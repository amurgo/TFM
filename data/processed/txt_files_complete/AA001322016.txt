For MB:          Mr Holmes, Counsel instructed by Greater
                            Manchester Immigration Aid Unit
For the Secretary of State:       Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting
                       Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. MB is a male national of Iran born  in  1984.  He  seeks  international
    protection on the grounds that he faces a real risk of  persecution  in
    Iran because he has converted to Christianity from Islam. It is further
    asserted on his behalf that any attempt to remove him would  give  rise
    to a real risk of a violation of the United Kingdom's obligations under
    Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights  (ECHR),  in  that
    there would be a reasonable likelihood that he would commit suicide  or
    otherwise inflict serious injury by self-harm.


 2. In its decision dated the 3rd  January  2017  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Malik) dismissed the appeal on  asylum  grounds,  rejecting  the
    contention that MB was a genuine convert to  Christianity.  The  appeal
    was however allowed with reference to Article 3, the Tribunal accepting
    that there was a real risk MB would attempt suicide or  otherwise  harm
    himself if faced with removal.

 3. Both sides applied for permission to appeal. Both  now  have  it[1].  I
    deal first with MB's appeal against the asylum decision.



    Anonymity Order

 4. MB has made a claim for  international  protection  and  has  diagnosed
    mental health difficulties.  Having  had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a tribunal or court  directs  otherwise,  MB  is
        granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings  shall  directly
        or indirectly identify him or  any  member  of  his  family.   This
        direction applies to, amongst others,  both  parties.   Failure  to
        comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
        proceedings"






    Asylum


 5. Three issues arise in MB's appeal:


              i) He had relied on a medical report prepared by Freedom  From
                 Torture  which  confirmed  him   to   have   scarring   and
                 psychological symptoms consistent with his account of  past
                 persecution in Iran; his first head of  challenge  is  that
                 the Tribunal failed to assess this evidence  in  the  round
                 with the remaining material. I shall refer to this  as  the
                 'Mbanga' ground, after the decision in Mbanga  v  Secretary
                 of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA  Civ  367  in
                 which the Court of Appeal held that decision makers  should
                 not  address  medical  evidence  only  after   a   negative
                 conclusion on credibility has been reached.


             ii) MB had brought  three  witnesses  to  court  with  him  who
                 testified to his regular attendance  at  Church  and  their
                 belief  that  he  was  a  genuine  Christian.    MB  places
                 reliance on the guidance in Dorodian v Secretary  of  State
                 for the Home Department (01/TH/01537) and asserts that  the
                 First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to follow it.

            iii) In submissions before the First-tier Tribunal  Counsel  for
                 MB, Mr Holmes, had advanced  what  he  referred  to  as  an
                 'alternative' case. If the Tribunal were not satisfied that
                 MB  was  a  genuine  convert  to  Christianity,  it  should
                 nevertheless allow the appeal on the ground that it is  the
                 fact of MB's baptism that will give rise to a real risk  of
                 harm.  It is accepted that as a failed   asylum  seeker  he
                 will be questioned on return to Iran: SSH and  HR  (illegal
                 exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 308  (IAC).
                 It is accepted that he should not be expected  to  lie:  HJ
                 (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) [2010] UKSC 31.  It  is  submitted
                 that it is reasonably likely that the receiving officer  in
                 Tehran would view baptism and attendance at  church  to  be
                 matters requiring further investigation even if MB were  to
                 protest that they had been cynical attempts to gain asylum.
                 It  is  accepted  that  such  further  investigation  would
                 involve ill-treatment amounting to serious  harm:  SSH  and
                 HR. The ground of appeal is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
                 omitted to address this submission.












    Mbanga


 6. In approaching its work on asylum the First-tier Tribunal did not  have
    a blank canvass.  That is because MB had previously appeared  before  a
    differently constituted Tribunal in the context of an asylum appeal. In
    2009 he had claimed asylum advancing a fear  of  political  persecution
    for his involvement in the 2009 reform protests. He stated  inter  alia
    that he had been beaten by the baseeji who had hit him with a metal bar
    about the head so that he  had  lost  consciousness.    In  a  decision
    promulgated on the 7th April 2000 that claim had been rejected  on  the
    facts by an Immigration Judge  K.  Gordon  who  found  the  account  to
    contain significant discrepancies. In  deciding  this  case  therefore,
    Judge Malik was  obliged  to  treat  Judge  Gordon's  findings  as  her
    starting point: see paragraph 41 of  the  decision  where  she  directs
    herself to the Devaseelan [2] guidelines.


 7. Before Judge Malik MB introduced new evidence. He  maintained  that  he
    had told Judge Gordon the truth about being beaten by  the  baseeji  in
    2009 but added that he had had three encounters  with  the  authorities
    before that. In approximately 2005 he had been sentenced to  82  lashes
    for the crime of consumption and possession of alcohol. He was arrested
    eight months  later  for  the  same  offence  and  received  a  similar
    sentence. Then in approximately 2006 he had got into  a  fight  in  the
    street with two men whom he later discovered  to  be  baseeji.  He  was
    detained, threatened and tortured. He was held in detention for 5 days.
    During this detention his ankle was broken when a metal filing  cabinet
    was pushed on to his leg. He had been  taken  to  hospital  and  whilst
    receiving treatment had absconded from detention.

 8. MB's new statements were not the only fresh evidence to  be  submitted.
    He further relied on medical evidence, consisting primarily of a report
    prepared by Dr Hamer of  Freedom  From  Torture  (FFT)  who  had  spent
    approximately ten hours with MB during four appointments in October and
    November 2015.  Following questions from  the  Secretary  of  State  Dr
    Hamer  produced  a  brief  addendum.  As  a  result  of  his   physical
    examination of MB Dr Hamer identified 33 scars on his body. MB  himself
    attributed 2 of these to an accident at work, and said that 21 had been
    self-inflicted during episodes of self-harm. Eight were  attributed  by
    MB to having been ill-treated in Iran; he denied any awareness  of  two
    linear scars to his back which appeared in the area where he claimed to
    have received lashes.  Dr Hamer evaluated  those  scars  in  accordance
    with the Istanbul Protocol and concluded that the  six  scars  to  MB's
    face and skull were individually consistent with, but as a group highly
    consistent with, the attributed cause of being beaten  about  the  head
    with a blunt instrument. The two linear scars to the back were found to
    be consistent with him having been lashed.  Injuries to his ankle  were
    found to be highly consistent with having had his ankle crushed when  a
    filing  cabinet  was  pushed  onto  his  leg.   In  respect   of   MB's
    psychological state he reported suffering from  a  number  of  symptoms
    including anxiety, depression, intrusive memories  and  nightmares.  He
    reported feeling suicidal and admitted to having self-harmed with  non-
    suicidal intent using  implements such as razor blades and broken glass
    to 'release' his anxiety (this was borne out  by  the  21  other  scars
    recorded by Dr Hamer).    Dr Hamer opined that  MB  is  suffering  from
    depression and PTSD, and that this could impact  upon  his  ability  to
    recall matters accurately.

 9. The key finding on  this  matter  in  the  determination  is  found  in
    paragraph 43, where the Tribunal states

         "... even accepting the appellant has sustained scars to  his  face
         which are highly likely to have been sustained by  force  and  that
         depression and PTSD may have affected his recall, the basis of  the
         appellant's claim as set out in  the  determination  of  his  first
         appeal  and  the  findings   therein,   highlight   a   number   of
         inconsistencies regarding his account  of  what  happened  in  June
         2009, which the availability  of  medical  evidence  now  does  not
         reconcile. For this reason I find the appeal now of the appellant's
         claimed involvement in demonstrations in  2009  is  materially  the
         same as it was at the first  appeal;  those  issues  were  settled,
         found not to be credible and I see no reason now to revisit them".

10. Having initially framed his attack in terms  of  weight,  in  his  oral
    submissions Mr Holmes clarified his position:  the  complaint  is  that
    there is a structural failing in the way that the  Tribunal  approached
    the  evidence.  It  should  first  have  assessed   whether,   applying
    Devaseelan, there was new material to be  assessed.  Having  made  that
    judgement it was then bound to  revert  to  the  standard  practice  of
    evaluating the material in the round. The persuasive  medical  evidence
    could not be discounted simply on the basis that Judge Gordon  had  not
    found the original account to be credible, as the final sentence of the
    passage set out above might suggest.  As to the concerns  expressed  by
    Judge Malik about discrepancies, Mr Holmes pointed to the opinion of Dr
    Hamer that MB's psychological condition is such that he very well might
    find it difficult to present his experiences in  ordered  chronological
    fashion.


11. Despite the impressive way that Mr Holmes made his  submissions,  I  am
    unable to accept them.  That  is  because  they  are  contrary  to  the
    guidance in the starred decision of Devaseelan  that  Judge  Malik  was
    bound to apply.




12. MB's testimony and the FFT report would fall into the fourth  class  of
    new material discussed in Devaseelan, namely evidence which could  have
    been before the first Tribunal but was not.  At guideline (4) the Vice-
    Presidential panel held that such evidence should be  viewed  with  the
    "greatest circumspection", going on at (7) to say this:


         (7) The force of the reasoning underlying guidelines (4) and (6) is
         greatly reduced if there is some very good reason why the
         Appellant's failure to adduce relevant evidence before the first
         Adjudicator should not be, as it were, held against him. We think
         such reasons will be rare....


         Having said that, we do accept that there will be occasional cases
         where the circumstances of the first appeal were such that it would
         be right for the second Adjudicator to look at the matter as if the
         first determination had never been made. (We think it unlikely that
         the second Adjudicator would, in such a case, be able to build very
         meaningfully on the first Adjudicator's determination; but we
         emphasise that, even in such a case, the first determination stands
         as the determination of the first appeal.)


13. The force of this guidance is not  then,  that  having  identified  new
    evidence  decision-makers  should  start  their  deliberations  afresh,
    applying all the usual  safeguards  as  to  standard,  weight  and  the
    careful attention that must be paid  to  the  evidence  of  independent
    experts.  Rather  the  Tribunal  in  Devaseelan  found  that  such  new
    evidence should be treated with the  "greatest  circumspection"  unless
    some very good reason establishes why the earlier omission  should  not
    be held against the appellant.  The  reason  advanced  is  recorded  at
    paragraph 44 of the decision to be that MB had a  bad  experience  with
    the police when he arrived in the UK and that he was fearful  of  being
    returned to Iran. Judge Malik did  not  consider  that  to  be  a  good
    reason. First of all no mention had been made of any difficulties  with
    the British police before. Secondly it was hard to see  why  mentioning
    these events would increase the chances of being returned to  Iran,  or
    of MB having perceived that to be  the  case.   Having  found  no  good
    reason why these events were not narrated to the Gordon  Tribunal,  the
    guidelines obliged Judge Malik to treat the evidence thereof  with  the
    greatest circumspection. Which is in fact what she did, giving  several
    other reasons why she was not minded to attach weight  to  the  medical
    report along the way.  Having read the determination  with  care  I  am
    unable to find that a Mbanga error occurred here.


14. Ground 1 is not made out.




    Dorodian


15. Ground 2 as pleaded reads: "the Judge has failed to properly apply  the
    guidelines expounded in Dorodian, and has failed  to  properly  address
    the evidence of the Appellant's conversion".


16. In his oral submissions  Mr  Holmes  made  various  criticisms  of  the
    approach taken to the question of conversion. He submitted that all  of
    the evidence ran contrary to the conclusion reached by the Judge,  that
    the reasons given for going against that weight of  evidence  were  not
    adequately reasoned and that the Tribunal appears to have misunderstood
    the facts in certain respects.

17. MB had called three Dorodian witnesses, the Reverend  Nicholas  Bundock
    of St James and Emmanuel Church of England Church in Didsbury, Mr Colin
    Hardicre, a senior member of the  congregation at the same  church  and
    the Reverend Hossein Khalifehhadi, an ordained  Christian  minister  of
    Iranian origin who was called in by this  church  (and  others  in  the
    North West) to help minister to  Iranians  who  wished  to  convert  to
    Christianity, or who had already done so. All three attested that  they
    had known MB since April 2016 when he began to regularly worship at  St
    James and Emmanuel. All three believed him to be a  sincere  Christian,
    and were aware that he had been baptised in 2013 in the Catholic faith.
     They were aware that some  years  earlier  he  had  attended  Catholic
    church in Manchester.  Taking their testimony alongside other documents
    in the bundles  the following matters appeared to be uncontentious:

           a) the assertion that MB had first attended  church  in  the  UK
              sometime in 2011;


           b) that he continued to regularly attend that  church  for  some
              two and a half years;


           c) that he was baptised at St Clements Church in 2013;


           d) that he stopped attending between 2014-2015 because,  on  his
              evidence, he was destitute  and  experiencing  mental  health
              problems;

           e) that he had maintained contact with his former Priest  during
              that period;

           f) that he had started attending the church in Didsbury in April
              2016 and continued to be a regular worshipper;  and

           g) that his Dorodian witnesses were giving their honest  opinion
              about him.

18. Having accepted all of those matters the Tribunal nevertheless went  on
    to find against MB on the matter of whether or not  he  was  a  genuine
    convert to Christianity.   At paragraph 46 the decision reads:


         "Pastor H said in his evidence the first time he saw the  appellant
         his faith was not strong, but he was committed to getting  baptised
         and to attend church. Even if the appellant  had not been able  for
         whatever reason to attend church for a number of years, it does not
         explain why his faith was not strong, as  he  had  previously  been
         baptised, nor does it explain why his rush to  be  baptised  again,
         having been baptised previously. When Pastor H was  asked,  why  if
         the appellant's faith was not strong, the church made a decision to
         baptise him, he said that this was because of the language  barrier
         at the Catholic Church, he could explain more and the appellant had
         a limited knowledge  of  Christianity  before.  This  suggests  the
         appellant's claim to have understood  and  embraced  the  Christian
         faith fully, in  September  2013,  when  he  was  baptised  in  the
         Catholic Church, to be without foundation and does not explain  why
         the appellant would have such a limited knowledge of his  faith  in
         2016."


    (I take 'Pastor H' to be Reverend Hossein Khalifehhadi).


19. Of this passage Mr Holmes submitted the following. First,  there  is  a
    significant mistake of fact in that there was no evidence that  MB  had
    been baptised twice, or had sought to  be  baptised  twice.  There  was
    accordingly no "rush to baptise", with the negative  connotations  that
    evidently had for the Tribunal. The evidence was that Reverend  Hossein
    had been asked to prepare MB for his Confirmation. His  evidence  about
    the developing strength of MB's  faith,  and  knowledge,  was  in  that
    context perfectly legitimate.   Second, (other than the  foregoing)  it
    was unclear on what the Tribunal based its finding that  MB  had  "such
    limited knowledge" of the faith in April 2016.  In fact, his  knowledge
    had never been tested, with the Immigration Officer who  conducted  the
    interview electing to ask only five basic  questions.   Third,  MB  has
    nowhere declared  that  in  2013  he  understood  the  Christian  faith
    "fully".

20. I have read the Record of  Proceedings.  It  indicates  that  the  term
    "baptism" did indeed arise in Reverend  Hossein's  testimony.   He  was
    asked whether MB had "been baptised before" and he replied that he had,
    in the Catholic Church. The record states that he then said "he said he
    want baptism  full  conversion";  he  goes  on  to  give  the  evidence
    (recorded in the determination)  about  the  language  barrier  in  the
    Catholic Church.  At the end of his evidence the Judge asked  him  when
    MB was "baptised"; the answer is recorded as "In April, B in  June":  I
    take this to mean that he started attending the church  in  April,  and
    was baptised in June.    It is therefore quite understandable  how  the
    Tribunal was left with the impression that MB had "rushed" to undergo a
    second baptism once he started attending the church in Didsbury.  I  do
    accept however that Reverend Hossein's evidence has  given  rise  to  a
    misunderstanding. His testimony notwithstanding it is  clear  from  the
    remaining evidence that the ceremony that MB underwent on the 19th June
    2016 was his Confirmation as a Christian. That  is  apparent  from  the
    Certificate of Confirmation, and the statements of MB and his  Dorodian
    witnesses, all of whom refer to a Confirmation and make no mention of a
    second baptism.    It is unfortunate that this matter was not addressed
    in re-examination so that Reverend Hossein was given an opportunity  to
    clarify.   Had he been asked, it is quite possible that the  Tribunal's
    concerns on this point would have been allayed.  His comments about the
    increasing  strength  of  MB's  faith,   and   his   understanding   of
    Christianity, are wholly consistent with the  journey  between  baptism
    and confirmation.   Although it is an error for which the Tribunal  can
    hardly be blamed, I do accept that the reasoning cited is  based  on  a
    misunderstanding of the evidence and to that extent must be set  aside.
    The question of whether MB is a  'genuine'  Christian  remains  a  moot
    point.


21. Returning to the grounds as originally pleaded, I do not  think  it  is
    one that needs to be re-determined by any  further  evidence.  That  is
    because in Dorodian the Tribunal accepted, on the basis of  six  months
    attendance at church, that the appellant was a Christian.  His  regular
    attendance,  confirmed  by  his  witnesses,  spoke  for  itself.    The
    importance of such attendance, and the importance of such witnesses  to
    it, are the essence of the Dorodian guidelines, which have very  little
    to do with the exercise of making windows into a man's soul:


         a) no-one should be regarded as a committed Christian who is not
         vouched for as such by a minister of some church established in
         this country: as we have said, it is church membership, rather than
         mere belief, which may lead to risk;

         b) no adjudicator should again be put in the position faced by Mr
         Poole in this case: a statement or letter, giving the full
         designation of the minister, should be sent to the Home Office at
         least a fortnight before the hearing of any appeal, which should
         give them time for at least a basic check on his existence and
         standing;

         c) unless the Home Office have accepted the appellant as a
         committed church member in writing in advance of the hearing, the
         minister should invariably be called to give oral evidence before
         the adjudicator: while witness summonses are available,
         adjudicators may reasonably expect willingness to do so in a
         genuine case;

         d) if any doubt remains, there is no objection to adjudicators
         themselves testing the religious knowledge of the appellant:
         judicial notice may be taken of the main beliefs and prayers of the
         Church.

22. As set out at [17] above, there were three Dorodian witnesses  in  this
    case, and unchallenged written evidence from the Catholic  Church  that
    MB had worshipped there for some two  and  half  years,  and  had  been
    baptised  there.    That  was  evidence  that  in  itself   potentially
    established risk.  As HHJ Gilbart put it in SA (Iran) [2012] EWHC  2575
    (Admin),  it is a dangerous thing for anyone to  attempt  to  work  out
    what someone else truly believes, and it is an exercise that is, in the
    context of Iran, perhaps unnecessary :


         "I am at a loss to understand how that is to be tested by  anything
         other  than  considering  whether  [the  claimant]  is  an   active
         participant in the new church. But  I  accept  that  such  judicial
         boldness as this judge showed  does  not  necessarily  undermine  a
         decision  in  law  if  he  does  so,  and  his  decision  was   not
         successfully appealed. But that is not the only point.  There  must
         be a real risk that if she has professed herself to be a Christian,
         and conducted herself as one, that profession, whether true or not,
         may be taken in Iran as evidence of apostasy".


    (emphasis added).


23. This leads me to MB's final ground, the 'alternative'  submission  that
    it is MB's outward profession of faith,  rather  than  his  true  inner
    feelings, which are of significance in assessing risk.


    Risk on Return


24. I accept that before the First-tier Tribunal  it  was  argued  on  MB's
    behalf that he would be at risk on return to Iran simply by  virtue  of
    his having proclaimed himself a Christian, having attended  church  and
    having been baptised/confirmed. That much is apparent from the skeleton
    argument which appears in the bundle, supported by the case  report  of
    SA (Iran).  I accept that it is a submission  which  is  not  expressly
    addressed in the determination. Is that omission material?


25. Mr Mills accepted that MB is likely to  be  questioned  on  arrival  in
    Tehran. He further accepted the proposition  that  if  he  is  asked  a
    question about why he claimed asylum, MB cannot be expected to  lie  in
    order to protect himself: see RT (Zimbabwe)  and  Ors  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC 38. He submitted however that
    MB cannot establish, even to the lower standard, that he would be asked
    about the basis of his  asylum  claim.  I  am  unable  to  accept  that
    submission.  That is because it is clear from the evidence given -  and
    accepted - in SSH and HR that the  authorities  in  Iran  will  conduct
    enquiries about failed asylum claims. In that case the  Upper  Tribunal
    heard evidence from expert  witness  Dr  Kakhki  about  the  procedures
    followed on arrival at Tehran. His evidence is set out in Appendix 1 of
    that decision.   He indicated that a person who did not  have  a  valid
    passport would have to apply for a 'Barge Obour', that  is  to  say  an
    emergency travel document, from the  embassy  in  London.  The  embassy
    would alert the authorities in Tehran so that  the  returnee  would  be
    questioned on his arrival  about  whether  or  not  he  had  left  Iran
    illegally [at �9].  Dr Kakhki considered it possible that  there  would
    be some investigation into the individual concerned by the  embassy  in
    the UK, depending on the circumstances [at �10].   The  returnee  would
    certainly be questioned about a failed asylum claim:

         "35.  Dr Kakhki's evidence is that the Appellants would face
         questioning not simply about the manner of their illegal exit from
         Iran but also about their failed asylum claim. Indeed, his evidence
         is also that, even without illegal exit, a person who has made a
         failed asylum claim would face questioning if they are returned on
         a Barge Obour".

This initial questioning could last between two to five hours, and be
conducted by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps: see
paragraph 14 of the main decision.

26. Even assuming that MB is subject to the shortest of interviews and  his
    interrogation is not led by a member of the ICRG,  applying  the  lower
    standard of proof I am satisfied that  when  he  is  asked  "about  his
    failed asylum claim" that will involve questions about what  the  basis
    of that claim is. It is implicit in the findings in SSH and HR, and the
    concession to this effect by Dr Kakhki, that  not  every  failed  claim
    will elicit  interest  from  the  Iranian  authorities.  Indeed  it  is
    implicit that most will  not.    Both  appellants  in  that  case,  for
    instance, had advanced false claims of involvement in Kurdish politics,
    and neither were judged to be at any risk  on  return.   I  am  however
    satisfied that an admission of a) having claimed  to  be  Christian  b)
    having been formally baptised and c) having regularly  attended  church
    is the kind of information that is reasonably likely to elicit  further
    questions.  That is because it is prima facie an admission of apostasy,
    considered a capital offence under  Sharia  law  (see  paragraph  6  of
    Dorodian). Mr Mills is of course right  when  he  says  that  MB  could
    protest that he remains a Muslim and that  his  conversion  was  all  a
    pretence, but in the context of  an  Islamic  state,  where  "religious
    minorities are viewed with suspicion and  treated  as  a  threat  to  a
    theocratic system bent on imposing  a  strict  interpretation  of  Shia
    Islam"[3] it appears to me that MBs answers are  reasonably  likely  to
    cause "particular concern" for his interviewer. See paragraph 23 of SSH
    and HR:


         "The evidence in our view shows no more  than  that  they  will  be
         questioned, and that if there are any particular  concerns  arising
         from their previous activities either in  Iran  or  in  the  United
         Kingdom or whichever country they are  returned  from,  then  there
         would be a risk of further questioning, detention and potential ill-
         treatment".


27. It follows that I find  the  failure  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    address this submission to be a material omission in the determination.
    I set the decision on risk for reasons of religious belief aside and re-
    make the decision by allowing the appeal on asylum grounds.


    Article 3


28. The reasoning in the determination is brief.   The Tribunal  notes  the
    conclusions of Dr Hamer,  made  after  seeing  MB  during  October  and
    November 2015. It records  that  in  March  2016  he  was  admitted  to
    hospital after stabbing himself and  that  he  was  discharged  with  a
    diagnosis of PTSD. From there it goes on to find  that  there  in  Iran
    there is mental health provision. The conclusion is reached:


         "Yet the issue here is the potential for the appellant to take  his
         own life if a removal decision is made. The latest medical evidence
         before me suggests the appellant has made a serious attempt of self
         harm in March this year and on balance considering the comments  of
         Dr H, I find there is a real risk he may do so again if removed".


29. The Secretary of State's complaint about this is twofold. First, it  is
    submitted, the Tribunal failed to apply the six principle framework set
    out in J v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    629. Secondly, that the Tribunal has failed to consider the  assumption
    that mechanisms would be put in place by the UK authorities to  protect
    MB during the period covering  communication of the  decision  and  his
    removal: AA v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2005]  UKIAT
    00084.  There was no evidential basis for concluding that  there  would
    be failing of protection in this country.


30. I find both grounds to be made out.

31. The reasoning in the determination certainly addressed  the  first  two
    questions posed in J, as well as the fourth  principle.   The  Tribunal
    properly directs itself that suicide is a type of serious harm  capable
    of engaging Article 3.   Although there  is  no  express  finding  that
    there would be a causal link between the risk  and  the  removal,  that
    much is clear from the  evidence  of  Dr  Hamer  that  is  set  out  at
    paragraph 50.   The sixth question is addressed, in that  the  Tribunal
    makes clear findings that there is in Iran provision for  the  care  of
    those with mental health difficulties. I am unable  to  find  that  the
    Tribunal addressed the fifth principle, namely  whether  there  was  an
    objective underpinning for the subjective fear.  Having  rejected  MB's
    claims to have been persecuted in the past in Iran, and the possibility
    that he would face persecution for reasons of his religious  belief  in
    the future, it is unclear how on the facts this test could be  met.  As
    for the intervention on the part of  the  authorities  in  the  UK  the
    Tribunal does not appear to weigh in the fact that MB has had  support,
    protection and treatment for his mental health problems thus  far.  For
    those reasons I set the decision in respect of Article 3 aside.


32. As to the remaking I am of course faced with a very  different  factual
    matrix from that applied by the First-tier Tribunal.  I  have  accepted
    that there is a real risk of serious harm to this appellant  by  virtue
    of his formal conversion to Christianity. I am therefore satisfied that
    Article 3 is engaged. As to whether there  might  be  a  discrete  risk
    arising because of the risk of self-harm or suicide, I do not  consider
    it appropriate that I make any finding to that effect. The report of Dr
    Hamer is now almost two years old. I have not been provided with any up
    to date assessment of MB's mental health upon which  I  could  properly
    conduct such an analysis. I note that MB  has  been  receiving  regular
    treatment (in the form of  psychological  counselling  and  medication)
    since that  report  was  written,  and  his  condition  may  well  have
    improved.


    Decisions


33. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors
    of law and it is set aside.  The decision is remade as follows:


    'The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.
    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.'

34. There is an order for anonymity.
