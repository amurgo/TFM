Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Augustine Clement


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were  termed
    before the First-tier Tribunal, that is Mr Tonweh as the appellant  and
    the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 1st August 1979  and  the
    husband of Ms Temituokpe Tonweh, a British citizen born on 6th February
    1983, and he applied for entry clearance to come to the United  Kingdom
    for settlement as the spouse of the sponsor.

 3. The application was made on 7th May 2013 and the respondent refused the
    appellant's application on 14th August 2013.

 4. The  issue  of  the  relationship  was  conceded  by  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer at the hearing on 11th August 2014 before  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Aujla.  He allowed the appeal finding that  the
    sponsor had shown sufficient income to meet the financial  requirements
    in paragraphs E-ECP.3.2. to E-ECP.3.4. of Appendix FM which requires an
    income threshold of �18,600 for a partner to be met.

         "E-ECP.3.1.   The applicant must provide specified  evidence,  from
                    the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of -

                    (a)    a specified gross annual income of at least -

                        (i)    �18,600;

                        (ii)   an additional �3,800 for  the  first  child;
                             and

                        (iii)  an additional  �2,400  for  each  additional
                             child; alone or in combination with

                    (b)    specified savings of -

                        (i)    �16,000; and

                        (ii)   additional savings of an  amount  equivalent
                             to 2.5 times the amount which is the difference
                             between  the  gross  annual  income  from   the
                             sources listed in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.2.(a)-(d)
                             and the total amount required under paragraph E-
                              ECP.3.1.(a); or

                    (c)    the  requirements  in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.3.being
                        met.

                    In this paragraph 'child' means a dependent child of the
                    applicant who is -

                    (a)    under the age of 18 years, or who was  under  the
                        age of 18 years when they were first granted  entry
                        under this route;

                    (b)    applying for entry clearance as  a  dependant  of
                        the applicant, or has limited  leave  to  enter  or
                        remain in the UK;

                    (c)    not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

                    (d)    not an EEA national with a right to  be  admitted
                        under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

         E-ECP.3.2.    When determining whether the financial requirement in
                    paragraph EECP.3.1. is met only  the  following  sources
                    will be taken into account -

                    (a)    income of the partner from  specified  employment
                        or self-employment, which, in respect of a  partner
                        returning to the UK with the applicant, can include
                        specified employment  or  self-employment  overseas
                        and in the UK;

                    (b)    specified pension income  of  the  applicant  and
                        partner;

                    (c)    any specified maternity allowance or  bereavement
                        benefit received by the partner in the  UK  or  any
                        specified payment relating to service in HM  Forces
                        received by the applicant or partner;

                    (d)    other  specified  income  of  the  applicant  and
                        partner; and

                    (e)    specified savings of the applicant and partner."

 5. The appellant's application to the respondent was made on 7th May 2013.
     At paragraph 22 of the determination the judge found that the  sponsor
    worked for an annual salary of �12,619.20 (amounting to �1,051.60 gross
    a month) as a teaching assistant  with  Enfield  Heights  Academy  from
    September 2012 until March 2013.  She left the employment at the end of
    March 2013.  Her wage slips were provided together with her contract of
    employment.  There was also a P60 which showed that  her  gross  income
    from that employment was �5,937.36 and that she earned that salary  for
    a period of seven months.

 6. The sponsor also registered a company on 31st January 2012 and  entered
    into a contract to work for the company as a  director  of  consultancy
    from 1st November 2012.  However, there was a contract  signed  between
    the company and the sponsor and she (the company)  paid  herself  on  a
    PAYE basis as an employee.  The wage slips showed she was paying income
    tax and national insurance.  She provided payslips of  that  employment
    which were also in the bundle.  She was paid �9.46 per hour and  earned
    �5,200 from that employment for the period of six months from  November
    until the end of April 2013 (23).

 7. The appellant made his application on 7th May 2013 and the judge stated
    as follows:

         "24. The Appellant made his application on 07 May  2013.   The  six
             months prior to the application would be from the beginning of
             November 2012 to the end of April 2013.  During  that  period,
             the sponsor had income from teaching for 5 months at the  rate
             of �848.19  per  month  which  for  five  months  amounted  to
             �4240.95 and �10,178.28 per annum.  In addition,  the  sponsor
             had income from the company  of  �866.66  per  month  and  the
             yearly equivalent being �10,399.99.  The sponsor's total gross
             yearly income therefore was �20,578.27.  That was in excess of
             the amount of �18,600 that the sponsor was required to show."

 8. He therefore considered on the evidence presented to him that there was
    an  excess  of  the  amount  of  �18,600  and  that  the  sponsor   had
    demonstrated  a  gross  income  of  this  relevant  amount  during  the
    "relevant period" (paragraph 26).

 9. The application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that the
    sponsor's salary as a director of consultancy was �10,399.99 per  annum
    based on her income from current employment for more  than  six  months
    and that "only this would be taken  into  account".   As  such  it  was
    submitted  that  the  sponsor's  income  was  significantly  below  the
    requisite income threshold.

10. Ms Isherwood presented me with the Immigration  Rules  in  relation  to
    Appendix FM-SE.  She submitted that paragraph 13(b) of  Appendix  FM-SE
    could not apply as the sponsor had been in her current  employment  for
    more than six months and further that paragraph  13(j)  did  not  apply
    because it was stated that this was not self-employment.

11. Mr Iqbal submitted that the appellant fell under Rule  13(a)  and  that
    the Secretary of State  had  misinterpreted  the  construction  of  the
    Rules.  If the  drafter  wished  to  exclude  income  from  the  second
    employment it was open to her to do so but nowhere in the Rules in  the
    context of paragraph 13(b) did it state that her income  could  not  be
    topped up by another employment which finished before the date  of  the
    application.  I was referred  to  paragraph  2  of  Appendix  FM  which
    referred to employers in  the  plural.   Thus,  he  submitted,  it  was
    obvious that there could be income from more  than  one  source.   Upon
    that basis, as long as the sponsor met the requirements  of  13(a)  and
    was in her current employment for more than six  months  there  was  no
    prohibition on her relying  on  another  source  of  income  and  which
    employment  had  finished   shortly   before   the   application.    On
    consideration of the grounds of application for  permission  to  appeal
    there was no explanation as to why only the current employment of  more
    than six months would be taken into account.  This was not expressed in
    the Rule in such a way and the case was not made out.

12. Ms Isherwood submitted that it was accepted that 13(b)  and  13(j)  did
    not apply.  The judge did not explain how he  came  to  the  conclusion
    that 13(a) applied in this instant.

13. I put to Mr Iqbal that the Rules refer to a current employer.

14. Mr Iqbal submitted that there was no need  to  explain  why  the  judge
    could consider income from two sources.

15. The difficulty with Mr Iqbal's  submissions  is  that  the  Immigration
    Rules at paragraph 13(a) refer to employment by a

         "current employer for  at  least  six  months  and  has  been  paid
         throughout  the  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date   of
         application at a level of  gross  annual  salary  which  equals  or
         exceeds a gross annual salary relied on in the application and  any
         non-employment income and  gross  annual  income  from  the  UK  or
         foreign state pension or a private pension."

16. This does not preclude more than one employer but is specific that  the
    calculation must  stem  from  the  income  received  from  the  current
    employer as at the date of application.

17. Indeed, in relation to paragraph 13(b) where  the  person  in  salaried
    employment has been employed by the current employer for less than  six
    months once again the gross annual income will be  the  total  of  "the
    gross  annual  salary  from  employment  as  it  was  at  the  date  of
    application".

18. Both of these provisions run the calculation of the gross annual income
    backwards from the income as at the date of the application and in both
    instances it is necessary to show  a  relevant  and  sufficient  income
    which is connected to an income received as at the date of application.
     I can accept that more than one employer can be used but  it  must  be
    from a current employer.  The Rule does  not  preclude  more  than  one
    employer but does not permit in effect a dramatic drop in income.

19. The difficulty with  the  calculation  by  Judge  Aujla  and  for  this
    appellant is that the judge used the yearly equivalent of the sponsor's
    income from her current employer as at �10,399.99 but also extrapolated
    the income from the teaching which he was  not  permitted  to  do.   He
    assessed the teaching job on the basis of five months at  the  rate  of
    �848.19 per month.  The actual gross income from the teaching  job  was
    �4,440.95 and cannot be  extrapolated  or  expanded.   Thus  the  gross
    income for the sponsor for the year leading  up  to  the  date  of  the
    application was in fact �14,640.94.  To put it another way,  the  judge
    should have assessed the income from the teaching post at  �353.41  per
    month rather than �848.19 per month because that is what  she  actually
    earned in the year to March 2013.

20. I therefore find that there was an error of law and that  I  set  aside
    and remake the determination and for the reasons given above I  dismiss
    the appeal in relation to the Immigration rules.

21. However the judge made no findings  with  regards  Article  8  and  the
    matter still needs to be considered.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed with respect to the Immigration rules.

The matter is to be determined  on  the  Article  8  issue  alone.   In  the
absence of any objection to making written submissions only in  relation  to
Article 8,  I shall determine the matter on the papers. The parties  are  to
make any written submissions on Article 8  within 28 days  of  the  date  of
this decision.
