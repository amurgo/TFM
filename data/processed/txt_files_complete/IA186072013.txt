                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born on 13th January  1987.
    He first arrived in the UK on 9th October  2009  when  he  was  granted
    leave to enter as a student.   Thereafter  the  Appellant  was  granted
    successive periods of leave to remain as a student and a Tier 1  (Post-
    Study) Migrant until  25th  March  2013.   On  5th  December  2012  the
    Appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain   as   a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  That application was refused on 14th May  2013
    for the reasons given in a  Notice  of  Decision  of  that  date.   The
    Appellant appealed, and his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Camp (the Judge) sitting at Birmingham on 21st March 2014.  He
    decided  to  allow  the  appeal  for  the  reasons  set  out   in   his
    Determination dated 3rd April 2014.  The  Respondent  sought  leave  to
    appeal that decision, and on 9th May 2014 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The reason given for the decision to  refuse  the  Appellant  leave  to
    remain is  that  he  failed  to  score  any  points  under  Appendix  A
    (Attributes) of HC 395.  This was because  whereas  the  Appellant  had
    produced with his application evidence in the form of  statements  from
    Barclays Bank plc showing him to have  access  to  funds  amounting  to
    �34,419.48, he had not submitted  the  required  evidence  to  show  an
    investment in his business of �16,550 as claimed.  This investment  was
    represented by  a  commercial  lease  of  business  premises,  and  the
    purchase of a car and office furniture.  The lease and receipts for the
    purchases  had  been  produced,  but  the  unaudited  accounts  of  the
    Appellant's business did not show such an investment.

 4. The Judge's reasons for allowing the appeal are given in paragraphs  11
    to 13 inclusive of the Determination.  After recording the  submissions
    made on behalf of the Appellant, the Judge wrote as follows:

         "12. Ms Knight (for the Respondent), addressed me  solely  to  rely
             upon the refusal letter.

         13.  I see no flaw  in  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
             Appellant.  He has shown that he had access  to  the  required
             level of funds at the  date  of  application.   This  was  not
             contested at the hearing, except formally, on the Respondent's
             behalf."

    At the hearing, I heard submissions  from  both  parties.   Mr  Kandola
    addressed me first when to begin with he referred  to  the  grounds  of
    application.  He argued that the Judge had erred in law in that he  had
    given inadequate reasons for his decision.  The Judge had  referred  to
    the refusal letter, but he had not dealt with its contents.  Mr Kandola
    then argued that the error of law was material  in  that  the  evidence
    produced by the Appellant with his  application  did  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  nor  the  accompanying  Policy
    Guidance.  In particular, the types of investment relied  upon  by  the
    Appellant were not of the kind allowed by the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    this connection Mr Kandola referred me to paragraph A19 of  the  Policy
    Guidance.  It was argued in the Appellant's Skeleton Argument that  the
    investments relied upon constituted a loan to the company and therefore
    did come within the Immigration Rules.  However, no terms of  the  loan
    had been provided as required by paragraph 46S-D(a)(iii) of Appendix  A
    of HC 395.

 5. In response, Miss Smeaton referred to her  Skeleton  Argument  and  the
    authorities mentioned therein.  She argued that  the  Determination  of
    the Judge was challenged only on the grounds of  insufficient  reasons.
    However, the Judge had not erred in law in this respect because in  his
    Determination he had set out the issues, the evidence, the submissions,
    and his conclusion.  The basis on which he had allowed the appeal   was
    clear.

 6. In the alternative, Miss Smeaton submitted that any error  of  law  was
    not material  in  that  the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules  for  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  In order  to  score  sufficient  points  under
    Appendix A: Attributes, the Appellant had to show access  to  funds  of
    �50,000 as required by paragraph 245DD(b) of Appendix A of HC 395.   It
    was not in dispute that at the relevant time the Appellant held the sum
    of �34,419.48, and therefore had  to  account  for  the  difference  of
    �16,550.  This the Appellant had done by his investment in the purchase
    of office equipment and a company car, and the payment of a deposit and
    advanced rent for the commercial lease of his business premises.  These
    amounts were shown in the company's accounts, and should not be treated
    as loans requiring particular forms of evidence.  The Respondent  could
    not reply upon what was said  in  the  Policy  Guidance  following  the
    decision in Pankina.

 7. I found an error of law in the decision of the Judge.   That  error  is
    that the Judge gave insufficient reasons for allowing the  appeal.   On
    the  basis  of  what  he  wrote  in  paragraphs  12  and  13   of   the
    Determination, the  Respondent  would  not  know  why  the  appeal  was
    allowed.  It is not sufficient to merely refer to the  refusal  letter,
    even if at the hearing the Respondent's representative did no more than
    that. It was behoven upon the Judge to deal with the material  contents
    of the refusal letter, and this he failed to do.  This  amounts  to  an
    error of law and I therefore set aside the decision of  the  Judge.   I
    then proceeded to remake that decision.

Remade Decision

 8.  Both  representatives  declined  the  opportunity  to   make   further
    submissions to me, and I was invited to  remake  the  decision  on  the
    basis of the evidence before the Judge.

 9. The sole issue in this appeal is  whether  the  payments  made  by  the
    Appellant for office furniture, etc., can be taken  into  account  when
    calculating if the Appellant had access to funds of at least �50,000 in
    order to score sufficient points under Appendix A: Attributes.

10. The Appellant relies upon the accounts of his business, Enem  Marketing
    Solutions Limited, for the period ending on 28th February 2013.   Those
    accounts are unaudited, but there is no significance in  that  fact  as
    the company was exempt from audit under Section 477 Companies Act 2006.
     The accounts show fixed tangible assets of �7,550 which are  specified
    in paragraph 1.4 of the Notes to be fixtures, fittings  and  equipment,
    and motor vehicles.  There are produced  at  pages  D1  to  D3  of  the
    Appellant's bundle receipts showing these purchases.   The  balance  of
    �9,000 is shown under the heading  "Other  Debtors"  in  the  accounts.
    This  figure  correlates  with  the  payments  required  at  paragraphs
    3.1.(iii) of the Commercial Lease Agreement also  produced.   Therefore
    it can be said that the accounts have shown an investment as claimed by
    the Appellant in accordance with paragraph  46-SD(b)  as  Miss  Smeaton
    argued. In my  view  these  payments  can  be  treated  as  investments
    regardless of what is said in the Policy Guidance.   I  therefore  find
    that the Appellant has  scored  sufficient  points  under  Appendix  A:
    Attributes and satisfies paragraph 245DD of HC 395.   The  decision  of
    the Judge is remade by allowing the appeal.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  and  I  see  no
reason to do so.
