For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal
dismissing the appeal of the appellant against a decision of the Secretary
of State refusing him leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

2. I think I can deal with the important facts justly in outline.
Essentially, the appellant has been identified as a TOEIC cheat and found
unsuitable to remain in the United Kingdom.  The appellant denies doing
anything wrong.  The First-tier Tribunal was very unimpressed with the
appellant's command of English and factored that into accepting that the
appellant was a TOEIC cheat.

3. There are many things wrong with this approach.  The first is that there
is guidance given by the Tribunal, and indeed mentioned in the decision,
about the need to be very cautious about a judge forming a view on a
person's linguistic skills.  There is a world of difference between giving
evidence before a Tribunal and responding to questions in an exam.  Of
course a judge can, and probably should, have regard to what is going on in
the hearing room.  Of course it is not to be ignored if a person has
exceptionally eloquent or, alternatively, seems incapable of answering even
elementary questions without an interpreter but outside these two extremes
it is dangerous to take any view and even then it is only something to add
to the evidential mix.

4. Certain parts of the grounds criticise the judge for making assumptions
which may or may not have been justified and the grounds have merit
although may well go more to weight and judicial discretion rather than
fundamental error of law.

5. Ground 3, however, worries me a lot.  The appellant has always
identified himself as a person who has obtained a Bachelor's and a Master's
degree in physics in Bangladesh that were taught in the English language.
If that in fact is right then it is something to bear in mind very much
when looking at the appellant's perhaps poor command of English in the
hearing room and his explanation that he was nervous.  The Tribunal's
approach was to doubt his claim that he had indeed obtained a BSc and an
MSc.  This is procedurally unfair.  The appellant had claimed for a long
time that he had achieved these standards.  He had no reason whatsoever to
think that this claim had not been believed until he was cross-examined and
I accept the thrust of the grounds that if this point was going to be taken
then notice should have been given so he could have dealt with it.

6. Mr Whitwell responded that an objection could have been made at the
time, either by the Tribunal or by Counsel asking for an adjournment, and
he is right, it could have been.  I do not know why it was not but
certainly Mr Whitwell does not contend that there is anything in the papers
that suggests that there was doubt about the appellant having achieved
these qualifications and in the absence of some doubt about that, whilst
the problem could possibly have been dealt with more efficiently, it is
still unfair to take the point without notice and it is quite plain that
the concern over that infected the general adverse findings, which were
possibly less than entirely satisfactory anyway.  Certainly the approach
was wrong.  The judge really should not have been concerned with his own
views of the appellant's ability to speak English.

7. I am satisfied that this is one of those cases where there has not been
a proper hearing because the conduct was procedurally unfair.

8. At the start of the hearing I was asked to rule on an application to
adduce further evidence.  This is evidence which goes some way to showing
that the appellant has indeed achieved the qualifications that he says he
has.  I did not admit that evidence because I did not see how it could
illuminate the question of whether there was an error of law.  As I am
sending the case back to the First-tier Tribunal it is not for me to rule
on that application will be answered. However it does seem to me that now
the point is known to be in issue the Secretary of State might want to look
very carefully at the evidence that has been served and either make a
formal concession or give notice of a further challenge to it before the
hearing. I am not directing that she should follow either of those courses
but it would be helpful if she opted for one or the other.

9. For the reasons I have given this is an unsatisfactory decision.  I set
aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  I find that the error goes
right to the root of the fact-finding and I direct that the case be
determined again in the First-tier Tribunal.




Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that I set aside the decision of the
First-tier Tribunal and direct that the appeal be heard again in the First-
tier Tribunal.
