                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. The appellants are nationals of Uzbekistan. The first appellant was
         born on 7 September 1983 and the second appellant is his wife,  who
         was born on 24 June 1986. The second appellant's application was as
         a dependent of her husband and so the outcome of  his  appeal  will
         determine hers.

      2. The first appellant has been in the United Kingdom with leave since
         August 2008 in order to study  and  for  post  study  work.  On  10
         February 2014 he applied for leave to remain as a Tier  4  student.
         He was required to demonstrate he had the necessary maintenance  of
         ï¿½14,400 for himself and his wife. This had to be evidenced by funds
         for his use held in a bank account for a consecutive 28 days before
         the application.

      3. He submitted bank statements in his father's  name  from  the  Xalq
         bank in Tashkent to demonstrate the necessary funds were available.
         The respondent carried out checks on the statements  and  concluded
         that the entries from 6 January 2014 to the 7  February  2014  were
         not  genuine.  Consequently,  his  application  was  refused  under
         paragraph 322(1A) on 18 March 2014 as was his wife's.

      4. 322(1A)  sets out grounds on which leave to remain and variation of
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused:

             '(1A) where false representations  have  been  made  or  false
             documents or information have been submitted (whether  or  not
             material to  the  application,  and  whether  or  not  to  the
             applicant's knowledge) ...'

      5. The appeal is heard at Taylor house on 28th  November  2014  before
         First-tier Immigration Judge Cockrill. In a decision promulgated on
         3 December 2014 both appeals were dismissed.

      6. Mr Khalid, who appears now also represented the appellants  at  the
         First-tier. In the First-tier he confirmed that  no  argument  with
         being advanced under article 8.

      7. First-tier Judge Cockrill in the decision records having copies  of
         the relevant bank statements and  a  document  verification  report
         obtained by the respondent. The first appellant gave  evidence  and
         it  was  contended  the  respondent  had  not  provided  sufficient
         evidence to establish that the bank  statement  was  false.  Cross-
         examination elicited that he  had  produced  no  rebuttal  evidence
         either from his father or the bank.

      8. In submissions, Mr Khalid pointed out that the verification  report
         produced referred to information obtained from a member of staff at
         the bank which had not been provided.

      9. First-tier Judge Cockrill at paragraph 31 stated there was only one
         issue in the appeal, namely whether the bank statements were false.
         The judge focused attention on the document verification report. At
         paragraph 33 the judge said  that  the  burden  in  this  situation
         shifted to the respondent to show the falsity. At paragraph 34  the
         judge stated that on the face of it  the  bank  statement  provided
         contained false information. The verification report  redacted  the
         identity of the bank employee and the judge commented that this was
         not uncommon and took view this did not reduce  the  weight  to  be
         attached to the document. The judge summarised at paragraph 35  the
         respondent's contention, namely, a genuine letter had  been  issued
         from the bank but contained false or  inaccurate  details  and  the
         transaction history shown did not correspond with bank records.  At
         paragraphs 36 and 37  the  judge  found  that  the  respondent  had
         discharged the initial burden to show the document  was  false  and
         that the appellant had not rebutted this. No further  evidence  had
         been produced from the appellant's father or the  bank.  The  judge
         summarised the approach at paragraph 40 :

             "Putting the matter shortly therefore,  I  consider  that  the
             Respondent has discharge the initial burden that lies upon her
             and then with the burden shifting back to the  Appellant  that
             he has not discharged the burden to show that he has  provided
             accurate and truthful information."

     10. The contention on behalf of the appellants in  the  Upper  Tribunal
         was that no weight  should  have  been  attached  to  the  document
         verification report because it refers to information from  a  third
         party which has not been provided.

     11. It was contended that the respondent had failed  to  discharge  the
         burden  of  proof.  Reference  was  made  to  the  decision  of  MH
         (respondent bundle: documents not provided)  Pakistan  [2010]  UKUT
         168 and Shen (paper appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014] UKUT  00236
         (IAC). It was not accepted that the bank statement contained  false
         information.

     12. The presenting officer contended that the appellant had produced no
         rebuttal evidence and the judge was entitled to find on the balance
         of probabilities the bank statements could not be relied upon. Both
         parties agreed that if I found a material  error  of  law  I  could
         proceed to remake the decision without hearing further evidence.

Consideration

     13. The document verification report is contained in  the  respondent's
         bundle. The appellants had been provided with a copy of this before
         the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal. It  consists  of  a  request
         from an identified member from  the  respondent's  fraud  team,  Mr
         Darren Conway. It is dated 27 February 2014.  It indicates that the
         bank statement as well as a letter from the bank was  scanned  onto
         the request and sent to the Chief of  Currency  Department  at  the
         Xalq bank. There is then a page described as `detailed verification
         results'. The name of the member of staff at the bank is  redacted.
         The `Comments' section indicates Mr Conway spoke to this person  on
         the telephone and confirmed that  the  letter  from  the  bank  was
         genuine. The bank official required time to check the  transactions
         and then telephoned Mr Conway who recorded the transaction  history
         in the statements did not match the bank  records.  The  conclusion
         was that the statements were false.

     14. There is also a page dated 12/3/2014 which refers to a verifier, Ms
         Joanne Morris and which contains a UK e-mail address.  The  comment
         section records `FALSE-checks with issuing body confirmed documents
         are false (see attachment). Third-party  confirmation  received  on
         28/2/14.'

     15. I see no basis for finding this evidence should have been  excluded
         as the appellants representative contends. It was highly  relevant.
         There is no unfairness in its introduction. Before the hearing  the
         appellant was aware of this evidence  and  had  an  opportunity  to
         address it. The issue is the weight to be attached to it.

     16. I believe the appellants' representative is mistaken  in  referring
         to a missing attachment. As I read the report  the  final  page  is
         completed by a UK member of staff, Ms Morris,  and  the  attachment
         referred to is a report from Mr Conway.

     17. The tribunal has traditionally taken a  flexible  approach  towards
         the admission of evidence. In terms of strict proofs the report  is
         not signed by the maker. The original  notes  of  the  conversation
         with the member of staff at the bank are not included. However, the
         tribunal does not require the strict proofs of evidence  applicable
         in other  forums.  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
         (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 were in  force  at  the
         time of the First tier hearing.  Rule  14  (2)  provides  that  the
         tribunal may admit evidence whether or not it would  be  admissible
         in a civil trial.

     18. MH (respondent bundle: documents not provided) Pakistan [2010] UKUT
         168 was concerned  with  whether  bank  statements  where  genuine.
         Checks were made with the bank and a report was  produced  but  was
         not on file. When the matter came to the Upper Tribunal  subsequent
         searches could not produce the report. The Upper Tribunal  referred
         to  the  applicable  2005  procedural  rules  which   require   the
         respondent to serve any  unpublished  document  referred  to.  This
         requirement is mandatory and similar provisions  are  contained  in
         rules 23 and 24 of the 2014 rules. The purpose behind the  rule  is
         for the appellant to know the case they have to meet.  The  present
         case is completely different on the facts.  Here,  the  report  was
         provided and in my view in its totality.

     19. Shen (paper appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014]  UKUT  00236  (IAC)
         gives guidance on the approach  where  deception  is  alleged.  The
         factual background was  again  considerably  different.  The  Upper
         Tribunal at paragraph 16 said that  the  reference  to  `false'  in
         paragraph 322 `dishonestly false'.

     20. At paragraph 25 the Upper Tribunal commented on the burden of proof
         and referred to a switching burden with the burden of proof resting
         on the decision maker to establish any  contested  precedent  fact.
         Once the  decision-maker  establishes  the  underlying  facts,  the
         burden shifts to the appellant. (see JC (Part 9 HC395 -  burden  of
         proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027, para  10;  MZ  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
         [2009] EWCA Civ 919 para 25; and Mumu (Para 320; article 8;  scope)
         [2012] UKUT 00143 (IAC)). At hearing, Mr Tusan provided me  with  a
         copy of the House of Lords decision in B (children) [2008] UKHL  35
         where, at  paragraph  70,  Baroness  Hale  said  that  neither  the
         seriousness  of  the  allegations  or  the   seriousness   of   the
         consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to
         be applied, namely the balance of probabilities.

     21. Having considered the arguments I find no material error of law  in
         the decision of First-tier Judge Cockrill. It is clear and  concise
         and identifies the issue arising and deals with  it  appropriately.
         The Judge dealt properly with the document verification report  and
         correctly self-directed on the burden of proof.  Consequently,  the
         decision dismissing the appeals shall stand.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Judge Cockrill dismissing the appellants'
appeals shall stand. The appeals are dismissed.
