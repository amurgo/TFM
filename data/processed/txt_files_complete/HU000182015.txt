               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Richardson, Counsel instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born in  April  1971.   She  had
    leave to  remain  as  a  student.  On  30  October  2014  she  made  an
    application for a further extension which was refused.
2.   In refusing the application the Secretary of State, in a  letter  dated
    4 March 2015, said in two different places that  she  had  a  right  of
    appeal against the decision and indeed set out the various  grounds  of
    appeal,  these  being  grounds  of  appeal  under  Section  82  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The reality is that  the
    Secretary of State was in error in stating that there was  a  right  of
    appeal because the application had been made after 20 October 2014 when
    the provisions set out in the Immigration Act 2014 had come into  play.
    The Commencement No. 3 Transitional and Savings Provisions  Order  2014
    makes it clear that after 20 October there was no  statutory  right  of
    appeal. What should have been said  was  that  there  was  a  right  of
    administrative review.  The appellant acted on the basis of  the  terms
    of the refusal and  lodged  an  appeal  which  eventually  came  before
    Designated Judge Manuell and was dismissed.  It is unclear exactly what
    happened with regard to the issue of any jurisdictional  point  at  the
    hearing before Judge Manuell but the reality is  that  he  went  on  to
    dismiss the appeal substantively.  The appeal before me  is  an  appeal
    against that decision.

3.   The reality however is that there was no right  of  appeal  because  of
    the provisions of the Immigration Act 2014 to which  I  have  referred.
    The terms of the Act are quite clear and I am  not  in  a  position  to
    somehow extend the rights of the appellant to an appeal  when  no  such
    rights exist.  There is clear authority for that in the case of Virk  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 652.  I therefore find that not only do I not have
    jurisdiction to hear this appeal but also Judge  Manuell  had  no  such
    jurisdiction.   The  appeal  is  therefore  dismissed   for   want   of
    jurisdiction.

4.   It is clear however that the appellant was induced  to  appeal  because
    of the clear terms of the letter of refusal.   They  were  wrong.   The
    appellant has been penalised on costs because of the costs she has  run
    up in bringing an appeal which the  Tribunal  had  no  jurisdiction  to
    hear.

5.   Ms Brocklesby-Weller has confirmed that the appellant will now  have  a
    full administrative review  notwithstanding  that  that  administrative
    review is itself out of time.  It is only fair that this should  happen
    given that the appellant was not told of her rights to judicial  review
    but was in effect misled in the letter of refusal  when  she  was  told
    that she had a right of appeal.

Notice of Decision
