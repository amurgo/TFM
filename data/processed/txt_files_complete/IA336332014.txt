Representation:
Appellant   Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by Shehzad Law Chambers Ltd
Respondent  Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan.  The  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom on March 4, 2011 having been given leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 student until  June  22,  2013.  He  married
    Lubna Begum, a British citizen, on May 22, 2013.

 2. On June 21, 2013 he submitted an  application  to  vary  his  leave  to
    enable him to remain based on his marriage. This  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on October 2, 2013 and following an appeal  submitted  under
    Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  his
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ellerman  on  March
    31, 2014. She found the decision was not in accordance with the law and
    remitted the decision back to the Secretary of State.

 3. The respondent considered the matter  further  but  again  refused  the
    application on August 13, 2014. The decision taken  by  the  respondent
    considered the application under Section EX.1 of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, Paragraph 276ADE and the respondent then  went  onto
    briefly consider whether there were any  exceptional  circumstances  to
    merit consideration outside of the Rules. There was no consideration of
    their child's situation because at that point in time he had  not  been
    born. His date of birth is December 27, 2014.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision on August 26, 2014, under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Farrelly on May
    28, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on June 17, 2015 he refused  the
    application having regard to the Immigration Rules and article 8  ECHR.



 6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal  on  June  30,  2015  submitting
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Farrelly had erred but  permission  to
    appeal was refused by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Brunnen  on
    September 11, 2015 on the grounds the appeal grounds amounted to a mere
    disagreement and were an attempt to re-argue the  case.  Those  grounds
    were renewed to the Upper Tribunal  on  October  12,  2015  albeit  the
    grounds  were  drafted  by  Counsel-the  appellant  had  hitherto  been
    unrepresented. Upper Tribunal Judge Frances found on November  6,  2015
    it was arguable there had been an error in law. In a rule  24  response
    dated January 7, 2015 the respondent conceded the error and invited the
    Tribunal to list the matter for an oral hearing.

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I extend that Order.

 8. The matter came before me on the above date. Mr Tarlow and Mr Ahmed had
    discussed the case before the matter was  formally  dealt  with.  Their
    joint approach was that the refusal letter dated August  13,  2014  had
    not engaged at all with Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and  there
    was a material change that had not been considered  by  the  respondent
    namely the appellant and his wife had a young child who  is  a  British
    citizen.

 9. Mr Tarlow further conceded, albeit stressed it would be  a  matter  for
    the case worker, that the evidence in  the  original  bundle  suggested
    that the financial requirements had been met and this  application  was
    likely to succeed.

10. Both representatives invited me  to  remit  this  matter  back  to  the
    Secretary of State on the  basis  the  original  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

11. I pointed out to both parties that Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Ellerman had done this on March 31, 2014 and we appeared to be back  in
    the same position as she had been. Mr Tarlow assured me that the matter
    would be looked at properly this time as a full note would be  provided
    by him.

12. In the circumstances I find the decision is not in accordance with  the
    law because it suffered from a defect in procedure. The effect of  this
    determination is the August 13, 2014 decision is quashed and  that  the
    application remains outstanding awaiting a lawful decision.

    DECISION

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set  aside  the  decision.
    The matter is remitted back to the Secretary of State for  the  reasons
    set out above.

FEE AWARD

I do not make a fee  award  because  the  matters  that  have  led  to  this
juncture have only arisen through the passage of time and  the  intervention
of legal representatives.
