                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Oluwatofunmi [A], a citizen of Nigeria born  29
       June 1999, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 4  June
       2018, itself dismissing her appeal against the decision of the  Entry
       Clearance Officer to refuse her entry  to  the  UK  on  human  rights
       grounds.




  Introduction

    2. The application for entry clearance was made on the  basis  that  the
       Appellant was a child for whom her mother, the Sponsor [FA], had sole
       responsibility, or alternatively that there were serious reasons  for
       considering her exclusion undesirable.

    3. The application of 30 April  2017  was  refused  on  14  August  2017
       because,  whilst  DNA  evidence   established   the   mother/daughter
       relationship, it was not accepted that the  Sponsor  had  established
       that she had daily responsible for the Appellant's upbringing or that
       she continued to take an active part in her daughter's life.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal set out the relevant background. The  Sponsor
       is a British citizen who naturalised on 31 July 2015.  The  Appellant
       in her statement had explained that  her  mother  took  care  of  her
       needs, and of those of her brothers, paying for her school fees,  her
       accommodation at school,  for  medical  treatment,  and  additionally
       providing pocket money. The Sponsor had made  arrangements  with  the
       school for the Appellant's  care  and  had  attended  her  graduation
       ceremony.

    5. The Appellant was at  boarding  school  from  2009  to  2015.  Having
       originally resided with her father until he departed the scene around
       Easter 2010, she lived with her grandmother  until  2013;  once  that
       arrangement was no longer  tenable  she  was  able  to  live  with  a
       guardian ([LD], the Sponsor's step-sister) appointed by the  Sponsor;
       until April 2017, when Ms  [LD]'s  home  became  overcrowded  due  to
       [LD]'s own mother having to be  accommodated  there,  those  problems
       having begun around December 2016. Since then the Appellant had lived
       in  university-provided  accommodation.  Ms  [LD]'s  duties  included
       providing  accommodation,  taking  the  Appellant   to   school   and
       collecting her, and managing her food and hygiene. She was  paid  for
       this work by the Sponsor, who  played  no  part  in  the  daily  care
       herself. Ms [LD] wrote that the Appellant missed her mother and  that
       she was worried for her emotional state.

    6. The Appellant's brother [OA] indicated he and his siblings  had  been
       unable to bond with the Sponsor as they were  unable  to  spend  time
       together; she had nevertheless been responsible for their  wellbeing,
       paying for their schooling and general upkeep  since  their  father's
       departure. [AA] wrote in similar terms. A letter from the Appellant's
       school confirmed she had boarded there and that the Sponsor had fully
       met her liabilities; but, in the estimation of the Judge, it did  not
       suggest the Sponsor had sole responsibility,  instead  stressing  the
       role of the grandmother and guardian.

    7. The Appellant had now left school and was in the  second  year  of  a
       five-year  law  degree  at  university.  The  Sponsor  suffered  from
       rheumatoid arthritis and  depression,  the  latter  condition  having
       developed from April 2017  when  the  care  agreement  with  Ms  [LD]
       lapsed. She had trouble sleeping and used prescription drugs.

  Findings of the First-tier Tribunal

    8. The First-tier  Tribunal  came  to  its  conclusions  based  on  this
       evidence, noting that sole responsibility was  not  to  be  construed
       literally and that that state of affairs could be  established  where
       there  was  continuing  control  and  direction  over   the   child's
       upbringing, with the important decisions being made by  a  particular
       parent.

    9. It concluded that the Appellant's care needs were divided between  Ms
       [LD] and her mother; in the past her brother  [AA],  the  grandmother
       and the school, had all played a part. The father had played  a  real
       part in her life as a care provider until Easter 2010. It was unclear
       who had made the decision that the Appellant  would  attend  boarding
       school.  Whilst  the  Sponsor  had  referenced  giving  the  guardian
       instructions as to "the Appellant's needs she  would  provide",  that
       appeared to specify particular duties. It accepted  that  the  school
       would have dealt with the Sponsor once the father left the scene.

   10. The Sponsor's role was mainly financial with occasional  visits,  and
       the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to a  shared  responsibility  for
       the Appellant's care during her childhood, most of  that  care  being
       provided by others. The children  had  been  despatched  to  boarding
       school and there was no evidence beyond the financial payments of any
       dominant role by the Sponsor. The  entry  clearance  application  had
       been precipitated by a deterioration in accommodation  conditions  at
       the guardian's home, rather  in  recognition  of  the  mother  always
       having exercised control from a distance. Overall sole responsibility
       was not established.

   11.  Nor  were  there  any   circumstances   suggesting   exclusion   was
       undesirable. The Appellant was now a young adult who  had  lived  all
       her life in Nigeria, had presumably made friendships there,  and  was
       in the early stages of a law course that would open up  opportunities
       to her. Her accommodation problems were short-term and the family had
       the resources to remedy them; besides, there was apparently  still  a
       living grandparent with whom she could reside, and her  mother  could
       doubtless engineer some solution for her  from  some  combination  of
       these relatives. She had missed out on a close relationship with  her
       mother for much of her childhood, and was  unlikely  to  regain  that
       potential relationship as a young adult. Her best interests would  be
       to complete her education and remain in her  country  of  nationality
       keeping in touch with her mother  via  social  media  and  occasional
       visits.

   12. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that there was no  disproportionate
       interference with private and family life rights given that a failure
       to meet the Rules represented a strong factor in the public  interest
       being to maintain the refusal of entry clearance, given that her best
       interests pointed in favour of her remaining in Nigeria.







  Onwards appeal, including the "error of law" hearing

   13. Grounds of appeal  of  13  April  2018  argued  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law in

        a) Failing to set out the standard and burden of proof;

        b) Failing to direct itself as to the relevant  date  at  which  to
           assess the facts;

        c) Failing to determine the question of who had "continuing control
           and direction" by way of making the overall decisions as to  the
           Appellant's care.

   14. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  21  August
       2018 on all grounds, though particularly noting  that  the  Appellant
       had been a minor at the date  of  application  and  under  the  Rules
       should have been treated  as  such  throughout  the  decision  making
       process. Given  the  relevance  of  the  Rules  to  decisions  as  to
       proportionality  generally,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  arguably
       materially erred in law by straying into  assessing  the  Appellant's
       circumstances as if she was a young adult. Furthermore there  was  an
       arguable  over-concentration  on   questions   of   day-to-day   care
       arrangements rather than focussing on overall responsibility.

   15. I previously adjourned this  appeal  as  the  Appellant  had  changed
       representatives but his former representatives  had  been  unable  to
       pass on the relevant papers to the  new  representative.  Ms  Everett
       noted, and apologised for, the Home Office breach  of  directions  in
       failing to provide copies of the refusal letters; both parties agreed
       that these were adequately  summarised  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       decision, though in any event I provided Mr Collins with  a  copy  of
       his decision.

   16. Mr Collins developed the grounds and submitted that  there  had  been
       undue attention afforded  the  daily  care  regime  rather  than  the
       overall question of control over decision making.

   17. Ms Everett submitted that the failure to cite the standard and burden
       of proof was not material here; it was true there was a  misdirection
       as to date of decision, though that might not be material as the case
       on "serious  and  compelling  reasons"  was  not  especially  strong.
       However she acknowledged that it was very difficult to determine  why
       it was that the First-tier Tribunal  had  found  that  the  Sponsor's
       assistance was restricted to financing daily  care  provided  in  the
       country of origin, given the express references in  the  evidence  to
       her having had overall responsibility. Accordingly she felt unable to
       vigorously defend the decision on sole responsibility grounds.

Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   18. As is explained in judgments such as  that  of  Buxton  LJ  in  Cenir
       [2003] EWCA Civ 572: "The general guidance is to look at whether what
       has been done in relation to the upbringing has been done  under  the
       direction of the sponsoring settled parent ... the importance of  the
       parent with responsibility, albeit at a distance, having what can  be
       identified as direction over or control of important decisions in the
       child's life."

   19. TD Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049 made a very thorough survey of the  legal
       principles relevant to the assessment of sole responsibility:

           "13.  A central part of the notion of "sole responsibility"  for
           a  child's  upbringing  is  the  UK-based  parent's   continuing
           interest and involvement in the child's life,  including  making
           or being consulted about and approving important decisions about
           the child's upbringing. ...

           30.   The Court of Appeal [in Nmaju [2001] INLR  26]  saw  "sole
           responsibility" as a practical (rather than  exclusively  legal)
           exercise of "control" by the UK-based parent  over  the  child's
           upbringing and whether what is done by the carer is done  "under
           the direction" of that parent.

           ...

           27.   What is apparent from both the judgments is  the  need  to
           establish "responsibility" for the  child's  upbringing  in  the
           sense of decision-making, control  and  obligation  towards  the
           child which must lie  exclusively  with  the  parent.  Financial
           support, even exclusive financial support, will not  necessarily
           mean that the person providing it has "sole responsibility"  for
           the child. It is a factor but no more than that.

           ...

           34. These cases are largely concerned with the  issue  of  "sole
           responsibility" arising between a UK-parent  and  relatives  who
           are looking after the child in the country of origin. In many of
           the cases, the other parent has  disappeared  from  the  child's
           life totally or plays so little part  as  to  have,  in  effect,
           abdicated any responsibility for its upbringing. What emerges is
           a concept of "authority" or "control" over a child's  upbringing
           which derives from the natural  social  and  legal  role  of  an
           individual  as  a  parent.  Whilst  others  may,  by  force   of
           circumstances, look after a child, it may be that they are doing
           so only on behalf of the child's parent.  The  struggle  in  the
           case law is to identify when  the  parent's  responsibility  has
           been relinquished in part or  whole  to  another  such  that  it
           should  be  said  that  there  is  shared   rather   than   sole
           responsibility. By contrast, where both parents  are  active  in
           the child's life, the involvement of the parent in  the  country
           of origin is  significant  -  perhaps  crucial  -  in  assessing
           whether the parent in the UK has "sole responsibility"  for  the
           child.

           ...

           44.   In most of the cases, the parent based in the child's  own
           country - usually the father - has abdicated any  responsibility
           for his child by disappearing or taking no part in  the  child's
           upbringing. There is only one parent  involved  in  the  child's
           life. If one started from principle, it might  be  thought  that
           the issue of "responsibility" for a child  and  whether  or  not
           that amounts to "sole responsibility" is  exclusively  an  issue
           between parents. The issue of sole  responsibility  should  not,
           therefore, arise. However, that is not the position taken in the
           cases, including those in the Court of Appeal.  We  accept  that
           the question of "sole responsibility" is not so  restricted  and
           it remains an issue even where there is only one parent but, for
           practical reasons, the child is looked  after  by  others  (see,
           Ramos, above, per Dillon  LJ  at  p  151).  The  issue  is  then
           whether, as between the relative/carers and the UK-based parent,
           the latter has "sole responsibility" for the child.

           45.   To understand the proper approach to the  issue  of  "sole
           responsibility", we begin with the situation where a  child  has
           both parents involved in its life. The starting  point  must  be
           that  both  parents  share  responsibility  for  their   child's
           upbringing. This would be the position if the parents and  child
           lived in the same country and we can see no reason in  principle
           why it should be different if one parent has moved to the United
           Kingdom. 46. In order to conclude that the UK-based  parent  had
           "sole responsibility" for the child, it would  be  necessary  to
           show that the parent abroad had abdicated any responsibility for
           the child and was merely acting at the direction of the UK-based
           parent and was  otherwise  totally  uninvolved  in  the  child's
           upbringing. The possibility clearly cannot be ruled out:  Alagon
           provides an example of this exceptional situation and turns upon
           an acceptance by the judge of the wholly unusual situation  that
           the father was "doing nothing for the child beyond the bare fact
           of living with her on reasonably good terms". (at p 345).

           ...

           52.   Questions of "sole responsibility" under  the  immigration
           rules should be approached as follows:

                ...

                iv.     Wherever  the  parents  are,  if  both  parents  are
                involved  in  the  upbringing  of  the  child,  it  will  be
                exceptional that one of them will have sole responsibility."

   20. In the light of the pragmatic stance of Ms Everett,  my  reasons  for
       finding an error of law in the decision below were relatively  brief.
       The stronger limb of this appeal was plainly the sole  responsibility
       issue. The argument on "serious and compelling reasons" for excluding
       the Appellant was rather less forceful, given that it would seem that
       the family unit has had, all material times, some degree of resources
       and connections in Nigeria, such that it would not be beyond them  to
       make alternative arrangements for the Appellant's care.

   21. However, on the sole responsibility ground, there were several pieces
       of evidence that required more careful attention than they  received.
       The Appellant's witness statement set out that  the  mother  was  the
       only person taking care of their needs by paying school fees,  buying
       clothes, paying  for  food,  accommodation  and  a  guardian,  making
       arrangements with  the  school  authority  regarding  her  care,  and
       attending her secondary school graduation.  The  Sponsor's  statement
       set out that "The guardian was taking instructions from me, regarding
       the  Appellant's  needs  she  would  provide".  The  guardian  [LD]'s
       statement  set  out  that  she  was  paid  20,000  Naira  to  provide
       accommodation, manage travel arrangements to school, and arrange  for
       her nutrition and hygiene.

   22. Each of those strands of evidence indicates that the  Sponsor's  care
       regime involved something by way of oversight of the arrangements  in
       place in Nigeria, and did not simply involve the  delegation  of  all
       decision making to family members or the guardian abroad.

   23. I accordingly found that there was a material error  of  law  in  the
       determination of the appeal on sole responsibility grounds.  However,
       as the findings on "serious and compelling reasons" were not shown as
       unsustainable, they were to be  treated  as  preserved  for  the  re-
       hearing, as I did not consider that the Judge's decision below  would
       have been any different had the correct date of evidential assessment
       been identified.

Evidence at the Continuation hearing

   24. It is now appropriate to set out the evidence  that  was  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal in slightly more detail, as it continued to found
       the Appellant's case, subject to the oral evidence now  given  before
       me. The Appellant's witness statement records that  the  Sponsor  had
       been the only person taking care of her and her brother, paying their
       school fees, providing a guardian  when  their  grandmother  was  too
       feeble to continue caring for them,  travelling  to  Nigeria  to  see
       them, calling them daily, and making  arrangements  with  the  school
       authority regarding her care.

   25. [LD], the Sponsor's stepsister, provided a witness statement  setting
       out that she had accepted responsibility as her  sister's  children's
       guardian on the basis of 20,000 Naira monthly. The Appellant had last
       resided with her on 18 April 2017. [LD] had told the Sponsor that she
       could no longer care for the Appellant when the Sponsor  visited  her
       in May 2017; [LD]  felt  that  the  daughter  was  really  struggling
       without her mother's  support,  which  was  adversely  affecting  her
       mental wellbeing.

   26.  The  Sponsor's  witness  statement  explains  that  she  was  solely
       responsible for her  childrens'  financial  and  emotional  care  and
       living arrangements from April 2010. She had  also  been  financially
       responsible for her own mother. Her eldest child, [AA],  was  in  the
       early days responsible for cooking for the family unit at  one  time;
       she would send him money to buy food and other provisions.  He  would
       collect and drop off the school registration form for the  Appellant,
       which she would complete and return to  him  via  email.  However  he
       found the caring role difficult, and  she  had  to  find  alternative
       care, taking on [LD] as her daughter's guardian from 2013.  [LD]  was
       paid to cover living costs, deal with travel to and from  school  and
       for   her   daily   provisions,   to   prepare   her   food,   attend
       parents/teachers meetings, and to ensure that she  maintained  decent
       standards of hygiene. [LD], once guardian,  would  take  instructions
       from regarding the Appellant's needs. Over this  period  the  Sponsor
       would see her daughter twice  a  year  during  the  school  holidays,
       remaining until a day before the resumed school when she would go and
       see their lecturers and head of administration. Overall "The guardian
       was taking instructions from me, regarding the Appellant's needs  she
       would provide".

   27. When problems had begun with the  quality  of  accommodation  at  her
       sister's house her daughter would call her up to twenty times a  day,
       crying unconsolably. Once it was clear that  further  residence  with
       [LD] was untenable, she sent her son [AA] to tell the Appellant  that
       she would make arrangements for her to stay at a hostel  pending  her
       own arrival in Nigeria. Once she arrived,  she  became  certain  that
       [LD] could no longer meet her role as guardian,  given  her  need  to
       care for her  own  mother,  who  was  now  residing  in  the  limited
       accommodation space available.

   28. Ms [A], the  Sponsor,  gave  evidence,  having  adopted  her  witness
       statement. The tenancy agreement  of  1  June  2016  related  to  her
       present accommodation where she had lived since that date, which  had
       all relevant amenities. She paid rent there. She was a  self-employed
       support worker making African dresses. If her daughter joined her  in
       the UK, she could continue with this employment. In  March  2018  she
       had moved to a new employer, Independence  Homes,  having  previously
       worked for Amber Home Carers.

   29. Cross examined, she said she worked four nights a week,  from  9:15pm
       to 7:15am, and earning �1,400  a  month.  She  earned  around  �1,000
       monthly from making  dresses.  She  would  alter  her  present  shift
       arrangements to day shifts if necessary, so she would not be  leaving
       her daughter at night. It was  put  to  her  that  she  had  made  no
       decisions in her daughter's life; the material she provided, such  as
       the school letter, did not show as much. She replied that  she  would
       give instructions to her mother to take her daughter to wherever  was
       necessary. It was put to her that the  grandmother  or  someone  else
       would presumably send her daughter to see a doctor; she replied  that
       she would make the decision about when the  daughter  would  see  the
       family doctor. She would direct arrangements generally,  for  example
       by the medium of WhatsApp. If urgent attention  was  needed  for  her
       daughter, she would see to that as well.

   30. For  the  Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  sole
       responsibility  was  not  established:  there  was  no  corroborative
       evidence of the Sponsor  taking  responsibility  for  the  daughter's
       care. The evidence of her present employment had  not  been  updated.
       Whilst she recognised  that  the  degree  of  financial  support  the
       Sponsor had provided to her daughter could not seriously be disputed,
       that alone was not  sufficient.  If  one  went  through  the  witness
       statements,  there  was  limited  reference  to  exercising   overall
       direction over her child's upbringing; for example, the school letter
       did not record any direct oversight. Overall this appeared  to  be  a
       case of shared responsibility by  which  the  family  combined  their
       efforts.

   31. Mr Collins replied that the Sponsor's witness statement did exemplify
       sole responsibility, if one had regard to the nine points  identified
       in TD Yemen.  The  very  fact  that  the  Sponsor  had  overseen  the
       appointment of a guardian was in fact  indicative  of  the  level  of
       control that she exercised.

Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

   32. It seems to me that, making inferences from the accepted evidence, on
       balance  of  probabilities  the  Sponsor   did   indeed   have   sole
       responsibility for her daughter's  upbringing  at  the  date  of  the
       application and decision in this case. In making this finding I  have
       regard to the need to recognise that there will be some  cases  where
       overall   responsibility   is   shared   between   family    members,
       notwithstanding significant input from a  UK  resident  Sponsor,  and
       other cases where it  can  properly  be  said  that  the  Sponsor  is
       exercising overall control of the arrangements. I am  confident  that
       the arrangements here fall on the latter side of the line.

   33. Firstly, the evidence of the witnesses, both Sponsor, Appellant,  the
       Sponsor's son [AA], and the sometime guardian [LD], coincides in  its
       general tenor. The overall direction of responsibility was  given  by
       the Sponsor. This is particularly clear from the fact that she signed
       off the arrangements for the child's schooling and that she took  the
       time to physically visit the school on  more  than  one  occasion  in
       order to speak to  the  teachers  regarding  her  daughter's  ongoing
       education. It is also demonstrated by the range of issues over  which
       the mother has consistently held control: from  issues  of  spending,
       education, to her daughter's attendance at the doctor. This  evidence
       was unshaken (indeed, largely unchallenged) in cross examination.

   34. Secondly, it is clear that the daughter has been  very  dependent  on
       her mother  emotionally,  as  shown  by  the  exceptional  number  of
       telephone calls over the period of instability of  her  accommodation
       at [LD]'s home, and as indeed is shown  by  [LD]'s  concern  for  the
       Appellant's state of mind.

   35. I accordingly accept that the Sponsor exercised  sole  responsibility
       for her daughter throughout her childhood. Given that there  is  very
       limited evidence before me  on  developments  thereafter,  I  see  no
       reason to consider the situation has changed  thereafter,  given  the
       regular contact between mother and daughter and the  latter's  strong
       emotional dependency on the former. For the reasons which  follow,  I
       do  not  consider  that  post-decision   events   are   of   critical
       significance in any  event.  In  any  event,  Ms  Isherwood  did  not
       question the Appellant on post  decision  developments,  leaving  her
       legal submission rather short of any evidential basis.

   36. Ms Isherwood made the submission, albeit rather faintly at the outset
       of the hearing without reference to any clear governing authority and
       without pressing the point  in  her  closing  submissions,  that  the
       question of sole responsibility should be assessed at the date of the
       hearing rather than at the date of the entry  clearance  application.
       However, the authorities make it clear that the Rules should be taken
       as the starting point for  assessing  immigration  appeals  on  Human
       Rights Convention grounds. As stated in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC  10,
       "although the tribunal must make its own judgment, it  should  attach
       considerable weight to judgments made by the Secretary  of  State  in
       the exercise of her  constitutional  responsibility  for  immigration
       policy." Lord Carnwath in the Supreme Court makes the same  point  in
       Patel [2013] UKSC 72, stating at [55] that "the balance drawn by  the
       rules may be relevant to the consideration of proportionality".

   37. So it seems to me that it is important that I should have  regard  to
       Immigration Rule 27 which expressly preserves the child's age at  the
       date of application. I consider that any other approach would lead to
       arbitrary consequences, given the long delays in the listing of entry
       clearance  appeals  and  the  subsequent  delays   in   their   final
       disposition which the onwards appeals process may sometimes occasion.
       This  is  also  consistent   with   the   Strasbourg   and   domestic
       jurisprudence which stresses the  potential  continuation  of  family
       life during a child's minority absent some exceptional  circumstances
       that break the parental link.

   38. Sir Ernest Ryder in TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109
       �35 stated:

           "The policy of the Secretary of State as expressed in the  Rules
           is not to be ignored when a decision about article 8  is  to  be
           made outside the Rules. An evaluation of  the  question  whether
           there are insurmountable obstacles is a relevant factor  because
           considerable weight is to be placed on the Secretary of  State's
           policy as reflected in the Rules of the circumstances in which a
           foreign national partner should be granted leave to remain.  ...
           where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not by  reference
           to  an  article  8  informed  requirement,  then  this  will  be
           positively determinative of  that  person's  article  8  appeal,
           provided their case engages article 8(1), for  the  very  reason
           that it would then be disproportionate for  that  person  to  be
           removed."

   39. Given that I have found the Immigration Rules satisfied on  the  sole
       question  on  which  the  application  was  refused,  that  of   sole
       responsibility, and that family  life  plainly  endures  between  the
       Appellant and her daughter, I accordingly find that  the  refusal  of
       entry clearance was disproportionate to the family life with which it
       interfered.

Decision:

The appeal is allowed.
