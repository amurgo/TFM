                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge  Fox  made
    following a hearing at Bradford on 27th September 2017.



Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Barbados born on 19th February 1971.   He
    applied to come to the UK as a spouse but was refused  entry  clearance
    on 27th June 2016 on the grounds that the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    not satisfied that the appellant was in a genuine relationship with his
    sponsor nor that the financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    had been met.

 3. The judge found that the appellant had  married  the  sponsor  on  16th
    March 2016, and if he was granted entry clearance he would reside  with
    her in the UK. He accepted that  the  couple  were  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.

 4. He was not satisfied that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  had  been
    met.

 5. He wrote as follows:-

         "It is agreed between  the  parties  that  the  appellant  and  the
         sponsor have not submitted the specified evidence  in  relation  to
         the financial requirements.  The sponsor accepted that she did  not
         submit her payslips for the six month period prior to the  date  of
         the application.  The sponsor and the appellant have also  accepted
         (both in the Grounds of Appeal and orally at the hearing) that  the
         letters from the employers do not contain all  of  the  information
         that is required as stated in Appendix FM-SE and  outlined  in  the
         refusal decision.  I note that the appellant submits  that  further
         letters will be submitted however the sponsor  confirmed  that  she
         does not have any other letters to submit.  She further stated that
         her employers told her that they would include all of the  relevant
         information in the letters that are  dated  2nd  and  19th  October
         2015.  I therefore find that the financial  requirements  have  not
         been satisfied in this matter as the  specified  evidence  has  not
         been submitted.

         I find that there is too much specified evidence  missing  in  this
         matter and that  the  respondent  was  correct  not  to  apply  the
         discretionary power stated in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE (to not
         apply the requirements for the documents)."

 6. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that  crucial
    documents were missing from the judge's file.  They had been  submitted
    via email on 26th July 2016 but not linked to the file at the  Tribunal
    hearing.  The documents included updated job  letters  from  Taskmaster
    and the NHS, Barclays and NatWest Bank statements showing  the  payment
    of wages from Taskmaster and NHS respectively, Taskmaster payslips  for
    the period 4th October 2015 to 3rd April 2016, P60 from Taskmaster  for
    2016, NHS payslips  for  the  period  2015  to  April  2016  and  other
    documents.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Murray on 26th October 2017.

 9. On 15th November 2017 the  respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination and submitting that the  sponsor  acknowledged  that  the
    employment letters did not include the specified evidence required.

The Hearing

10. At the hearing Mrs Pettersen accepted that the documents referred to in
    the reply in fact referred to documents  relating  to  the  appellant's
    relationship with his spouse. She acknowledged that the material  which
    was in the documents which had not been linked to the file were in fact
    relevant to the consideration of whether the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ought to have applied paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE.

11. The decision is set aside on the grounds that the judge did  not  reach
    it on the basis of all of the evidence which ought to have been  before
    him.  Relevant information which should  have  been  on  his  file  was
    missing.

Findings and Conclusions

12. Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE states:-

         "(a) In deciding an application in relation to which this  Appendix
             states that specified documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
             Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State   will   consider
             documents that have been submitted with the  application,  and
             will only consider documents submitted after  the  application
             where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b)  If the applicant:

             (i)  Has submitted:

                  (aa)     A sequence of documents and some of the documents
                      in the sequence have been omitted (e.g. if  one  bank
                      statement  from  a  series  of  bank  statements   is
                      missing);

                  (bb) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if  a
                      letter is not on letter headed paper  as  specified);
                      or

                  (cc) A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                      document; or

                  (dd) A  document  which  does  not  consider  all  of  the
                      specified information; or

             (ii) Has not submitted a  specified  document,  the  decision-
                  maker may contact the applicant or his  representative  in
                  writing or otherwise and  request  the  documents  or  the
                  correct versions.  The material requested must be received
                  at  the  address  specified  in  the  request   within   a
                  reasonable timescale specified in the request.

         (c)  The decision-maker will not request documents where he or  she
             does not anticipate that  addressing  the  error  or  omission
             referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because
             the application will be refused for other reasons."

13. Mrs Pettersen acknowledged  that  the  deficiencies  in  the  documents
    before the Entry Clearance Officer fell  within  the  above  paragraph.
    The letter from the employer was not in the correct format and some  of
    the payslips were missing.  However she accepted that the appellant had
    submitted the other documents, including P60s for the  relevant  years,
    which  would  have  informed  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  that  the
    appellant could potentially meet the requirements of  the  Rules.   The
    sponsor has not changed her employment for many  years.   It  is  clear
    from the P60s that she earns well in excess of the ï¿½18,600 required.

14. She also accepted that,  in  July  2016,  the  appellant  produced  the
    missing payslips and the employer's letter  setting  out  the  required
    information and a more up-to-date P60 covering the  date  of  decision,
    which fell within a new tax year.  In the circumstances she agreed that
    the Entry Clearance Officer would  reconsider  the  application  taking
    into account the documentation produced  with  the  Grounds  of  Appeal
    which could have been requested under paragraph D.

15. The decision as to whether entry clearance ought to be granted  remains
    of course with the Entry Clearance Officer.  The  appeal  is  therefore
    allowed to the extent that it is remitted back for  a  decision  to  be
    made.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
