                            DECISION AND REASONS





Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Traynor, promulgated on  20  August  2015.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert, on 4 January 2016.

Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. The appellants are the spouse, son and daughter of Mrs  Prabhakar,  the
    sponsor who is a British citizen. On 30 July 2013,  they  sought  entry
    clearance to settle in the United Kingdom with the sponsor.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer (ECO) deferred a final decision on  the  applications
    pending the outcome of  the  Secretary  of  State's  challenge  to  the
    judgment in MM & Ors v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin).  Nonetheless,
    initial assessments took place on 25 February 2014  and  3  July  2014,
    following which the ECO noted that  the  sponsor  failed  to  meet  the
    minimum income requirements of Appendix FM.

 4. The notices of decision are dated  4  August  2014.  They  advised  the
    appellants that the Secretary of State's appeal in MM had  been  upheld
    as  to  the  lawfulness  of  the  income  threshold  requirement;  that
    additional information and documents had been taken  into  account  but
    that  the  applications  were  refused  because  the  income  threshold
    requirement of Appendix FM was not met.  Specifically,  the  ECO  noted
    from the Appendix 2 form  submitted  with  the  application,  that  the
    sponsor  said  that  she  earned  a  total  of  �25,200  from  salaried
    employment  and  self-employment.  Referring  to  paragraph  13(3)   of
    Appendix FM-SE, the ECO explained that only the gross income from  both
    sources for the last financial year  could  be  considered.  The  ECO's
    calculation for the financial year ending on 5 April 2013, was that the
    sponsor earned �14,949.00 from salaried employment and  �2,400.00  from
    self-employment, making a total of �17,349.00. E-ECP 3.1(a)  stipulates
    that an income of �24,800 is required in the absence of savings,  which
    the sponsor did not have.

 5. The ECO assessed new evidence submitted after the application  but  did
    not take it into  consideration  because  it  did  not  relate  to  the
    sponsor's circumstances at the time of the application. The  appellants
    were informed that if they wished the ECO to  consider  that  evidence,
    they would need to apply  again  and  the  sponsor's  income  would  be
    assessed at the time of the application.  Lastly,  the  ECO  considered
    there to be no exceptional circumstances raised by the applications.

 6. The appellants appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  grounds  of
    appeal argued that the ECO had failed to consider all the  evidence  or
    compassionate circumstances and asserted that the sponsor's  income  up
    until 31 March 2014 was  �25,375.00.  Thus,  it  was  argued  that  the
    appellants met the requirements of  the  Rules  and  further  that  the
    decision to refuse entry was unlawful pursuant  to  Section  6  of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998.

 7. An Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) reviewed the decisions under appeal on
    3 December 2014. The decisions were maintained. It was said that  while
    there was evidence to suggest  that  the  sponsor  had  earnings  which
    exceeded the financial threshold in the financial period which followed
    the applications, this was irrelevant in relation to  the  applications
    submitted. On the matter of Article 8, the  ECM  did  not  consider  it
    unreasonable for the sponsor to visit or live with  the  appellants  in
    India.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 8. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  judge  heard  oral
    evidence from the sponsor and submissions from her representative.  The
    respondent was not represented.  The sponsor mainly relied on  evidence
    of her income for the 2013/2014 financial year. It was  argued  on  the
    appellants' behalf that owing to  section  85(4)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  that  the  judge  was  permitted  to
    consider evidence about any matter relevant to the  decision  including
    evidence submitted after the applications but prior to  the  decisions.
    The judge concluded that he  was  only  obliged  to  consider  evidence
    submitted with the applications; that the income threshold was not  met
    and that it was open to the appellants to submit fresh applications. He
    found there to be no breach of their Article 8 rights; reiterating  the
    point made by the ECM.

The grounds of appeal

 9. The grounds of appeal in support of the applications for permission  to
    appeal argued that the judge erred in stating that section 85(4) of the
    2002 Act only came into force after the decisions in  question  and  he
    was  therefore  obliged  to  take  the  sponsor's  circumstances   into
    consideration at the time of those decisions.  It  was  said  that  her
    income exceeded the income requirement. It was stated that at the  time
    of the application, the sponsor  had  been  self-employed  for  just  6
    months but her projected income from all sources  during  the  12-month
    period  January  2013  until  December  2013   would   be   �25,200.00.
    Furthermore, her  tax  return  for  the  year  ending  April  2014  was
    �25,375.00.  The grounds also asserted that  the  judge  erred  in  his
    Article 8 assessment because the sponsor was unable to  live  in  India
    with her family because she lost her Indian citizenship  when  she  was
    naturalised as a British citizen.

10. Permission to appeal was granted on following basis

    3. Whilst there is clearly arguable error by the  judge  in  the  above
    respect, it could be equally argued to lack materiality insofar as  the
    provisions of Appendix FM-SE  require  the  specified  evidence  to  be
    submitted at the date of application. In the absence of firm  authority
    as to resolution of the tension between the  judge's  discretion  under
    S85(4) to consider evidence relevant to the substance of  the  decision
    and the requirements of Appendix FM as to submission of  evidence  with
    the application the grounds are arguable.

11. The respondent's  Rule  24  response  indicated  that  the  appellants'
    complaint relating to section 85(4) was wholly  erroneous  because  the
    Rules precluded  consideration  of  evidence  not  submitted  with  the
    application and Appendix FM-SE expressly referred to the last financial
    year in relation income from self-employment and not projected income.

The hearing

12. Mr Quee handed up a skeleton argument  which  referred  to  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions dating from May 2016. He reiterated  what  was
    said in the grounds that at [24] of his decision and reasons, the judge
    had erred in saying section 85(4) was not applicable.

13. At this point, Mr Wilding interjected to clarify  that  the  respondent
    accepted that a decision maker could consider further evidence  adduced
    by an appellant to improve their case, but that  the  evidence  had  to
    relate to the date of the application and not otherwise.

14. Mr Wilding  argued  that  the  difficulty  with  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's income was not just insufficiency of that income but  missing
    evidence. While some documents were missing from a series,  there  were
    other deficiencies.

15. Mr Quee indicated an acceptance that the Rules were not met at the time
    of the application and that "we may be in new  application  territory."
    He also asked us to note that the appellants were unrepresented at  the
    time of the applications.

16. Mr Wilding took us through the documentary  evidence  relating  to  the
    date of application, with reference to Appendix FM-SE.  Essentially, he
    submitted, in respect of the  sponsor's  salaried  employment,  that  3
    months' pay slips were missing and  one  personal  bank  statement.  He
    contended if these were the only items missing, it would  be  difficult
    to argue that evidential flexibility should  not  be  applied,  however
    there were significant omissions in relation to the evidence  of  self-
    employment.

17. Considering Part 7 of Appendix FM/SE, Mr Wilding  submitted  that  sub-
    paragraph 7(a) was not met, in that evidence of tax payable,  paid  and
    unpaid was not submitted for the 2012-2013 financial year.  In  respect
    of 7(b), no self-assessment for the last full financial year before the
    application was provided and the statement of account provided,  namely
    SA302 was for the 2013-2014 financial year. Moving on  to  7(f),  there
    were no personal bank statements for 2012 and those from  January  2013
    and April 2013 were missing. He added that  it  was  also  questionable
    whether 7(h)bb was met.

18. In reply, Mr Quee admitted to being in  some  difficulty.  He  conceded
    that the specified documents referred to by  Mr  Wilding,  were  indeed
    missing and that was the case before the ECO as well as the  First-tier
    Tribunal. He informed us that there were difficulties with making a new
    application at the time the ECO  suggested  it,  which  meant  such  an
    application would have failed. Mr Quee commented that there had been no
    references to the defects in the evidence or lack of documents  in  the
    ECM's review.  He  reminded  us  that  the  ECM's  view  was  that  the
    additional material submitted after the application, indicated that the
    financial threshold may have been  exceeded.  He  also  said  that  the
    appellants were not represented at the  time  of  the  ECO's  decision.
    Regarding the First-tier Tribunal hearing, he explained that  his  firm
    could only provide evidence  which  had  been  given  to  them  by  the
    sponsor.

19. Mr Quee asked us to note that the only  requirement  not  met  was  the
    financial requirement  and  that  the  ECO  ought  to  have  given  the
    appellants an opportunity  to  provide  the  missing  documents.  After
    querying whether  Article  8  ground  was  included  in  the  grant  of
    permission and being advised that  it  was  not,  Mr  Quee  nonetheless
    argued that the second and third appellants were financially  dependent
    upon the sponsor, who owing to her British nationality could  not  live
    in India.

20. At the end of the hearing, we reserved our decision which we  now  give
    with reasons.

Decision on error of law

21. Permission to appeal was granted solely in  relation  to  the  argument
    that the judge erred in finding that section 85(4) of the 2002 Act  was
    not in force at the time of the decision to refuse entry  clearance  in
    this case. The judge granting permission did not do so in  relation  to
    the Article 8 grounds.

22. The relevant section of the 2002 Act, given the date of the decision in
    this case was in fact section 85(5) which reads;

    (5) But in relation to an appeal under section 82(1) against refusal of
    entry clearance or  refusal  of  a  certificate  of  entitlement  under
    section 10-

    (a)subsection (4) shall not apply, and

    (b) The Tribunal may consider only the  circumstances  appertaining  at
    the time of the decision to refuse.

23. Section 85(4) of the Act was, therefore, not relevant. What  the  judge
    did was, correctly in our view, to consider the evidence  submitted  by
    the appellants  with  the  applications  for  entry  clearance,  having
    reference to paragraph D(a) of Appendix FM-SE;

    "D.(a) In deciding an application to which this  Appendix  states  that
    specified documents must be provided, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  or
    Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will consider documents  that
    have been submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider
    documents submitted after the application where  sub-paragraph  (b)  or
    (e) applies. "

24. The judge considered whether the exceptions in sub-paragraph (b) or (e)
    applied at [26] and concluded that they did not. There is no  challenge
    to this aspect of his decision.

25. It is the case that in relation to the sponsor's employment there  were
    missing documents, in that one of  a  series  of  bank  statements  was
    missing and three out of six of the pay  slips  were  missing,  however
    owing to paragraph D(c) of the said Appendix, a decision-maker will not
    request such documents where it  is  not  anticipated  that  addressing
    those omissions would lead to a grant of entry because the  application
    will be refused for other reasons. Other  reasons  in  the  appellants'
    case are that there were serious omissions in respect of  the  evidence
    of self-employment. That there was no evidence of tax payable, paid and
    unpaid for the financial year 2012-2013, which was the  last  financial
    year prior to the applications being made was not disputed by  Mr  Quee
    in his closing submissions. Accordingly, we reject the submission  that
    the ECO ought to have exercised evidential flexibility in this case.

26. Nor did Mr Quee dispute that the evidence of income declared to HMRC in
    the form of a SA302,  related  to  the  financial  year  following  the
    application and  that  in  relation  to  the  sponsor's  personal  bank
    statements showing income from self-employment, only two out of  twelve
    were provided for the 2012-2013 financial year.

27. These missing specified documents were not  before  the  judge  at  the
    hearing. Had they been, they could have been considered by  the  judge.
    Instead, the appellants relied on evidence relating  to  the  financial
    year ending in 2014, too late for the present application, arguing that
    the sponsor's income was anticipated to exceed the income threshold.

28. The judge, rightly, did not take this  post-application  evidence  into
    consideration.  At [28], referring to Appendix  FM-SE  13(e)  where  it
    states that the evidence of self-employment must  relate  to  the  last
    full financial year prior to the  application  being  made,  the  judge
    remarks, that this provision "strongly implies that it is not  possible
    to provide  evidence  of  part  of  the  financial  year  in  order  to
    illustrate earnings but rather it is the full financial year."

29. Any error made by the judge in relation to section 85  could  not  have
    affected the outcome of the appeals, which were bound to be dismissed.

Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
