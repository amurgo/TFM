                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The claimant is a citizen of Thailand born on 5th January 1976.  She
       first came to the UK as a visitor  in  2011  to  visit  the  British
       citizen man she was later to marry, and made two further  visits  in
       2012. On 15th August 2012 the claimant married her  husband  in  the
       UK, but then left the UK on 8th June 2013 so  she  could  apply  for
       entry clearance to return to the UK as her husband's spouse. On  8th
       August 2013 the claimant was notified that her application would  be
       refused entry clearance due to failure to  meet  the  financial  and
       evidential requirements, but that the decision was put on hold,  and
       so not  formally  refused,  due  to  the  challenge  to  the  income
       threshold containing within the Immigration Rules  at  Appendix  FM,
       which was eventually resolved by the decision in the Court of Appeal
       in the case of MM & Ors in July 2014 upholding the lawfulness of the
       income threshold requirements. Following the decision of  the  Court
       of Appeal in MM a  formal  refusal  of  the  claimant's  application
       issued on 31st July 2014, and sent to the  claimant  on  1st  August
       2014, thus enabling her to appeal.

    2. On 28th October 2014 the claimant  appealed  this  decision  out  of
       time. On 29th March 2015 the First-tier Tribunal extended  time  for
       appealing. On 31st July 2015 the Secretary of State produced an  ECM
       review of her refusal, and said that she was now satisfied that  the
       financial and evidential requirements were in fact met, but  in  the
       same document goes on to say  that  the  claimant  was  refused  for
       failure to meet some of the evidential requirements relating to  her
       husband's self-employed earnings.

    3. The claimant's appeal against the decision to refuse entry clearance
       as a spouse was allowed outside of the Immigration Rules on  Article
       8  ECHR  grounds  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  AD  Baker  in   a
       determination promulgated on the 10th June 2016.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Manuell on 7th October 2016 on the basis that it was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law in  failing  to  consider
       proportionality outside of the Immigration Rules correctly as  there
       was a failure to consider  whether  family  life  could  take  place
       elsewhere; and a consideration of immaterial matters such  as  delay
       and the complexity of Appendix FM. It was therefore arguable that SS
       (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387 had not been followed.

    5. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law

Submissions - Error of Law

    6. The Secretary of State argues that the First-tier Tribunal  errs  in
       law as SS (Congo) holds that if family life can be enjoyed elsewhere
       the requirements on the Secretary of State are less  stringent  with
       regards Article 8 ECHR. The First-tier Tribunal had  not  identified
       what compelling circumstances existed to allow an appeal outside  of
       the Immigration Rules justifying giving this appellant  preferential
       treatment; there was also no  proper  consideration  whether  family
       life  could  be  enjoyed  in  Thailand  or  whether  this  would  be
       unjustifiably harsh. It had not been  considered  that  the  sponsor
       could have continued his business in Thailand. It was not correct to
       say the claimant had been subjected to delays as all cases where any
       financial matter was part of the refusal were stayed  in  accordance
       with the Secretary of State's policy so all claimants like this  one
       were treated equally. As such the decision erred in law for  failure
       to follow SS (Congo).  Further  there  was  a  failure  to  properly
       consider the public interest in refusing the claimant as  she  could
       not meet the Immigration Rules, as well as her  financial  situation
       in accordance with Ruppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ.

    7. The Sponsor submitted that the claimant had gone back to Thailand to
       make an application for entry clearance as  he  had  been  told  she
       would otherwise be banned from entering the UK for ten years. He had
       asked his accountant to provide evidence of his funds,  and  he  had
       done his best. He felt he had not been treated fairly as he had  not
       been told what was needed in relation to the evidential requirements
       of the Immigration Rules by the embassy staff  in  Thailand  or  the
       First-tier Tribunal. He considered that the decision of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal was correct, particularly as he could not conduct  his
       business in Thailand. He would not be able to do building work  (his
       trade) in Thailand due to the heat, and because in any case it  paid
       very poorly so would not support him.  The  claimant's  brother  did
       building and farm work and was paid about �6 a day  for  working  in
       heat up to 47 degrees centigrade, something he would not be able  to
       do. He also wished to remain in the UK as  he  had  family,  and  in
       particular three sons (aged  17,  19  and  21  years)  for  whom  he
       provided support who did similar work to his, and for whom he needed
       to remain nearby. He  had  not  mentioned  this  at  the  First-tier
       Tribunal as no one had asked him any questions about them.

    8. I reserved my decision as to whether there was an error of  law  and
       asked  the  parties  to  provide  evidence  and  make  any   further
       submissions for remaking in case an error was found.

Evidence & Submissions Remaking

    9. In response to cross-examination the sponsor, Mr [D],  provided  the
       following additional evidence. His oldest  and  youngest  sons  live
       with him: his youngest is 17 years old and his oldest  is  21  years
       old. His youngest lives with him following being thrown out  by  his
       mother. The oldest is a window fitter and the youngest is a  trainee
       carpenter. His middle son is age 19 years and lives with his  mother
       and is a qualified car-sprayer earning a good income. The sponsor is
       still  financially  supporting  his  youngest  son.  He  pays  money
       regularly into his bank account which his son uses to maintain a car
       and he also pays for additional matters such as his  insurance.  His
       youngest son still attends college. He contends that his support  to
       his youngest child is very important as his children's mother  is  a
       drinker and gambler who lives on benefits, and who does not talk  to
       her son, their relationship having broken down. He believes his role
       is vital to provide an example  of  "making  a  go  of  life":   for
       instance he had given his youngest child the incentive to get a  job
       by offering him �200 if  he  did  this  and  this  had  worked.  His
       youngest child needs on-going emotional  support.  His  mother  just
       shouted at him and does not/ has not provided this. There is no  one
       else who could provide this support as his ex-wife's mother is  dead
       and her father a drunk, and his parents whilst  still  active  could
       not fairly be asked to take on a youngster having  worked  hard  all
       their lives and brought up four boys. His  eldest  child  could  not
       take on the task either as he and the youngest do not  get  on,  and
       fight if he is not there so keep the peace.

   10. The two older boys received some financial assistance from him  from
       time to time but are emotionally self-sufficient.

   11. The sponsor also added that he wished to remain in the UK due to his
       contact with his parents who are 77 years old, and with whom he  has
       daily contact via phone as well as visits.

   12. The sponsor is in on-going contact with the claimant in Thailand. He
       visits for a month between 14th December and 16th January each year;
       talks via Skype every morning between 6am and 7.30am; and phones her
       between 2 and 3pm. He does not speak Thai and all  communication  is
       in English, which she is fluent in both spoken and written.

   13. The sponsor said that the only work he could imagine being  possible
       for him to do in Thailand was running a bar. This was the only  work
       he had seen done by non-Thai people. He did not want to  run  a  bar
       and did not really drink. Apart from the issues  of  the  heat;  the
       very low pay he felt he could not work as a builder also because the
       building techniques were not the same in Thailand. He had  also  not
       managed to learn Thai beyond a few greetings.

   14. The sponsor did not know what he would do if the  claimant  was  not
       allowed to come to the UK. He believed he should be allowed to bring
       the claimant to the UK, particularly as he wished to continue living
       in this country due to his children and parents, and the  fact  that
       the claimant had no living parents to care for in Thailand. He  felt
       he had been treated unfairly as if he had done something  wrong.  He
       worked very hard and was bringing up his three boys  and  wanted  to
       see/ speak to his parents every day. He  had  no  wish  to  live  in
       Thailand.

   15. Ms Fijiwala submitted that there was no challenge to the Immigration
       Rules  having  been  met.   She   submitted   that   no   compelling
       circumstances had been shown  which  warranted  the  claimant  being
       given preferential treatment to others in accordance with SS (Congo)
       and that the claimant's wife was able to make a new  application  if
       she so wished. She accepted that given what  was  said  in  the  ECM
       review it was paragraph 53 of SS (Congo) that was relevant,  to  the
       weight to be given to the failure of the claimant to  meet  all  the
       evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE.  She  did  not  accept
       that any inequality had been done to the claimant due to the  delays
       in decision-making at the Embassy. She said that the sponsor had not
       investigated sufficiently to show he  could  not  be  a  builder  in
       Thailand. She accepted that the sponsor had a minor son  in  the  UK
       for whom he provided support but argued that the  sponsor's  parents
       who were fit and well could provide this for him. Given  the  weight
       to be given to immigration control the appeal should be dismissed.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   16. The respondent argues that the decision errs in law for  failure  to
       follow  SS  (Congo)  and  to  take  into  consider  s.117B  of   the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal does not mention SS (Congo) by name.  To  follow
       the decision, given that it is accepted by all that  the  evidential
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE are not in part met,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal must show that "compelling circumstances" exist  justifying
       a grant of LTE, see paragraph 51 of SS (Congo). However  it  is,  at
       this stage, important to note that only one of the two  reasons  set
       out in SS  (Congo),  for  requiring  such  compelling  circumstances
       applies in this case. The ECM has stated  explicitly  on  16th  July
       2015 that "the financial requirements are conceded" and that  "I  am
       now satisfied that the sponsor's income exceeds the threshold of the
       financial requirements". Thus there can be no issue  of  the  public
       interest in the claimant being a burden on public resources  as  set
       out at paragraph 52 of SS  (Congo),  and  the  requirement  to  show
       "compelling circumstances" is therefore required  solely  to  ensure
       everyone applying is treated "equally and fairly in relation to  the
       evidential requirements" as set out at paragraph 53.

   17. With respect to "compelling circumstances" the First-tier  Tribunal,
       when considering  the  proportionality  of  refusing  to  admit  the
       claimant, clearly found  that  family  life  could  not  take  place
       permanently in Thailand due to  the  business  that  the  claimant's
       husband/ sponsor (who is a self-employed builder) working in the UK,
       and the fact that  this  "relies  on  his  being  in  the  UK",  see
       paragraphs 41 and 43 of the decision.

   18. The First-tier  Tribunal  also  found  that  issues  of  delay  were
       relevant.  The Tribunal considered that the weight to  be  given  to
       immigration control was lessened by the fact that the  Secretary  of
       State had put the claimant's decision on hold for a year, preventing
       her appealing and progressing her case, due to the case of  MM  even
       though her case was not one which was  to  be  refused  due  to  the
       sponsor  having  insufficient  income.  Indeed  the  sponsor  earned
       �37,000 per annum, and this was accepted by the Secretary of  State,
       see paragraphs 38 -40 of the decision.

   19. The First-tier Tribunal made explicit reference  to  s.117B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 at paragraphs 31 and 36
       of the decision. The First-tier Tribunal explicitly gives weight  to
       the public interest in immigration control at paragraph  43  of  the
       decision. There is no reference to the claimant's  English  language
       skills but these are conceded in the decision by  the  Secretary  of
       State, and it is accepted by the Secretary of State  also  that  she
       meets the Immigration Rules with respect to financial support. I  do
       not therefore find that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by
       failure to consider s.117B of the 2002 Act.

   20. The only issue that remains is therefore whether the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal to find  the  Secretary  of  State's  delay  and
       inability of the sponsor to relocate to Thailand  due  to  his  work
       commitments constituted "compelling circumstances" is irrational, or
       whether the decision is insufficiently reasoned on this point.

   21. On consideration of all the facts I do not find that the  First-tier
       Tribunal errs in  law  as  contended  by  the  Secretary  of  State.
       However, even if I am wrong and I were to remake the appeal,  taking
       into account the evidence and submissions on remaking I  would  have
       reached the same conclusion as  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  At  this
       point it is important to note that I find  the  sponsor  a  credible
       witness, who gave very balanced and fair  evidence  -  for  instance
       immediately conceding the emotionally and financial independence  of
       his older sons.

   22. There clearly are very good reasons why the British citizen  sponsor
       who has worked as a self-employed builder all of  his  working  life
       could not make a living doing the same work in  Thailand:  the  very
       low pay, for him intolerable heat, his lack  of  Thai  language  and
       lack of applicability of his particular building skills. In addition
       he has an on-going and very important fathering role to his youngest
       minor son, who does not have a functional mother to turn to and  who
       has  needed  the  sponsor's  input  to  be   motivated   to   engage
       constructively with education and training. I do not find this is  a
       task that would be taken on by the sponsor's 77 year old parents  or
       his son's older brother. In addition the sponsor has a daily contact
       commitment to his elderly if well parents. I find that all of  these
       matters provide compelling circumstances which mean  that  it  would
       not be proportionate for the sponsor to be required to  have  family
       life with his wife abroad in  the  context  of  it  being  unusually
       accepted by the  respondent  despite  the  absence  of  all  of  the
       required evidence that the  necessary  financial  requirements  were
       met, along with all other substantive requirements.

   23. The presence of these compelling  matters  combined  with  a  public
       interest which consists of simply, but importantly, of  an  interest
       in treating all equally and fairly with respect  to  the  evidential
       requirements but where the claimant has been  subject  to  a  year's
       unfair delay by the Secretary of State placing her case on hold  for
       the hearing of a case in the Court of Appeal  which  focused  on  an
       issue for which she was not refused can properly  be  said  to  make
       that refusal of entry clearance a disproportionate interference with
       the claimant and sponsor's right to respect for their family life.

          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      the making of an error on a point of law.

   2. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  under
      Article 8 ECHR is upheld.
