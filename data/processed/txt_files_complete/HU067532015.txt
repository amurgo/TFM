Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Lemer, Counsel instructed by Lupins Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The  appellant  applied  for  permission   to   appeal   against   the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Parkes  who  dismissed  his
    appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse his application  for
    entry clearance.  That decision was taken on 2nd September  2015.   The
    appellant made an application for entry clearance  as  a  spouse.   The
    grounds were as follows.




    Ground (i)

    The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the appellant was  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with the  sponsor  who  is  a  national  of
    Kazakhstan.  The sponsor was able to maintain the appellant and met the
    substantive requirements of Appendix FM.  The focus of the decision was
    on Article 8.  It was contended that the judge erred in his approach to
    the burden of proof and reference was made to AB (Jamaica) [2007]  EWCA
    Civ 1302 specifically at paragraphs 7  and  31.   At  paragraph  31  it
    stated:

         "31. The  breach  of  immigration  control  involved  no  fraud  or
             concealment was not  protracted  and  was  owned  up  to.  The
             marriage was genuine, subsists and provides a family not  only
             for Mr and Mrs Brown but for  her  two  adolescent  girls  now
             settled here. Mr Brown is here not by leave but by right,  was
             born here, has work and  housing  here  and,  so  far  as  the
             evidence goes, has neither  lived  nor  has  accessible  roots
             anywhere else. If, as is accepted, the obligation  under  art.
             8(2) rested  on  the  Home  Secretary  to  show  that  it  was
             proportionate to expect him to  emigrate  to  Jamaica   if  he
             wanted to  preserve  his  marriage,  not  only  was  there  no
             evidence about the availability of work  or  accommodation  in
             Jamaica but, when offered the  opportunity,  the  Home  Office
             presenting officer declined to  ask  Mr  Brown  any  questions
             about this or anything else.".

    In effect the judge erred in his approach to the burden of  proof.   So
    far as there was a burden of proof in relation  to  proportionality  it
    rested with the Secretary of State. If there was a paucity of  evidence
    that did not matter if the burden was on the Home Office under  Article
    8(2).

    Ground (ii)

    The judge legally erred in his failure to take  into  account  relevant
    factors when exercising discretion.  The Tribunal erred  in  concluding
    in relation to paragraph 320(11) HC 395 as amended, that to exclude the
    appellant  from  the  United  Kingdom  ,  would   not   amount   to   a
    disproportionate breach of Article 8.  There was a failure to take into
    account material factors.  Specifically at paragraph 17 the  judge  had
    concluded:

         "17.     The parties  would  prefer  to  live  in  the  UK  as  the
             alternatives in Kazakhstan and Albania are not, for  a  number
             of reasons, preferable although there is no evidence that they
             could not live in  either  of  those  two  countries  or  that
             relocation would be  unduly  harsh  or  that  there  would  be
             insurmountable obstacles to their doing so".

    The sponsor's witness statement had expressly set out very  significant
    difficulties arising from proposed relocation.  There was an absence of
    suitable accommodation and a lack of any  employment  opportunities  in
    Albania.  There was a failure to make reference to  these  matters  and
    whilst the decision concluded that relocation would be  neither  unduly
    harsh nor give rise to insurmountable obstacles there was no  reference
    to the accommodation or employment.  The judge merely concluded at [19]
    to [20] that the simple act of making an application  was  insufficient
    to 'wipe the slate clean in every case' and that there was 'an  element
    of deterrence' in the case.

 2. The appellant did not seek to argue  that  merely  leaving  the  United
    Kingdom in an attempt to regularise his status should be sufficient  to
    require discretion to be exercised in his favour.  It was noted however
    that the judge accepted that the refusal of entry clearance  could  not
    be maintained indefinitely and that at some point, continued  exclusion
    would be unlawful.  The appellant had been separated from his wife  for
    19 months. No reference was made to the period of separation which  was
    in excess of nineteen months.  It was  incumbent  on  the  Tribunal  to
    consider  whether  the  19  month  period  was  sufficient  period   of
    separation, the appellant did not seek to argue that merely leaving the
    UK was sufficient to require discretion to be exercised in  his  favour
    but, if the period of separation was insufficient the judge should have
    given reasons.

The Hearing

 3. Mr Lemer emphasised the points made in the grounds  and  advanced  that
    the result was that the reversal of the burden of  proof  did  have  an
    effect and made a difference to the conclusions of the judge.

 4. With reference  to  ground  (ii)  Mr  Lemer  specifically  referred  to
    paragraph 17 where the judge states:

         "17.     There is no dispute  that  the  marriage  is  genuine  and
             subsisting or that the Sponsor  can  afford  to  maintain  the
             Appellant in the UK and that the requirements of  Appendix  FM
             were met in the application.  The parties would prefer to live
             in the UK as the alternatives in Kazakhstan  and  Albania  are
             not, for a number of reasons, preferable although there is  no
             evidence that they could not  live  in  either  of  those  two
             countries or that relocation would be  unduly  harsh  or  that
             there would be insurmountable obstacles to their doing so".

 5. Mr Lemer also referred me to the relevant  paragraphs  in  the  witness
    statement of the sponsor.  Particularly at  paragraph  11,  she  states
    that she travelled to Albania and to the house of  his  family  in  the
    village which was one bedroomed, in the mountain and in the  middle  of
    nowhere.  She noted that she felt very uncomfortable at  the  time  and
    felt sorry for his family because they lived in poverty.  At  paragraph
    16, as Mr Lemer pointed out in the sponsor's statement, she stated  the
    following:

         "16.     It is therefore impossible to live  in  Albania  with  the
             current unemployment rate we would not be able to  secure  any
             jobs.  I have been living in the UK for approximately 10 years
             and I have a established job.   I  have  been  in  my  current
             employment for 10 years and earn around ï¿½37000 per  annum.   I
             get paid accommodation allowance on the  top  as  the  company
             pays for my rent.  I won't be able to  have  this  opportunity
             anywhere else.  I also believe that UK has become my home  and
             I want to spend my life here with my husband.   We  have  made
             many friends and had a good circle when we married.

         17.      I become very depressed when this application was refused,
             as I was left lonely and also developed some health issues.  I
             wanted Albert to come soon so that we can start a  family.   I
             want to have a child but it is not possible  to  commit  to  a
             child when the father is not around.  I want my child to  have
             both parents around him.  When we  married  we  could  have  a
             child but we made a decision not to because he had  no  status
             and I was the only bread winner  of  the  family,  I  couldn't
             afford to go on maternity".

 6. Mr Lemer pointed out that the judge's approach to the burden  of  proof
    resulted in him omitting consideration of relevant aspects of the  case
    put by the appellant and sponsor.

 7. A further issue which was very relevant was the length of separation in
    the matter.  At this point the judge  acknowledged  that  there  was  a
    point after which it would  become  proportionate  but  the  judge  had
    nowhere made any reference to the length of the separation,  which  was
    nineteen months at the date of decision but had  increased  now  to  27
    months.

 8. AB (Jamaica) confirmed that the  burden  of  proof  in  proportionality
    rested with the Secretary of State and that had  been  acknowledged  in
    the Rule 24 response.

 9. On reflection Mr Nath submitted that the point was not straightforward,
    and not as straightforward as set out in the Rule 24  response  and  it
    was for the appellant to provide some evidence.

10. Mr Lemer rejoined that in AB (Jamaica) the  point  was  that  the  Home
    Office failed to cross-examine on the point of  evidence  but  in  this
    instance it was clear in the witness statement that there were specific
    difficulties to the appellant returning to Albania but the judge simply
    missed it.  The Secretary of  State  declined  to  pursue  the  matter.
    There was no engagement with the sponsor's evidence  and  the  approach
    the judge took would have made a difference.   It  was  not  inevitable
    having taken into account relevant factors that the result would be the
    same.

11. I was also referred to PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion:  care  needed)
    India [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC) and the care that needed  to  be  taken  in
    relation to such matters.  The head note reads as follows:

         "In exercising discretion under paragraph 320(11)  of  HC  395,  as
         amended, to refuse an application for entry  clearance  in  a  case
         where the automatic prohibition on the grant of entry clearance  in
         paragraph 320(7B) is disapplied by paragraph 320(7C), the  decision
         maker  must  exercise  great  care  in  assessing  the  aggravating
         circumstances said to justify refusal and must have regard  to  the
         public interest in encouraging those  unlawfully  in  the  United
         Kingdom to  leave  and  seek  to  regularise  their  status  by  an
         application for entry clearance".

12. In response Mr Nath pointed out that the judge had highlighted the very
    poor immigration history of the appellant and the judge at paragraph 17
    had given and made an opinion on the option of the alternative  of  the
    appellant living in either Albania or Kazakhstan.



Conclusions

13. At paragraph 2 the First-tier Tribunal Judge stated

           'In this appeal the burden of proof lies on the  appellant.   In
           order to succeed the appellant must show that on  a  balance  of
           probabilities that  the  decision  involves  a  disproportionate
           breach of human rights.

14. I was referred, by way of contrast, to paragraph 7 of  AB  (Jamaica)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ  1302  which
    reads:

         "7.      Secondly, however, the onus  which  ï¿½5(b)  of  the  policy
             places on the settled spouse to demonstrate undue hardship has
             no analogue in art. 8(2). The proportionality of a prima facie
             breach of the Convention right is to be gauged objectively  on
             whatever evidence is available. So far as there is a burden of
             proof in relation to proportionality,  counsel  for  the  Home
             Secretary accepts that it rests on the state".

    I note that the proportionality, as stated by Mr Justice Sedley, should
    be gauged objectively on what evidence is available.

15. As in Huang [2007] UKHL 11 at paragraph 20:

         "20.     In an article 8 case where this question is  reached,  the
             ultimate question for the appellate immigration  authority  is
             whether  the  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  or   remain,   in
             circumstances where the life of the family  cannot  reasonably
             be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full  account  of
             all  considerations  weighing  in  favour  of   the   refusal,
             prejudices the family  life  of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
             sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental
             right protected by article 8. If the answer to  this  question
             is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must
             so decide. It is not necessary that the appellate  immigration
             authority, directing itself along the lines indicated in  this
             opinion, need ask in addition whether the case meets a test of
             exceptionality. The suggestion that it should is based  on  an
             observation of Lord Bingham in Razgar above, para 20.  He  was
             there expressing an expectation, shared with  the  Immigration
             Appeal Tribunal, that the number of claimants not  covered  by
             the Rules and supplementary directions but entitled to succeed
             under article 8 would be a very small minority. That is  still
             his expectation. But he was not purporting to lay down a legal
             test."

    The exercise rather than attributing burden of  proof  emphasises  that
    there is a need to balance the interests of society with those  of  the
    individuals  and  groups.   Indeed  Huang  quoted  Razgar  specifically
    paragraph 20 and that the judgment on proportionality:

         "Must always involve the striking of a  fair  balance  between  the
         rights of the individual and the interests of the  community  which
         is inherent in the whole  of  the  Convention.   The  severity  and
         consequences of the interference would call for careful  assessment
         at this stage".

16. In the light of the above it would appear that the overall exercise  is
    one of viewing the evidence objectively and 'striking a fair  balance',
    but even if the approach in AB (Jamaica) is correct, although I  accept
    that in his opening remarks the judge may have erred in his  assessment
    of the approach to justifying the decision, it  would  appear  that  at
    [15] he was aware that the  'issue  is  whether,  at  this  stage,  the
    appellant's continued exclusions is proportionate' and indeed  at  [16]
    the judge reasons

           'The more  serious  the  dishonesty  and  length  of  its  being
           maintained   are   clearly   relevant   issues   in    assessing
           proportionality of an Appellant's exclusion.  The  more  serious
           the efforts to undermine the system  and  the  longer  that  the
           pretence is maintained the greater  the  justification  for  the
           exclusion of the appellant for a longer period'

17. It would thus appear from  a  careful  reading  of  the  decision  that
    despite the injunction at the outset of the decision, that in  practice
    the judge the facts in the light of 'justification for  the  exclusion'
    rather than the appellant justifying the decision.

18. As the Rule 24 response from the Home Office stated,  "it  is  accepted
    that the appellant did not bear the burden in terms of  the  Article  8
    assessment".  That statement is a relatively opaque statement and  does
    not detract from the fact that it is for the party who proposes a  fact
    has to prove that fact on the balance of probabilities.  It may well be
    that the onus of demonstrating that proportionality is justified  rests
    with the Secretary of State but it is still  the  case  that  the  onus
    rests  with  the  appellant  on  the  balance   of   probabilities   to
    substantiate the points that are made and the facts to be made in their
    favour.  It is correct that the proportionality must  be  justified  on
    the part of the Secretary of State but the facts which should be  taken
    into account on the part of the appellant must be proved on the balance
    of probabilities, and indeed the positive fact  where  it  is  asserted
    should be the responsibility of the appellant to prove.

19.  Further,  an  important  difference  between  AB  (Jamaica)  and  this
    particular case are the facts.  At paragraph 31 in  AB  (Jamaica)  Lord
    Justice Sedley had this to say:

         "31.     The breach of immigration control  involved  no  fraud  or
             concealment, was not protracted  and  was  owned  up  to.  The
             marriage was genuine, subsists and provides a family not  only
             for Mr and Mrs Brown but for  her  two  adolescent  girls  now
             settled here. Mr Brown is here not by leave but by right,  was
             born here, has work and  housing  here  and,  so  far  as  the
             evidence goes, has neither  lived  nor  has  accessible  roots
             anywhere else. If, as is accepted, the obligation  under  art.
             8(2) rested  on  the  Home  Secretary  to  show  that  it  was
             proportionate to expect him  to  emigrate  to  Jamaica  if  he
             wanted to  preserve  his  marriage,  not  only  was  there  no
             evidence about the availability of work  or  accommodation  in
             Jamaica but, when offered the  opportunity,  the  Home  Office
             presenting officer declined to  ask  Mr  Brown  any  questions
             about this or anything else".

20. In that case the breach of immigration control  involved  no  fraud  or
    concealment.  It was  not  protracted  and  was  owned  up  to.   There
    appeared to be no question about the underlying facts of that case, and
    indeed the Home Office were offered the opportunity  to  cross  examine
    which was declined.  At paragraph 33 of AB  (Jamaica)  it  is  asserted
    that the paucity of evidence from the appellant of  potential  hardship
    did not matter if the burden was on the Home Office under Article  8(2)
    to show there was little or none.

21. With reference to ground (ii) in  this  case  the  appellant  had  been
    refused under the Immigration Rules (having met Appendix FM but refused
    under paragraph 320(11).  The judge found that there  was  no  evidence
    that  relocation  would  be  either  unduly  harsh  nor  give  rise  to
    insurmountable obstacles.  The judge was presented with the evidence in
    a witness statement from the appellant's sponsor  to  the  effect  that
    they could not relocate to Albania from whence the appellant  emanates.
    There was nothing in the witness statement to suggest that  they  could
    not return to Kazakhstan.

22. At paragraph 16 of the sponsor's witness statement she merely states:

         "16.     It is therefore impossible to live  in  Albania  with  the
             current unemployment rate we would not be able to  secure  any
             jobs.  I have been living in the UK for approximately 10 years
             and I have a (sic) established job".

23. What the judge had to say about the evidence of the sponsor is:

         "The parties would prefer to live in the UK as the alternatives  in
         Kazakhstan and Albania are not, for a number of reasons, preferable
         although there is no evidence that they could not live in either of
         those two countries or that relocation would  be  unduly  harsh  or
         that there would be insurmountable obstacles to their doing so".

24. Mr Lemer argued that the judge had failed  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence of the sponsor but the judge clearly referred at [17]  to  the
    "number of reasons" that had been cited by the appellant and I  am  not
    persuaded that the judge has failed to address the evidence.  He framed
    his response to the evidence of the sponsor in the alternative,  and  I
    note that  the  appellant's  case  was  that  she  retained  family  in
    Kazakhstan.  Indeed recorded at paragraph [12] is  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence that

           'with regard to Kazakhstan where the sponsor is from  originally
           she still has family there and goes for work  to  meet  clients.
           When she visits her employers pay for the flights.  There  would
           not be the opportunities there.  Asked  if  they  had  discussed
           what would happen if the appeal failed she paused and went on to
           say that it would be difficult'.

25. That does not reveal  the  same  difficulties  with  accommodation  and
    employment as set out in relation to Albania.  This was not  a  paucity
    of evidence or lack of cross examination but the sponsor  referring  to
    mere 'difficulties' in relocating to Kazakhstan not more.

26. The context of this appeal is that the judge was  obliged  to  consider
    the Article 8 claim taking into account the immigration history of  the
    appellant  and  the  appellant's  fulfilment  or   otherwise   of   the
    Immigration Rules.  The Secretary of State's  case,  and  justification
    for the decision, was made through  the  analysis  of  the  Immigration
    Rules which effectively sets out her position in relation to Article  8
    - or the justification for her decision thereof.

27. In relation to paragraph 320(11) I accept  that  it  was  found  in  PS
    (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India [2010] UKUT 440  that
    the  decision-maker  must  exercise  great  care   in   assessing   the
    aggravating circumstances said  to  justify  refusal,  and,  must  have
    regard to the public interest encouraging those unlawfully in the UK to
    seek leave to regularise their status.  It was argued  that  the  judge
    had failed to appreciate or spell out  the  length  of  time  that  the
    parties would be  parted,  but  the  judge  specifically  noted  PS  at
    paragraph 15 and noted that the issue at this  stage  was  whether  the
    appellant's continued exclusion was proportionate. The  judge  recorded
    the fact that the appellant had made a number of  applications  without
    success whilst in the UK and that he  had  left  the  UK  in  May  2015
    following his refusal of a spouse application.  There can be  no  doubt
    that the judge was aware of the length of separation of  the  appellant
    and sponsor.

28. As the judge pointed out, however, in paragraph 13 there were a  number
    of aggravating features referred to in the body of the  Rule  including
    absconding, the use  of  a  false  identity  or  identities,  and  make
    frivolous applications.  At [13] the judge spells out

         "13.     The situation that  the  Appellant  finds  himself  in  is
             entirely of his own making.  It is not surprising that the ECO
             took a dim view of his immigration history.  Paragraph 320(11)
             is not  mandatory  but  there  are  a  number  of  aggravating
             features referred  to  in  the  body  of  the  rule  including
             absconding, the use of a  false  identity  or  identities  and
             making frivolous applications.  The list is not  complete  and
             the making of a fraudulent asylum application would also be an
             aggravating feature.

         14.      His use of the Balkan conflict as  a  cover  for  economic
             migration whilst not unique is a  clear  abuse  of  a  process
             designed  to  assist  those  in  distress  and  in   need   of
             international protection.  It is clearly a  serious  piece  of
             dishonesty  on  his  part  which  he   maintained   for   some
             considerable period of time and even sought the benefit of the
             legacy programme under the false identity.  It appears that he
             was not honest with the Sponsor either to begin with  although
             that was corrected fairly early on  however  his  use  of  the
             false identity continued in his dealings with the Home  Office
             until 2014".

    As the judge pointed out the actions of the appellant

           "was a  serious  piece  of  dishonesty  on  his  part  which  he
           maintained for some considerable period and he even  sought  the
           benefit of the legacy programme under a false identity  and  was
           not even honest with the sponsor".

    The appellant made an application for asylum as a Kosovan when  he  was
    in fact Albanian and continued to use his false identity from  2001  to
    2014.  As the judge pointed out at paragraph 16

           "The more  serious  the  dishonesty  and  length  of  its  being
           maintained were factors which were clearly  relevant  issues  in
           assessing proportionality of an appellant's exclusion.  The more
           serious the efforts to undermine the system and the longer  that
           the pretence is maintained the greater the justification for the
           exclusion of the appellant for a longer period".

29. As the  judge  again  repeated  at  paragraph  19  the  application  of
    paragraph 320(11) must reflect "the seriousness of the behaviour of the
    appellant in his efforts to evade the controls that actually applied in
    the circumstances".

30. Although Mr Lemer centred on the sentence in the decision

          "I am not prepared that the simple of  act  leaving  to  make  an
          application is enough to effectively  wipe  the  slate  clean  in
          every case",

    it is not just that statement which supports the judge's reasoning  but
    also that he found the  appellant's  behaviour  and  dishonesty  to  be
    serious and long standing.  That finding is repeated at  paragraph  20,
    noting that the appellant could have rectified his position by  leaving
    "many years before he finally got round to doing so".  The  judge  also
    identified that the appellant's behaviour  was  at  the  "significantly
    more serious end of the scale of possibilities".  Finally, although the
    judge had noted at paragraph 2 that the burden of proof  lay  with  the
    appellant and was clearly incorrect in his approach that the balance of
    probabilities that the decision involved a disproportionate  breach  of
    human rights ultimately in the application made clear at paragraph 20

           "the  decision was justified and in the circumstances it  cannot
           be said that the exclusion of the Appellant is inappropriate  or
           that there are circumstances that would require his admission".

31. The judge had clearly set out the appellant's immigration  history  and
    was fully aware of the time that the appellant and his spouse had  been
    parted stating:

         "The appellant's immigration history was set out starting with  his
         illegal entry and false claim to asylum in a Kosovan  identity  and
         his remaining illegally following the refusal of his claim and  the
         dismissal of his appeal following his refusal to attend.  From 2010
         a number of applications had been made  without  success.   He  had
         left the  UK  in  May  2015  following  the  refusal  of  a  spouse
         application".

32. I am not persuaded  that  the  judge  must  give  further  reasons  for
    justifying a further period of separation.  What  it  is  important  to
    remember is that Section 117 must be taken into account in any  Article
    8 exercise and that includes commencing a relationship when it is known
    that the status of the appellant was  precarious.   That  includes  the
    development of a relationship through the case  of  Deelah  and  others
    (section 117B - ambit) [2015] UKUT 00515 (IAC)  and it is the case that
    the sponsor would have known that the appellant had entered  illegally,
    remained illegally and claimed asylum in a false name.

33. The judge effectively noted a number of  aggravating  features  in  the
    body of the Rule and which would appear to have been fulfilled  by  the
    appellant.  The appellant not only used a false identity, made numerous
    applications including a legacy application which the judge identified,
    but also  made  a  fraudulent  asylum  application  would  also  be  an
    aggravating feature.  The  appellant had also  absconded  between  2003
    and 2010, albeit that that was referred to obliquely by the judge.

34. On an overall reading of this decision I can accept that the  direction
    at paragraph 2 was possibly an error but the judge clearly  found  that
    the appellant's behaviour was at the significantly more serious end  of
    the scale of possibilities and that the sponsor knew of the appellant's
    immigration status when she developed the  relationship  with  him  and
    married him.  As such I am not persuaded that he judge needed  to  give
    further reasoning  to  justify  the  separation.  On  the  judge's  own
    findings which had taken into  account  the  relevant  factors,  on  an
    objective assessment of proportionality, the  Secretary  of  State  had
    justified her decision.

35. As such, I find there is no material error in the approach to Article 8
    and that the judge did take into account the relevant factors and  made
    adequate findings when considering the exercise of discretion.
