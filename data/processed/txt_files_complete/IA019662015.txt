                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, of Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                       Notification of no valid appeal

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McGavin, dismissing his appeal against  refusal  of  a  residence
    card as an extended family member under the "EEA Regulations".

 2. In light of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC),  the
    outcome of these proceedings is as follows.  The appellant had no right
    of appeal. The FtT had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and erred in
    law by purporting to do so. Its decision is  set  aside.  The  decision
    substituted is that there was no valid appeal before the FtT.
