                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals against a determination of Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Ford (the judge) promulgated on 7th February  2014.



 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Jamaica born 8th April  1975.   She
    entered the United Kingdom as a visitor on 4th November  2011,  with  a
    visa valid between 20th October 2011 and 20th April 2012.

 4. On 21st March 2012 the Claimant applied for  further  leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules, initially to care for her mother-in-law,
    and subsequently to provide care for her husband and sister-in-law.

 5. The application was refused on 10th May 2013, and a  decision  made  to
    refuse to vary leave to remain, and that the Claimant be  removed  from
    the United Kingdom.

 6. The application was considered with reference to  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the Secretary of State finding that the  application
    could not succeed because the Claimant was in the United Kingdom  as  a
    visitor, and therefore could not satisfy E-LTRP.2.1, which  meant  that
    she could not rely upon section EX.1.

 7. The Claimant's private life claim  was  considered  with  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE,  and  the  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  the
    Claimant could not satisfy any of the requirements of this paragraph as
    she had not lived in the  United  Kingdom  continuously  for  at  least
    twenty years, and it could not be said that she had no ties to Jamaica.



 8. The Secretary of State considered whether there were any  circumstances
    which would entitle the Claimant to be granted leave to remain  outside
    the rules.  It was noted that the Claimant's  mother-in-law  had  sadly
    passed away, and that her  husband,  who  is  a  British  citizen,  was
    suffering  with  back  pain  and  was  on  a   waiting   list   for   a
    microdiscectomy operation but it was noted that the  Claimant  and  her
    husband had previously lived in Jamaica,  and  it  was  felt  that  the
    couple could return to Jamaica  with  the  Claimant's  husband  briefly
    returning to the United Kingdom for his operation  when  required.   In
    relation to the Claimant's sister-in-law, it was not accepted that  she
    required a full-time carer, as it was noted that she was still in full-
    time employment.

 9. The Claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, and  her  appeal  was
    heard on 23rd January 2014.  The Claimant appeared  in  person  without
    legal representation.  The judge heard evidence from the Claimant,  her
    husband,  and  the  Claimant's  sister-in-law.   The  judge  found  the
    witnesses to be credible and allowed the appeal under section  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM, and with reference to  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention  on  Human  Rights  (the  1950   Convention)   outside   the
    Immigration Rules.

10. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In summary it was  contended  that  the  judge  had  made  a
    material misdirection of law, and reliance was placed  upon  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free  standing)  [2014]
    UKUT 00063 (IAC).

11. It was contended that the judge was wrong to  allow  the  appeal  under
    Section EX.1, because EX.1  was  not  free-standing,  and  because  the
    Claimant was a visitor, she was not entitled to rely upon EX.1.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  V
    A Osborne who found it arguable that the judge had erred  and  had  not
    taken into account Sabir, which is authority for the  proposition  that
    EX.1 is not a "stand alone" provision of the rules but a component part
    of the rules to be read in conjunction with  some  other  provision  of
    Appendix FM.

13. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law
    such that the decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

14. The Appellant attended the hearing together with her husband and sister-
    in-law.  She confirmed that she was not  legally  represented  and  was
    content to proceed without legal representation.

15. I explained to the Appellant the purpose of the hearing, in that I  had
    to decide whether the First-tier Tribunal had made a  mistake  of  law,
    and whether the determination needed to be set aside.  I confirmed  the
    independence of my role.

16.  The  Appellant  confirmed  that  she  had  seen  the  application  for
    permission to appeal, together with the grant of permission.

17. I then heard submissions from Mr McVeety who relied  upon  the  grounds
    contained within the application for permission to appeal.

18. I then heard from the Appellant, who asked me to uphold the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal, or in the alternative if  it  was  found  that
    there was an error of law, to remake the decision  so  that  she  could
    remain in the United Kingdom for the reasons that had been explained to
    the First-tier Tribunal and which are set out in that determination.

19. I decided to reserve my decision.  Mr McVeety and the Appellant  agreed
    that if it was necessary to set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the decision could be re-made without a further  hearing,  on
    the basis of the evidence that had been  presented  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

My Conclusions and Reasons

20. The Judge erred in finding that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  with
    reference to section EX.1 of Appendix FM.  The judge did not  have  the
    benefit of the guidance given in Sabir, which was not  published  until
    7th February 2014, and the judge prepared her decision on 31st  January
    2014.  It is clear that the Appellant was in the United  Kingdom  as  a
    visitor when she made her application for further leave to remain.  Her
    visa was valid until 20th April 2012, and she made her application  for
    further leave to remain on 21st March 2012.

21. Sabir confirms that EX.1 is not a stand alone provision.  The head note
    to Sabir is set out below;

    It is plain from the architecture of the Rules as regards partners that
    EX.1 is "parasitic" on  the  relevant  Rule  within  Appendix  FM  that
    otherwise grants leave to remain.  If EX.1 was intended to be  a  free-
    standing element some mechanism of identification would have been used.
     The structure of the Rules as presently drafted requires it  to  be  a
    component part of the leave granting Rule.  This is now made  plain  by
    the Respondent's guidance dated October 2013.

22. Section R-LTRP sets out the requirements for limited leave to remain as
    a partner and requires that an applicant must either  satisfy  all  the
    requirements of E-LTRP or meet the requirements of E-LTRP.1.2-1.12  and
    E-LTRP.2.1 and section EX.1 must apply.

23. In this case the Appellant could not satisfy all of the requirements of
    E-LTRP, as this would include the financial requirements, which  it  is
    accepted could not be satisfied by the Appellant and her  husband.   It
    is also the case that the Appellant cannot satisfy E-LTRP.2.1 (which is
    set out below) because at the time she made her application  for  leave
    to remain she was in the United Kingdom as a visitor;

    E-LTRP.2.1    The applicant must not be in the UK -

                (a)    as a visitor;

                (b)    with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months  or
                    less, unless that leave is as a  fiancï¿½(e)  or  proposed
                    civil partner; or

                (c)    on temporary admission.

24. Therefore the judge  materially  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    Respondent should have granted the Appellant's application under  EX.1,
    and erred in allowing the appeal on that basis.  The  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal that the appeal succeeds under EX.1 is set aside.

25. However the judge also allowed the appeal with reference to  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.  This decision has not  been  challenged
    by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The  grounds  contained   within   the
    application for permission contend  that  the  judge  made  a  material
    misdirection of law by allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
     Reference is made to paragraph 50 of the determination  in  which  the
    judge records that the application should have been allowed under EX.1.
     There  is  no  reference  in  the  grounds  to  paragraph  51  of  the
    determination in which the judge finds that  exceptional  circumstances
    exist  which  warrant  the  application  being  allowed   outside   the
    Immigration Rules.  In making the finding that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed with reference to  Article  8  outside  the  rules,  the  judge
    considered and set out earlier in the determination (paragraphs  14-18)
    the Secretary of State's guidance on  "exceptional  circumstances"  and
    the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in Gulshan [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC).

26. In my view the judge correctly considered the guidance and case law and
    was entitled to conclude that exceptional circumstances existed in this
    case, and in the absence of any challenge, those findings stand.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
Immigration Rules was wrong in law and is set aside.  I substitute  a  fresh
decision dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appeal  is  allowed  on
Article 8 grounds outside  the  Immigration  Rules  is  not  set  aside  and
stands.  The Claimant's appeal is therefore allowed  on  Article  8  grounds
outside the rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.

To the Respondent
Fee Award

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules  but  allowed  on  human
rights grounds.  The First-tier Tribunal had the benefit  of  oral  evidence
that was not before the decision maker.  There is no fee award.
