                            DECISION AND REASONS

     This is an appeal by a citizen of Nigeria, born in  1979,  against  the
    decision of Judge Martin Loughridge, made at Newport without a  hearing
    on 24 April.  The appeal was against refusal of a residence card on the
    basis of a retained right of  residence  from  the  appellant's  former
    marriage. As the necessary evidence  to  show  he  would  have  been  a
    'qualified person' did not seem to be before the judge, the appeal  was
    dismissed.

2.    In fact, though the judge was not to know of this,  proof  of  posting
    of the appellant's bundle was supplied on the  permission  application,
    which showed that it had been posted on 26 February, one day inside the
    period given in the directions from the Tribunal.  The bundle  was  not
    on the file, but has now been filed by Mr Ikegwuruka. It is accepted by
    Mr Walker for the Home  Office  that  something  went  wrong,  and  the
    decision must be set aside: the case  will  come  back  before  another
    judge.  Since the papers are now  filed,  that  again  can  take  place
    without a hearing, unless the appellant applies for one, in which  case
    it should be granted without payment of any extra fee.
