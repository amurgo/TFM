                       Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born in  1983.   She  appeals
    with permission[1] the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    O'Malley) dated 2nd November 2016 to dismiss her  appeal[2]  on  asylum
    and human rights grounds.


    Anonymity Order

 2. This case concerns  a  claim  for  international  protection  involving
    allegations of sexual violence. Having had regard to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim to international protection  was  as
    follows.   Before she left Bangladesh to study in the United Kingdom  a
    neighbour named Alamgir Hussain had determined that  he  was  going  to
    marry her.  When rebuffed he subjected both Appellant and her family to
    a campaign of harassment.  This man is of bad  character,  having  been
    arrested on  several  occasions  by  the  Bangladeshi  police.  He  has
    connections to the Awami League.  The  Appellant  describes  him  as  a
    "gangster". In August 2013 he kidnapped the Appellant.   She was  taken
    to an unknown location where she was repeatedly injected  with  a  drug
    which made her lose consciousness. Alamgir Hussain  sexually  assaulted
    her. He forced her to take part in a marriage ceremony. His  associates
    caught the Appellant speaking on the telephone to her sister  and  beat
    her so that  her  sister  could  hear.  They  demanded  money  for  the
    Appellant's release. After eight days the Appellant was rescued by  the
    police who arrested Alamgir.  The Appellant  suffered  from  depression
    and mental health problems.  She was unable as  a  result  to  properly
    take part in the prosecution of Alamgir and in October 2013 he  managed
    to get released on bail.  In the weeks that followed  he  accosted  the
    Appellant and her father whilst they were travelling in a rickshaw.  He
    threatened them and told them that she had to withdraw from  the  court
    case against him otherwise she would be killed.  In  January  2014  the
    Appellant and her  family  attended  court  to  demand  the  arrest  of
    Alamgir. Two days after this armed men stormed the family  home,  stole
    valuables and the Appellant was kidnapped  for  a  second  time.    The
    Appellant was again injected with a drug and Alamgir  repeatedly  raped
    her.  He told her that if she participated in the prosecution he  would
    kill her parents.  On the 9th March 2014 there  was  a  court  hearing.
    Alamgir's associates took the Appellant to court  where  the  Appellant
    told the court that she did not wish to proceed with  the  prosecution.
    After the hearing she was taken to a house about 10 minutes drive  away
    from the court. There she managed  to  escape  through  a  window.  She
    injured her foot in the escape and has suffered  problems  since  then.
    The Appellant's family managed to arrange for her to come to the United
    Kingdom to study in order to get away from  Alamgir.   She  arrived  in
    this country in May 2014 and only claimed asylum in October 2014  after
    her college had its Tier 4 licence revoked and she faced  removal.  The
    Appellant avers that Alamgir is free in Bangladesh, well connected  and
    resourceful, continues to subject her family to harassment and that  he
    would kill her or otherwise do her harm if  she  were  to  be  returned
    there.


 4. The Respondent refused the claim on the 27th October 2014.   She  noted
    that the Appellant had submitted various documents as corroboration  of
    her claim, and that these were to be  viewed  in  the  round  with  the
    remaining  evidence  per  Tanveer  Ahmed  principles.   The   remaining
    evidence was not found to be credible. The  Respondent  found  numerous
    discrepancies and implausibilities in the account  given.  Further  the
    Respondent considered that the claim failed because the Appellant could
    obtain a sufficient level of protection by the Bangladeshi  authorities
    who on the Appellant's own account had clearly taken steps to apprehend
    and prosecute Alamgir.  The  documents  were  rejected  as  unreliable.
    Alternatively she and her family could  relocate  to  another  part  of
    Bangladesh if they were afraid of a criminal  in  their  locality.   In
    short the risk was not proven, and if it did exist the Appellant  could
    avail  herself  of  internal  flight  and/or  the  protection  of   the
    Bangladeshi authorities.

 5. When the matter came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellant
    relied on her own oral evidence as well as a fifteen documents she  had
    produced  from  Bangladesh.  These  included  two  'First   Information
    Reports' (FIRs) purportedly lodged at Shahporan police station, Sylhet,
    and an arrest warrant  allegedly  issued  at  the  same  station.   The
    Respondent relied on her refusal letter, and a  'document  verification
    report' (DVR) dated 11th April 2016 which related to one of  the  FIRs.
    This report explained that on the 31st March 2016  two  officials  from
    the British High Commission visited Shahporan police station to enquire
    about FIR 07/88 and dated 11th August  2013.  They  were  told  by  the
    officer on duty that the record book showed that no FIRs were lodged on
    the 11th August 2013. The officials concluded that the FIR in  question
    was non-genuine.

 6. In its conclusions the Tribunal was prepared  to  accept  that  Alamgir
    exists, is relatively uneducated, lives in the Appellant's home village
    and has some connection to the Awami League [at �92-92].  It  was  also
    accepted that he and the Appellant were at one time married  [at  �93].
    As to the documentary evidence the determination  recognises  that  the
    DVR was not helpful since the officials from the  High  Commission  had
    checked the wrong date - the FIR purported to have been issued  on  the
    12th, not the 11th August [at  �116].  Beyond  these  findings  in  the
    Appellant's  favour  the  Tribunal  was  not  prepared  to  accept  the
    remainder of the account. It found there to be errors,  inconsistencies
    and exaggerations that must "fall at the feet of  the  Appellant".  The
    Appellant was now married to another man in the United Kingdom so there
    was no question of  her  having  to  relocate  as  a  'lone  woman'  in
    Bangladesh.  It considered the documents in the round in light  of  the
    generally adverse credibility findings that it reached,  and  dismissed
    the appeal.


 7. The Appellant now appeals on the following grounds:

              i) The Tribunal failed to give reasons;


             ii) The Tribunal failed to take material evidence into account;


            iii) The Tribunal misdirected itself as to the evidence/made
                 mistakes of fact.


 8. For the Respondent Mr Kotas defended the decision.  He  submitted  that
    the decision was careful and fair, and open  to  the  Tribunal  on  the
    evidence before it. He took issue with some of the  factual  assertions
    made in the grounds and pointed out  that  notwithstanding  any  errors
    that the Tribunal might have made,  the  findings  on  internal  flight
    stood: the appeal would in any event fall to be dismissed.




    Discussion and Findings


 9. The central thrust of the Appellant's appeal  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to give her case the anxious scrutiny that it deserved.
      It is submitted that the cumulative weight of the errors of  law  are
    such that they must be material and that the decision must be set aside
    as a result.


10. In his submissions Mr Seelhoff identified a number of adverse  findings
    where, he said,   there  was  a  failure  to  give  reasons  for  those
    findings. For instance:

            . The rejection [at �110] of "a  number  of  documents  dealing
              with complaints against Alamgir": "I am not satisfied that it
              is appropriate to put any significant weight on  these  court
              documents"


            . The rejection [at �113] of a letter  from  the  Human  Rights
              Development Association of Bangladesh: "I  am  not  satisfied
              that the letter is genuine or represents the  true  state  of
              any actions in Bangladesh relating to the Appellant"

            . The finding [at �123] that it  is  not  "credible"  that  the
              Appellant would be held in the circumstances  she  describes,
              or be taken to a Magistrates court after her rescue

            . The finding [at �124] that the Tribunal is not satisfied that
              Alamgir and his gang would be able to obtain drugs to  effect
              the Appellant's consciousness

11. I find that this ground must be made out. In respect of the documentary
    evidence there is a paucity of reasoning.   One  of  the  documents,  a
    letter from an advocate said to be engaged by the  Appellant's  family,
    is rejected on the grounds that there is no explanation  as  to  why  a
    letter from a lawyer would be  written  in  English.    This  does  not
    however appear to be advanced as a reason why any of the  other  items,
    for instance those mentioned at  paragraphs  110  and  113,  should  be
    rejected as non-genuine.    I  can  find  no  reasons  at  all  in  the
    determination to support the decision not to place  appropriate  weight
    on these documents.  I would also note that the reason given in respect
    of the lawyer's letter would appear to overlook the fact that the legal
    system in Bangladesh is largely administered in the English language.


12. As to the Appellant's own  evidence  and  the  matters  highlighted  at
    paragraphs 123-124 I would have to  agree  that  there  is  a  complete
    absence of reasoning. The words "I do not find her testimony  credible"
    and "I am not satisfied" amount to findings, not reasons for them.

13. Mr Kotas points to the general conclusion that there  were  significant
    discrepancies  in  the  Appellant's  account.  He  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal does not have to give reasons for each and every  finding  and
    that  the  broad  thrust  of  the  conclusions  is  evident  from   the
    determination read as a whole.  I  have  given  consideration  to  that
    submission and have looked closely at the determination. Having done so
    I am unable to find any reasoned findings for the conclusion  that  the
    account is inconsistent and exaggerated.

14. The credibility findings in this appeal were central  to  the  outcome.
    Although the appeal may ultimately fail on grounds of 'internal flight'
    or sufficiency of protection, those  matters  could  only  properly  be
    decided once clear reasoned findings had been made on the nature of the
    risk emanating from Alamgir.  I am satisfied that the lack  of  reasons
    is an error  that  pervades  the  decision  and  that  the  credibility
    findings taken as a whole must be set aside.

15. It follows that the remaining grounds need  not  be  addressed  in  any
    great detail.  I accept that  there  does  appear  to  have  been  some
    confusion on the part of the Tribunal about  certain  factual  matters,
    for instance as to whether the Appellant had sought to resile from some
    of her documentary evidence.  This supports the Appellant's  contention
    that the decision in the appeal needs to be remade.   I  would  however
    record that I entirely reject Mr Seelhoff's proposition that the second
    FIR and arrest warrant had  to  be  accepted  as  genuine  because  the
    Respondent has not produced a  negative  DVR  to  discredit  them.  The
    argument ran as follows. Three documents  were  produced  all  said  to
    emanate from Shahporan  police  station.  Only  one  was  checked.  Any
    competent officers would have checked all three.  It  can  be  inferred
    from the absence of a negative DVR on those other  two  documents  that
    they are in  fact  genuine.    This  argument  is  fallacious  for  the
    following reasons. First, there is no evidence at all to  suggest  that
    the Respondent's agents on the ground did in fact seek  to  verify  the
    second FIR or the arrest warrant. There may be any  number  of  reasons
    for that. The  most  obvious  is  that  they  did  not  bother,  having
    established (to their satisfaction at least) that  the  first  FIR  was
    fake.  Second, there is on the Respondent a general duty of candour and
    she can be expected to act with  probity  in  proceedings  before  this
    Tribunal. Absent any evidence of bad faith the Tribunal cannot  proceed
    on the basis that the Secretary of State has deliberately contrived  to
    conceal evidence  supportive  of  the  Appellant's  case.   Third,  the
    Secretary of State is under no obligation to make out  the  Appellant's
    case for her: even if the officers were lazy or incompetent and did not
    ask about the other documents this does not obviate the  need  for  the
    Tribunal to conduct a reasoned Tanveer Ahmed assessment of them.




    Decisions


16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside in its entirety.


17. Due to the extent of fact finding required the  appropriate  forum  for
    the remaking of the decision in this appeal is the First-tier Tribunal.


18. There is an order for anonymity.
