                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a  Somali  national  presently  living  in  Kenya.  He
    married his sponsor, Mrs Sacdiya Awaeys Noor, in Kenya on 6  May  2013.
    She is originally from Somalia and holds British citizenship.  She  was
    previously married and has five children.  She obtained  a  divorce  in
    Kenya on 10 August 2012.

 2. He applied for entry clearance to join his sponsor. The application was
    considered under appendix FM of the immigration rules and  was  refused
    on 14 November 2013.

 3. His sponsor is reliant upon State benefits and the bulk of  the  family
    income relates to payments in respect of her children. She  has  a  son
    who has a disability. He receives Disability Living Allowance  and  the
    sponsor receives Carer's Allowance.

 4. The entry clearance officer was not satisfied the sponsor  was  legally
    divorced and therefore free to marry. Furthermore, it was not  accepted
    that the relationship was genuine, subsisting and the parties  intended
    to live together permanently in the United Kingdom.

 5. The application  was  also  refused  on  the  basis  it  had  not  been
    established  that  the  family  could  be  adequately  maintained   and
    accommodated without recourse to additional public funds. The sponsor's
    total weekly income from benefits amounted to �485.12. As a  comparator
    the applicable Income Support level for a  couple  with  five  children
    amounted to �408 per week. Whilst the sponsor's income  exceeded  this,
    five children had to be supported and there would be  council  tax  and
    utilities to pay. The tenancy agreement submitted  was  dated  February
    2012 and the entry clearance officer was not satisfied the family could
    be adequately accommodated without recourse to additional public funds.



 6.  The  final  ground  for  refusal  related  to  the  English   language
    requirement under paragraph E-ECP.4.2. The  appellant  was  not  exempt
    from this and had not passed an English language test from an  approved
    provider.

 7. On review by the entry clearance manager the refusal was maintained. It
    was accepted that the marriage was valid; genuine and subsisting.

The First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant appeal was dismissed by  Judge  Napthine  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 24 November 2014. The  judge  expressed  dissatisfaction
    with the entry  clearance  manager's  concession  in  relation  to  the
    marriage on the basis detailed reasons had not been given. However, the
    judge did not seek to go behind the concession.

 9. On the question of maintenance and accommodation the judge  upheld  the
    entry clearance officer's decision. The judge emphasised the  interests
    of the children and took the view that whilst the sponsor's income from
    benefit exceeded the applicable income support level for a  couple  the
    balance was not truly available. This  was  because  the  bulk  of  the
    Benefits paid were for the children's  needs,  particularly  the  child
    with  a  disability.  Regarding  accommodation  the  tenancy  agreement
    provided that no more than six people may live in the property. All but
    one of the sponsor's children was over 10 years of age  and  the  judge
    concluded the property was fully occupied as it  was.  The  judge  also
    emphasised the impact on the children of another occupant and  presumed
    there would be additional physical requirements for the  child  with  a
    disability. The judge indicated the property as it was, was overcrowded
    and  concluded  it  had  not  been  shown  they   would   be   adequate
    accommodation if the appellant joined the household.

10. Finally, the judge dealt with the English language requirement. It  had
    been argued that the appellant should be exempt from the test. This was
    because he had been unable to  attend  courses  or  to  take  the  test
    because of his circumstances, namely, he was living in a refugee  camp.
    The judge was not  satisfied  the  appellant's  circumstances  were  as
    claimed, pointing out no evidence had been led that he was resident  in
    a refugee camp. In any event the judge did not accept he was restricted
    to the confines of the camp, pointing out he  said  he  first  met  the
    sponsor in a shopping mall; had attended the wedding of her sister  and
    was free to attend his  own  wedding.  Furthermore,  the  sponsor  gave
    evidence to the effect that the appellant had been given a  three-month
    travel permit.

11. Having dealt with the appeal under  the  immigration  rules  the  judge
    referred to the decision of Gulsham (Article 8 - New  rules  -  Correct
    Approach) [2014] Imm AR 2. The judge concluded for Article 8  purposes.
    There were no compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  by
    the rules.

The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12. In the grounds of appeal it was claimed at the First-tier Tribunal  the
    presenting  officer  had  indicated  acceptance  the  maintenance   and
    accommodation  grounds  were  met.  Regarding  the   English   language
    requirement reference was again made to the claim  that  the  appellant
    was living in difficult circumstances in a refugee camp. The grounds of
    appeal state that there was a basis for allowing the appeal outside the
    rules given the acceptance that the  marriage  was  genuine;  that  the
    sponsor was now pregnant; and the difficult circumstances the appellant
    faced in the refugee camp.

13. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Levin  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Reference  was  made  to  the  decisions  of  KA  and  others
    (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006]  00065  and  MK  (Somalia)  v
    Entry Clearance  Officer  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1521.  On  the  basis  the
    sponsor's income exceeded the applicable income support  level  it  was
    arguable the  judge  erred  in  law  in  considering  the  question  of
    maintenance.

14. It was also accepted as  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by
    following the Upper Tribunal decision of Gulsham (Article 8 - New rules
    - Correct Approach) [2014] Imm AR 2 in light of  the  Court  of  Appeal
    judgement in MM (Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

15. The respondent, further to rule 24 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 indicated ongoing opposition to the appeal. It was
    sought to distinguish MK (Somalia) v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2007]
    EWCA Civ 1521 on the basis  the  disability  living  allowance  in  the
    present appeal was being paid for the benefit of  the  sponsor's  child
    rather than the sponsor. Regarding the judge's approach  to  Article  8
    the respondent sought  to  distinguish  the  present  appeal  from  the
    situation in MM (Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA  Civ  985  as  it  was
    concerned with the level  of  income  required  by  the  respondent  to
    support an application for entry clearance. It was said that the First-
    tier  judge  followed  the  approach  set  out  in  Nagre,  R  (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin) as approved by the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MF  Nigeria
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, namely, it was only if there was a good  arguable
    case  that  there  was  any  need  to   carry   out   the   traditional
    proportionality exercise in relation to Article 8.

Error of law

16. Mr Duffy stated that the notes from the First-tier  Tribunal  indicated
    there was  agreement  between  the  then  presenting  officer  and  the
    appellant's   representative   with   regard   to    maintenance    and
    accommodation.  I have considered the record of proceedings.  The  bulk
    of the judge's note is concerned with the English  language  test  .The
    judge then raised other matters  with  the  sponsor  arising  from  the
    refusal letter. It is recorded in the  note  of  the  submissions  that
    counsel for the appellant indicated maintenance and accommodation was `
    accepted' by the presenting officer and so no  submissions  were  being
    made on the point.

17.  It is not apparent why the  judge  then  pursued  this  point  in  the
    Determination .In any event it was my  conclusion  in  that  the  judge
    erred in law in how maintenance was dealt with. This was  in  light  of
    the majority decision of the Court of Appeal in  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in MK (Somalia) v Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    1521.  The minority judgement of Lord Justice  Pill  does  accord  with
    Judge Napthine's approach. At paragraph 14 Lord Justice Pill refers  to
    DLA being for the particular needs of a disabled person and the absence
    of control over how it is spent does not converted into a benefit which
    can be treated as family income or the joint  income  of  the  disabled
    person and their spouse.  Lord  Justice  Sedley,  giving  the  majority
    decision took the opposite view: monies paid to  the  claimant  of  DLA
    could be spent as they choose  and  can  be  used  for  the  upkeep  of
    another. Lord Justice Rimer at paragraph 24  accepted  the  argument  a
    person seeking entry could  assert  they  would  become  the  sponsor's
    carer. In MK (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2007] EWCA  Civ  1521
    it was the sponsor who was in receipt of the  benefit  whereas  in  the
    present appeal it is the sponsor's child. However, it seems to me  that
    the same principle applies. Mr  Duffy  has  not  raised  any  issue  in
    relation to accommodation.

18.  Regarding  the  English   language   qualification   the   appellant's
    representative argued that given his  circumstances  as  a  refugee  in
    Kenya he should have been exempt under E-ECP.4.2 (c) on  the  basis  of
    exceptional circumstances  preventing  him  from  meeting  the  English
    language requirement. The appellant has now passed the  necessary  test
    .Mr Duffy made the point that the appellant's ability to study and take
    the English test could not have  been  as  restricted  as  was  claimed
    before the First-tier Tribunal as he now had the qualification.   There
    was an absence of information about the circumstances whereby  he  took
    the test subsequent to the decision. His sponsor was present and whilst
    there was no Somali interpreter arranged she indicated she was able  to
    give some information. She indicated that she sent her husband money so
    he could prepare for the test. She said conditions  in  the  camp  were
    very difficult  with  ongoing  fights  and  that  it  was  a  dangerous
    environment. She said her husband develop malaria and was taken outside
    the camp and he subsequently was able to prepare for the English test.

19.  Mr Duffy suggested the appellant could make a fresh application. I was
    advised the sponsor was due to give birth at the end of  the  month.  I
    asked Mr Duffy if requiring the appellant to make a  fresh  application
    would have similarities with the position in  Chikwamba.  He  submitted
    that the position here was quite different from in  Chikwamba.   There,
    the appellant had been in the United Kingdom some  time  and  would  be
    returning to Zimbabwe where they would face  difficulties.  I  accepted
    the merit in the points made. He also pointed out that  Article  8  was
    not meant to be used as a general dispensing power and I  was  referred
    to the decision of Patel & Others v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 72.

Conclusions

20. It is common case is that the  English  language  requirement  was  not
    satisfied by the appellant at the time of decision. Judge Napthine  did
    not find the appellant to be exempt. The judge referred to the lack  of
    evidence that he was in a refugee camp and refers to instances where he
    was not confined to the camp. The  judge  also  refers  to  the  public
    interest that person seeking to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  speak
    English. I find no error of law in  the  judge's  conclusion  that  the
    appellant was not exempt.

21.  My conclusion therefore is  that  any  error  on  the  part  of  Judge
    Napthine in relation to how maintenance was dealt with would  not  have
    made any material difference to the negative outcome under  the  rules.
    The absence of the necessary English language qualification  was  fatal
    to the application.

22. I also do not see  any  material  error  in  law  in  Judge  Napthine's
    conclusion in relation to Article  8.  The  judge  had  concluded  that
    nothing arose which indicated arguably good grounds for granting  entry
    clearance outside the  immigration  rules.  The  judge  was  aware  the
    appellant's sponsor was  pregnant.  Reference  was  made  to  the  best
    interests of the children being a primary consideration. Regard was had
    to part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  the
    relevant public interest considerations.

23. The judge relied upon the decision of Gulsham (Article 8 - New rules  -
    Correct Approach) [2014] Imm AR 2, finding  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the rules. MM (Lebanon)
    & Others, R (On the Application of) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  985  refers
    to situations when the immigration rules provide a  complete  code  for
    dealing with a person's Convention rights in which case  the  balancing
    exercise and the way the various factors are to be taken  into  account
    in an individual case must be done in accordance with that code. If the
    relevant rules are not such a complete code  then  the  proportionality
    test will be more at large.

24.  Judge Napthine at paragraph 45  and  47  indicated  consideration  was
    given to the specific circumstances and  the  Judge  did  not  see  any
    matters of significance that were not adequately recognised. I can  see
    no error of law in this. It remains open as the presenting officer  has
    suggested for the appellant to make  a  new  application  now  that  he
    appears to meet the requirements of the rules.

25. In conclusion therefore, whilst I find there was an error of law in the
    treatment of maintenance this  was  not  a  material  error.  This  was
    because  the  appeal  was  bound  to  fail  as  the  English   language
    requirement was not satisfied. The judge was entitled to  conclude  the
    appellant was not exempt. I also find no error of law  in  the  judge's
    consideration of Article 8.

Decision

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on the 24  November
    2014 dismissing the appealed does not contain a material error  of  law
    and shall stand.
