On return to the DRC failed asylum seekers do not per se face a  real  risk
of persecution or serious harm or treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR.  In
so finding this decision updates and reaffirms existing country guidance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    Lengthy as was the hearing of this case, it concerns  essentially  two
    matters only: the appellant's particular case and the issue of  whether
    failed asylum seekers returned to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo
    (DRC) against their will are at real risk  of  persecution  or  serious
    harm or ill treatment. Given the publicity it has received, here and in
    the DRC, it is important to emphasise what the case is not about. It is
    not concerned with the issue of treatment of failed asylum  seekers  by
    United  Kingdom  officials  during  the  removal  process.  It  is  not
    concerned with the sending of any kind of political message to the  DRC
    government as to  what  this  country  thinks  of  how  it  treats  its
    citizens; that is not in any event  a  judicial  function.  Apart  from
    deciding the appellant's case, it is concerned solely with  the  purely
    factual issue of what is likely to happen to failed asylum seekers when
    they arrive at N'Djili airport in Kinshasa and thereafter. Nevertheless
    resolution of this issue is of some  moment  for  those  concerned  and
    indeed on 23 August 2007 the Administrative Court stayed  any  removals
    to the DRC pending the outcome of this case.

2.    Quite exceptionally, much of the hearing of the  case  took  place  in
    camera. Hearings before this Tribunal must normally be in public and it
    is of cardinal importance that they should  remain  so.  However,  both
    parties in  this  case  were  agreed  from  the  outset  that,  without
    prejudging any issues, we should have regard to concerns  expressed  by
    certain potential witnesses about  their  safety  if  their  identities
    became known. In the event we have serious  doubts  that  the  veil  of
    secrecy  was  justified  in  several  cases  and  we  have  principally
    maintained our anonymity and confidentiality order because that is what
    we said we would do. It has proved convenient in any event  for  us  in
    this determination to anonymise all the witnesses save  for  that  from
    witnesses who expressly said they were happy to be named and  save  for
    that which concerns figures in the political  life  of  the  DRC  whose
    names are already in the public realm. Given the length and  complexity
    of the case (the documentation alone occupied  11  lever  arch  files),
    Senior Immigration Judge Warr and Immigration  Judge  Davey  have  made
    some contribution to the writing of this  determination.  Our  findings
    and reasons, however, are the findings and reasons of all three.  Below
    W=Witness and E= Expert.

3.    In view of the very considerable body of  evidence  we  have  to  deal
    with, covering both the appellant's  case  and  the  general  issue  of
    failed asylum seekers, it may assist to begin with a table of  contents

   Appendix: Background materials before the Tribunal

The Appeal
4.    The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic  of  Congo  born
    in November 1978.  She arrived in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2006
    and applied for asylum on that date. The Secretary of State  considered
    the application but refused it in a letter dated  28 March  2006.  The
    appellant appealed. It is her appeal which falls for us  to  decide  in
    this determination. Given  the  agreement  of  both  parties  that  our
    determination of the appellant's appeal should  encompass  the  general
    issue of risk to failed asylum seekers returned to the  DRC,  we  shall
    deal first of all with this general issue, returning at the end to  the
    appellant's particular case.

Procedural History
5.    Prior to the first day of hearing on 3 July 2007 there  were  several
    case management hearings. We need only note the following details.

6.    On 16 May 2006 the parties agreed before Immigration Judge  Gillespie
    that there was "no reliance on Article 8".

7.    Despite the respondent  requesting  the  appellant's  representatives
    several times, beginning as long ago as 20 June  2006,   to  ask  their
    expert witness, E1, to use his extensive contacts in the DRC to confirm
    aspects of the appellant's account relating to her  and  her  husband's
    and father's UDPS involvement, this was never done.

8.    In a letter dated 29 June 2006 the Treasury Solicitor requested  that
    the hearing set for 2 July be adjourned in view of repeated delays  and
    late service by the appellant's representatives of  various  documents.
    That application was refused on 29 June 2007, but  was  renewed  by  Ms
    Giovannetti at the outset of the hearing on 3 July. She highlighted the
    fact that the evidence submitted by the appellant's representatives  by
    the 27 June deadline set by the Tribunal included a statement  from  Ms
    Atherton which made reference to 10 case studies and  a  second  report
    from E2 of which no prior warning had been given. There were some 1,500
    pages of evidence which had been adduced.  It was essential,  in  order
    for the respondent to prepare properly for what had been identified  by
    the Tribunal long ago as an intended country guidance case on a generic
    issue, she submitted, that adequate time be given  to  investigate  the
    particulars of the case studies mentioned, the files relating to  which
    were currently in storage. She accepted, however, that  the  respondent
    was ready to proceed in relation to the appellant's evidence. Mr Jacobs
    objected to the application to adjourn as  well  as  to  the  fall-back
    position of proceeding only with the evidence relating specifically  to
    the appellant.

9.    We decided that it would be unfair to proceed with the hearing  on  3
    July insofar as it had been set to deal with general issues relating to
    failed asylum seekers and UDPS  involvement,  but  that  neither  party
    would be prejudiced by proceeding with the hearing of evidence specific
    to the appellant.   The  hearing  was  accordingly  undertaken  in  two
    stages. The first stage in July dealt with the "subjective" element  of
    the case - the evidence of the appellant,  her  mother,  JK  (  Federal
    President of the UDPS in the United Kingdom) and the  expert,  E1.   E1
    had prepared reports dealing both with  the  individual  facts  of  the
    appellant's case and the wider issues of returned  asylum  seekers  and
    the hearing in July was only concerned with E1's report in  respect  of
    the personal features of the  appellant's  case.   The  proceedings  in
    September 2007 were largely devoted to the "objective"  evidence  of  a
    general nature.

10.   In between July and  the  resumed  hearing  in  September  there  were
    communications from the parties which we  need  not  detail  except  to
    observe that both sought permission to adduce  further  evidence,  some
    relating to the appellant's particular case, some to the general  issue
    of returned failed asylum seekers.

11.   Prior to the commencement of  the  resumed  hearing  in  September  we
    reminded ourselves of the entirety of the evidence that had been before
    us when he heard the case in July.  At  the  outset  of  the  September
    hearings we granted both  parties  permission  to  adduce  the  further
    evidence they had submitted. Mr Jacobs also raised the concerns  of  W1
    that he had received death threats which he had reported to the  police
    (we were subsequently given details of the  police  reference  number).
    W1 was already covered by the Tribunal's Anonymity and  Confidentiality
    Order, effective from the beginning of the hearing in July but, in view
    of this information, we took additional steps to ensure W1, W2  and  W3
    were  able  to  give  their  evidence  in  camera.  We  also   reviewed
    arrangements put in place for certain other parts of the hearing to  be
    heard in camera.

12.   Although we have maintained  and  still  maintain  our  Anonymity  and
    Confidentiality order in respect of W1, W2 and W3 [and certain others],
    we would emphasise that we have done so reluctantly. In the  course  of
    the hearing in September we learnt that commencing in early  2007  both
    W2 and W3 had been speakers at a number  of  public  meetings  held  in
    several UK cities (including Birmingham) to raise awareness amongst the
    DRC diaspora about the failed asylum seeker issue  in  the  context  of
    this (pending) Tribunal case. Leaflets advertising  these  meeting  had
    given their names.  As for W1, his name had also appeared on a  leaflet
    distributed for the meeting in  Birmingham.   Having  heard  from  Miss
    Atherton we are prepared to accept that mention of  his  name  in  that
    leaflet was inadvertent on her part, but  we  also  learnt  during  the
    September hearing that in July 2007 W1 had identified himself  by  name
    on a website covering DRC affairs underneath an entry  criticising  the
    current DRC regime as "looters". Given, as we shall come on  to  later,
    Mr Jacobs' reliance on the fact that there are DRC agents active in the
    UK, we consider it was unjustified for him to have suggested, that  the
    threat to W1's life may "very likely"  have  been  the  result  of  the
    British Embassy mentioning him to DRC officials in the  course  of  the
    Embassy's recent efforts to obtain  more  evidence  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent so as to check whether W1's evidence was  reliable.  He  was
    someone whose name in connection with this case had  already  been  put
    into the public realm within the Congolese community.

13.   If we had been given the above information  at  the  outset  we  might
    well have decided not to maintain  our  Anonymity  and  Confidentiality
    Order in respect of this witness and W2 and W3.  In the event  we  have
    decided to maintain it in respect of all three, chiefly because we said
    we would and  because  we  consider  generally  that  in  view  of  the
    publicity surrounding this case it is prudent that we should only refer
    by name to individuals who  have  expressly  indicated  that  they  are
    content for us to do so. The parties  will  be  able  to  ascertain  by
    reference to the agreed bundles to whom we refer when we anonymise. The
    publicly disclosable evidence on which we have relied is listed  in  an
    appendix.

14.   On the first day of the hearings in September (17th)  the  appellant's
    representatives also raised their concerns about the fact  that  recent
    correspondence from the British Embassy in Kinshasa revealed  that  one
    of their officials (whom we  refer  to  throughout  as  X)  had  openly
    mentioned W1's name to  DRC  government  sources,  notwithstanding  the
    Tribunal's   Anonymity   and    Confidentiality    Order    prohibiting
    identification  of  this  witness.   Insofar   as   any   question   of
    admissibility  of  the  relevant   parts   of   the   British   Embassy
    correspondence is concerned, we are satisfied that it was  evidence  to
    which we should have regard. W1 in his witness statements of 16 May and
    10 September 2007 had made a number of claims about his role at N'Djili
    airport in the period 1998-2002 and the respondent  (without  objection
    from Mr Jacobs) had specifically asked the Tribunal for  adequate  time
    to seek to verify and check these claims, which is  what  she  did.  We
    note further that   none of the British Embassy  enquiries  related  to
    evidence or details which  W1 had given in the  course  of  his  asylum
    claim and, being a recognised refugee in the  UK,  W1  is  not  in  any
    danger of  being  himself  returned  to  the   DRC  against  his  will.
    Additionally W1 was by his own account a well known figure in  the  DRC
    government, both before and after his fall from grace in  the  eyes  of
    the Kabila regime (we were shown a July 2006 news item from a Congolese
    website making reference to him); and, as already noted,  W1's name  as
    someone now in the UK with evidence to give  exposing  mistreatment  of
    returned failed asylum seekers was already in the public  realm  within
    the DRC community, here and in the DRC, well before the hearing of this
    case.

15.   Having said that, we think that the  British  Embassy  enquiries  made
    regarding him showed insufficient regard to the terms of the Tribunal's
    order. We acknowledge that the Embassy mentioned that W1 was among  the
    witnesses expressing concern for  his  safety,  specifying  that  as  a
    result "special  care  was  taken  when  making  inquiries".   Yet  the
    Embassy's 13 September 3007 letter shows clearly  that  enquiries  were
    made about  W1  of  certain  ex-colleagues  and  former  acquaintances,
    including senior figures within the DGM.   It  appears  that  that  the
    Embassy was not fully informed about the terms of the Tribunal's order.

16.   However, having  reviewed  all  the  correspondence  we  can  find  no
    evidence to indicate any wilful disregard  by  the  respondent  of  our
    order. In AH (Sudan) [2007] EWCA Civ 297 (in a  passage  unaffected  by
    the subsequent overturning of this judgment by  the  House  of  Lords),
    Buxton LJ emphasised the  value  of  British  Embassy  assistance  with
    information and evidence relating to intended country  guidance  cases.
    Whilst we have found no intentional breach by  the  respondent  of  the
    Tribunal's order, we would hope that in  future  the  respondent  would
    ensure that Embassy officials asked to assist with  inquiries  relating
    to country guidance issues are made fully aware of  any  anonymity  and
    confidentiality implications and that, in a case  where  they  consider
    that response to requests for information may  entail  some  degree  of
    disclosure, the respondent approaches the  Tribunal  for  clarification
    beforehand.

17.   One other matter arose during  the  September  hearings  which  merits
    comment here. Prior to the September hearing Mr Jacobs informed us that
    the first witness he would call would be E1.  On  the  morning  of  the
    first day's hearing he announced that it was now his intention to  call
    E1 at the end of the week. It is clear that he had  not  informed  Miss
    Giovannetti  of  this.  We  deprecate  this  lack  of  regard  for  the
    difficulties this obviously caused Miss Giovannetti for her preparation
    of questions for the witnesses who were in fact called first.

18.   At the beginning of the hearing on Thursday 20  September  we  alerted
    the parties to the fact that we could  not  be  sure  we  would  finish
    hearing from previous witnesses before the beginning of Friday, when we
    were  due  to  hear  from  E1.   Mr  Jacobs  undertook  to   alert   E1
    straightaway to the real possibility that we might not be ready to hear
    him until the following Monday 24th.  We heard nothing thereafter  from
    Mr Jacobs to suggest that this would cause EI  any difficulties   until
    the morning of 21 September,  (the day when we were due  to  hear  from
    E1), when Mr Jacobs advised us that E1 had e-mailed during the  weekend
    to say he had a prior commitment and would be unable to attend.

19.   Mr Jacobs proceeded to apply for an adjournment of the  case  until  a
    date in late October. He drew attention to the fact that in the  e-mail
    from E1 explaining why he could not attend on 24 September he  went  on
    to say that he was also in the process of examining some elements  from
    the witness statements of W1,  W2  and  W3  and  verifying  some  other
    matters including Voix des Sans Voix's (VSV's) monitoring  capacity  at
    N'Djili airport. He expected his final and additional report concerning
    these matters to be ready by 20 October and  ended  by  saying  he  was
    prepared to  give  evidence  to  the  Tribunal  when  this  report  was
    finished. We decided to refuse this application.  No  good  reason  has
    been shown to justify an adjournment and we are satisfied that  it  was
    just to refuse one.  We  do  not  know  precisely  what  communications
    preceded this letter, but we are surprised if any suggestion  was  made
    to E1 that he might be able to produce a further report for this  case.
    There have been a number of adjournments of this appeal already and the
    appellant's representatives have known for some considerable time that,
    having adjourned part-heard in July 2007, the Tribunal would not extend
    its hearing of this case beyond Tuesday 25 September.  There  has  been
    more than ample opportunity  for  the  appellant's  representatives  to
    obtain relevant, up-to-date evidence from E1 and to have him called  as
    a witness on the general issues. E1 had confirmed in his very recent e-
    mail that he stood by his two reports produced for this appeal.  We did
    not consider it appropriate in all the  circumstances  to  adjourn  the
    proceedings, which had already been protracted.

The "objective" parts of the case

20.   As already noted we deal first with  the  general  issue  of  returned
    failed asylum seekers, starting with a summary of  the  most  important
    items of written and oral evidence.






(a) Witnesses who gave oral evidence

Witness W1
21.    In his witness statement of 6 May 2007 W1 states  that  he  had  fled
    the DRC in December 2002 and claimed asylum. The basis  of  his  asylum
    claim was that in the course of his work as a  principal  assistant  to
    the chief prosecutor of the  Military  (or  Marshal)  Court,  sometimes
    known  as  COM,   during  the  prosecution  of  persons  suspected   of
    involvement in the assassination of President  Joseph  Kabila,  he  had
    helped his half-brother, one of the suspects,  escape  from  detention.
    His appeal had been allowed by an Adjudicator in May 2003  and  he  had
    been recognised as a refugee. Since arrival in the UK he  had  kept  in
    contact with colleagues and friends in the DRC. Due to  the  very  high
    rank he held and the work he was involved in, he  still  had  contacts,
    including high ranking contacts, who  trusted  him.  He  contacted  his
    sources nearly every other day.  His  sources  informed  him  that  the
    situation is still the same at the airport as it was when he was there.

22.   W1 states that from 1998 until  he  fled  he  had  also  worked  as  a
    liaison officer/standing magistrate for the Military Court in Kinshasa

23. He explained that despite  its  name  the  Military  Court  had  a  wide
    jurisdiction and  his  role  as  a  liaison  officer  involved  him  in
    communication with  all  of  the  security  and  policing  departments,
    including  the  Direction  Generale  de   Migration   (DGM),   National
    Intelligence Agency (ANR),  Detection  Militaire  des  Activites  Anti-
    Patrie/Military Detection of Anti-Patriotic Activities (DEMIAP), Police
    Special  Service  (including  the  IPK)  and  the  Committee  of  State
    Security. He was required to work in other parts of the country as well
    as in Kinshasa. By 2001 he was appointed as personal assistant  to  the
    main prosecutor. As part of his liaison officer duties he was "based at
    Ndjili airport until the time that I had left the country".   This  led
    to him becoming familiar with the  way  in  which  the  regime  treated
    failed asylum seekers and deportees, although he  did  not  have  great
    knowledge of the small day to day running of the DGM.  He  was  a  very
    high ranking official who outranked the DGM officers at the airport and
    had power to arrest an officer if there was  cause,  which  on  several
    occasions there was. For the most part he was  only  brought  into  the
    system when someone very high requested that he become involved or when
    the conduct of the DGM officers warranted that he become involved.

24.   He explained the procedures failed asylum seekers  went  through  from
    arrival: being checked against the passenger manifest list  to  see  if
    they are on a wanted list, being taken to an office  called  Permanence
    where there is a cell. Here there is interrogation.  The  view  of  the
    relevant services at the airport is that  failed  asylum  seekers  have
    gone abroad to betray the regime and to say negative things  about  it.
    Additionally, because of things that had happened to presidential aides
    in the UK, "[p]eople who come from the UK are seen with great suspicion
    and  as  the  enemy  number  one".  From   Permanence   failed   asylum
    seekers/deportees are taken to a hidden office at the  airport,  called
    Bureau  Contentieux,  a  large  spacious  office,  where  interrogation
    continues. Interrogation covers, inter alia, where the  deportees  have
    come from, how long they have spent outside the country, why they  have
    claimed asylum, why they were  deported.  For  deportees/failed  asylum
    seekers of Rwandan origin everything is that much worse.

25.   From Bureau Contentieux  deportees  are  usually  transferred  to  Kin
    Maziere, a DGM detention centre. He had visited Kin Maziere on numerous
    occasions (it was part of his duties to control the cells there) and he
    observed  the  interrogations  undertaken  there.  For  failed   asylum
    seekers/deportees this follows  the  same  lines  as  at  the  airport.
    Torture is used: he witnessed  deportees  being  slapped,  punched  and
    kicked. This was normal procedure so he  did  not  interfere.  Rape  of
    women is common. He gave  several  examples  of  cases  known  to  him.
    Conditions in Kin-Maziere  are  inhumane.  Failed  asylum  seekers  are
    detained there for, on average, 3 months. A  bribe  is  often  elicited
    from the detainee or his family.  He  had  accepted  bribes  of  around
    $5,000 at a military court to help people leave. If not released at Kin
    Maziere, individuals go to Makala, the military court, ANR, IPK, DEMIAP
    or other detention centres, where  they  suffer  greatly,  particularly
    women.

26.   He had on many occasions intervened  when  deportees  had  had  money,
    clothes, or luggage taken from them by the immigration officers. He had
    often entered rooms and seen immigration officers  punching  deportees;
    he had also witnessed kicking and stamping  and  "numerous  methods  of
    torture" been used, including iron bars to squeeze fingers and electric
    shock guns. Beating and torturing people was "commonplace". It was also
    commonplace for deportee women to be sexually abused and raped  at  the
    airport. The officers considered that as they  had  acted  against  the
    government, such women deserved to be raped, although  ordinary  female
    travellers could  find  themselves  raped  or  abused  also.   "If  you
    disagree with this then you could be seen as someone who is against the
    government and not interested in protecting the  regime".  W1  gave  an
    example of an incident which happened to a women returned from  Belgium
    in 1999. He had had the two immigration  officers  who  had  raped  her
    arrested but one of them was  the  brother  of  an  important  airforce
    general and so he returned to work a  few  days  later.  By  virtue  of
    having high-placed relatives many officials at the  airport  knew  they
    could act with impunity. Amongst several other examples he gave of ill-
    treatment was the case of a woman deported from the UK in 2002 who  was
    raped. He ordered that the officer concerned be arrested and the latter
    was eventually convicted before the military court. There had also been
    the case of a woman due to travel by South Africa airways in  2000  who
    had been raped. The soldier he ordered to be arrested was sentenced  to
    20 years in prison. Summarising the general situation, W1 stated:

         "From the time that I spent at the airport, each  time  there  were
         deportees, I can say that there was never a  possibility  that  any
         individual deportee would be exempt from ill-treatment.  They  will
         be physically and  morally  abused....In  every  office  while  the
         deportees are questioned or interviewed, their money or  belongings
         are taken by force and nearly all the time they  are  subjected  to
         torture".

27.   It is very difficult for deportees  to  pay  bribes  to  the  officers
    because anything they have when they  land  is  taken  from  them.   In
    exceptional cases officers allow family members to pay bribes to secure
    the deportee's release. 2-4 thousand dollars is  required.   Even  when
    this happens, if a woman  is  involved  she  can  still  be  raped.  He
    received a cut of the bribes that were paid. Human rights NGOs are  not
    normally present at the airport and, when they are, the  officials  put
    on a show of everything being OK. He knew that DRC intelligence  agents
    had used poison to kill a number of anti-Kabila individuals abroad.

28.   His sources had informed him that  during  the  operation  surrounding
    the February 2007 charter flight from the UK to N'Djili airport, around
    a dozen people were detained [NB. Throughout  this  determination  this
    charter flight is sometimes  referred  to  as  the  "26  February  2007
    charter flight" (the date it left  the  UK),  sometimes  as  the  "27th
    February 2007 charter flight"  (the  date  it  arrived  in  Kinshasa)].
    Those who could afford to bribe their way out  were  released.  Despite
    the presence of national TV, people still  ended  up  in  Kin  Maziere,
    including two women. He mentioned two cases  since  then:  deportations
    from the UK in April and May 2007. He had not met W2 or W3  in  the  UK
    until after the meeting in Birmingham in March 2007, but in Kinshasa he
    had seen W2 detained at the military court: he had authorised this.  He
    had not been able to give evidence in W2 or W3's appeals as he was  not
    in contact with them then.

29.   Contained within the  bundle  there  are  photographs  of  W1  wearing
    military uniform and in the presence of  well-known  senior  officials.
    There is also a witness statement from a  Mr  FL  in  support  of  W1's
    asylum claim, which confirms aspects of W1's account.  The  Adjudicator
    who allowed his appeal in May  2003  found  W1  had  given  a  truthful
    account. He found that W1 held an influential position in the  military
    legal system in the DRC, being an assistant to the chief prosecutor  in
    the Kabila assassination trial. W1 had become concerned at the  way  in
    which the trial was conducted and in particular  the  position  of  his
    half brother. He was able to obtain his half-brother's release with the
    help of a friend.  All  3  fled  the  DRC  to  avoid  retribution.  The
    respondent adduced W1's SEF form and witness  statement  made  for  his
    asylum claim. In those documents he mentions, inter alia, that his wife
    had been able to leave the DRC whilst he was still in prison,  that  he
    had been able to organise his own escape via N'Djili airport because he
    had an identity card as part of his duties as  military  court  liaison
    officer based at the airport. He had also been able to  get  help  from
    some officials he knew there.  In his asylum statement W1 stated:

         "...that it is not safe for people to return to  Kinshasa  Airport,
         especially if they are wanted by the government and also if  it  is
         known that a  person  has  claimed  asylum.  People  are  detained,
         tortured, killed. I know that this has happened on many occasions".



30.   The respondent also produced documents relating to  the  asylum  claim
    made by W1's wife and a witness statement W1 had made dated  9  January
    2007 relating in the main to the case of his  former  chief  prosecutor
    boss, whose family were now asylum-seekers.

31.   In a second witness statement dated 10 September 2007 W1 gave  further
    details concerning his sources and about the current situation  of  his
    former boss.  He said that there  were  ANR  officers  in  the  British
    Embassy in Kinshasa and he was worried that if they found out about him
    helping the court, they would inform the regime. He gave names. London,
    he said, was known to have a very high concentration  of  opponents  to
    the regime: attacks on Kabila aides here had  worsened  the  situation.
    Agents here and in the DRC  monitored  radio  stations  such  as  Radio
    Okapi.  It was ridiculous to suggest that VSV  had  an  office  at  the
    airport. RVA passes would not get people in to areas such  as  the  ANR
    offices or Bureaux Contentieux.  He gave further  updating  on  several
    cases he had mentioned. He mentioned having given evidence in the  case
    of a Mr TA, who was found credible in his asylum appeal.

32.   At the hearing  W1  largely  reiterated  his  written  evidence.  Miss
    Giovannetti stated at the outset that the respondent  accepted  W1  had
    worked in the military justice system in the DRC and that he  had  been
    assistant to the  chief  prosecutor.  Amongst  the  matters  that  were
    mentioned  by  W1  in  the  course  of  a  cross-examination  by   Miss
    Giovannetti (which challenged many aspects of W1's evidence)  were  the
    following. He gave a list  to  the  Tribunal  of  those  with  whom  he
    maintained regular contact. They knew, he said, that  there  was  a  UK
    case intended to give country guidance on  failed  DRC  asylum-seekers;
    there was a close  regime  interest  in  the  case.  One  of  them  had
    specifically told him he wanted the Tribunal to know people  sent  back
    were not welcome. He agreed his contacts  would  know  he  had  claimed
    asylum. He believed they told him what  was  going  on,  including  for
    example about torture  in  Kin  Maziere,  because  they  were  isolated
    individuals who wanted the DRC to become respectable.  He agreed if  it
    became known that they talked to him they could  lose  their  jobs  and
    would be punished. He did not accept the  British  Embassy  claim  that
    intelligence officers in the DRC tapped phones unless encrypted.

33.   W1 said he had  been  responsible  for  the  arrest  of  around  three
    quarters of  the  127  people  arrested  in  the  Kabila  assassination
    investigations, which began straight after the assassination in January
    2001. He accepted that he had been involved in having  innocent  people
    convicted and in detainees being left to starve, but that did not  mean
    he agreed with  it.  He  had  intervened  whenever  he  could  to  stop
    injustice. He had sometimes at risk to his life  given  information  to
    human rights NGOs including Amnesty International: he agreed,  however,
    that he had not mentioned that in his asylum claim or in his  May  2007
    statement.

34.   Asked if he had accepted a bribe on more than one occasion, he  stated
    he had accepted a bribe (for $5,000) only once. The reference in one of
    his statements to acceptance of bribes in the plural (B2, para 79)  was
    a mistake. Although his salary never rose above $15 per  month  he  was
    able to supplement that through  payments  he  received  for  going  on
    missions and certain court-related property transactions.  He  did  not
    accept that he had been able to describe himself  as  a  "wealthy  man"
    (with 3 properties) because he had benefited from corruption. He agreed
    that shortly after his appointment to become principal assistant to the
    chief prosecutor, that man had appointed someone else to replace him as
    liaison officer, but as this man needed help doing the job he went with
    him to the airport quite often, for example  when  he  had  information
    that a military person was being deported back to the DRC or was trying
    to desert by leaving the country or when he had to organise tickets  or
    clearances for military court personnel. As  regards  the  wanted  list
    held at the airport, he  would  be  interested  in  deserters,  escaped
    prisoners, bail jumpers, enemies of the state or  persons  involved  in
    some judicial process. The result was that he went to the airport 3  or
    4 times per week sometimes and to Kin Maziere 5-6 times a month.

35.   In all he had given statements in support of 5 other  asylum  appeals;
    up to now he had forgotten to mention one he wrote in January 2007  for
    the family of his former chief. Asked why he had not intervened to stop
    the rape of women on more than a very limited number of  occasions,  W1
    said he needed proof. He agreed,  however  that  it  was  his  evidence
    elsewhere that airport officers did not deny raping women.  It was  his
    job to make it clear that those engaged  in  rape  would  be  punished.
    Sometimes, in relation to rape or torture, there was nothing  he  could
    do. He would intervene when he could.  He  could  recall  in  his  time
    complaints being made about mistreatment  at  the  airport  or  in  Kin
    Maziere around 20-30 times when he was  in  charge.  Out  of  some  100
    officials at the airport around 30 were protected by powerful relatives
    and so had impunity. Asked to comment on how he squared  his  statement
    that he had received a cut of bribes with  his  evidence  that  he  was
    doing his best to stamp  out  the  practice,  he  said  that  sometimes
    families would wish to thank him by giving money for his  intervention.
    He was sure his information about the February 2007 charter flight  was
    reliable: he had in fact spoken to one of his senior  sources  to  tell
    them that this flight was going to arrive with failed  asylum  seekers.
    His information about one of the charter returnees  having  to  pay  an
    $8,000 bribe came from two of that person's children in the  UK.  Their
    information source was Kinshasa. A senior source had told  him.   Asked
    why he had not claimed asylum on his own arrival, he said that  he  was
    traumatised. Asked why he would not have known from his  dealings  with
    many failed asylum seekers (including those  from  the  UK)  about  the
    process of claiming, he said they never told. He stood by his  evidence
    that he did not know where his wife lived when he arrived in the UK. He
    had not asked his solicitor to find out where she lived but he believed
    that it was the  solicitor  who  found  out.  The  information  in  the
    solicitor's letter did not come from him (W1).

36.   Asked why if he was frightened of speaking out  and  being  identified
    by DRC agents in the UK he had given his name and city on a Radio Okapi
    website when describing the current regime as "looters", he said he had
    felt it important to denounce evil. His name being used on the  leaflet
    publicising the Birmingham meeting in March 2007 was a mistake; he  had
    not approved it. He had never discussed his evidence with W2 or W3.  He
    did not manifest hatred for the regime; the proof of that was  that  he
    was still talking to  people  running  the  DRC.  He  had  never  heard
    questions  being  asked  by  airport   officials   to   failed   asylum
    seekers/deportees about illegal emigration networks. He  was  not  well
    off in the UK but he had never been approached about his  evidence  for
    this hearing by any illegal network.

37.   The submissions which we do not recite, essentially argued either  way
    on the issue of the credibility of witness 1, and  the  reliability  of
    the evidence that he gave concerning events at the airport.

Witness W2
38.   W2 in a statement dated 15 May 2007 sets out the background to how  he
    became involved and employed at the headquarters of the  DGM  in  1998.
    He was one of the prot�g�s  of  a  lawyer  called  MK.  Other  prot�g�s
    included W3 and a person later introduced to him as W1 (at para  32  he
    states that this was whilst he was working in the DGM office).

39.   W2 describes his career as  falling  into  two  stages:  from  1998  -
    October 2001  he  worked  as  an  office/legal  assistant  at  the  DGM
    headquarters; from October 2001 he worked as an Immigration Officer  at
    N'Djili airport. He outlines the nature of his training, instruction in
    the methods of interrogation and torture or ill-treatment, his  general
    role under supervision in  assessing  and  providing  information,  his
    involvement in checking those applying to leave and  leaving  the  DRC,
    and working with  many  official  documents.    Whilst  at  DGM  HQ  he
    attended  interviews  of  failed  asylum  seekers  where  it  was   his
    responsibility to take verbatim notes. From time to time  he  was  also
    actively involved in the detention, interrogation and/or observation of
    persons in detention centres and elsewhere. He describes  ill-treatment
    at Kin Maziere, the DGM detention centre, and of the repeated  multiple
    rape of women, the use  of  humiliating  ill-treatment  and  of  taking
    bribes. He and his supervisor (MB) would hear accounts from these women
    but would not help by releasing them as it was just a reality in  Congo
    that when people are detained they suffer. His superior  at  that  time
    did not take bribes. In an attempt to  discourage  officials  accepting
    bribes the regime  sometimes  tested  its  own  staff  with  undercover
    officers offering fake bribes to see if they  would  be  accepted.  The
    person accepting the bribe would then  be  arrested  and  sent  to  the
    Marshal Court and charged.  Detention at  the  detention  centre  could
    vary from between 3 weeks up to 6 months, sometimes longer.  He  stated
    that eventually (in October 2001, not October 2002 as was stated in  is
    asylum determination) he was  demoted  and  transferred  to  become  an
    Immigration Officer at the airport:  he  adduced  a  transfer  document
    bearing an October 2001 date. The new director of DGM could  not  trust
    the old staff and needed people like W2 whom he could trust.

40.   Failed asylum seekers were,  he  stated,  perceived  as  traitors  and
    criminals and they would be reminded of that during interview. He gives
    a description of the reception of failed asylum seekers  on  return  to
    the airport, the presence of ANR, DEMIAP, RVA and  the  Military  Court
    (COM). He states that  such  persons  are  held  in  a  cell  known  as
    Permanence, which was small (some 3 x 4m in dimensions) and in which up
    to twenty  people  or  so  would  be  kept.   The  WC  facilities  were
    exceptionally limited.  He states that such persons have  their  monies
    and possessions taken away from them. Particularly adverse interest  is
    taken, he says, in those  from  Rwanda,  Uganda  and  Burundi.   Return
    involved an investigation into a person's background and  it  does  not
    necessarily follow that because a person has  obtained  documents  from
    the United Kingdom to enable return that they are accepted on return as
    being of DRC nationality.  He described another restricted part of  the
    airport  building,  called  the  Bureau  Contentieux,  where  only  DGM
    officers are allowed to go -  apart from such as W1 who were very  high
    ranking.  A second stage of interrogation starts  here,  involving  not
    just assessing what  country  the  person  might  come  from  but  also
    questions  concerning  identity,  whether  or  not  crimes   had   been
    committed, to what extent there had been a betrayal of the DRC  regime,
    the nature of the asylum claim that had been made and the use of  force
    if necessary to obtain information. He states:

         "52. ... If the individual lies to us or if  we  feel  that  he  is
         lying to us, we use force to get the person talk.  We punch them to
         get them to talk, we kick them, slap them and threaten to send them
         to prison or threaten to kill them.  We tell him that we will  kill
         traitors and that if they did not want  us  to  kill  him  then  he
         should  tell  the  truth.   We  beat  them  with  batons,   chairs,
         electrical wires and other things.  A  lot  of  the  time  when  we
         finish with them they are severely beaten,  bruised,  cut,  swollen
         and in pain.  We record all of the information that we can get from
         the interrogation and give it  to  our  team  leader.   An  average
         interrogation lasts about two hours.  I find that a lot  of  people
         do not talk and force is necessary..."

41.   He continued at paragraph 52:

         "It is commonplace at the airport during the interrogation  process
         for women  to  be  sexually  abused  and/or  raped.   Many  of  the
         Immigration Officers are not from good background and  are  from  a
         background where it is acceptable to treat women that way."

42.   In addition, W2 identified the locking of doors  during  interrogation
    and the real risk of women being raped, even when there was  more  than
    one interrogator. He states that there is a code of silence between the
    Immigration Officers that  if  they  know  that  someone  has  raped  a
    detainee, then it remains between them.  It can  and  often  does  mean
    that officers group together to  take  over  interrogations  of  female
    returnees, which effectively means that another officer wished to  rape
    the woman after the previous one has finished.   Particular examples of
    ill-treatment, both of men and women, are  given  and  W2  particularly
    describes an event of a woman returnee  being  the  subject  of  sexual
    abuse (paragraphs 58 and  59  by  way  of  example).   He  states  that
    Immigration Officers boast of what they have done.  There is  talk  and
    banter about such matters  as  between  seemingly  different  teams  or
    certainly the same teams. He gives a description of  regular  abuse  of
    women both at the airport and (following  onward  transfer,  which  the
    public is not allowed to observe) at  Kin  Maziere.   No  human  rights
    organisations  would  get  to  see  what  happens  in  any   interview/
    interrogation setting at the airport.

43.   He states that persons, if they are from Rwanda,  Uganda  or  Burundi,
    simply go into the hands of  ANR  security  forces.  He  describes  the
    prevalence of bribery and release through bribery. The bribe had to  be
    significant (400-$1,000 dollars) and had to cover the superiors and the
    whole team. About 20% of detainees were lucky enough to use  bribes  to
    be freed.  W2 identifies his  continued  contacts  (totalling  some  20
    persons), including officers in the ANR and certain officials  in  high
    government cabinet offices.  It is said the information is that torture
    and rape continue at the airport and the procedures are the same in the
    process of moving through the building.  He describes  certain  returns
    to the DRC. His informants had told him that the February 2007  charter
    flight from the UK had got a lot of publicity and there was pressure on
    the government: what happened that day was exceptional,  with  all  the
    senior officers  present  including  the  British  Embassy  and  senior
    representatives from human rights organisations. One  of  his  contacts
    told him he was not against accepting the Congolese from abroad but  in
    any modern society the infrastructure must take place before  accepting
    that movement. He had learnt about an article by a man ( IK) who was  a
    DGM officer who worked at the airport at  the  same  time  he  did;  it
    mentioned W1, W2 and W3. He had heard that many had been  detained  and
    taken to Kin Maziere. W2 speaks of his friendship with W3.  W2 said  he
    did not feel he was properly advised in  his  asylum  appeal.  W2  also
    sought to clarify his presence at the time of the escape of W1.


44.   In his second witness statement  of  10  August  2007,  W2  sought  to
    clarify and give further details about some of his earlier evidence. He
    also mentioned been told since his last  statement  by  a  high-ranking
    source of his that the DGM wrote two letters to the  Interior  Minister
    asking him to cancel the February 2007 charter flight operation because
    DGM viewed asylum seekers as a security risk to the regime  and  needed
    to put procedures in place to deal with them. This led to an  operation
    called "Operation de Recuperation" which relates to  subsequent  arrest
    of returnees. His belief is, from information given by a  high  ranking
    contact, that this method was in use in the DRC to pick up persons  who
    had been admitted  following  return  -  in  order  to  circumvent  the
    monitoring of treatment of returnees.

45.   Produced by W2 is a copy of  the  decision  of  Adjudicator,  Mr  A.G.
    O'Malley. At paragraph 12 the Adjudicator noted that W2 claimed to have
    been employed as an Immigration official in the DRC since  1998,  being
    employed  at  N'Djili  "[b]y  October  2002".   Although   noting   the
    respondent's concession that W2 had been  employed  as  an  Immigration
    Officer, the Adjudicator found W2 otherwise not credible and  dismissed
    his Refugee Convention and ECHR claim.

46.   W2 clarified some of his evidence in  examination-  in-chief  and  was
    subject to cross-examination, essentially challenging the extent of his
    involvement in the DGM and his knowledge  of  events  at  the  airport,
    alleging that he had grossly exaggerated his account  of  ill-treatment
    and of abuse as  put  and  generally  challenging  credibility.   Among
    things covered in his examination were the following. Although  he  was
    now in regular contact with his sources in the  DRC,  some  very  high-
    ranking, he said that after he left the DRC in 2002 he had cut off  all
    relations with the Congo and had no news about it. He only  decided  to
    renew contact in June/July last year when he learnt of the rape of  his
    11 year old daughter by an  official  he  had  accused  of  misconduct.
    Asked to give examples of what information he would  "trade"  with  his
    contacts, he said he would tell them when  Congolese  in  the  UK  were
    planning a march on the DRC Embassy. His first contact with W1  in  the
    UK was a month before the meeting in Birmingham in March 2007;  he  got
    his number from Miss Atherton. He had not discussed  his  evidence  for
    this case with either W1 or W3.

47.   W2 agreed that he had not been in  contact  with  the  UK  immigration
    authorities and until this hearing had not given his address  and  that
    he was listed with them as an absconder since 6 April 2005. He had  not
    contacted them because they had not written  to  him.  He  agreed  that
    steps to crack down on bribery had been taken at  N'Djili  airport  but
    the system was deep-rooted.  Deportees/failed asylum seekers as part of
    a process called "first aid" would have all their possessions including
    suitcases taken from them.  They were "all traitors. No one leaves  the
    airport". Everyone has to  go  to  Kin  Maziere.   People  from  Europe
    sometimes had family waiting, about one in 10 succeeded in  getting  an
    Immigration Officer to intervene by  bribery.  Deportees/failed  asylum
    seekers  were  physically  mistreated  at  the  airport  although  that
    happened more in  Kin  Maziere  or  other  detention  centres.  He  had
    personally been involved in the torture of people at  the  airport  not
    less than 12 times. Rape of women at the airport was automatic. He  had
    witnessed about 3 rapes. He often tried  to  intervene  to  stop  them.
    Generally you could not protest. If he had he would have  been  accused
    of desertion and punished.  He (W2) did not agree that his  account  of
    mistreatment at the airport was a gross exaggeration.  His DRC  sources
    knew about his involvement in this case and have known  since  December
    2006 that he (and W3) had spoken out publicly in  the  UK  against  the
    regime. His sources tried to "combat within the system".  They knew  he
    was a traitor in the eyes of the Kabila  regime.  He  knew  of  several
    occasions - 3 at least - where complaints had been made and Immigration
    Officers  had  been  arrested  for  mistreating  deportees;  some  were
    released afterwards.

48.   W2 stated that he was one of the co-authors (with  W3)  of  a  January
    2004 letter/document entitled "A Report by  Two  Congolese  Immigration
    Officers" about the treatment of asylum seekers once they are  returned
    to the DRC.  He also gave particulars of certain persons with  whom  he
    is still in touch.

49.   The submissions made in respect of W2,  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    were that W2 was a reliable and coherent witness,  giving  evidence  of
    clear levels of risk at the airport. The counter-submissions were  that
    W2 was unreliable, not credible and was not a witness  to  whom  weight
    should be given when set against the background evidence.

Witness W3
50.   W3's statement of 20 May 2007 states that he fled  the  DRC  in  April
    2003. At the time he had been working  as  an  Immigration  Officer  at
    N'Djili airport. He stated that he was appointed to the DGM along  with
    W2. He had been transferred  to  work  as  an  Immigration  Officer  at
    N'Djili airport, along with W2, in around October  2001.  He  became  a
    wanted person after authorising his cousin (who had helped a Rwandan to
    enter) to enter the country. He was detained for 21 days  and  suffered
    abuses before being released in April  2003  with  the  return  of  his
    uniform and DGM ID card. On W3's release he went into hiding before  an
    arranged departure from Ndolo Airport; which is a  lesser  airport  and
    one where  he  was  unlikely  to  attract  significant  attention.   An
    internal flight to Lubumshi and a cross-border  journey  on  foot  into
    Zambia was the route of escape.  Having left the DRC in  May  2003  and
    arrived in the UK he had claimed asylum on arrival.  Following  refusal
    of his asylum claim, his appeal was unsuccessful.

51.   We intersperse here  that  on  21  October  2003  although  the  first
    Adjudicator, Mrs N Bircher, accepted that W3 had  been  an  Immigration
    Officer at N'Djili airport, she otherwise found him  not  credible  and
    dismissed his appeal. Following remittal "for a fresh hearing"  by  the
    IAT on 30 July 2004, a  second  Adjudicator,  Mr  Neil  Davison,  in  a
    determination of 7 October 2004, dismissed his appeal, finding  W3  not
    credible.

52.   In his May 2007 statement W3 sets out his involvement in the DGM.   He
    had to go through training which lasted around a month and a  half.  He
    had public relations and administrative responsibilities.  As  part  of
    his responsibilities he came across very sensitive documents concerning
    asylum seekers: files from the port would tell him why the  person  had
    been deported back to the DRC and whether they had claimed  asylum.  He
    described the procedure as being that failed asylum seekers were  taken
    on arrival to a holding  cell  at  a  place  called  Permanence.  There
    deportees were put through a process called "first aid" which consisted
    in taking away all of their jewellery and valuables. The next stage was
    to take them  to  a  large  office  called  Bureaux  Contentieux  where
    interrogation continued.  Deportees were told, inter  alia,  that  they
    had committed a crime by applying for asylum abroad and betraying their
    country.  If someone was not  forthcoming  they  would  be  threatened,
    violently slapped, punched and stamped on.  Women  suffered  extremely.
    Rape and sexual abuse was commonplace. There  was  a  code  of  silence
    between immigration officers about this. He gave examples of  incidents
    from  December  2001  and  September  2002,  2002  and  January   2003.
    Describing the 2002 incident, he stated  that  colleagues  were  joking
    that his boss had received a delivery  of  "fresh  meat"  from  Europe.
    When his boss had finished raping the woman concerned and had come back
    out of the room, W3 and his colleagues shook his hand  and  joked  with
    him. It was very difficult to release someone from the airport;  to  do
    so would lead to problems with the regime.


53.   After being interrogated in the Bureaux Contentieux deportees  were  -
    within 24 hours - moved to Kin Maziere. His duty was to  take  verbatim
    notes while his boss  did  the  interviewing.  Questions  covered  such
    things as whether the person was a traitor and what was  said  when  he
    claimed asylum. Primarily the interviewers were  worried  about  people
    trying to overthrow the government.

54.   People in detention were ill treated. He had observed an interview  in
    Kin Maziere in 2000 when a woman deported from France  had  been  raped
    and ill treated. He and his officers suspected  that  most  people  who
    fled and applied for asylum were likely to  be  involved  in  politics.
    Rape was a common  occurrence  in  Kin  Maziere  as  at  all  detention
    centres. Conditions there were appalling. The  length  of  time  people
    remained at Kin Maziere varied. High level officials found it difficult
    to openly accept bribes.  In his opinion it was difficult for officials
    to release people at  the  airport  and  Kin  Maziere  having  accepted
    bribes. The government placed spies and tried  to  entrap  people.  But
    corruption at the airports was endemic; the bribe had to be significant
    and enough to cover the whole team including  superiors.  Even  so,  he
    estimated that "only 10% of the failed asylum seekers are able  to  use
    the bribes to be freed".  He had accepted bribes at the airport.

55.   There were no human rights organisations at the airport,  except  when
    they first wrote stating that they wished to visit;  then  things  were
    temporarily presented as if everything was OK.  He had  kept  in  touch
    with his colleagues from the DGM and other organisations and maintained
    contacts, even if not directly, with people with powerful contacts  and
    friends. He gave names. W3 claimed  that  there  were  other  and  very
    serious high ranking sources who he would not disclose except in court.
    His contacts had told him that the  situation  had  not  changed.   His
    sources had told him that the February 2007  charter  flight  operation
    was made to look good to observers but in fact DGM officers  were  told
    to go to the deportees' addresses and  arrest  them  afterwards.  Those
    detained in Kin Maziere would have been tortured.

56.   He described working at the  airport  in  October  2002  when  W2  was
    arrested.  However, the day that W1 and W2 escaped from the airport, he
    was off duty.

57.   W3 had first met W2 in the UK in 2003 and had first  seen  W1  at  the
      March 2007 meeting in Birmingham.

58.   W3 said he was in the process of "building a fresh claim for asylum".

59.   In his second witness statement of 2 September 2007 W2  explains  that
      he had made a mistake in his original claim in  stating  that  he  had
      worked at the  airport  in  2000.  His  previous  representatives  had
      advised him not to change his story, so he had not. He also gave  more
      details about his cousin (whose return had led to his own arrest)  and
      the circumstances he faced when detained.

60.   Together with the statements of W3 there was, inter alia,  his  asylum
    interview record (in which he said he had  worked  at  N'Djili  airport
    since 2000 to March 2003)  a  witness  statement  of  NN,  a  Congolese
    refugee living in the United Kingdom. The latter claimed to have met W3
    in 1998 at DGM headquarters (DGEM) when W3 was posted with that  body's
    legal adviser and then again dealt with him on a working basis in  2000
    and thereafter at the airport when W3 was working at the checkpoints.

61.   In cross-examination Ms Giovannetti challenged virtually  all  aspects
    of W3's account. Among points made by W3 in his oral testimony were the
    following. He had not discussed his evidence with W2 or W1. His  saying
    previously that he had started at the airport in 2000 was a  result  of
    bad advice by his then representatives. He decided to stick to the same
    claim when identifying the photos of him at the airport as being  taken
    in 2000. It was said that, in the light of that advice, to  change  the
    date would damage the credibility of the claim. Asked why NN  had  said
    in his statement that he met W3 working at the  airport  checkpoint  in
    2000, he said he was at the airport then on a  temporary  basis  for  2
    months due to the  war,  to  collect  money.  "[W]e  were  posted  near
    checkpoints", he said. He and  W2  had  written  the  joint  letter  in
    January 2004 so as to alert  human  rights  organisations  in  European
    countries to what was going on at the airport. He  agreed  it  did  not
    mention torture and rape at the airport but they had  not  set  out  to
    provide details and their focus was on specific risk categories. He did
    not know how it had happened  that  he  had  not  produced  the  second
    Adjudicator's determination (by Mr Davison) of his  asylum  appeal;  he
    had asked his current solicitors to ask his previous solicitors  to  do
    that. He had attended around 100 interviews of failed asylum seekers at
    Kin  Maziere  between  1998-2001,  sometimes  with  W2.  His   superior
    conducted all the interviews. He saw many women interviewed. Asked  why
    then he had said in his May 2007 witness statement  that  he  had  only
    ever interviewed one woman in Kin Maziere, he agreed that his  superior
    was present but said that on occasions, as had happened here,   he  had
    to conduct the interviews and leave a space for his  superior  to  sign
    the record.

62.   Torture  and  rape  were  rife  at  the  airport.  He  had  personally
    interviewed about 3 asylum-seekers;  what  he  said  in  his  May  2007
    statement (e.g.  at  paragraph  53)  was  not  based  on  his  personal
    experience. He had never engaged in rape of passengers at  the  airport
    himself; he was a humanist. Asked why he had described shaking the hand
    of his boss after the latter had just raped a  woman  and  joking  with
    him, W2 said he had to hide his real  thoughts;  if  he  had  disclosed
    those he would have been targeted. It was very  rare  for  families  of
    deportees/failed asylum seekers to come to the airport to await them.

63.   W3 also gave some further information about his  current  contacts  in
    the DRC: he said he was in touch with them about  twice  a  month.  His
    senior sources confirmed the situation at the airport had not changed.

64.   Asked about  his  name  appearing  on  leaflets  produced  for  public
    meetings about this intended country guidance case,  W3  said  that  it
    came as a surprise and "we told them (the organisers) about that and we
    were ready to boycott". He agreed, however, that he had spoken  in  his
    own name at Birmingham and Cardiff meetings.

65.   He had often heard about deportees/failed asylum seekers  being  asked
    about  illegal  emigration  networks,  in  order  to  gain  information
    designed to destroy such networks. His family  had  paid  for  his  own
    departure, he had no idea how much it had cost, but it was  not  cheap.
    Fellow nationals of the DRC in the UK did not tell you what  they  were
    doing, but it was his understanding that the majority had  made  asylum
    claims.

66.   In addition W3 produced various photographs  showing  him  in  uniform
    and one  in front of (what was said  to  be)  a  machine  for  checking
    passports.

67.   One of the main points dealt with by both parties in  submissions  was
    whether there had been any concession by the respondent arising out  of
    previous proceedings as to W3's role  as  an  immigration  officer.  Mr
    Jacobs contended that the first Adjudicator had accepted this  and  the
    second Adjudicator was equivocal  and  so  the  first  findings  should
    stand. Miss Giovannetti contended that the terms of the remittal to the
    second Adjudicator made clear that fresh findings were to be  made  and
    the second had not believed any aspect of W3's account.


The IK and the Observer 16 September 2007 evidence
68.   Witnesses W1, W2 and W3 also referred to an article by a Mr  IK  which
    had appeared on a website called Congoscopie. We will  return  to  this
    item and the evidence about it when we assess the evidence  later.  The
    same goes for the account given in the Observer of  16  September  2007
    concerning a man claiming to have been  part of the  personal  security
    corps for the former President Laurent Kabila with personal  experience
    of torturing  detainees  at  Kin  Maziere,  including,  he  said,  many
    deported from the UK, France and Germany.

Miss Jenny Cuffe's BBC report and evidence
69.   This witness  was  the  author  of  the  BBC  World  investigation  of
    December 2005 dealing with  the  treatment  of  failed  asylum  seekers
    returned to the DRC. In her statement dated  18  May  2007  Miss  Cuffe
    describes her career as a journalist spanning some thirty years  during
    which she has worked for the BBC and two national  newspapers  and  won
    several awards, including two for her radio  documentary  dealing  with
    the DRC.   She has made a number of programmes on Africa  although  the
    programme she did in 2005 was her first on the DRC. She  explains  that
    she became involved in the programme because she had heard from British
    solicitors and their clients that they were worried about what happened
    to asylum seekers on return to the DRC but "there was a  lack  of  firm
    evidence".  She decided the best  way  to  find  out  was  to  see  for
    herself. She describes the persons/bodies she contacted and met with in
    the DRC.  She carried  out  her  assignment  (single-handedly)  over  a
    period of eight days in September 2005, although she  had  spent  about
    three weeks researching the background to the  issue  beforehand.    In
    her statement she says that "I was very careful not to see people whose
    credibility I doubt or to refer to information from sources that  I  am
    not satisfied with".

70.   Whilst in the DRC she visited five persons  she  describes  as  failed
    asylum seekers, one from Belgium (who returned in April 2005), one from
    the Netherlands (who returned in 2003), one from Switzerland  (no  date
    given for her return) and two from the UK (returning in  December  2004
    and on January 11, 2005 respectively).   She  only  used  the  Belgian,
    Dutch and one of the UK returnees in  her  programme.  She  also  heard
    whilst in the DRC about several other returned asylum seekers  who  had
    had problems, one of whom she heard about from VSV.  She also  met  and
    interviewed a senior official with the ANR, based at Ndjili airport: he
    told her that failed asylum seekers are questioned about why they  left
    the country and what they told the authorities in the  country  abroad.
    If they said "bad things" about the country whilst abroad, they were at
    risk.  The ANR would know what had been said by  returnees  because  it
    had spies in  lots  of  embassies  around  the  world.  This  man  also
    confirmed that bribes were commonplace within the immigration services.
     He indicated that those with Rwandan connections were mistreated.

71.   She also recounts her interview with a former DGM  head,  Mr  Yamboua,
    whilst he was under house arrest. Yamboua told her he had been  accused
    by the government for taking bribes  from  three  European  governments
    wanting to arrange  special  charter  flights  of  asylum  seekers.  He
    explained, she said, "that the  government  did  not  want  any  asylum
    seekers  returned".  He  denied  taking   any   money   from   European
    governments. She added:

         "He denied any ill-treatment of returning asylum seekers under  his
         watch, but he did confirm that the ANR was operating in the airport
         and he said that sometimes the  DGM  let  returning  failed  asylum
         seekers leave  the  airport,  only  for  the  ANR  to  arrest  them
         outside."  (Emphasis added)

72.   She states that she did not use Yamboua's account in her reports.  She
    also mentioned visiting a member  of  VSV  (Voix  des  San  Voix)   who
    emphasised to her that his organisation's lack  of  resources  made  it
    difficult to monitor returnees. She did not  see  any  VSV  officer  or
    individual at the airport when she used it and she had the  sense  that
    he was trying to give the impression that his  organisation  was  doing
    more than it actually was.

73.   We shall not detail the contents of the 1 December 2005 report,  since
    it largely reflects her witness statement, although she does  quote  in
    it the Vice President of the DRC in charge  of  defence  and  security,
    accepting that there are some cases of  abuses  committed  by  security
    services against returning asylum seekers, but denying  that  there  is
    any policy to harm them. She also reports the UK Home Office position.

74.   The  transcript  of  her  BBC  World  Investigation  report   dated  1
    December 2005 deals, inter alia, with her eventually successful efforts
    to contact one of the UK returnees (who she  had  been  told  by  a  UK
    solicitor had been returned at the  beginning  for  2006  as  a  failed
    asylum seeker and who appeared to her too afraid to say anything on the
    record about the  "hard time" he had  when  he  arrived),  the  account
    given by  the  returnee  from  Belgium,  discussions  with  a  European
    Commission official about monitoring of enforced  returns  from  Europe
    generally and the affair in the Netherlands concerning allegations that
    the Dutch authorities has passed to  DRC  officials  details  of  their
    asylum applications.  Her report ends:


         "While the European Commission plans for the future  we  discovered
         that there are failed asylum seekers in this city [who] were beaten
         and locked away in prison without trial or hiding in  fear  and  no
         one seems to accept the responsibility for  checking  if  they  are
         safe."

75.   In her oral testimony Miss Cuffe  said  she  had  not  formed  a  view
    before she began her assignment. She said that she  had  not  asked  or
    received from any of the  failed asylum seekers  she met any documents,
    nor could she recall asking any of them  for  ID;   she  took  them  at
    their word (although in the Dutch case she had seen media reports about
    his case).  However, she assessed them as credible, based on her  years
    of experience as a journalist.  She could not  recall  asking  any  for
    specific details of their asylum claim or their previous background  in
    the DRC.  She reiterated that from her interview with a VSV member  she
    had formed the  view  that  VSV's  only  current  concern  was  Rwandan
    returnees.  Asked what she thought the senior ANR official had meant by
    his reference to  anyone who said "bad things" about the DRC government
    being at risk, she said  she   thought  that  meant   anyone  who  when
    claiming asylum had said the DRC ill-treated them and/or said they were
    opponents.  In reply to a Tribunal question she agreed  that  it  would
    have been more scientific to have at  least  asked  the  failed  asylum
    seekers she interviewed for documentation relating to  their  identity,
    their  asylum  claims,  their  flight  departure  and  arrival   dates,
    reference numbers etc and also, upon her return  to  the  UK,  to  have
    followed up by way of enquiries with the Home Office and other European
     governments to check if these individuals' claims about  being  failed
    asylum seekers and being on certain flights checked out. She thought it
    was a great shame that a scientific study had not been  done.  She  had
    worked to a seven day deadline to get the programme out and  afterwards
    she had no  ongoing  brief  to  follow  up  any  of  these  cases.  She
    reiterated that in relation to what the failed asylum seekers and  NGOs
    had told her, she "took people on trust".  She had not heard about,  or
    asked anyone any questions about, illegal emigration networks.

Evidence of Elizabeth Atherton
76.   In her witness statements  of  26  June  and  5  September  2007  Miss
    Atherton described herself as the founder of the Congo Support  Project
    which was officially founded in January 2007.  Its aims were to support
    asylum seekers and refugees from the DRC in the UK.  Her voluntary work
    for asylum seekers from the DRC had begun in early 2005, which she  did
    in between her job as a freelance subeditor.    She stated that in  the
    course of her voluntary work she became:


         "...particularly worried about the accounts I  was  receiving  from
         people who had been  removed  to  the  DRC  and  tortured.   I  was
         particularly concerned that the people I met said  that  they  felt
         that at the airport they would be harmed and arrested".

77.   She began to keep accounts of people who had been removed to  the  DRC
    and to try and find out what had happened to them. She heard that Trott
    and Gentry were helping to prepare a country guidance  case  and  as  a
    result she intensified her efforts to trace deportees.  She  emphasised
    that in her experiences it was very  difficult  to  gather  information
    from people. She spoke French but some of the time those she spoke with
    mixed Swahili and Lingala out of habit.   Mostly  she  had  to  conduct
    interviews by telephone and she did not read back details given to her;
    however, she believed the notes she had taken were accurate.

78.   Her statements then detail 14 cases  of  persons  (numbered  1-15  but
    with no case 10) who said they were removed to the  DRC,  two  of  whom
    wished not to give their names to the Tribunal.  Two  were  removed  in
    2005 (8 February 2005, 8 December 2005), two in 2006 (7 and 9  November
    2006) and six in 2007 on the charter flight of 26 February 2007  (cases
    5-11 and 13). Two of  the  accounts  alleged  suffering  or  witnessing
    mistreatment in the process of the detention and removal process in the
    UK or during the flight itself (Case 5, 9-11).  Some said that although
    they had passed through the airport without any  major  problems,  they
    were visited by security services at the places they were  staying  and
    were then arrested and detained (Cases 3, 5, 8, 9). Some said  that  on
    return they had been  interrogated  and  then  beaten  at  the  airport
    (Ndjili) (Cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 13 14).  Some identified, as questions they
    were asked, ones  about  their  political  affiliations  or  activities
    (Cases 1, 2 , 5, 7),  how and why they had left (Cases 2, 12),  whether
    the returnee was a spy (Case 1), why they had returned and why they had
    betrayed their country (Case 1).  Several referred to being transferred
    from the airport to another place (or other places) and being  detained
    and ill-treated (Cases 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 13).   Two mentioned being able
    to escape (Cases 1, 5), some said that since release/escape   they  had
    been in  hiding or were avoiding going out (Cases 3, 5, 7, 13, 14, 15).
    Case 8 (mentioned in an article which appeared in Le Malmores, 4 August
    2007 as escaping a raid on the residential district of Mount Nafula,  a
    commune) had disappeared.  Three  had  managed  to  escape  to  another
    country (Case 2: Malawi, Case 5: Zambia;Case 9: South Africa).  One had
    arranged to return to the UK (Case 1 was given admission  to  join  his
    spouse and was granted a residence permit for five years)  and  another
    was not admitted but was returned to the UK on  the  same  plane  (Case
    11).

79.   In her oral evidence Miss Atherton identified the cases of hers  whose
    names were on the list of charter flight "refoul�s" submitted by E2 and
    gave brief updatings on some of her cases.  Asked how sure she was  the
    returnees she had spoken to were telling the truth, she said  she  went
    by how  they  expressed  their  emotions  and  she  had  no  reason  to
    disbelieve them. Since her second witness statement she had learnt that
    Case 15 had had  further  problems  with  the  DRC  security  services;
    neighbours had said that men from "Bureau 2" had blocked off  the  road
    to look for him, he had gone into hiding. Of  the  roughly  150  people
    from the DRC she had got to know in the UK,  most  were  failed  asylum
    seekers. In some instances she had helped them make fresh claims.   She
    could think of three or four returnees who had come  back  to  the  UK.
    She had put them in  touch  with  Trott  and  Gentry  (agents  for  the
    appellant's solicitors) and three out of the four were  at  that  stage
    willing to give evidence.  She described how she had met W1, W2 and W3.
     it was only when she and colleagues began a series  of  consciousness-
    raising meetings in several UK cities  commencing  in  January  2007  -
    meetings intended to discuss the forthcoming intended country  guidance
    case and to find out if anyone knew of  other  returned  failed  asylum
    seekers -  that she learnt about W1 and was able to make  contact  with
    him.  W1 had been insistent from the beginning that he did not want  to
    be named in any publicity.

80.   She described the series of meetings which  took  place  over  several
    months  as  successful.  The  places  and  approximate  numbers   were:
    Manchester  (200),  Coventry  (80),  Glasgow  (800),  Newcastle   (60),
    Birmingham (100), Bradford (50-60) and Cardiff  (50-60).  The  speakers
    had varied but had included herself, Mr  DW,  someone  from  Trott  and
    Gentry and W2 and W3.  W2 and W3 were quite  open  about  being  named:
    they felt they were doing something for the Congolese  community.  They
    knew they were taking a risk.  The mention of W1's name in the  leaflet
    for the Birmingham meeting was a huge  oversight  for  which  she  felt
    responsible.  She did not know if any of the cases she had collected of
    returned failed asylum seekers had attended the meetings. In  terms  of
    the number of DRC nationals in the  UK,  which  she  understood  to  be
    around 10,000, those who attended these  meetings  were  only  a  small
    percentage. She agreed that in her experience most DRC nationals in the
    UK had not come to the UK through legal avenues under  the  immigration
    law and rules but had come  as  asylum  seekers.   She  had  heard  and
    believed that there were DRC government agents present  and  active  in
    the UK. She agreed that the failed asylum seekers she had had  dealings
    with - as well as W1, W2 and W3 - were people she took on trust and she
    had never asked people about their asylum claims or  whether  they  had
    had criminal records.  Asked about human rights  organisations  in  the
    DRC she had communicated with, Miss Atherton said that they were all in
    need of financial help: to get anything done by them  one  had  to  pay
    money.

Other evidence
Evidence of  DW
81.   In his witness statement of 19 May 2007  DW  states  that  he  is  the
    Chairman  and  founder  of  Lazarus  Refugee   Concern,   a   voluntary
    organisation set up in June 2006 whose primary aim is  to  help  asylum
    seekers, especially detained asylum  seekers,  get  access  to  medical
    treatment or to legal advice.  He often deals with detained individuals
    who have exhausted all legal avenues to stay in the UK.

         "Often having assessed the claim we find out that the person  (sic)
         asylum claim was invariably handled very poorly  by  non-specialist
         immigration solicitors."

82.   Since a lot of detainees expressed a fear to him that they were  going
    to be tortured in N'Djili airport and might not be released, he decided
    to try and find out what happened to such people. His organisation,  he
    stated:

        "had sources that would place people that they knew and trust (sic)
        at the airport to find out what happened to the person,  once  they
        were returned. We would also contact the family members or  friends
        and ask them to confirm the safety  of  the  individual  once  they
        arrived in the DRC".

82.   Between July 2006 and December 2006 he was able to monitor the  return
      of four people and was able  to  get  monitors  in  place  at  N'Djili
      airport for three of them. His information was  that  all  three  were
      arrested. Since December 2006 he had sought to arrange monitors for  2
      further persons being  removed  (one  on  the  February  2007  charter
      flight) but that proved not possible. DW does not number his cases but
      for convenience we shall number them Cases 16-21 (so as to  follow  on
      from Miss Atherton's), taking them in the order he  does.    Case  16,
      returned on 20 July 2007, had been  arrested  by  immigration  at  the
      airport and taken  to  Makala  prison.   He  suspected  he  was  still
      detained. He found hard to believe contrary information  given  to  MP
      Jacqi Lait that this man had been met by members  of  his  family,  as
      this man had told him his only  living  relative  in  the  DRC  was  a
      brother in prison. Case 17, returned on 9 November 2006, had been seen
      at  the  airport  being  taken  away  by  the  "GDM".  DW's  inquiries
      established that he had  been  detained  in  Goma.  Despite  this  man
      promising to contact DW once he had returned, this did not happen.  He
      had not been able to arrange anyone to  witness  his  arrival  at  the
      airport. As regards Cases 19-21, who  were  returned  on  22  November
      2006, 16 January 2007 and February 2007 respectively, he had not  been
      able to arrange anyone to witness their arrival. Despite  arrangements
      for them to call DW when they arrived, none had done so.  DW notes:

        "I have also used similar methods of asking people  to  contact  me
        once removed or detained who are removed to Angola, Nigeria,  Kenya
        and India. On the majority of occasions  I  receive  communications
        from people removed to  these  countries.  In  relation  to  people
        removed to the DRC no one has contacted me."


Evidence Relating to AB (including that from Ms CC)
83.   In response to an application from Mr  Jacobs  made  on  14  September
      regarding AB, the Tribunal agreed that  the  latter  could  give  oral
      evidence.   AB was said to be the same  person  whose  case  Bail  for
      Immigration Detainees (BID) had investigated in 2003  and  about  whom
      the Tribunal in VL (Risk-Failed Asylum Seekers) DRC  CG  [2004]  UKIAT
      00007 had commented (for that reason we employ the  same  initials  as
      were used to describe this man in VL). He was said to have escaped the
      DRC for the second time and arrived in the UK on 29 March  2004.   The
      documents relating to AB include a witness statement from AB dated  12
      September 2007 and a witness statement from Ms CC, dated 11  September
      2007.  Ms CC is a worker at a London Law Centre who previously  worked
      for BID.  Her statement, related, inter alia, the fact that  following
      a judicial review application the Home  Office  certification  of  his
      claim was withdrawn and he was registered as having made a fresh claim
      on 6 August 2004.  As at 11 September, his claim remained outstanding.
      Despite Ms CC declaring in her statement that   AB  "has  informed  me
      that he is willing to give evidence in this Country Guidance case", he
      in fact chose not to do so and Mr Jacobs  formally  told  us  that  in
      these circumstances  he no longer sought to rely on AB's evidence.  Ms
      CC's statement appends some documentation relating to AB some of which
      was before the Tribunal in VL and some of which is subsequent.   There
      is a further unsigned and undated witness statement from Ms  CC  circa
      19 September 2007 explaining that AB had now told her that on  further
      reflection he did not wish to give oral evidence "for fear of damaging
      his own claim [if there were] negative credibility findings in the  CG
      case", although he was happy for the evidence which predated his (new)
      asylum claim to be considered by this Tribunal, including  the  report
      from PT dated 3 November  2003.    Miss  CC's  statement  goes  on  to
      chronicle her involvement in and knowledge of AB's case and to comment
      on the Tribunal in VL's negative  findings  on  AB.   Finally  we  had
      produced at our request a statutory declaration from Ms  CC  dated  24
      September 2007, in  which  she  covers  identical  ground  as  in  her
      statements save for a subhead, "Recent developments",  which  mentions
      her receiving several  threatening  phone  calls  on  her  mobile  and
      reporting them to the police who advised her "to regard it,  at  least
      until  fresh  investigation  showed  otherwise,  as  an   attempt   to
      intimidate a witness in  the  case".   She  gives  a  crime  reference
      number.


June  2004  VSV  Report:  "Narrative  Report,  Programme   of   Observation,
Information and Reception of Persons Expelled from Europe and America"

84.   Having described its  history  as  an  active  NGO  since  1994,  this
    document (which we shall refer to in its translated  version)  explains
    that it consists in a  report  of  its  Programme  of  Observation  and
    Reception of Person Expelled from Europe and America covering 1 January-
     15 April 2004 during which period it recorded 50  cases  of  expulsion
    from foreign countries of Congolese citizens seeking to  emigrate.  The
    report is partly concerned with the conditions  under  which  expellees
    say that they were taken  on  board  their  planes:  it  describes  the
    procedures expellees said they commonly experienced - and  does  so  in
    terms highly critical terms of the European authorities concerned.  But
    it also deals with the procedures at the airport and  what  happens  to
    expellees later on. The report emphasises that  "[t]here  are  frequent
    reports of extortion of assets and personal belongings by officers  who
    think  that  expellees  are  hiding  money  on  them  when   they   are
    repatriated".

85.   Describing its methodology it states that:

         "With regard to the follow-up of persons expelled,  the  person  in
         charge of the programme uses  an  information  sheet  on  which  he
         records all relevant  information  relating  to  this  category  of
         person, including their identity, address,  date  of  repatriation,
         the country from which they  are  arriving,  and  the  opinion  and
         consideration of VSV."

86.   Later on the report notes:

         "For the person  responsible  for  the  programme  of  observation,
         information and reception of expellees from Europe, contact is made
         straight after  the  immigration  formalities  (disputes  service).
         Gaining the trust of the expellee is the primary  objective  before
         doing anything else. Once the bona fides  of  the  observation  and
         reception group have been presented and described, the head of  the
         programme or other person involved  has  a  conversation  with  the
         expellee in which he tries  to  find  out  the  maximum  amount  of
         information on the reasons and conditions of  the  expulsion.  Some
         people are so reserved that they are reluctant to open up easily".

87.   It states that the person in charge  of  the  programme  went  to  the
    airport "two or three times per week to meet international  flights  in
    order to perform his task of observation, information and reception  of
    expellees arriving from Europe". It mentions that "in order to  provide
    better follow-up, VSV has just acquired a location where it is  setting
    up an office or observation and reception point at N'Djili airport."

88.   The description the report  gives  of  the  returns  procedure  is  as
    follows:

         "Whenever an international flight arrives and passengers disembark,
         if a case of repatriation is announced,  the  immigration  officers
         wait for the expellee alongside the aeroplane on the tarmac.  After
         a brief exchange, they take delivery of the person in question  and
         any documentation linked to the expulsion.  The  expellee  is  then
         taken to the immigration bureau, where he is  held  in  a  room  or
         cell, before being questioned by immigration officers. If he  faces
         any charges, he is  taken  straight  away  to  the  police  special
         services office, which has a branch at N'Djili airport, where he is
         also questioned  and  then  transferred  to  another  place  to  be
         detained, if required."

89.   Further on it is noted that expellees from  Europe  are  generally  in
    very low spirits after their treatment at the hands of the  immigration
    officers and are "overcome with fear and shame"  in  relation  to  what
    people might say about them in the areas where  they  are  known.  They
    prefer to settle elsewhere so as to avoid being subjected to all  kinds
    of mockery. "[F]or this reason",  it  adds,  "many  people  give  false
    details when greeted at the airport"; and many generally do not  manage
    to adapt to their new situation. Being expelled by force  is  described
    as being "very hard, bitter and difficult  to  accept",  especially  by
    those who have been in work for a period of time  and  find  themselves
    suddenly deprived of income and other assets. "Almost all of them", the
    report adds, "express a desire to make an immediate return to Europe as
    soon as an opportunity presents itself."

90.   The report goes on to express its opinion  that  "repatriation  causes
    unprecedented prejudice to asylum seekers even if they do not  run  any
    risk of persecution in the case of being  forced  to  return  to  their
    country of origin". It states:

         "Expellees suffer degrading treatment as  subjects  without  rights
         and have no sure way of recovering their assets and other  personal
         belongings that have been wrongly taken. After spending time in the
         West, they sometimes feel disconnected and often lose their ability
         to adapt to the living conditions in their country of  origin.  The
         situation  is  particularly  difficult  in  the  case   of   forced
         repatriation. It should be stressed  that  family  ties  and  other
         relationships count for little in large urban centres in  countries
         rocked by political and socio-economic crises. Forced  repatriation
         is a form of persecution  because  it  obliges  asylum  seekers  to
         return empty-handed, something which is seen as a  serious  failure
         not only by the individuals concerned but by their home countries."

91.   In similar vein  it  later  describes  mass  repatriation  on  charter
    flights as a "humiliating" practice. The report then puts the case  for
    Western  countries  reforming  their  current  removals  practices  and
    putting in place a  "compensatory  mechanism"  to  encourage  voluntary
    repatriation based on incentives.

92.   A  substantial  part  of  the  report  is  taken  up  with  furnishing
    particulars of 70 odd cases,  being  returns  from  European  and  non-
    European countries. Only 10 of these cases involve  removals  from  the
    UK. The most common  reason  given  for  the  expulsion  is  "irregular
    residence" or "clandestine  entrant".  Note  is  made  of  whether  the
    individual was escorted  and  whether  he  or  she  was  handcuffed  or
    otherwise restrained during the flight. Slightly more detail  is  given
    of five "illustrative case studies". Of the 5, only in Case 1 is  there
    any reference to difficulties at the  airport:  reference  is  made  to
    "the little bit of money he had on him (roughly 9 US dollars)  and  his
    cigarettes" being taken from him. What these case examples also confirm
    is that this VSV monitoring exercise was not confined to  the  airport,
    as there is express reference in Cases 2,  3  and  4  to  visits  being
    carried out and in each of the 5 it is clear that VSV  had  ascertained
    what has happened to the deportees after they had left the airport  and
    gone to their homes or places of stay.


Evidence from Congolese Observatory on Human Rights (OCDH) etc
93.   We had written evidence from the private secretary  to  the  president
    of the Committee for Democracy and Human Rights (CDDH) (we shall  refer
    to him as  RK) who was also the chief of staff  of  the  OCDH.  He  had
    discussed  cases  with  Jenny  Cuffe  in  late  2004  and  (before  and
    afterwards) with his contact E2 (Miss Cuffe's statement notes that  two
    of the failed asylum seekers she met had been introduced to her by RK).
     As we shall see, E2's first report notes that his organisation was one
    of the DRC NGOs who had  given  evidence  to  UN  bodies  stating  that
    systematic torture is taking place in the  country  and  that  she  has
    known him since 2000 and regarded  him  as  extremely  trustworthy  and
    honest and as someone who had  a  good  reputation  with  international
    bodies.

94.   After RK had given a speech to a Saturday 25 August  2007  meeting  in
    Manchester on DRC failed asylum seekers in the context of this  pending
    country guidance case, the appellant's solicitor wrote  to  him  asking
    for his replies to a number of  queries  relating  to  a  case  he  had
    mentioned.  In his reply of 11 September 2007  RK  explained  that  his
    involvement with the issue of the treatment of  failed  asylum  seekers
    began in 2000 when he met E2 and her organisation. Around 2004 he  also
    began liaising with a lady from  the  Churches  Commission  for  Racial
    Justice regarding deportees from Great Britain.  He  did  not  wish  to
    present himself as an expert on deportees, although he  had  very  long
    experience.  Time did not allow him to put forward  all  cases  he  had
    come across over many  years,  but  he  would  mention  several  cases,
    relating them as they were given to  him  by  the  witnesses.  He  then
    listed seven cases, 1-7 (which for convenience we  shall  co-number  in
    brackets Cases 22-29).  All were cases he was made  aware  of  by   E2.
    Case 1 (22) experienced ill-treatment at the hands of  Dutch  officials
    prior to and during the removal, which took place on 26  October  2000.
    On arrival at N'Djili airport he was arrested and  detained  for  three
    weeks in a cell in or near Kin Maziere, before being freed on reporting
    conditions. This man was able to produce two documents, which  RK  said
    he was able to verify, on a visit to DGM.  Case 2(23) concerned someone
    deported from Holland on 23 August 2002.  He was interrogated  for  six
    hours at the airport but later received a summons for him to attend DGM
    offices in 17 September 2002.  He went into hiding  but  after  contact
    with the Dutch Embassy was "brought back to Holland".  Cases  3  and  4
    (24 and 25) concerned two women said to have been deported from Holland
    to N'Djili airport in November 2002 and in August 2003 respectively and
    to have been beaten and detained for several   hours  by   DGM  agents.
    Case 5(26) was removed  from  Holland  on  24  October  2003,  and  was
    mistreated at the airport and detained in a DGM cell there for  a  very
    long period because he did not have money. This man had given testimony
    during a TV interview with (Dutch company)  TV  IKON.  Case  6(27)  was
    deported from Holland on 21 January 2004; he had been able to avoid ill-
    treatment at  the  airport  by  pretending  to  be  Ghanaian  and  then
    persuading a DGM officer to take him to RK's office. The  same  officer
    told  RK  that  when  deportees  arrive  at  the   airport   they   are
    systematically arrested and taken to DGM cells in Kin Maziere in Gombe.
    They stay in detention for forty-eight hours and to be released have to
    pay $250 per person. Case 7 was the same family who had been on the  27
    February 2007 charter flight as reported by E2.

95.   RK confirmed  that  there  were  DGM  cells  or  detention  facilities
    "behind Kin Maziere". The British Embassy  had  supported  two  of  his
    organisation's projects (one relating to elections and  one  to  public
    demonstrations). The outgoing ambassador,  who  knew  his  organisation
    well, had never contacted him about the treatment  of  returned  failed
    asylum seekers, although he hoped that with the  new  ambassador  there
    would be effective collaboration between them.

Evidence of E1
96.   E1 is a renowned expert on the DRC.  We  have  already  explained  the
    circumstances under which he  submitted  reports  in  support  of  this
    appeal but ultimately did not attend to give evidence as to the general
    issue of risk to failed asylum seekers. However, in his  letter  of  22
    September 2007 addressed to Trott & Gentry, he confirms that the report
    he wrote and submitted in May 2007 "is  still  valid  and  reflects  my
    current position on the subject of the returned failed asylum seekers".



E1's May 31, 2006 Report
97.   We deal later with E1's first report dated May 31, 2006 insofar as  it
    addresses the appellant's specific case. We chiefly confine our summary
    here to those parts which directly bear on the issue of returned failed
    asylum seekers, but his report also sets out a description and analysis
    of the general situation in the DRC in recent years. General matters he
    mentions include: the  acute poverty in  which  the  vast  majority  of
    population of 50 million people live on the equivalent of US$  0.2  per
    person per day and consume less than two thirds of the  daily  calories
    needed to maintain good health; approximately  70%  of  the  population
    has little or no access to health  care;  1.6  million  Congolese  have
    critical food needs; decades of armed conflict have  resulted  in   3.3
    million  deaths and have created a serious humanitarian situation  with
    as many as 2.5 million internally displaced  persons  (IDPs);  and  the
    fact that the economy in the DRC is increasingly caught in the  web  of
    the international criminal economy and money-laundering  circuits.   As
    at May 31 he considered that:

        "any return under  the  present  circumstances  means  exposure  to
        unbearable suffering for many Congolese. The country is  simply  in
        ruins".

98.   Human rights violations are seen as widespread.   The  justice  system
    lacks independence from the executive power. The security  services  do
    not respect legally binding procedures.

99.   "All prisoners, to different degrees", he writes, "are the  object  of
    cruel,  inhuman  and  degrading  treatment  (whipping,  beatings,   and
    torture)".

100.  Rape of women is common practice in the  detention  centres.   Torture
    is very common in detention. There is general insecurity in the country
    notwithstanding the end of the war (in 2003).

101.  Section D of his  report,  which  deals  with  failed  asylum  seekers
    returned to the DRC,  begins  with  some  general  remarks.   First  he
    emphasises that because of the   terrible economic and social situation
    in the DRC and the tightening of European border controls "a number  of
    stories by asylum seekers are  invented".  Second,  he  emphasises  the
    unreliability of documentation emanating from the DRC: "There is little
    standardisation of the  documents  and  most  can  be  falsified".  The
    security services,  he  states,  sometimes  themselves  sell  authentic
    documents to persons who then adopt the  names  mentioned  therein.  He
    goes on to note that:

        "Asylum seekers are, in a number  of  cases,  sent  by  an  'asylum
        seeker emigration network' with the complicity of  officials  (even
        high level politicians) in the government  administration,  in  the
        immigration services and officials  in  the  embassies  of  foreign
        countries..."


102.  Elsewhere, he explains that the composition  of  the  immigration  and
    security services is very much still in the hands of the groups  around
    the President.

103.  E1 goes on  to  distinguish  between  individual  and  collective  (or
    group) deportations.  Dealing with  individual  deportations,  he  says
    that individuals who travel using valid and ordinary  travel  documents
    (e.g. a valid passport) will, assuming there is no known charge against
    them, pass through  unharmed.   However,  individuals  with  substitute
    documents issued by a DRC Embassy abroad will be easily  identified  as
    failed asylum seekers.  Earlier his report had stated:

        "When failed returned asylum seekers are not returned collectively,
        high level officials of the ministry for  foreign  affairs  are  in
        charge. At the  international  airport  of  N'Djili  and  at  Beach
        Ngobila (entry points for travellers from Congo Brazzaville), their
        passports are confiscated and they are  subjected  to  an  official
        investigation made by the  immigration  services  at  the  airport.
        Afterwards  they  are   normally   transferred   to   the   central
        administration of the immigration services.


        This category  of  person  (i.e.  failed  returned  asylum  seekers
        without known political charges against them) is, in a sense, 'held
        hostage' by these services. They are kept in detention in irregular
        places of detention (often offices) and are released  upon  payment
        of 'fines' that disappear into the pockets of state officials."

104.  As regards failed asylum seekers who are sent  back  collectively,  he
    considers they are even more in danger, since  they  are  automatically
    transferred to the central office of the immigration services  and  are
    only released upon payment of  a  'ransom'  (which  he  defines  as  "a
    significant sums of money").

105.   One  of  the  reasons  failed  asylum   seekers   (whether   returned
    individually or collectively) are treated in this way is that they  are
    seen to have 'dishonoured' the Congolese state.   Even  asylum  seekers
    who are only motivated by reasons of survival, he adds, "are questioned
    by the immigration services".  He states:

         "If these services  have  elements  at  their  disposal  about  the
         particular case of the asylum seeker, they run a  serious  security
         risk and may even disappear".

106.  E1  sees  it  as  important  to  understand  that  the  procedures  he
    describes cannot be considered as uniform and rigid rules:

        "The rules are applied according to the "political conjuncture" and
        their effect may  vary  considerably.  One  element  is  permanent:
        because of endemic poverty, everything can  be  settled  by  paying
        money."

107.  A point E1 emphasises is that from his  sources  in  Kinshasa  he  has
    learnt that sometimes the  DRC  Embassy  in  London  writes  individual
    reports  on  failed  asylum  seekers,  which  are  transmitted  to  the
    authorities in Kinshasa.   His report goes on to identify a  number  of
    risk  categories:   persons  from  Kivu  or  Kasai;  Tutsis  or  anyone
    perceived to be Tutsi (this, he says, is "the category of persons  most
    at risk"); UDPS members; members of Unified Lumumbist Party (PALU); DSP
    members or family members of DSP; high-ranking MPR officials  or  their
    families; and persons suspected of  being  part  of  the  network  that
    planned the assassination of President Kabila.

108.  E1 then comments on the UNHCR position, pointing out that the  UNHCR's
    catalogue of risk categories fails to include  Tutsis  or  'Tutsi-like'
    persons.  He states that otherwise:-

         "The information given by the UNHCR and other sources confirms what
         I have been able to gather through my own  research:  namely  those
         returnees without valid travel documents are  at  risk  on  return.
         When they have outstanding  charges  against  them,  they  will  be
         imprisoned and probably tortured.  When  they  don't  have  such  a
         charge, they will be imprisoned by the security services  who  will
         try to get money from the family."

109.  The final section of this first  report  E1  comments  on  a  previous
    (2005) Tribunal analysis of his expert evidence.   Confining  ourselves
    to matters salient to this appeal, he draws attention  to  a  paragraph
    where he was recorded as saying that if there were no other factors  "a
    person  was  likely  to  get  out  after  paying  money  but  this  was
    speculative".  Commenting on this, he states:

         "That risk of being detained and imprisoned in case of  non-payment
         is a very real one and not just a hypothetical risk ...


         ...


         ... it is important to realise that a person is kept in a detention
         centre when he/she is not able to pay.  This  is  a  means  to  put
         pressure on the family and relatives of the returnee, to force them
         to collect the money to free their relative."

110.  To similar effect he seeks to clarify that his position  in  2005  was
    that whilst failed  asylum  seekers  'per  se'  were  not  at  risk  of
    persecution, "they  are  at  risk  of  cruel,  degrading  and  inhumane
    treatment because of the risk of being detained in a  detention  centre
    when they are unable to pay a bribe to secure their release."

111.   Commenting  on  another  paragraph   in   which   the   Home   Office
    representative had alleged that  there  was  a  considerable  vagueness
    about some of [E1's] evidence, such as his evidence about a  particular
    flight where people were said to have been detained and also about  his
    methodology for obtaining information, E1 comments, "I am currently  in
    the process of gathering more precise information on this point".

E1's May 17, 2007 Report
112.  That brings us to his latest report of  May  17,  2007.  Concentrating
    our summary on points not  already  made  in  his  earlier  report,  he
    emphasises that the risk categories for failed refused  asylum  seekers
    are not always indicative as the political  situation  is  in  constant
    flux. The fact that the procedures at the airport are  not  unified  or
    standardised  gives  the  officials  there  an  important   scope   for
    independent action and an ability to intervene and  take  advantage  of
    the vulnerable position of the returnees and secure for  themselves  an
    additional source of income:

         "A specific person who is a member of the ANR  or  the  immigration
         services DGM when with  a  specific  returnee's  case  may  have  a
         relatively important space for decision making. He /she will make a
         risk assessment  as  to  the  income  he  may  generate  from  this
         particular case.  The normal course of action will be to ask for  a
         bribe in exchange for letting the returnee go.  A part of the bribe
         will  normally  go  to  his/her  hierarchal  superiors.    However,
         reliance [on] a returnee may  entail  a  risk  in  some  particular
         cases, if e.g. this person is specifically targeted for judicial or
         political reasons or both ... If this risk is too high, the ANR  or
         DGM officer will not  accept  a  bribe  but  put  the  returnee  in
         detention. This signifies that is it very difficult to foresee  the
         course of action from the DGM/ANR offices at the airport  or  Beach
         Ngobile". (emphasis added)


113.  E1 explains that there are four different sources  of  evidence  which
    he bases himself on: DRC officials (at different levels) with different
    knowledge of the airport procedures; interviews with some failed asylum
    seekers from Europe and other countries; human  rights  activists  from
    VSV  and  Association  Africaine  de  Defense  des  Droits  de  l'Homme
    (ASADHO); plus an airplane company contact.

114.  E1 says that from the evidence he collected "the  central  (official!)
    preoccupation of the  intelligence  and  immigration  services  is  the
    struggle against the clandestine immigration networks".   This  is  "in
    accordance with  the  demands  coming  from  Western  governments".  In
    practice some members of the DGM are collaborating with these networks.
     In terms of  written  instruction  to  airport  officials,  "there  is
    nothing very much specific  on  the  failed  returned  asylum  seekers,
    except the call upon the agents to audition  [them]  with  the  aim  of
    detecting emigration networks". Other questions asked were  about  "the
    conditions of their departure were  from  the  country  abroad  and  to
    detect possible abuses from the European administration".

115.  In the  course  of  describing  the  procedures   at  the  airport  in
    relation to returnees whose expulsion has been "done  with   violence",
    E1 notes that  "depending on the seriousness of the case, they are  led
    to the  head office of the  DGM at Kin-Maziere  before being redirected
    to the ANR, to the  DEMIAP or to justice department within forty-eighty
     hours".

116.  E1 emphasises that there is close collaboration  between  the  various
    services at the airport, DGM and ANR in particular. They utilise wanted
    lists, one covering persons (or categories) prohibited from leaving the
    country, the other identifying those of interest on return.

117.  Adverting to the opinions  of  VSV  and  ASADHO,  he  identifies  four
    inconsistencies between his information and that given by VSV:  no  NGO
    has an official representative or observer at the airport;  no  "police
    station" is charged with the  detention  of  returnees;  any  detention
    centres where returnees are held are in  the  city;  the  size  of  the
    payments of failed asylum seekers to bribe officials successfully is in
    fact larger. He ventures some "tentative" explanations as to VSV's  and
    ASADHO's incorrect description (as he sees it) of certain matters: that
    their reports  are  not  based  on  preliminary  inquiries  or  serious
    completion of data; that they wish to preserve their image  as  serious
    NGOs; that their view on failed returned  asylum  seekers  makes  their
    opinions a little more credible in cases they  themselves  take  up  of
    political asylum seekers.

118.  E1 next turns to the issues of  "the  level  of  risk  on  return"  to
    failed returned asylum seekers:

         "It is essential to realise that failed returned asylum seekers are
         not ordinary travellers. When they  are  identified  (and  this  is
         mostly the case); they constitute a group  directly  or  indirectly
         engaged in a form of political activity.  They are, in  all  cases,
         the object of careful  scrutiny  by  the  immigration  or  security
         services. In many cases, they are released  against  payment  of  a
         bribe; when a risk factor is involved they are detained for shorter
         or longer periods."

119.  Addressing the treatment of failed asylum seekers  (other  than  those
    with valid travel documents such as passports) he states that:

         'The treatment of this category of persons is greatly determined by
         one element: money (however: see also the following sections).  The
         DGM and/or ANR services at the airport will ask [for] money  [from]
         any failed asylum  seeker  returning  from  Europe  or  the  United
         States.  Local belief  holds it that anyone  returning  from  those
         continents must have relatively  considerable  financial  means  at
         his/her  disposal, making them an interesting prey for  badly  paid
         officials  who  also   must  'redistribute'  something   to   their
         hierarchical superiors.  The requested sums  may  be  considerable,
         varying from US$200 to US$1,000. The sum put forward by VSV in  the
         UNHCR letter referred to above [US$5 to US$10] is not accurate.'


120.  If the returnee refuses to  pay,  "all  kinds  of  pressure  including
    physical pressure" will be exerted so that he/she pays or asks  his/her
    family to pay.

121.  His report goes on to state that any transfer from  the  airport  into
    any kind of detention centre will result  in  ill-treatment,  including
    rape, for both males and females.

 122. His report documents the offences for which some  returnees  may  face
      punishment if they are considered to  have  fake  documents,  to  have
      given false testimony, committed  offences  abroad  or  escaped   from
      prison (in the  DRC). It often happens, he says, that any  offence  is
      invented by the ANR/DGM officials to pressurise a returnee to pay  the
      requested sum of money.  He considers that the situation for returnees
      from the UK "has currently specific characteristics linked  to  events
      happening in October 2006" (e.g. when a director of Kabila's  cabinet,
      She Okitundu, was physically attacked in London); there have also been
      attacks on prominent pro-Kabila individuals in Brussels and Paris.  He
      adds:


         "As  the  Congolese  community  in  the  UK  is  very  active   and
         aggressive, and because of the action taken against  She  Okintundu
         and Jaynet Kabila, all returnees from the UK is [sic] the object of
         a very  specific  attention  from  the  relevant  services  at  the
         airport.  They are very thoroughly interrogated and  run  a  higher
         risk that they would not be  believed  than  returnees  from  other
         countries."

123.  His report  then  discusses  specific  risk  categories,  reaffirming,
    inter alia, that these include Tutsis or persons perceived  as  Tutsis.
    He interposes this observation:

         "It is also important to stress that any failed asylum seeker  from
         the UK  will be treated with much suspicion as  all  returnees  are
         considered to be anti-Kabila and adherents  of  N'Gbanda's  APARECO
         movement."

124.  The final section of this report is  comprised  of  comments  on  some
    other documents. As regards the Jenny Cuffe BBC report published on the
    BBC website on 1 December 2005, he  considers  that  what  it  says  is
    consistent with his own report on several matters but  inconsistent  on
    two.  Commenting on the fourth of six points of accord, he writes:

         "There is indeed no  evidence  that  asylum  seekers  as  such  are
         persecuted. But they all have to pay a bribe for their release.  If
         they refuse to pay or are unable to pay, they are detained as a way
         of  pressurising  them.  The  authorities   are   concerned   about
         emigration networks, whether a person has  committed  a  crime  and
         particular attention is currently paid to those from the  UK.   The
         authorities assume that people are lying and  use  the  methods  of
         obtaining information as described throughout the report ..."

125.  E1 also deals with the Home Office COIS Report, 14  February  2007  at
    paragraph 36.03 [which states, inter alia, that it is considered by the
    FCO that there is no evidence that returned failed asylum  seekers  are
    specifically targeted for adverse treatment]. It is, he says:

         "consistent with the contents of this report, although I have  some
         doubts  about  the  thoroughness  of  the  mentioned   sources   of
         information ... I agree that there is no  persecution  of  returned
         asylum seekers per  se.  On  the  other  hand,  all  returnees  are
         interrogated (on minutes) and the persons  who  may  face  criminal
         prosecution are those with individual travel documents or  who  are
         the  object  of  criminal  investigation/arrest  warrant.   It   is
         important to note, however, that this is a general  statement  that
         does not exclude the existence of specific categories of person who
         are at risk ..."

126.  He qualifies his endorsement of the whole of paragraph 36.03 with  the
    following remarks:

         "I do not  think  that  there  is  any  embassy  or  NGO  that  has
         undertaken an in-depth investigation of the fate of failed returned
         asylum  seekers,  including  contacts  with   DGM/ANR  officers  on
         return.  I also would like to stress the existence of specific risk
         categories."

127.  He next directs his attention to paragraph 36.08 of  the  same  report
    which summarises the  view  expressed  in  the  EU  Report  on  Illegal
    Migration, April 2006, that there is no  reliable  evidence  of  failed
    asylum seekers  being  specifically  targeted  for  harassment  by  the
    security services and  concludes  with  the  sentence:  "harassment  is
    experienced by the majority of travellers, both Congolese or foreign."

128.  To this EI responds:

         "I totally disagree with this paragraph if it wants to assert  that
         failed returned asylum seekers are as much or as little harassed as
         ordinary travellers. There is ample evidence that all failed asylum
         seekers are interrogated, some specific  cases  detained,  and  all
         subjected to the payment of bribes for their release."

Evidence of E2
129.  E2 was produced by the appellant as an expert who has close  knowledge
    of the DRC and who has taken a particular interest in  issues  relating
    to DRC returnees for a number of years.

130.  The first report of E2 is dated 12 March 2007 and is headed  "Expert's
    report on the issue of failed asylum seekers who are returned by  force
    to the DRC". E2 refers to the  work  of  the  Havermans  Commission  in
    Holland (whose initial report, dated 9 December 2005 concluded that the
    "reception committee" set up by the Dutch government in September  2003
    to monitor the arrival and reception of returnees from Holland  to  the
    DRC was only intended to cover "group deportations" and had  only  been
    convened once in November 2002).  She had no  knowledge  of  any  group
    deportations for the past five years.

131.  Her first report describes the return procedures at  N'Djili  airport.
    Her information, she states, is drawn from reliable  sources  including
    persons  who  work  as  immigration  officers  at  this  airport.   She
    describes the situation at N'Djili airport as characterised by   "chaos
    and insecurity".  Failed asylum seekers are handed over to the  DGM  at
    the stairs of the plane and then  face  rough  handling,  enclosure  in
    dirty claustrophobic rooms ("cells") and "being  accused  of  behaviour
    that undermines the state by virtue of claiming asylum abroad".  He  or
    she is locked in a "cachot" (cell) and then interrogated in the offices
    of the  DGM at the airport.   After a brief interrogation all deportees
    (unless they are asked for and can pay a bribe) are taken  to  the  DGM
    headquarters in the city for further  investigation.   There  are  only
    supposed to be five services at the  airport  but  in  fact  there  are
    seventeen. Sometimes the ANR wear DGM uniform. These different services
    are also there, she says, to spy on each other.  For a number of years,
    she notes, the Congolese media have carried  items  exposing  the  fact
    that the situation at the airport is chaotic and the security  services
    at the airport "bother" passengers and behave high-handedly.

132.  In addition to the DGM the other government services  at  the  airport
    include: RVA, Customs and Excise, Congolese Inspection Service,  Public
    Health Service, the  Special  Services,  the  ANR,  DEMIAP,  DIVK  ASA,
    Republican Guard, city security services, the  state  protocol  service
    and "Bureau 2". She considers it "highly likely" that  a  person  being
    repatriated is recognised by the airport authorities  as  a  failed  or
    former asylum seeker.

133.  She had heard of two or three  cases  where  deportees  could  not  be
    traced several days after arrival. During interrogation by the  DGM  at
    the airport people are asked for their  personal  details,  address  in
    Kinshasa and from where they were deported.  At  DGM  headquarters  the
    interrogation is more in-depth and concerns the reasons  for  going  to
    Europe, what they have done during their time in Europe, who they  have
    associated with there and why they were forcibly repatriated.

134.  In general, deportees continue to be considered as offenders and as  a
    danger to the authorities. This is for  two  reasons:  firstly  because
    they assume the asylum  seeker  has  said  negative  things  about  the
    country and secondly "because back in  Congo  he  can  stir  unrest  by
    criticising the  people  in  power".  At  the  airport  people  can  be
    assaulted and receive inhuman treatment. Any interrogation in  the  DRC
    is always accompanied by violence, beatings, insults  and  humiliation.
    Each asylum seeker who comes from Paris or London is suspected of being
    connected with APARECO or with the  group  who  attacked  high  profile
    Congolese  visitors  in  London.  She  stated  that  a  year  ago   her
    organisation had traced  a  number  of  people  in  Kinshasa  who  were
    deported asylum seekers.  Over a couple of weeks her  organisation  had
    amassed fifty contacts but few of them wanted to talk  about  what  had
    happened. She mentions two examples.

135.  Her first report contains  several  criticisms  of  VSV.  Another  DRC
    human  rights  organisation  was  unable   to   find   an   independent
    confirmation of VSV's claim that it kept an office at the airport.   As
    regards VSV's report on monitoring of 16 April  2004,  she  points  out
    that of the seventy cases it lists, four or five were  duplicated.  She
    then states that her organisation tried  to  visit  as  many  of  these
    people as possible:

         "In 75% of cases we were successful and  discovered  that  none  of
         them had ever had contact with the VSV.  In general people  reacted
         very angrily to this malpractice."

136.  A third criticism was that it was strange that VSV  had  mentioned  to
    UNHCR that   the figure of US$5 - US$10 must be paid  to  "police"  for
    corruption, as it was the DGM who settled things  with  deportees,  not
    the police.

137.  A further criticism was that the VSV version  (not  aware  of  any  of
    those persons being detained and/or tortured) diverged from the version
    given to her by her DGM sources. In her view  VSV  management  provided
    this  "rather  more  reassuring  picture"  to  secure   financing   for
    monitoring projects. VSV, she says, "has  taken  up  the  view  of  the
    government without having to mention this as such". She adds  that  she
    could not understand why the head of VSV should say expellees would not
    face ill treatment on return when he himself  was  obviously  aware  of
    "the imprisonments": she cites a VSV press release  of  13  March  2005
    which refers to the long  term  detention  of  JN  said  to  have  been
    deported back to the DRC from Germany in November 2004.

138.  Her report goes on to deprecate some of the views UNHCR had  expressed
    about rejected DRC asylum seekers in its letter of 19 April 2006.  They
    arose, she says, because UNHCR  is  not  actively  involved  with  this
    issue.  She points out that the UNHCR recommendation  that  no  one  is
    deported to Kinshasa if they do not have family there has been  ignored
    by European  countries.   She  criticised  UNHCR  for  vagueness  about
    sources and evidence and says it is not clear why  they  consulted  the
    VSV and ASADHO but not other human rights NGOs.

139.  Her first report mentions several human rights and/or lawyer  contacts
    in Kinshasa who have expressed concerns to her organisation  about  the
    risks for returning asylum seekers. One of the  lawyer's  contacts  had
    mentioned an incident in December 2005 concerning the family of someone
    who had been granted asylum in the Netherlands.  This contact specified
    the articles of DRC legislation "under which people  put  on  trial  as
    former asylum seekers are accused".  This contact also promised to  try
    and obtain court judgments dealing  with  such  persons,  but  after  a
    number of fruitless attempts she had heard  nothing  more.    She  also
    mentions being told by another lawyer that many  deportees  were  being
    arrested by the security services and imprisoned; however, she does not
    record his mention of any specific cases. She states that with the help
    of a DRC NGO she had obtained in December 2005  a  list  of  the  eight
    indictable offences set out in the Code de Competence et l'Organization
    Judiciaire under which asylum seekers are  "seized":  offences  against
    national security; offences against the Head of State, offence  against
    Heads of State of another country and  insults  to  foreign  diplomatic
    agents; insult to the Head of State provided that he makes a complaint;
    and subversive propaganda.

140.  Another section of her report dealt  with  Dutch  investigations  into
    whether the Dutch authorities handed asylum dossiers held  on  any  DRC
    returnees to  the  DRC  and  the  conclusions  of  the  Dutch  National
    Ombudsman regarding this in February 2007.

141.  She states that the ANR have photographs of all  Congolese  people  in
    the UK who have attended meetings of Congolese  people.  Currently  the
    situation of Congolese people living in the UK was extremely  dangerous
    as the result of recent attacks in London on Kabila aides:

        "The consequence at a lower level is that the Congolese people  who
        were involved in these activities    will  undoubtedly  lose  their
        lives as they fall  into  the  hands  of  the  Congolese   security
        service ... Their revenge will be terrifying."

142.  Her report  also  deals  with  conditions  in  prisons  and  detention
      centres in the DRC. That is not per se an issue in this appeal, but it
      is relevant to note her reference to a Committee of Observers on Human
      Rights (CODHO) briefing of 5 September 2006 regarding nineteen  people
      arrested and ill-treated by Detection Militaire  des  Activites  Anit-
      patrie (DEMIAP) which said  that  all  were  "refugees  and/or  asylum
      seekers of Rwandan origin".

143.  Her report also deals with the risk to women of rape at the  hands  of
      the prison guards.

144.  As regards the second stage after the  release  of  deportees  at  the
      airport, she notes the concerns of one reputable government source  as
      well as Amnesty International (AI refers  to  2  "possible  problems")
      regarding reports of visits by security agents made to  the  addresses
      of deportees some weeks after they have been released.

145.  She next gives an overview of what certain EU  governments  have  done
      by way of monitoring the returns of deportees to the DRC. She adverted
      to an entry in the British COIS Report of  14  February  2007  stating
      that the Belgian Embassy in a July  2003  letter  had  said  that  the
      Belgian Immigration Department monitored  the  treatment  of  returned
      failed asylum seekers to the DRC. That information,  she  states,  has
      been refuted by a study conducted by the Flemish Refugee Council.  The
      same Council in a separate November 2005 study had described two cases
      of imprisonment in the former Makala prison which occurred immediately
      after  deportation.  Having  returned  to   the  subject  of  the  VSV
      monitoring and her doubts about the reliability of VSV's 16 April 2004
      reports,  E2  concludes  that  neither   systematic   nor   incidental
      monitoring is being carried out by any  European country.

146.  Referring to the existence of an extremely large number of  registered
    and unregistered NGOs in the DRC, she states that  information  on  the
    treatment of deported asylum seekers cannot  easily  be  obtained  from
    those sources. She identifies three  NGOs  which  should  be  consulted
    about this issue because "each of them has knowledge of concrete  cases
    of Failed Asylum Seekers (FAS)  who  have  experienced  problems  after
    being deported": the Observatoire Congolais des Droit  Humains  (OCDH);
    International Society for Human Rights/Congo (ISHR/Congo) and Committee
    of Observers on Human Rights (CODHO).

147.  She then refers to a "fact-finding mission" taking place  in  December
    2005 - beginning February 2006. In this time, she says, "we traced  and
    spoke to a large number of people". In an appendix this is said to have
    been  "at  least  fifty  people  in  about  twenty  meetings".    Their
    experiences (despite not knowing each other)  were  generally  similar:
    threatened,  roughly  handled  by  the  Congolese  authorities  at  the
    airport, detained, houses vandalised, living in hiding. She notes  that
    it was particularly   difficult to gain the confidence of these  people
    so as to obtain audio and DVD  evidence.  Strangely,  she  said,  after
    first contact from her organisation none made any  further  contact  to
    see if it could offer them any help or  support.   (We  have  seen  the
    DVDs/ transcripts).

148.  Her appendices include a copy of the proceedings of  a  26  July  2005
    meeting which took place in Kinshasa  between  the  OCDH  and  a  Dutch
    delegation in which the OCDH representatives referred to "two cases [of
    returned failed asylum seekers] among others": details are given.

149.  E2's second report dated 23 June 2007,  although  entitled  "A  Report
    about Congolese who have been removed to Kinshasa", is largely  devoted
    to one case: that of WY.  E2 explains that her  organisation  had  been
    asked by Trott &  Gentry  Solicitors  to  undertake  investigations  in
    Kinshasa as regards the fate of  the  Congolese  who  were  removed  to
    Kinshasa from London on  the  26  February  2007  charter  flight.   As
    regards the arrival of the charter plane,  she  stated  that  they  had
    received a witness statement from a "reliable partner" who had observed
    the arrival from beginning to end. The formalities  at  Ndjili  airport
    took place without the obvious rough treatment, though those  concerned
    were much stressed. She then refers to  her  follow-up  on  information
    given to her by a colleague in the  form  of  the  name  and  telephone
    number of "the leader of a Congolese NGO with whom one of  the  victims
    of removal of last February was staying  in  hiding":   JP.   She  then
    recounts unsuccessful attempts to meet with WY and having to make do in
    the end with a telephone interview.  She annexes  her  record  of  this
    interview in an appendix.  WY's account speaks of he and his  wife  and
    child being three of the deportees who were returned on the 26 February
    charter flight, the house where he and his family  were  staying  being
    raided by security services several hours later, he being taken off  in
    a jeep and then beaten up with  barbed  wire  somewhere  in  the  Mount
    Nabula area, then finding himself in a "cachot" (cell) with  two  other
    prisoners facing further beatings and interrogations, being  confronted
    with photos of himself at demonstrations  in  London  and,  in  between
    further beatings, being accused of  assaulting  a  Kabila  aide  (  She
    Okitundu), being taken off in  a jeep  and being   dumped in  the  bush
    and finding himself being taken to a Red  Cross  dispensary  and  being
    cared for there for three days. Several weeks later,  he  goes  to  the
    British Embassy to apply for an NGO job advertised via the Embassy.  On
    his way out of the Embassy gates (having been  interviewed  about  this
    application), he is abducted by DRC security men in two jeeps and taken
    to Kin Maziere where  he  faces  further  interrogation,  before  being
    eventually allowed, on payment of a bribe, to phone and receive a visit
    from his brother.  During this visit WY asks   his brother to "alert JP
    from the NGO as well  as  the  Red  Cross".  Three  days  later  he  is
    released.

150.  The report  also  mentions  trying  to  follow  up  on  "snippets"  of
      alarming information from a number of  sources  [in  Britain]  between
      March and June 2007 and events subsequent to 26  February  2007.    It
      proved impossible to follow this up because her organisation  had  not
      received information on how to make contact with the victim  or  their
      nearest relatives.

151.  Before us there were also several further  letters  and  e-mails  from
    E2.  One dated 11 September 2007 was partly devoted to  a  response  to
    the criticism made to the British Embassy  of  her  organisation  by  a
    Dutch Embassy in Kinshasa source who had  said  that  her  organisation
    often takes "a very activist approach on  behalf  of  Congolese  asylum
    seekers who (then) turn out to be  fraudulent  during  the  procedure".
    That  criticism,  she  said,  was  wrong,  since  her  organisation  is
    concerned only with  information-gathering  at  the  request  of  legal
    representatives  of  asylum  applicants.    She   explains   that   her
    organisation's assistance has often led  to  asylum  seekers  initially
    disbelieved succeeding in their claims. She  then  gives  several  case
    examples. On 13 September 2007 she  reports  on  her  contacting  three
    names sent to her  by  Trott  &  Gentry  of  persons  thought  to  have
    undergone abuse after the arrival on the charter flight of 27  February
    2007.  One, she says, she could not contact because she was told he had
    disappeared. Another, a  woman,  described  being  threatened  by  male
    officials at N'Djili  airport  threatening  to  have  her  detained  in
    Makala, but being rescued by a woman who bribed these officials to  let
    her recover her handbag and other  luggage  and  go  free.  This  woman
    considered she had a lucky escape as in her handbag was her Home Office
    refusal. She described having to live  in  difficult  conditions  under
    another identity.  The other person E2 spoke to described spending  two
    periods of detention in Kin Maziere during which  he  was  interrogated
    and ill-treated before being released on the intervention of a relative
    who paid a bribe. This other person also described  being  asked  about
    his activities in the UK and accused of  dishonouring  his  country  by
    saying things against it abroad.  He was also asked about  how  he  had
    got out of the country.

152.  E2's further letter also details other contact with WY and with JP  in
    which she is told WY is now living in hiding having left  Kinshasa.  WY
    was adamant the Red Cross could provide a letter and photograph of him.
     She had asked WY by phone about his reference to  "passports" which he
    had earlier told E2 had been taken from him  by  the  DRC  authorities.
    She records  him  as  confirming  in  reply  that  they  took  all  his
    documents. He added that just before putting him on the plane in the UK
    the British "had  handed  him  his  complete  asylum  file".   He  also
    mentioned his wife complaining at N'Djili airport to a British  Embassy
    official and the fact that the DRC authorities had stolen everything of
    his. In reply to his wife the British  Embassy  official  had  said  he
    would record the complaint and that his Embassy would write to the  DRC
    government.

153.  A further 16 September letter from E2 to Trott  and  Gentry  describes
    further communication with JP about WY as well as her having phoned the
    number of a person in charge of the Red Cross in Limete (she gives  his
    name)  who  had  confirmed  that   his   organisation   knew   of   her
    organisation's concern about WY's case and said that he  was  happy  to
    furnish a letter and to provide confirmations if necessary.

Tribunal Country Guidance

154.  The Tribunal in AB and DM (Risk Categories Reviewed  -  Tutsis  added)
    (Democratic Republic of Congo) CG [2005] UKAIT 00118 broadly  confirmed
    the list of risk categories identified in the earlier country  guidance
    decision in VL (Risk - Failed Asylum Seekers  (Democratic  Republic  of
    Congo)) CG [2004] UKIAT  00007,  namely,  those  with  a  political  or
    military profile in opposition to the government,  but  found  that  in
    view  of  the  increase  in  anti-Rwandan  feeling,  Tutsis,  or  those
    suspected of being Tutsis, were at risk of being  associated  with  the
    Rwandans.   It  found  further  that  the  assessment  of  risk  in  an
    individual  case,  would  depend  upon  a  careful  analysis  of   that
    individual's origins, background and profile.

155.  The issue of 'profile' was a matter that the Tribunal  in  AB  and  DM
    referred to at paragraph 34 of its determination.  It  reiterated  that
    there continued to be a  real  risk  for  those  with  a  political  or
    military profile and that each case was to be judged on its own  facts.
    But it was possible now to provide a little more detail at least  about
    those who  fell  within  the  'political  profile'  sub-category.   The
    Tribunal continued at paragraph 45 as follows:

         "We would emphasise first of all that the use of the word 'profile'
         highlights the fact that this category  is  intended  to  mark  out
         those whose actual perceived military or  political  activities  or
         involvements are  likely  to  have  brought  them  to  the  adverse
         attention  of  the  Kabila  regime.   The  mere  membership  of  an
         opposition political party will not demonstrate that a  person  has
         such a profile". (Our emphasis).


156.  In MK (AB and DM Confirmed) Democratic Republic  of  Congo  CG  [2006]
    UKAIT 00001 the Tribunal  was  concerned  with  an  HJT  Research  News
    Reporting Service Item of 27 June 2005  concerning  suspension  by  the
    Netherlands for a period of the return of asylum seekers  to  the  DRC.
    The Tribunal concluded that it did not afford a  sufficient  basis  for
    modifying the conclusions on failed asylum seekers reached  in  AB  and
    DM.

157.  At  paragraph  51(3)  the  Tribunal  confirmed  as  an  existing  risk
    category:

         "... those  having  or  being  perceived  to  have  a  military  or
         political profile in opposition to the government.

158.  It stated that:

         " the risk fluctuates in accordance with the  political  situation.
         On the basis of the evidence before us, the current position is  as
         follows.  The Tribunal accept there is a real risk at  present  for
         UDPS activists."

159.  In MM (UDPS members-Risk on return) Democratic Republic  of  Congo  CG
    [2007] UKAIT 00023 the Tribunal stated that:

        "201.  Looking at the objective situation as a whole,  and  mindful
        of the past history of the DRC, we have concluded that despite what
        appears to be a dramatic change in the  political  landscape,  that
        carries with it the  hope  that  it  will  result  in  much  needed
        stability in this vast and previously divided country, it would  be
        premature to hold that  these  prospects  have  yet  translated  to
        adequate improvements on the ground, so as to justify a revision at
        this stage of the Tribunal's view of risk to UDPS members, as  held
        in AB and DM , endorsed in MK  and which we thus re-affirm.


        It  follows  that  we  continue   to   believe   that   low   level
        members/sympathisers of the UDPS for that reason alone, will not be
        at real risk on return to the  DRC  in  the  current  climate,  but
        conclude that it is too early in the process of the  transition  of
        the DRC to democratic rule, to find that  there  is  no  continuing
        threat on the part of the current Kabila regime to  persecute  UDPS
        activists.  As the Tribunal in AB and DM rightly observed, the risk
        category to those having or being perceived to have a  military  or
        political profile in opposition  to  the  government  is  one  that
        "fluctuates in  accordance  with  the  political  situation."  (See
        paragraph 51(iii)) of their determination)."


The background evidence
160.  Since there is no real dispute between the  parties  about  the  basic
    country conditions in the DRC, we shall confine what  we  say  here  to
    summarising what background sources tell us about:  (1)  the  different
    police and security services which exist in the  DRC;  (2)  the  latest
    situation in the country following the recent  Presidential  elections;
    (3) the evidence about asylum-related  returns  to  the  DRC;  and  (4)
    evidence of specific relevance to the appellant's case.

161.  Describing the different government agencies involved in security  and
    policing, the Home Office COIS Report for July 2007 states that:

         "10.01   The US State Department Report on Human  Rights  Practices
         in 2005 published on 8 March 2006 (USSD 2005) reported as follows:

         "The security forces consist of a national police force,  including
         the Rapid Intervention Police unit, which the Ministry of  Interior
         oversees;  an  immigration  service  under  the  Ministry  of   the
         Interior; the National Intelligence Agency (ANR)  overseen  by  the
         National  Security  Advisor;  the  military  intelligence   service
         overseen by the Ministry of Defense; and the  GSSP,  which  reports
         directly to  the  presidency.  The  national  police  have  primary
         responsibility for law enforcement and  maintaining  public  order.
         The ANR is responsible for  internal  and  external  security.  The
         FARDC was responsible for external security but also  had  domestic
         security responsibilities."


         10.02.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  Report  on   the   DRC   by   the
         Documentation  and  Research  Service,  Refugee   and   Nationality
         Commission of Belgium (CEDOCA) dated October 2002 noted that  there
         are a number of security agencies. [24a] (p9) These include DEMIAP
         (Detection Militaire des Activit�s Anti-Patrie / Military Detection
         of Anti-Patriotic Activities). DEMIAP is formally answerable to the
         staff   of   the   Congolese   armed    forces    (Forces    Arm�es
         Congolais/Congolese armed Forces (FAC)) [renamed FARDC in 2003]  It
         is subdivided into internal and external departments. The  internal
         section has a prison known as Ouagadougou. [24a] (p9)


         10.03. The same report advised that the ANR was set up in  1997  to
         replace SNIP (National Service for Intelligence and Protection) and
         has made efforts to remedy the worst  abuses.  Most  of  the  ANR's
         illegal prisons have been closed in recent years, except for  those
         at ANR/Fleuve and ANR/Lemera. This service  is  subdivided  into  a
         Department for Internal Security (ANR/DSI)  and  a  Department  for
         External Security (ANR/DSE), both  run  by  a  Director  General...
         [24a] (p9)


         10.04. Regarding the  GSP  (Garde  Sp�ciale  Pr�sidentielle/Special
         Presidential Guard, also known as GSSP), the CEDOCA  report  stated
         "This special department consists of President Kabila's  Praetorian
         Guard and was set up  to  replace  the  no  less  infamous  Special
         Presidential Division of former President Mobutu. Starting off with
         the name GSSP, this Guard has had several name changes." [24a] (p9)


         10.05. CEDOCA also stated that  the  General  Migration  department
         (Direction G�nerale de Migration) (DGM) was responsible for  border
         control, among other  things.  It  succeeded  the  former  National
         Immigration Agency (ANI). [24a] (p10)


         10.06. CEDOCA also stated  that  the  Special  Intervention  Forces
         (Forces d'Intervention Sp�ciale) (FIS) were formed from part of the
         GSP and part of the former  50th  Brigade,  now  the  7th  Military
         Region and their headquarters were in the military camp of  Kokolo.
         [24a] (p10)


         10.07. A situation report issued via  the  Institute  for  Security
         Studies in January 2005 titled 'Summary Overview of Security Sector
         Reform Processes in the DRC' detailed  plans  for  the  reform  and
         restructuring of civilian and military security forces  and  stated
         that police reform was an integral part  of  SSR  [Security  Sector
         Reforms] efforts in the DRC. [27f] (p11)".


162.  So far as the police are concerned, the same COIS Report states:

        "10.08     A  Fact-Finding  Mission  Report  on  the  DRC  by   the
        Documentation  and  Research  Service,  Refugee   and   Nationality
        Commission of Belgium (CEDOCA) dated October 2002 stated  that  the
        Congolese National Police (Police Nationale Congolaise)  (PNC)  was
        formed on 7 June  1997  to  replace  the  National  Guard  and  the
        Gendarmerie,  and  was  run  by  the  Police  General  Inspectorate
        (l'Inspection G�nerale de Police). [24a] (p9) The PNC is made up of
        Communal Police (Police Communale) (PC); Rapid Intervention  Police
        (Police d'Intervention Rapide) (PIR); Internal Police  (Police  des
        Polices)  (PP);  Special  Transport  Police  (Police  Speciale   de
        Roulage) (PSR). The uniform of the PNC and the PIR was reported  as
        all blue or all black, and the uniform of the PP and PSR as  yellow
        shirt and blue trousers (often with a yellow line). [24a] (p10)


        10.09. The US State Department Report on Human Rights Practices  in
        2005 published on 8 March 2006 (USSD 2005) reported as follows:


           "by year's  end  the  national  police  force  was  increasingly
           integrated. On November 8, the government-with financial support
           from foreign governments-opened a $1.3 million  police  facility
           in Kinshasa to bring the country's disparate police units  under
           central command and control. In addition  during  the  year  the
           government worked with MONUC and members  of  the  international
           community to train police. There was  some  police  improvement,
           specifically  among  the  rapid  police  force,  following   the
           training by a foreign country of  three  thousand  officers  for
           riot control and emergencies. These officers were properly armed
           with tear gas and rubber bullets to handle  volatile  situations
           and significantly reduce human rights violations. At year's  end
           the international community was training  and  professionalizing
           traffic police."


           The  report  continued,  "...although  the  overall   level   of
           professionalism  increased  during  the  year,   police   forces
           generally remained ineffective  and  corrupt.  During  the  year
           members of the police, military, and security  forces  attacked,
           detained,  robbed,  and  extorted  money  from  civilians.   The
           government prosecuted and disciplined some abusers; however, the
           vast  majority  acted  with  impunity.   Although   there   were
           mechanisms available to investigate human rights  violations  by
           police, they were used sporadically." [3h] (1d)


        10. 10. A report by the International Crisis Group titled 'Security
        Sector Reform in the  Congo'  dated  13  February  2006  states  in
        relation to the police:

           "The Congo police have never been able to provide basic law  and
           order and have  themselves  ranked  among  the  top  abusers  of
           citizens' basic human  rights.  [39f] (page  4)  It  continues,
           police reform has gone forward on an ad hoc basis driven by what
           individual donors are willing to  provide  rather  than  on  the
           basis of a long term strategic plan. These reforms have not been
           without success; for example, when the elections were  postponed
           in June 2005, demonstrations in Kinshasa were handled  well  for
           the most part. However there is little co-ordination  among  the
           main donors - France, EU, South Africa, Angola and MONUC  police
           - on the training and nature of  the  force.  The  bulk  of  the
           effort has focused on Kinshasa, and there is virtually  no  long
           term  plan.  A  police  reform  reflection  group   (groupe   de
           reflexion)  was  only  recently  established  to   improve   co-
           ordination between MONUC, the European Commission, The EU police
           mission (EUPOL) and bilateral donors." [39f] (page 6)


               ...


        10.13. The twenty-first report from the UNSG in June 2006  reported
        that while the national police  in  Kinshasa  had  demonstrated  an
        ability to control political demonstrations without violating human
        rights, there was a tendency to use excessive force. [54i]


        10.14. In June the UNSG's special representative Mr. William  Swing
        announced that 46,000 police  officers  had  been  trained  so  far
        14,000 of them by MONUC. The majority were trained by partners such
        as South Africa, Angola, France,  the  European  Union  and  Japan.
        According to Mr. Swing the aim was to train 50,000  police  by  the
        date of the election. [71d]
    i. ...
        10.16. On 16 December 2006,  Radio  France  International  reported
        that a police academy, funded by France, had  been  inaugurated  in
        Kinshasa.  The academy will receive 270 trainees each year. [95ak]


        10.17. On 15 January 2007, Angola Press reported that over 2,700 DR
        Congo policemen had been trained by  the  Angolan  National  Police
        (PN) since 2004.  Since 2004 the  PN  have  organised  the  Mbakana
        Training Centre, and trained a police battalion and other units  in
        anti-riot, and anti-terrorism.  In Angola, they have held a  course
        for trainers in public order, and trained 80 staff in the motorbike
        brigade for special anti-terrorism units. [34a]".


163.  The COIS Report also includes the  following  entries  on  arrest  and
    detention.

        "14.01   Articles 19 and  20  of  the  current  draft  transitional
        constitution of 23 March  2003  (published  by  the  Institute  for
        Security Studies) provided for all citizens to have the right to be
        detained or arrested only in accordance with the law and within  24
        hours, to be permitted  contact  with  their  family  and  a  legal
        adviser, informed of the reason for the arrest, their legal rights,
        and any charges. Article 20 also states that police custody  should
        not exceed 48 hours; after  this  period  the  detainee  should  be
        brought before a competent judicial  authority.  The  same  Article
        states that treatment should  be  in  accordance  with  maintaining
        life, physical and mental health, and dignity. [27a]


        14.02. A report compiled by the Canadian  Immigration  and  Refugee
        Board in February 2005 also stated that in  theory,  the  Congolese
        constitution guarantees  impartial  justice,  defendants  have  the
        right to appeal  in  most  cases,  and  the  right  to  defence  is
        recognized by all courts. [43s]


        14.03. Several reports indicated that although the law provides for
        a speedy process, access  to  family  and  lawyers,  and  prohibits
        arbitrary arrest and detention, these provisions were not  followed
        in practice. [3h] (Sections 1d, 1e, 1f) [11f] (Torture and Illegal
        detention) [55b] [56a] They included the US State Department Report
        on Human Rights Practices in 2005 published on 8 March  2006  (USSD
        2005) [3h] which also stated:


               "Police often  arbitrarily  arrested  and  detained  persons
               without filing charges, often to extort  money  from  family
               members. When authorities did press charges, the claims were
               rarely filed in a timely manner and were often contrived  or
               overly vague.  Reportedly  security  forces  regularly  held
               alleged  suspects  for  varying  periods  of   time   before
               acknowledging that they were  in  custody  or  allowing  the
               detainees to have contact with  family  or  legal  counsel."
               [3h] (Section 1d)


               and


        "Throughout  the  country,  there  were   credible   reports   that
        authorities sometimes arrested or beat a close family member of the
        person they sought but were unable to locate. For example on August
        5, police in Lubumbashi arrested  and  severely  beat  Mimi  Balela
        Mbayo in place of her husband,  who  was  wanted  for  stealing  24
        thousand dollars from a former employee. Ms. Mabyo's buttocks  were
        flayed, tearing off large pieces of flesh and muscle. At year's end
        no action had been taken  against  OPJ  Donat  Atwena,  the  police
        officer who ordered the beating." [3h] (Section 1f)

        14.04. A report in April 2004 by the  United  Nations  Mission  for
        Congo (MONUC) on Detention in the Prisons and  Detention  cells  of
        the DRC, based on a series of visits in  2002  and  the  first  six
        months of 2003, stated that:


               "The lawfulness of the arrest  and  detention  is  often  an
               infringement of the law linked to the  serious  disfunctions
               [sic] in the police force and in the  legal  system.  It  is
               clear that the fundamental rights of  persons  arrested  are
               not respected, in particular:


               ? The period in police detention, which may not exceed forty-
               eight hours,
               ?  The  right  for  any  person  arrested  to  be   informed
               immediately or at the latest within twenty-four hours of the
               reasons for  his/her  arrest  and  of  any  accusation  made
               against him,
               ? The right to a  just  and  fair  trial  within  the  legal
               periods." [56a] (p4)


        14.05. The MONUC report recommended a number of measures to improve
        the situation of illegal detention, and to  reduce  the  number  of
        people  held  in  preventive  detention  and  limit  its  duration.
        [56a] (p39-44)


        14.06. The  Amnesty  International  (AI)  Annual  Report  in  2005,
        reporting on events in 2004,  stated  that  "Arbitrary  arrest  and
        illegal detention remained frequent across  the  DRC.  Many  people
        spent long periods in detention without charge or trial.  A  number
        were reportedly ill-treated or tortured. Human rights defenders and
        journalists engaged in legitimate investigation and criticism  were
        also  threatened  and  unlawfully  detained."  [11f] (Torture  and
        Illegal detention)


         A report by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur for the DRC
        in March 2004 also stated "Crime generally goes unpunished  in  the
        Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  and  arbitrary  detention  is
        practised on a wide scale." [55b] (p16) The same report also stated
        "The lack of security for the civilian population  is  one  of  the
        impediments to the realization of human rights  in  the  Democratic
        Republic of the  Congo.  The  civilian  population  is  subject  to
        violence by the military and police, often for  financial  reasons;
        most such offences go unpunished. Since bribery is ubiquitous,  the
        guilty parties can buy off the justice system and the  police,  and
        justice officials often help victims and perpetrators to make deals
        in exchange for part of the compensation paid..."


164.  As regards general conditions in  the  DRC,  the  UN  Office  for  the
    Coordinati0n of Humanitarian  Affairs  stated  in  a  briefing  to  the
    Security Council on 11 September 2007 that:

        "Last year's successful national elections and the establishment of
        democratic  institutions  are  important   steps  on  the  road  to
        recovery, and to  the  re-establishment  of  state  and  government
        authority.   The  successful  completion  of  the  local  elections
        planned for next year should be a vital next step.  This  progress,
        and the end of major fighting in most of the  country,  has  had  a
        positive effect on the humanitarian situation.   Over the last four
        years, the total  number of internally displaced has decreased from
        3.4 to 1.2 million.  In Katanga Province alone, some 350,000 people
        returned home last year.  Most  of  the  country  is  beginning  to
        experience greater calm and stability, even if MONUC should not yet
        even start to contemplate leaving.


        Nevertheless, serious humanitarian problems remain, particularly in
        the  east,  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  civilians  are  still
        displaced and more continue to  flee  fighting  and  violence,  and
        where illegal armed groups terrorise large parts of the population.
         While the position in Ituri has improved significantly, continuing
        insecurity  in  north  and  south  Kivu  has  particularly   severe
        humanitarian consequences.   These two provinces  account  together
        for close to 1,000,000 of the internally displaced, or 90%  of  the
        total national caseload.  North Kivu alone represents  almost  two-
        thirds of this number, including about 300,000 more since  November
        last year."

165.  From the Amnesty International Report, May  2007,  it  is  clear  that
    torture and ill-treatment committed  by  government  forces  and  armed
    groups continue to take place as do attacks on human  rights  defenders
    with impunity and diminished risk of arrest and being put on trial.

166.  So far as asylum-related returns to the DRC  which  have  taken  place
    under UNHCR auspices, the same COIS Report states:


         "32.26 On 10 January 2007 the UNHCR reported that although the long-
         standing refugee crises in the Great Lakes region continued to ease
         last year, problems still remain.   The  DRC  remains  the  UNHCR's
         biggest Great Lakes operation.  The refugee agency helped more than
         26,000 of last year's almost 37,000 Congolese  returnees  go  home.
         Slightly more than 47,200 people were repatriated to DRC  in  2005,
         including some 14,000 assisted  by  UNHCR.   DRC  also  hosts  some
         220,000 refugees from neighbouring countries; some 30,000  of  them
         went back last year, 13,200 helped by UNHCR. [21ah]
         ...


         32.38...On 13  April  2007  Relief  Web  quoting  the  UNHCR  as  a
         source...said that so far 7,000 refugees had returned in  2007  and
         96,000 in total since 2004."


         The report records repatriation in significant numbers of  refugees
         back to the  DRC  from  Angola,  Rwanda,  Burundi,  Uganda,  Sudan,
         Tanzania, the Central  African  Republic,  Mozambique,  Malawi  and
         Zambia.


         In response to a request from the Tribunal for figures  of  asylum-
         related returns from the UK to the DRC, the respondent furnished us
         with figures covering the period January 2004 - September 2007. The
         covering letter stressed that whilst figures from January  2004  to
         June 2007  are  from  published  information,  those  from  July-15
         September 2007 have yet  to  be  verified  by  auditing  processes.
         Headed "Unsuccessful Asylum Seekers", these figures are broken down
         into A ("enforced removals,  persons  departing  voluntarily  after
         enforcement action has been initiated against them  and  those  who
         have left the UK without informing the  immigration  authorities");
         and B ("persons leaving under Assisted Voluntary Return  Programmes
         run by the International Organisation for Migration [and which  may
         include cases where enforcement action has been  initiated])".  The
         total of unsuccessful asylum seekers given for 2006 is 105 and  for
         Jan-15 September 2007 it is 97. The  information  on  returns  also
         states that in the period January 2004 until  December  2006  there
         were 45 non-asylum cases concerning nationals of the DRC removed to
         the DRC.


167.  Since it has been the subject of specific commentary by  E1,  we  need
    also to set out the July 2007 COIS  Report's  entry  on  failed  asylum
    seekers:

               "36.   Treatment of failed asylum seekers returned to the
               DRC


        36.01. In comments to the Advisory Panel on Country Information  on
        8 March 2006, UNHCR stated a BBC report  published  on  1  December
        2005 completely contradicted the COI report of  October  2005,  and
        operational guidance. [15y] [60f]


        36.02. The USSD Country Report on Human Rights - 2005 published  on
        8 March 2006 gave an account of the BBC  programme  but  concluded:
        "During the year there were no other reports that corroborated  the
        accounts contained in the BBC article." [3h] (Section 2d)

        36.03. The view of the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  (FCO)  was
        given in two  letters  dated  6  February  2006  from  the  British
        Ambassador to the DRC. The first letter confirmed the letter  of  9
        December 2004 which stated that the FCO had no  evidence  that  DRC
        nationals face persecution from DRC authorities on  being  returned
        to Kinshasa after a failed claim for political asylum  in  a  third
        country. It stated: "Our sources in researching  the  treatment  of
        failed asylum seekers include local non governmental organisations,
        press  and  lawyers,  Ministers  from  all  parties   forming   the
        transitional government and colleagues in other Embassies based  in
        Kinshasa."  The  same  letter  noted  that  "other  EU  governments
        continue to  make  regular  supervised  returns  of  failed  asylum
        seekers to Kinshasa, for which DRC Immigration requires a  suitable
        identification document. Flights carrying returnees  from  Schengen
        countries are met by a French Airport Liaison Officer  who  ensures
        that, on arrival, the returnee holds a satisfactory document before
        passing them on to be landed by DRC Immigration officials." It also
        stated: "All passengers arriving at N'djili airport are  liable  to
        be questioned by DRC immigration officials.  We  have  no  evidence
        that returned failed asylum seekers are specifically  targeted  for
        adverse treatment." The letter continued: "It is possible that some
        returnees may face criminal prosecution upon their  return  to  the
        DRC if it were established on their return that they  had  departed
        the DRC with invalid travel documents or were already  the  subject
        of an arrest warrant or criminal investigation." [22l]


        36.04.  The  second  letter  from  the  embassy  states  that   the
        Ambassador had met with the Vice-Minister for the Interior in  late
        December 2005 to discuss the return of failed asylum  seekers  from
        the UK to the DRC. During the discussions  the  Ambassador  relayed
        concern over reports that failed asylum seekers, on return  to  the
        DRC, had been investigated or persecuted by the DRC authorities and
        enquired what the DRC Government's official position was. According
        to the letter the Vice Minister "said categorically that there  was
        no official policy to  target  failed  asylum  seekers  upon  their
        return to the DRC. He could not guarantee  that  individual  failed
        asylum seekers had not  been  harassed  by  individual  members  of
        immigration or security services. But they had definitely not  been
        ordered to do so by the Interior Ministry." [22m]


        36.05. In response to an information request on the subject of  the
        treatment of rejected asylum seekers in the DRC the UNHCR stated on
        19 April 2006, that after the  press  coverage  following  the  BBC
        programme  their  officials  in  Kinshasa  had  contacted   various
        organisations  and  institutions  in  an  attempt  to  gather  more
        information. This included  organisations  such  as  the  Congolese
        Immigration Authorities (DGM), the National Committee for  Refugees
        (CNR), IOM, MONUC, and national human rights NGOS. In addition,  it
        sent staff to the airport  on  days  of  arrival  of  flights  from
        Europe. The following were its findings:


           1. According to the DGM and CNR,  the  usual  procedure  for  any
           person returning through  Kinshasa airport in case  they  do  not
           hold  proper  documentation,  including  current  DRC  passports,
           and/or when they have been absent for  a  long  time,  is  to  be
           interrogated by immigration officials at the airport. In the best
           case scenario, they are freed within one to three hours.  In  the
           worst case, they are sent to a detention facility in  the  centre
           of town, and released after further verification.


           2. The Congolese human rights NGO 'Voix des Sans  Voix'  informed
           the office that rejected asylum-seekers are received upon arrival
           at the airport by agents of DGM, who question them about why they
           left and applied for asylum.  The  NGO  have  an  office  at  the
           airport and are closely monitoring the situation. They  mentioned
           that there were many failed asylum seekers who are sent  back  by
           western European countries, but they are  not  aware  of  any  of
           these persons detained and/or tortured upon return. They reported
           that some of the failed asylum seekers had to pay some  money  to
           the police (5 to 10 US$).


           3. IOM Kinshasa advised the office that they have no  information
           of returnees who were mistreated and/or tortured upon return.


           4. According to MONUC's  human  rights  section,  which  is  also
           monitoring the prisons in the DRC, they did not receive  concrete
           indications that individual failed asylum-seekers  were  arrested
           upon their return.


           5. According to ASADOH  (Association  Africaine  de  Defense  des
           Droits de l'Homme), no cases of detention, abuse  or  torture  of
           failed asylum-seekers were known to their office.


           6. As reported above, UNHCR staff were at times  present  at  the
           airport, but they have not witnessed arrests made at the airport.
           However, it has to be kept in mind that arrivals at  the  airport
           are difficult to monitor, and  UNHCR  does  not  have  a  regular
           presence at the airport.  The  UNHCR  Kinshasa  office  has  only
           details on the forced return of three persons, of whom  two  were
           from African countries and one from  Sweden.  The  latter  person
           was, upon arrival, interrogated for some  three  hours  and  then
           released without further problems.


           7. In general, the situation in the prisons and detention centres
           in DRC  are  extremely  dire,  and  detainees  have  to  rely  on
           relatives to bring them food.


           8. With the limited information available to UNHCR, it  does  not
           have evidence that there is systematic abuse, including detention
           and mistreatment, of failed asylum seekers returned  to  the  DRC
           through Kinshasa airport. It wishes to highlight,  however,  that
           it advises against the forced return to Kinshasa  of  persons  of
           Banyamulenge ethnic origin. [60h]


        36.06. An EU Report on Illegal Migration  published  in  June  2006
        dealing with the subject of returned asylum seekers states that the
        majority of failed asylum seekers (particularly in the UK)  do  not
        take  up  the  offer  of  voluntary  repatriation.  Member   states
        therefore mostly rely on forcible repatriation.


        36.07. The report goes on to state that no EU member state has  run
        charter flights of failed asylum seekers to the DRC since 2003. The
        DRC authorities have resisted attempts by member states to  restart
        them. However, many member states have signed or are hoping to sign
        agreements to allow charter flights and guarantee a  minimum  level
        of service from Congolese embassies  and  immigration  directorate.
        Some who have signed agreements have not been satisfied with  their
        results.


        36.08. The report continues  to  say  that  there  is  no  reliable
        evidence of failed asylum seekers being specifically  targeted  for
        harassment by the security services. Although some  returnees  have
        been harassed, this is seen as part of  a  trend  of  opportunistic
        crime against random civilians by unpaid  or  underpaid  officials.
        Harassment is experienced  by  the  majority  of  travellers,  both
        Congolese or foreign. [22n]


        36.09. The Belgian and Dutch governments stated that, like the FCO,
        they have not seen any evidence to indicate  that  returned  failed
        asylum seekers are persecuted. A letter from the Belgian Embassy in
        London of July 2003 stated that the Belgian Government enforced the
        return of failed Congolese asylum seekers  to  the  DRC.  Both  the
        Belgian Embassy in Kinshasa and the Belgian Immigration  Department
        monitored the treatment of returned failed asylum  seekers  to  the
        DRC from Belgium and had not seen any  evidence  to  indicate  that
        returned failed asylum seekers were at risk of persecution. [25]


        36.10. A letter from the Dutch  Embassy  in  London  of  July  2003
        stated that the Dutch Government also enforced the return of failed
        Congolese asylum seekers to the DRC, and that the Dutch Embassy  in
        Kinshasa had not seen any evidence to indicate that returned failed
        asylum seekers were at risk of persecution.  The  Dutch  Government
        did not monitor the treatment of returned failed asylum seekers  to
        the DRC. [26] Further information about the return of failed asylum
        seekers from The Netherlands was reported by a BBC News  report  of
        24 June 2005 which stated that, following a media programme report,
        "The Netherlands [had]  suspended  the  return  of  failed  asylum-
        seekers to the Democratic Republic of Congo  following  reports  of
        documents being leaked. Congolese officials are  reported  to  have
        obtained confidential  documents  on  several  deportees  and  then
        abused them.... She said an independent inquiry  would  investigate
        how Dutch files may have ended up with Congolese immigration.... On
        a number of occasions in the past she has reassured parliament that
        failed asylum-seekers' files were kept secret. Dutch media  reports
        that human rights organisations  had  also  warned  that  deportees
        faced the serious risk of imprisonment, extortion  and  assault  if
        unmasked as asylum-seekers." [15r]


        36.11. A report from Justitie Netherlands reported  on  9  December
        2005 that "The Dutch Government has concluded  that  the  Havermans
        Committee report indicates that no information on  the  content  of
        asylum files was provided to the Congolese authorities. The  report
        also shows that the current affairs programme Netwerk did not  find
        any such information in the Democratic Republic of Congo".  ..."The
        findings of the report prove that the relevant executive bodies did
        not supply any detailed data from the asylum files to  the  country
        of  origin,  something  that  Immigration  Minister  Rita   Verdonk
        repeatedly told the Lower House of Parliament in its debate  of  23
        February 2005." [78]


        36.  12.  Further  information  about  the  attitude  of   European
        countries on this subject was  set  out  in  a  country  report  of
        January 2004 by the Netherlands  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  as
        follows:


             "4.3 Policy of other countries:


             United Kingdom
             "All applications for asylum from Congolese are dealt with on
             an individual basis. Asylum is generally granted to Tutsis,
             but not to persons of mixed origin. In principle, failed
             Congolese asylum seekers are returned to the DRC.


             Belgium
             "Most applications for asylum from Congolese are dealt with in
             the usual way. There is a freeze on taking decisions on
             applications by persons giving their place of origin as Ituri.
             In principle, failed Congolese asylum seekers are returned to
             the DRC.


             Germany
             "Applications for asylum from Congolese nationals are assessed
             individually. Congolese asylum seekers who have exhausted all
             legal remedies are returned to Kinshasa.


             Denmark
             "All applications for asylum from Congolese are assessed
             individually. Congolese asylum seekers who have exhausted all
             legal remedies are de facto deported.


             Switzerland
             "Asylum is granted to Tutsis in some cases. Tutsis and persons
             who were in close contact with the Mobutu government are not
             deported. Congolese asylum seekers who have exhausted all
             legal remedies are deported to Kinshasa." [42] (p22)


        36.13. During the course of a country of origin information seminar
        in June 2002, sponsored  by  UNHCR  and  the  Austrian  Centre  for
        Country of Origin and Asylum Research and  Documentation  (ACCORD),
        which was addressed by representatives from  Amnesty  International
        and UNHCR, the subject of the involuntary  return  of  unsuccessful
        asylum seekers was discussed at length. It was stated that  caution
        should be exercised and a case-by-case approach  was  necessary  in
        dealing with these individuals. [52] (p122-127)


        36.14. In a report by the Danish  Immigration  Service  in  1999  a
        spokesman for the NGO, TOGES NOIRES, Association Internationale des
        Avocats et Magistrats D�fenseurs des Droits de  l'Homme,  Kinshasa,
        (BLACK TOGAS, International Association of Lawyers and  Magistrates
        Committed  to  Defending  Human  Rights,  Kinshasa)   offered   the
        cooperation of his organisation in helping refused  asylum  seekers
        who were to be repatriated to return home safely without difficulty
        [104]


        36.15. On 26 February 2007 the UK sent a charter flight to the  DRC
        with 40 failed asylum seekers (FAS) on board.  The plane arrived in
        Kinshasa at 0600 hrs local time. All 40 FAS had been  certified  as
        Congolese by the DRC Embassy in London prior to departure.  Despite
        this two of the FAS were declared non-Congolese  by  the  Congolese
        migration authorities (DGM) following  interviews,  in  which  they
        said they were respectively Mozambican and Senegalese.  After about
        half an hour of processing,  the  remaining  38  of  the  FAS  were
        allowed to leave, where the majority  were  met  by  family  and/or
        friends.  Two of the FAS even reached the embassy to enquire  about
        appeals and visas later that morning. The Embassy who observed  the
        process stated that there were no obvious abuses of  human  rights.
        [22w]"

168.   Turning  to  background  evidence  of  specific  relevance   to   the
    appellant, we confine ourselves here to noting (as being of  particular
    relevance to the appellant's case)  that  the  July  2007  COIS  Report
    contains the following reference to the killing  of  journalist  Franck
    Kangundu:


         "18.10   The journalist killed was Franck 'Ngyke' Kangundu, 52, who
         headed the political  section  of  the  independent  Kinshasa-based
         daily La R�f�rence Plus. He and his wife were  shot  outside  their
         home in Kinshasa. [7d] Three policemen  and  two  accomplices  were
         arrested for the killings. During a news conference  the  suspected
         ringleader, Second Lieutenant Mungande Kimbao Joel,  denied  having
         any part in the murders and said he only confessed  under  torture.
         [18bw] Subsequently members of the Congolese  NGO,  Journaliste  En
         Danger (JED) received death  threats  following  an  article  about
         their investigations into the killings. [74c] During a meeting with
         Reporters sans Frontieres (RSF) on 9 March  2006  President  Kabila
         gave an undertaking that a 'public trial' would be held "before the
         presidential election." [74d] The  trial  of  three  suspects,  two
         policeman and a  soldier,  commenced  on  12  July  2006  before  a
         military tribunal. The six judges did not read out the charges. One
         of the lawyers representing Ngyke's family said  it  was  just  the
         opening of the trial which involved the presentation of  the  three
         suspects who had refused to recognise the lawyers assigned to them,
         saying they had no earlier  contact  with  them.  A  spokesman  for
         Journaliste en danger (JED) alleged that Ngyke was  killed  because
         of an article on embezzlement of government funds. [18cr]".

169.  It is also worth adding what is said  in  the  same  section  of  this
    report about the media in Kinshasa:

         "18.51   Freedom House stated in the Freedom in  the  World  report
         2005  that  "At  least  30  independent  newspapers  are  published
         regularly in Kinshasa but are  not  widely  circulated  beyond  the
         city." [66] (Political Rights and Civil Liberties)  The  EIU  2005
         Country Profile also stated:


             "There are many newspapers in Kinshasa, but only a handful are
             regularly printed and read. The main opposition newspapers are
             Le Potentiel, Le Phare, Temp�te des Tropiques and La R�f�rence
             Plus. Le Palmares and L'Avenir are the two main pro-government
             newspapers. Le Potentiel has the largest circulation, at 4,000
             copies a day. There are few newspapers  in  the  rest  of  the
             country.  However,  since  the  resumption  of  national   air
             traffic, the Kinshasa newspapers are getting to cities in  the
             rest of the country, if only in small quantities." [30b] (p21)


        18.52. The USSD 2006 report further reported:


         "A  large  and  active  private  press  functioned  throughout  the
         country, and a very large number of daily newspapers were  licensed
         to publish. The transitional government required each newspaper  to
         pay a $500 ...licensing fee  and  complete  several  administrative
         steps before  it  could  publish  legally.  While  many  newspapers
         remained critical of the transitional government, many showed  bias
         towards it or particular political parties. Although there  was  no
         official newspaper, the government press agency published the Daily
         Bulletin,  which  included  news  reports,  decrees  and   official
         statements" [3i] (Section 2a)".


Submissions

170.  Since we deal with the main points raised by each side in  submissions
    on the general issues in our assessment below,  we  need  only  briefly
    outline their main thrust here.

171.  Partly with reference to his skeleton  argument  Mr  Jacobs  submitted
    that there was now a significant  body  of  compelling  fresh  evidence
    placed before the Tribunal, which necessitated a major  change  in  its
    existing country guidance on the DRC, so as  to  accept  that  returned
    failed asylum seekers (FAS) generally are at risk. The risk they  faced
    on return amounted to a consistent pattern and so met the "generally or
    consistently happening" test set out in Harari [2003] EWCA Civ  807  as
    approved in AA (Zimbabwe) [2007] EWCA Civ 149. There were 4  categories
    of risk to FAS on return to the DRC:  risk  of  ill  treatment  at  the
    airport; risk of ill treatment at Kin Maziere; risk of ill treatment at
    Makala prison or other detention facilities; and inhuman and  degrading
    prison conditions throughout the DRC. We should accept  the  first-hand
    evidence that W1, W2, W3 (reinforced by their current airport contacts)
    were able to give about abusive conditions at  the  airport.  This  was
    reinforced by the written account given by a former DRC security  agent
    in  the  16  September  Observer  article  and  other  sources.   Cases
    investigated by Miss  Cuffe,  Miss  Atherton,  Mr  DW,  E2  and  others
    confirmed that even at the interrogation  stage  at  the  airport,  the
    immigration officials (DGM) and/or ANR nearly all the time use violence
    and/or detention. FAS are regarded by airport officials as traitors for
    having gone abroad and said negative things about their country.   Most
    FAS are ransomed and money is extorted from them. An offence  is  often
    invented by the ANR/DGM officials to pressurise a returnee to  pay  the
    requested sum of money. The norm is for FAS to be  transferred  to  Kin
    Maziere or other detention centres, where the likelihood of torture and
    other forms of ill treatment is even greater.  The  ANR/DGM  also  make
    house visits to addresses of deportees some days or  weeks  after  they
    have been released. Such visits often lead to  re-arrest,  imprisonment
    in dire conditions and further ill-treatment. Rape, more  prevalent  in
    the DRC than any other country in the world, is endemic in DRC  prisons
    and detention centres.

172.  Mr Jacobs said that the situation for returnees sent back from the  UK
    has currently specific characteristics arising out of events in October
    2006 when there were attacks in London on Kabila aides. So there was an
    added risk for UK expellees. Such persons are  considered  as  traitors
    and as involved with  APARECO  and/or  other  anti-Kabila  groups.  The
    Kabila regime has many agents who spy on the Congolese community in the
    UK. Contrary to what UNHCR, VSV and the British Embassy have suggested,
    there is no NGO who is  an  official  representative  at  the  airport.
    Neither systematic nor incidental monitoring is being  carried  out  by
    any European country. FAS would not be  safe  until  proper  monitoring
    safeguards were put in place.

173.  Both the experts,  he  submitted,  should  be  accepted  as  balanced,
    objective and highly informed about their subject.

174.  The various case dossiers Miss Atherton and others had  been  able  to
    assemble disclosed many accounts on similar lines of ill  treatment  at
    the airport or thereafter. They had a powerful corroborative effect. Of
    the 40 people who returned on the February 2007 charter flight, we  had
    information in respect of 10 and all 10  have  accounts  of  being  ill
    treated at the airport. In relation to one of them, WY, we  had,  inter
    alia, ICRC photographic confirmation of his injuries sustained  shortly
    after security agents had raided his home within hours of his  arriving
    off this flight.

175.  The accounts given by VSV and ASADHO should be regarded as  unreliable
    and we should attach weight to the telling  criticisms  made  of  their
    position (as described in the April 2006 UNHCR Response) by E2 and  E1.
    We should prefer the account given by Mr RK of CDHH  /OCDH  who  was  a
    highly respected and credible source, in addition to  other  informants
    (who included a pastor).

176.  The British Embassy evidence  should  be  treated  with  caution.  The
    Embassy correspondence betrayed an unwillingness to investigate  and  a
    willingness to disbelieve. The Embassy was wrong at one stage to  refer
    to having "no evidence" of problems facing returned FAS. There had  not
    been frank and full disclosure from the Embassy of a number of matters.
    Why, instead of asking VSV if it had an office at the airport, did  not
    the Embassy official go to the airport to check for himself?

177.  Miss Giovannetti asked that we consider the issues  in  this  case  in
    the context of the country evidence as a whole. She confirmed  that  it
    was conceded by the respondent that for the  purposes  of  this  appeal
    conditions in DRC prisons  and  detentions  centres  were  contrary  to
    Article  3.  She  contended  that  the  new  evidence  adduced  by  the
    appellant's representative was in the main confused  and  contradictory
    and/or had been served too late to enable any proper investigation  and
    response. E2 for example,  had  made  reference  to  a  report  from  a
    "reliable partner" in the DRC that nothing alarming had happened to the
    February 2007 charter flight  returnees,  whom  he  had  observed  from
    beginning to end. That man's account contradicted that of some  of  her
    own case examples. The appellant's representatives had failed  to  deal
    with the very significant report made public by EU HoM  in  April  2006
    which concluded that expellees were not at risk of ill treatment at the
    airport. This report's findings were also consistent with much of  E1's
    reports (although he seemed not to know of the report  directly),  both
    emphasising in particular that illegal emigration networks were  active
    in the DRC and sometimes worked in collusion  with  airport  officials.
    E1's point about the miserable conditions for many living  in  the  DRC
    giving people a motive to tell false stories, was important. Given that
    NGOs needed money to do their work, it was very hard  to  be  confident
    about  individual  stories.  Those  working  in  or  with  the  illegal
    migration networks would have a motive for lying about what happened to
    FAS on return, because if returns were problem-free they would  not  be
    able to tell customers that their network had  done  what  it  promised
    them -  establishing themselves in the UK/Europe. Failed asylum seekers
    would also have a motive to lie since they would  know  that  if  their
    stories of ill treatment on return were accepted, they might succeed in
    a future asylum claim.

178.  E1, in his comments on the Tribunal country guidance case of  AB,  had
    had every opportunity to disavow his earlier position, as  put  to  the
    Tribunal in AB (that there was no violence  or  ill  treatment  at  the
    airport), but  had  not  done  so,  despite  other  criticisms.  Closer
    inspection of E1's sources in the annex to his second  report  revealed
    that he had not taken into account the 2004 VSV report  cases  and  his
    own information was far too dependent on questionable sources.

179.  E2, despite her ability to  obtain  one  or  two  documents  verifying
    certain matters (e.g. the list of those on the  February  2007  charter
    flight) essentially relied on good faith research.  Significantly  none
    of her 50 cases covered  during  her  December  2005  -  February  2006
    investigations, made any complaint of torture at the airport.  Although
    they referred to rough handling, out of the 50 cases,  only  one  punch
    was specified. E2 seemed to have made  no  critical  analysis  of  WY's
    evidence. WY's evidence was utterly implausible.

180.  The criticisms of VSV raised by E2 and  E1  in  particular  were,  she
    submitted, largely unfair.

181.  One of E2's criticisms was that the head of VSV  was  obviously  aware
    of imprisonment of the FAS, since it had written about in  one  of  its
    own press releases and so should not have "avoided mentioning  them  in
    his monitoring report". Yet, she pointed out, the individual  concerned
    was described in that VSV press release dated 13 March 2005  as  having
    been imprisoned on arrival in November 2004. That was  a  date  falling
    outside the period covered by the VSV report. As for E2 having  managed
    to trace three quarters of those expellees VSV interviewed in its  2004
    report, only for all of them to deny any contact  with  VSV,  they  had
    been approached over two years later and it was hardly surprising  they
    were cautious about  saying  anything  regarding  VSV  to  E2  and  her
    organisation.  On  E2's  evidence,  yet  totally  ignored  by  her  own
    assessment of that evidence, none denied being FAS and none raised with
    her any complaints of ill treatment.

182.  The Tribunal should reject the evidence of W1,  W2  and  W3  as  badly
    flawed. There  were,  she  said,  very  significant  discrepancies  and
    implausibilities.

183.  The February 2007 charter flight  took  place  at  a  time  when  Miss
    Atherton and others had  already  begun  holding  consciousness-raising
    meetings within the DRC community in the UK. In January 2004 W2 and  W3
    had also written a paper. In any event, all the "cases" put forward  of
    those on the charter flight were second or third hand accounts and some
    were inherently implausible on their  face.  These  accounts  were  not
    consistent with those from the  British  Embassy,  VSV  and  MONUC  and
    others. If FAS were regarded as traitors, you would have expected these
    bodies to have heard about it.  Key witnesses have failed to attend  to
    give evidence.

184.  Miss Giovannetti emphasised that she was not suggesting there were  no
    cases of ill treatment at the airport  on  return,  but  there  was  no
    reliable evidence to show a consistent pattern. She accepted that  some
    of those involved in this case who had  tried  to  find  out  what  had
    happened to returned FAS  (such  as  Miss  Cuffe,  Miss  Atherton,  DW)
    genuinely believed there were causes for concern, but the evidence  did
    not stand up.

185.  Among the observations made by Mr Jacobs in reply was that the  points
    made by Miss Giovannetti about the likely motives of illegal emigration
    networks and FAS appeared to rely on the idea of a conspiracy theory.

Legal Framework

186.  The provisions of SI 2006 No 2525, the Refugee or Person  in  Need  of
    International Protection (Qualification) Regulations  2006,  now  bring
    into United Kingdom domestic law the  Council  of  the  European  Union
    Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004  on  minimum  standards  for  the
    qualification and  status  of  third  country  nationals  or  stateless
    persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need protection and the
    content of the protection  granted"  (the  "Qualification  Directive").
    Changes were also made in the Immigration Rules by means of a Statement
    of Changes in the Immigration Rules also taking  effect  on  9  October
    2006 (Cm 6918).

187.  The burden of proof is upon the Appellant.  The standard of proof  has
    been defined as a "reasonable degree of likelihood".  The  question  is
    answered by looking at the evidence in the round and  assessed  at  the
    time of hearing the appeal. When considering the "objective"  parts  of
    the case we  have  taken  into  account  the  appellant's  "subjective"
    evidence. Similarly, when considering the "subjective" evidence we have
    done so in the context of the  "objective"  evidence.  Where  below  we
    refer to 'risk'  or  'real  risk'  this  is  to  be  understood  as  an
    abbreviated way of  identifying  respectively:(i)   whether  on  return
    there is a well-founded fear  of  being  persecuted  under  the  Geneva
    Convention; (ii)  whether on return there are substantial grounds  for
    believing that the person would face a real risk of  suffering  serious
    harm within the meaning of paragraph 339C of  the  amended  Immigration
    Rules; and (iii) whether on return there are substantial  grounds  for
    believing that a person would face a real  risk  of  being  exposed  to
    treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.

Our Assessment:  Specific Matters

Identification as failed asylum seekers
188.  It was common ground between the parties  that  persons  involuntarily
    returned or expelled from the UK to the DRC will not be seen as  normal
    returnees. They will be questioned with a  view  to  establishing  what
    type of expellee they are; and in particular whether they are either  a
    failed asylum seeker or a deportee. (It will have already been observed
    that much of the evidence in this  case  does  not  always  distinguish
    between these two categories. Sometimes the term "deportee" is used  to
    cover both a failed asylum seeker and a person expelled or deported for
    non-asylum reasons - such as that his or her presence has  been  deemed
    unconducive to the public good in the UK - whereas sometimes it is used
    to cover the latter category only. In  certain  contexts,  as  we  have
    already had cause to see,  it  can  be  of  importance  to  distinguish
    between different categories of involuntary returnees/ expellees).

189.  The fact that a person's identity  as  a  failed  asylum  seeker  will
    become known at the point of return reflects the  main  thrust  of  the
    evidence; and we are prepared to accept that for the purposes  of  this
    appeal this is the case. The  fact  that  failed  asylum  seekers  have
    substitution documents  (a  laissez  passez)  will  suffice  to  arouse
    initial interest. In respect of those who have travelled with  escorts,
    the fact that they are not ordinary returnees will be known to the  DRC
    airport officials in any event, from the flight manifest. Those who are
    handed over to DRC airport officials by UK  immigration  officials  (as
    happened on the February 2007 charter flight), will observably  not  be
    normal returnees.

Asylum seekers as traitors
190.  At the heart of the case put by  the  appellant's  representatives  is
    the contention that failed asylum seekers on  return  to  the  DRC  are
    perceived as traitors, or persons who have dishonoured,  or  said  'bad
    things' about, their country and as a result are seen by  the  DGM  and
    security services at the airport (or afterwards) as deserving  of  ill-
    treatment.

191.  For a number of reasons we consider that  this  contention  fails.  We
    note first of all that the DRC is a full  party  to  the  1951  Refugee
    Convention and its 1967 Protocol as well as to the 1969 OAU  Convention
    governing  the  specific  aspects  of  refugee  problems   in   Africa.
    Manifestly the DRC is also a country which is very  familiar  with  the
    problems of refugees and displaced persons: the latest MONUC report, as
    well as a number of other reports, refer to the large numbers of former
    Congolese refugees who have returned to the DRC since the  end  of  the
    war in 2003. The UNHCR reports that refugees who had fled from the  DRC
    to Zambia, Tanzania, Burundi, Uganda, Angola and Sudan have returned in
    their thousands, in reaction to  the  improved  security  and  economic
    conditions in many areas of the DRC. As already noted, UNHCR  has  been
    heavily involved in these voluntary repatriations "to all parts of  the
    DRC". It is difficult to follow why, if the  DRC  authorities  regarded
    the mere act of fleeing the DRC to claim asylum abroad  as  a  betrayal
    (legitimising reprisal), these  large-scale  returns  would  be  taking
    place with UNHCR approval and without in general any  adverse  reaction
    on the part of the DRC authorities.  We note in this  regard  that  the
    DGM together with the ANR (in common with most of  the  other  security
    personnel  who  have  a  presence  at   the   airport)   are   national
    organisations and the DGM controls the DRC borders generally.

192.  Secondly, it is difficult to understand why DRC officials involved  in
    the airport returns process would seriously think that  asylum  seekers
    had said 'bad things' about their country  in any  public  way,  unless
    they had become politically active  or  vocal  in  the   host  country.
    Leaving aside the fact already noted that they work as part of a  state
    which  is  a  full  party  to  the  Refugee  Convention  and  the   OAU
    Convention, it is clear  that the DGM has a number of dealings with its
    counterparts in  European government with responsibility  for  removing
    asylum seekers (we also note from the   2006  EU  Report  that  France,
    Belgium, Netherlands and  the  UK  have  run  training  programmes  for
    officers from the DGM and provided equipment for  immigration  services
    over the past few years). The experts also tell  us  that  there  is  a
    network of DRC agents in the UK who keep a close eye on  the  Congolese
    community here and  feed  back  to  the  DRC  authorities  anything  of
    interest.  We think it reasonable to assume, therefore, that  the   DRC
    airport officials know that asylum seekers make their claims for asylum
    in host countries (certainly in European countries)  in  a   relatively
    confidential setting and that  it will only be when asylum seekers have
    become politically active that what they have said  about  the  DRC  is
    known  more widely. Knowing that those  they  were  dealing  with  were
    failed asylum seekers, they would also very likely  presume  that  what
    such persons have told their examiners in such relatively  confidential
    settings, has been disbelieved.

193.  Allied to this, it is abundantly  clear  from  the  evidence  we  have
    heard that the current Kabila regime has serious  anxieties  about  the
    activities of all  DRC  nationals  abroad  who  involve  themselves  in
    political activities or  organisations  opposed  to  it.  It  was  E2's
    evidence that the ANR has officials in the UK who conduct  surveillance
    activities and have photographs of every DRC national involved in anti-
    regime activities. Miss Atherton emphasised  the  need  for  care  when
    doing her work  to  ensure  those  she  spoke  to  were  not  in  truth
    government agents.  The high-ranking airport  official  interviewed  by
    Jenny Cuffe made plain that one of the  reasons  why  failed  returning
    asylum seekers were interrogated was to find out  what  they  had  said
    about the DRC government. If the DRC authorities believed that the mere
    act of claiming asylum was traitorous, such lines of questioning  would
    be largely superfluous. We also think that it is na�ve to suggest  that
    the DRC intelligence and security services would take  such  a  blanket
    view of a sizeable section of the UK's DRC diaspora.  If the regime  is
    extremely   paranoid   about   its   position   vis-�-vis    opposition
    organisations and about possible plots/coups d'etat, then we  think  it
    safe to infer that the principal task of its intelligence and  security
    agents will be  to  focus  on  those  who  are  politically  active  in
    mobilising or plotting against the regime.

194.  Further, there is ample evidence to show that the DRC authorities  are
    well aware that many of their nationals who go abroad to Europe  do  so
    for reasons of economic betterment.  They are clearly  well  aware  too
    that legal routes of migration to Europe are very restricted. The media
    in the DRC is said to report sympathetically on the situation of  those
    who leave for economic reasons and, in view of the fact that the DRC is
    167th in the UN's Development Index, with a life expectancy  of  around
    forty years and with half of the  country subsisting on around $1 a day
    (US) or less (see the  2006  EU Report), it must be apparent to  anyone
    in the DRC, that claiming asylum abroad can sometimes, if not often, be
    for purely economic  motives.  We  have  also   had  very  considerable
    evidence about the increasingly active and sophisticated role played by
    'Ngulu' ('pig') organisations in Kinshasa and elsewhere and  about  the
    fact that some individual officials  in the  DRC (including  those  who
    work at N'Djili airport) are complicit. The 2006 EU Report states:

         "The 'Ngulu' networks organising unofficial migration from the  DRC
         to Europe benefit from complicity by individuals with the Congolese
         authorities.  This problem is exacerbated by the low and  irregular
         salaries received by civil servants, who seek to  supplement  their
         income by  taking  bribes  from  "Ngulu"  networks  or  individuals
         seeking to leave the DRC.


         'Ngulu' networks are generally seen in  a  positive  light  by  the
         Congolese population, as despite their exorbitant  fees,  they  are
         helping people to  achieve  a  widely  held  dream.  Naturally  the
         government is reluctant to take  what  would  be  unpopular  action
         against them.   Likewise  remittances  sent  back  from  Europe  by
         Congolese form an important part of  the  DRC's  economy,  and  the
         government is reluctant to interrupt this flow."

195.  Fifthly, there have been no official government or pro-government  (or
    indeed any) public statements or reports brought to our attention which
    portray asylum seekers as traitors. If the  DRC  authorities  seriously
    believed that the generality of DRC asylum seekers in Europe or the  UK
    were traitors, then we would have thought they  would  have  sought  to
    publicise the fact, so as to deter further acts of  betrayal.   As  the
    above information indicates, the position would seem to be quite to the
    contrary, that the government sees  many  of  them  as  benefiting  the
    economy.

Risks specific to failed asylum seekers from UK/ Europe
196.  Another prominent feature of the  appellant's  case  was  that  failed
    asylum seekers returned from the UK would run a risk additional to that
    facing those returned from other countries because of the fact that the
    ruling group in Kinshasa perceives the Congolese community in the UK as
    aggressively anti-regime. Various witnesses have referred to  the  fact
    that there have been a number of incidents in the UK  in  which  Kabila
    aides have been attacked, the principal incident  being  an  attack  in
    London on 11 October  2006  on  She  Okitundu,  director  of  President
    Kabila's cabinet. The aggressors  were  said  by  E1  to  be  "properly
    trained people". The significance of these (acknowledged) incidents  is
    put most forcibly by E1 who considers that as a result  "all  returnees
    from the UK is [sic] the object of a very specific attention  from  the
    relevant services at the  airport".   More  than  one  returned  failed
    asylum seeker whose cases were given in some details by E2 and  others,
    spoke of airport officials accusing  them  of  being  involved  in  the
    attack on Okitundu.

197.  However, we consider that such concerns and claims are not  borne  out
    by a  critical  approach  to  the  available  evidence.  The  incidents
    affecting Kabila aides have not been confined to the  UK.   E1  himself
    mentions an incident in Brussels and an incident in  Paris  around  the
    same time. The size of the DRC diaspora in  the  UK  is  said  by  Miss
    Atherton to be around 10,000.  Numbers from France  and  Belgium  would
    add significantly to that figure. If the Kabila regime considered  that
    the UK's or Europe's DRC diaspora was generally anti-regime,  we  would
    have expected some  evidence  of  problems  at  the  airport  affecting
    ordinary DRC national travellers  visiting  the  DRC   (on  British  or
    European passports or DRC  passports),  whereas  E1  specifically  said
    there were no problems for such travellers. Furthermore we come back to
    the point that elsewhere in his evidence E1 (like E2)  emphasises  that
    the Kabila regime has a number of agents in the UK who pay particularly
    close attention to the political activities of DRC nationals in the  UK
    and who are said to  have photographs  of  everyone  who  has  attended
    demonstrations  or  other  anti-Kabila  events.  Viewed  against   this
    background, we consider it na�ve to suggest that  the  DRC  authorities
    are unable to differentiate between those in the DRC diaspora  who  are
    anti-regime and those who are either loyal or apolitical.

The "airport witnesses"
198.  We turn now to consider the three "airport witnesses".

199.  In looking at W1, W2 and W3's evidence individually  it  is  important
    that we do not put to one side the totality of their evidence nor  must
    we overlook the background and other evidence concerning the nature  of
    DGM and other security forces' activities at the airport.

Witness 1
200.  W1 is a person who was found credible in his asylum  appeal.  As  such
    we take the account he gave then as a starting-point when assessing his
    evidence in this case. We remind ourselves, however, that  we  are  not
    bound by findings of fact  previously  made,  where  there  is  new  or
    further evidence which casts a different light: see Ocampo [2006]  EWCA
    Civ 1276 (and now AA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 1040).

201.  In his recent written evidence and oral testimony W1 has  presented  a
    picture of himself as someone who regularly visited N'Djili airport  in
    a  supervisory  capacity  and  had  developed  a  close  knowledge  and
    understanding of airport procedures  in  relation  to  deportees/failed
    asylum seekers. Although he did seek to qualify this at certain  points
    by emphasising that he did not have knowledge  of  "small  day  to  day
    matters", it was central to his evidence that he was in a  position  to
    describe what generally happened  at  the  airport  based  on  his  own
    experience between 1998- December 2002 (and since,  through  high-level
    and airport contacts).  As we have seen, W1 described the wide  use  of
    physical ill treatment  against  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  and
    deportees and the risk to women (even those who were not  deportees  or
    failed asylum seekers) of being raped - on such a regular basis  as  to
    be fairly described as commonplace. Bribery  and  extortion  were  also
    said to be routine. It was said that these events took place in  either
    a  holding  cell  called  'Permanence'  or   offices   called   'Bureau
    Contentieux' and such treatment was likely  to  occur  thereafter  away
    from the airport at holding detention centres or prisons.

202.  We have considerable difficulty with this portrayal for  a  number  of
      reasons.

203.  First of all, from  his recent witness statements  and  oral  evidence
      it was clear that W1 considered it accurate to describe himself  as  a
      high-ranking official with  a  key  role  in  the  Military  Court  as
      principal assistant to the chief prosecutor. Furthermore, for much  of
      the last year or so in this  post  he  was  heavily  involved  in  the
      prosecutions mounted against those  (and  there  were  many  of  them)
      suspected of involvement in the assassination of President  Kabila  in
      January 2001: there can hardly have been a more  intensive  and  high-
      profile job in the DRC at that time. He further  spoke  of  having  an
      ongoing,  wide-ranging,  multiple  set  of  liaison   responsibilities
      covering both military and civilian government services, all of  which
      fell under the jurisdiction of the  Military  Court.  He  was  also  a
      standing magistrate. He spoke of various missions taking him elsewhere
      in the country on numerous occasions during his period  of  employment
      there. Yet at the same time, he wished to present himself (in his 2007
      evidence) as someone with close working knowledge of  N'Djili  airport
      matters and able to speak knowledgeably about what happened there on a
      "day to day basis" (para 37 of his May 2007 statement). He claimed  to
      visit  there  several  times  a  week.  In  our  view,  W1  could  not
      realistically have had the involvement at the airport which he claimed
      and his attempt to enhance the extent of his airport (and Kin Maziere)
      knowledge and involvement is a deliberate  embellishment  designed  to
      bolster his efforts to have his evidence on airport (and Kin  Maziere)
      procedures treated as empirically based. We noted  that  in  his  oral
      testimony it transpired that following his  appointment  as  principal
      assistant to the chief prosecutor sometime in  2001,  the  latter  had
      given W1's liaison officer job to someone  else.  When  asked  how  he
      could therefore have continued his claimed work base at  the  airport,
      W1 said that his successor was not up to the job and so he  needed  to
      go with him often. In our view that explanation did little to  enhance
      the credibility of his original claim.

204.  Secondly, the recent portrayal of himself as someone closely  involved
    with airport matters is very different from the portrayal  he  gave  of
    himself in the context of his asylum claim. In that claim  he  made  no
    specific reference to the Immigration Service's DGM. Nor was there  any
    reference in it to the DGM's involvement  or  his  own  involvement  in
    interrogations or beatings at Kin Maziere  detention  centre.  We  take
    into account that W1 appears not to have been asked any questions about
    his airport or Kin Maziere role. It is also true that  he  did  mention
    being "based at" the airport and that he knew of  ill  treatment  meted
    out to people  on  return,  "especially  if  they  are  wanted  by  the
    government and also if it is known that a person has  claimed  asylum".
    He also mentioned people being "detained, tortured,  killed".  However,
    his claim of risk on return solely related to having helped  his  half-
    brother to escape, his desertion and of his been recognised  on  return
    on account of his high profile. Furthermore, two  other  witnesses,  FL
    and TA, made no reference to his airport role. The statement of FL  (29
    April 2003) confirmed the role of W1 as  part  of  the  Military  Court
    prosecution team and as personal assistant to a high  ranking  officer,
    but made no reference to W1 being involved in  Kin  Maziere  or  Makala
    Prison or in any role supervising the DGM at the  airport.   TA,  in  a
    statement dated 29 April 2003, dealing  with  his  having  entered  the
    United Kingdom in company with W1, makes no reference to  W1  having  a
    role in the  airport.  Witness  W2  in  his  AIR  refers  to  W1  as  a
    magistrate, a soldier and Secretary to the  Military  Court  and  chief
    prosecutor.  It is also far from clear to us, although we lack evidence
    on this, that W1's supervisory role could have been  as  direct  as  he
    described. The chief of the DGM would surely, in  our  view,  have  had
    routine responsibility for disciplinary matters involving DGM officers.

205.  Thirdly, the portrayal W1 presents (in common with that of W2 and  W3)
    is extremely discordant with that indicated by other weightier sources,
    including, the EU HoM in their April 2006 report and  E1.  Whilst  even
    E1, at least in parts of his report (which  we  deem  below  to  embody
    "Position A") described ill treatment at the airport, there is  nothing
    in those parts to suggest anything like the scale  and  extent  of  ill
    treatment described by W1: a consistent pattern of  torture,  rape  and
    dispossession. If there was anything remotely  suggested  by  E1's  own
    body of sources (as assessed by him) to indicate  such  a  pattern,  we
    believe that E1 would have said so. Indeed, if W1 is right, then E1 has
    been misinformed for several years. W1's portrayal is  also  not  borne
    out by what we know about the media in the  DRC,  which  includes  many
    organs who are openly critical of the government and  who  often  carry
    reports of abuses by government officials in other aspects of  life  in
    the DRC (particularly in prisons and detention  centres).  We  find  it
    inconceivable that they would have failed to have come to learn of such
    an appalling and long-standing  pattern  of  abuses.  On  W1's  account
    literally several hundred (if not thousands of) deportees/failed asylum
    seekers would have  either  been  killed  or  disappeared  or  received
    torture or been raped over the past decade or so,  yet  the  media  has
    been silent about all this. To say that airport  officials  kept  these
    abuses away from view and maintained a code of silence does not  answer
    the problem with the evidence here. All or most victims would have  had
    family or friends - many desperate, we think it safe to infer, to  tell
    the media what was going on, in the same way as family and  friends  of
    detention victims have done.

206.  Fourthly, W1's account  of  immigration  officials  on  the  one  hand
    collectively (and openly between themselves) participating  in  routine
    acts of torture, rape and dispossession against deportees/failed asylum
    seekers and on the other hand banding together in a code of silence  is
    very difficult to square with certain aspects of  W2's  and  W3's  (and
    sometimes his own) evidence and that from other quarters,  for  example
    from E2. Such factors include:  the intense rivalry  between  different
    services at the airport,  the  frequent  changes  in  the  top  office-
    holders, the various efforts by  Kabila's  own  security  officials  to
    catch out airport officials involved in  taking  bribes.  On  W1's  own
    account he himself had taken steps to charge and prosecute several  DGM
    officers. Even assuming a significant number had protection from  high-
    placed relatives, W1 did not  suggest  that  this  prevented  him  from
    arresting them; only from them been sentenced and dismissed from  their
    posts. Yet on his general account the patterns  of  torture,  rape  and
    dispossession were openly displayed and practised.

207.  Fifthly, we do not consider that W1 gave a  truthful  account  of  the
    nature of his own involvement in wrongdoings at the  airport.  Although
    he sought to convey that he spent a considerable amount of time at  the
    airport trying to prevent abuses and in several cases taking action  to
    arrest  and  punish  wrongdoers,  he  was  unable  to  explain  to  our
    satisfaction why he would only have accepted a bribe on  one  occasion.
    Indeed even on that point his evidence was inconsistent, since  in  his
    May 2007 statement he referred to  "bribes"  and  elsewhere  said  that
    corruption took place at every level and  "I  received  a  cut  of  the
    bribes that were paid" (paras 49,51). If, on his account  everyone  was
    doing it routinely, why would he  confine  himself,  as  he  maintained
    before us, to just one occasion? We cannot overlook, either, that  even
    on his own (somewhat coy) account, he had practised torture. We  accept
    that W1 has recently sought to say that since arrival in the UK he  had
    more fully recognised how appalling the conduct  of  officials  at  the
    airport (and in Kin Maziere) was and now wishes to do what  he  can  to
    help stop it. But we do not accept that at the time his own role was an
    enlightened as he now seeks to say it (for the most part) was.

208.  A further difficulty we have with W1's evidence  concerns  the  claims
    he has made  about  his  current  contacts  with  various  high-ranking
    officials in the  DRC.  Of  course,  since  W1's  last  claimed  direct
    knowledge of airport procedures was nearly 5  years  ago  (in  December
    2002), his evidence might have been thought of historical  value  only.
    However, he has insisted that his portrayal continues to  describe  the
    current situation, because he has a number of reliable sources who have
    been and are keeping him up-to-date. In our view why  someone  in  W1's
    position would have been involved in so many exchanges  of  information
    readily conducted by DRC officials holding positions very  high  up  in
    the  government  in  the  DRC  has  not  been   adequately   explained,
    particularly  as  on  W1's  account   such   exchanges   involve   open
    communication    through    unencrypted    means    on    a     regular
    weekly/monthly/sometimes slightly longer  basis.  We  remind  ourselves
    that his sources would be well aware that these exchanges would be with
     someone regarded by the Kabila regime as a deserter and (he agreed)  a
    betrayer of his country,  a man willing to tell 'bad stories' about the
    conduct of the DRC security forces and immigration services. Whilst  we
    take fully into account the complex dialectics of  DRC  politics,  with
    e.g. rebel involvement in the previous transitional government and  the
    likelihood that top-ranking officials are  sometimes  persons  who  are
    intent on working against rather than for the interests of  the  Kabila
    inner circle, we consider W1's evidence about his  contacts  largely  a
    contrivance. We can accept that given his previous  high  rank  he  may
    well be someone with whom some  current  high-ranking  officials  would
    want to contact discreetly, but his account of a significant number  of
    such sources ready to  up-date  him  through  unencrypted  means  about
    airport abuses even knowing he was involved in this case as a potential
    witness, is not credible. We did not find  credible  W1's  explanation,
    when challenged about this matter, that they were all secret  opponents
    of the regime, particularly given their high ranks and responsibilities
    in the present regime.

209.  In addition we do not find W1 to be a credible  and  reliable  witness
    in connection with  his  coming  to  the  United  Kingdom.  In  largely
    unexplained circumstances it is claimed that W1's  wife  was  found  in
    their DRC home in or about April 2002 to have  been  in  possession  of
    materials associating her with 'rebels'.   This led to W1 and his  wife
    being  detained  in  Lubumbashi  and  his  wife   being   released   in
    circumstances that simply are not explained in any  adequate  way,  she
    leaving the country, without W1's knowledge of her whereabouts or  even
    departure plans.  W1 was in due course released, returning to his work,
    presumably in or about May 2002 through to December 2002.  He  says  he
    did so without material difficulty or any  adverse  inferences  arising
    from his wife's absence.  How that could be so remains unexplained.  We
    find that the arrangements for the departure of W1's wife were in  fact
    of a very different nature than W1 has described.  If  W1  was  a  high
    official as he claims of the significance that he was in  the  Military
    Court, we are also puzzled as to why he  would  have  been  taken  from
    Kinshasa to Lubumbashi, a very  substantial  distance  to  be  held  or
    interrogated about rebel involvement  as  claimed:  it  is  simply  not
    credible as presently explained.  We find it far more  likely  that  W1
    was not detained in the way he claimed and knew his wife had  left  and
    that he was very probably involved in the arrangements for  her  to  do
    so. It is apparent that if she was of any interest, her conduct in  the
    way  she  departed  did  not  give  rise  thereafter  to  any   adverse
    consequences for W1.

210.  W1 also gave quite inconsistent evidence regarding  his  knowledge  of
    his wife's whereabouts when he arrived in the UK. On the  one  hand  he
    has claimed not to know the whereabouts of his wife. On the other  hand
    there is the supporting letter to his asylum  application  through  his
    solicitors, which shows that, within  two  days  of  his  arrival,  the
    whereabouts of his wife and her Home Office reference number  had  been
    notified to the Home Office. W1 sought to explain this in terms of  his
    solicitors having found out this information from their own  inquiries.
    Even disregarding the fact that for  the  Home  Office  to  have  given
    details of W1's wife's address without  her  authorisation  would  have
    been contrary to Home Office policy, this claim is unsupported  by  any
    other evidence and, given that on W1's own evidence he  had  not  asked
    his solicitors to find his wife's address, it is one which  strikes  us
    as implausible.

211.  In the light of the above considerations we  have  considerable  doubt
    whether the same view of W1's credibility would have been taken by  the
    Adjudicator in May 2003 if W1 had voiced then the much wider  claim  he
    now has. This wider claim covered not just being principal assistant to
    the  chief  prosecutor  and  heavily  involved  in  prosecuting  Kabila
    assassination suspects  but  also  being  engaged  in  diverse  liaison
    duties, missions, actions throughout  the  country,  assisting  various
    high level individuals and having a prominent  role  and  base  at  the
    airport. Given the stance the Secretary  of  State  had  taken  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal letter and the absence of cross-examination through
    the respondent failing to provide a Presenting Officer,  there  was  in
    any event no full testing of W1's claim.  We thus  have  no  idea  what
    view would have been taken of W1's credibility had the totality of  his
    story, as now presented, fallen for consideration. But the omission  of
    those various matters which are now claimed to have taken place at  the
    same time seriously affects the reliability of that decision so far  as
    we are concerned.  On the fuller evidence before us, we are prepared to
    accept that he was principal assistant to the chief prosecutor and that
    he may well have had occasion to visit N'Djili airport and Kin Maziere,
    although it was notable that when pressed in  cross-examination  as  to
    what caused him to visit the airport the examples he gave  were  purely
    military matters (apprehending deserters etc).

212.  We should mention that in assessing W1's  credibility  we  have  taken
    into account E1's assessment that, having  met  and  discussed  matters
    with W1, he was a  credible  source;  however,  in  the  light  of  our
    analysis we found  ourselves  unable  to  attach  any  weight  to  this
    assessment.

Witness W2
213.  We did not find W2 a credible witness. In his screening  interview  W2
    gave a largely incoherent explanation for his presence, but in the  SEF
    statement he claimed that he had been a DGM immigration official at the
    airport in 2000 and gave as his reason for leaving that in October 2002
    he had been involved in dealing with two arrivals at the airport  on  a
    UN flight of two individuals who  he  later  learnt  were  brothers  of
    Joseph Kabila.  He had had them held in a holding  cell  ('Permanence')
    at the airport as he was unable to  check  their  immigration  position
    there and then. Discovery of his error led to him being  denounced  for
    his insulting conduct, and being detained  in  Makala  Prison  for  two
    months. W2 claimed that on or about 20 December 2002 he had been  taken
    to the airport, having been provided with his  DGM  uniform.  There  he
    found inside his pair of socks and shoes his DGM identity card for  use
    at the airport, this property having been mixed up apparently with  the
    property of other detained people. The  reason  W2  was  taken  to  the
    airport was  to  open  W2's  personal  safe  which  contained  the  two
    strangers' documents, which other officers interrogating him  had  been
    unable to open. Coincidentally at this time  a  problem  arose  at  the
    airport involving steps being taken to try and prevent  W1's  departure
    from the DRC.  W2's two guards were distracted and W2 was able to  slip
    away unnoticed, using  his  DGM  identity  card  to  make  his  escape.
    Thereafter W2 left the DRC (on a business class ticket) wearing his DGM
    uniform from a different airport at the end of December  2002.   Having
    arrived in the United Kingdom, he made a claim for asylum based only on
    the above stated circumstances relating to the  detention  of  the  two
    individuals, and on 11  August  2003  Mr  A.G.  O'Malley  (Adjudicator)
    accepted W2 had held the role of Immigration Officer and  had  been  in
    charge of a team of some twenty officers at the airport (N'djili),  but
    rejected the entirety of his claim otherwise. The adverse decision  was
    not the subject of an appeal.

214.  That brings us to the first reason why we did not  find  W2  credible.
    Save in one limited respect, his asylum claim was found not credible by
    an Adjudicator. We, of course, have further evidence  relating  to  his
    claim, but in our view it only reinforces the  adverse  view  taken  of
    W2's credibility earlier. His account was found implausible in a number
    of respects and we would observe that his escape account also relied on
    a quite remarkable number of fortuitous events (e.g. being  given  back
    his DGM uniform, finding his ID  card  in  socks)  happening  in  rapid
    succession.

215.  Furthermore, W2 cannot be said to have no  personal  interest  in  the
    portrayal he has given of the situation at the airport being  believed.
    He is an absconder who for several years has failed to notify the  Home
    Office of his address or whereabouts. He stated that he has made (or is
    in the process of making) a fresh claim. As a failed asylum  seeker  he
    has considerable self-interest in seeking to maintain a  further  claim
    on the basis of being a refugee sur place.  He  has  also  been  openly
    involved in publicising the claimed misconduct of the DGM and others at
    the airport. These are said to  be  matters  of  interest  to  the  DRC
    authorities who keep close watch on the activities of DRC nationals  in
    the UK.

216.  We also consider it significant that W2's  more  recent  accounts  (in
      his January 2004 joint letter and in his 2007 statements) are markedly
      different from that he gave in the context of  his  asylum  claim.  In
      that claim it  had  been  no  part  of  his  case  that  he  had  been
      (reluctantly or otherwise) involved in or present  whilst  there  were
      abuses at the airport practised on  deportees/failed  asylum  seekers,
      including  rape,  torture,  extracting   bribes,   stealing   property
      (passengers luggage and personal possessions), nor had  he  given  any
      inkling of his objection to such matters as having any bearing on  his
      reasons for leaving the country or on the nature of the risks he would
      face on return. It is therefore only recently that W2 claims  to  have
      possessed revelatory knowledge of the airport and  the  activities  of
      the DGM.

217.  As with W1 and w3's more recent evidence we also consider  significant
      the fact that W2 presents a picture of treatment  of  deportees/failed
      asylum seekers at the airport which is  at  wide  variance  with  that
      given in other more reliable sources. The claims for example that "no"
      deportee leaves the airport, that torture and general brutality by DGM
      officers is widespread and routine and that this has been the  pattern
      for many years are not supported by evidence from, for example, the EU
      HoM 2006 report. As already noted in relation to  E1,  even  his  most
      pessimistic position (Position A) does not  remotely  suggest  such  a
      picture of pervasive iniquity. As already noted in  relation  to  W1's
      claims, we consider that if W2's claims  were  true  this  would  have
      become known to the DRC media - not to mention local and international
      NGOs and embassies. We do not accept that this can be such a well kept
      secret.

218.  Moreover W2's own portrayal is at odds with some aspects  of  his  own
      evidence. For example, having said that "all" deportees/failed  asylum
      seekers are subjected to onward detention, he elsewhere estimates that
      (in his time)  20% whilst still at the airport were "lucky  enough  to
      use bribes to be freed" (see para 66). Before us he said  that  family
      interventions succeeded in "one out of 10" cases.  Curiously  the  two
      Rwandan foreigners, despite what he said elsewhere about the  especial
      hatred felt for persons in this category, were not said by him to have
      been mistreated. Having described immigration officers and members  of
      other services as boasting openly about the rape of  women  returnees,
      he refers to the distrust felt by differing DGM airport  directors  of
      their predecessor's colleagues and several cases  where  officers  had
      been arrested for misconduct and also to efforts by the  Kabila  inner
      circle and/or top officials at the airport to catch  officers  out  in
      misconduct. The joint letter he wrote in January 2004 with W3 makes no
      mention of torture or rape at the airport and the reference in  it  to
      "liquidation" would appear to refer to a post-detention context.

219.  We also find implausible W2's claims about his  airport  contacts.  To
    begin with, the account he gave about them in his  May  2007  statement
    gave no clue to the important qualification he made before  us,  namely
    that there had been a 4 year period since he left the DRC during  which
    he cut off all contact with persons from the DRC. At paras 71 and 72 of
    his first statement he said: "[s]ince arriving in the UK, I  have  been
    in touch with my colleagues in the DRC...I have been in regular contact
    with my DGM officers." There is further the highly  dubious  nature  of
    his claim to have high level connections in the DRC  (even  after  a  4
    year gap). Given the illegal nature of his departure from the  DRC  and
    the fact that he readily agreed his contacts knew that  he  was  openly
    anti-regime and was regarded by the Kabila regime as  a  traitor  (they
    were also said to know about this country guidance  case),  we  do  not
    find it credible that they would expose themselves (through unencrypted
    phone connections) and others to the  risk  of  disclosure,  especially
    given the widely claimed presence  of  DRC  security  services  in  the
    United Kingdom. We do not find satisfactory his explanation  that  they
    were prepared to do this as they were themselves  against  the  regime.
    Not just one but several of his sources as named to us were high-level.
     We  do  not  accept  the  suggestion  that  several  such  high  level
    informants are likely to be opponents of the present  regime.  We  also
    find it hard to understand why such high-level sources  would  wish  to
    enter into contact with W2 (even before any  talk  of  a  new  Tribunal
    country guidance case) when W2 was a relatively minor official  himself
    (in charge of 20 men only): he spoke of his transfer to the airport  as
    a "demotion". According to W2,  different  heads  of  the  DGM  at  the
    airport deeply distrusted all staff who were not ones they  had  chosen
    themselves. W2 did not seek to suggest that all  his  current  contacts
    had historic loyalties of this kind.

220.  Nor do we find that W2 gave a credible account of his  own  degree  of
    involvement in airport wrongdoings. For the  most  part  he  sought  to
    minimise his own involvement in such wrongdoings and to  highlight  the
    attempts he made to intervene: he said in evidence before  us  that  he
    sought to intervene without success "often"and he maintained that as  a
    team leader he was appalled by the abuse and would not take part in it.
    Yet elsewhere he claimed to have been present near an office and  taken
    some passing interest in some of the  particular  events  of  rape  and
    laughing at a colleague seen with his trousers down. We do not find the
    claim of such systematic abuse is credible and we consider his  attempt
    to try and explain his non- involvement in it as an artifice  to  avoid
    the fact that those events  did  not  occur  during  his  time  at  the
    airport.

221.  Leaving aside that before  us  he  also  accepted  that  he  had  used
    torture more than 10 times and that he had witnessed women being  raped
    3 times, we also find his claim elsewhere to  have  sought  to  prevent
    such wrongdoings very hard to reconcile with his own claim that  anyone
    who did not go along with the pattern of abuse stood out as someone who
    was not playing his part and who would risk been seen  as  disloyal  by
    his colleagues. He made no mention of been regarded by  his  colleagues
    when working at the airport prior to the Rwandan incident as disloyal.

222.  Nor do we find credible W2's claim that on  arrival,  when  returnees'
    luggage might contain  evidence,  clues  and/or  indications  of  their
    history  and  connections,  it  would  simply  be  taken  away  without
    examination.  (On W2's evidence all baggage is taken  away  and  either
    its contents, if of worth, are shared out or alternatively its contents
    are sold and the  proceeds  form  part  of  a  general  pool  for  that
    particular team on duty to share out amongst themselves as agreed.)

223.  Further, we do not accept W2's claimed involvement  in  interrogations
    in Kin Maziere detention centre as true.  We find  that  his  claim  to
    have knowledge of those matters is simply fiction.

Witness 3
224.  For reasons already  given,  we  do  not  find  that  the  consistency
    between W3, W2's and W1's evidence weighs in favour of any of them.

225.  Like W2, W3 is  someone  whose  asylum  claim  ended  in  failure.  In
    October 2004 the second  Adjudicator,  Mr  N  Davison,  found  him  not
    credible. It is clear in our view that, so far as previous findings  of
    fact on this individual are concerned, those we should take as a start-
    point  are  Mr  Davison's.  When  finding  the  previous  Adjudicator's
    determination unsustainable, the IAT had ordered remittal for a  "fresh
    hearing". In any event, even the first  Adjudicator  had  not  believed
    W3's account in major respects. She found at para 18  that  he  was  an
    Immigration Officer but that "he has  created  an  account  around  his
    job". She went on to reject the truth of his claim  as  to  the  events
    which caused him to leave and the circumstances of  his  departure.  Be
    that as it may, when the appeal of W3 came to be reheard by Mr Davison,
    W3 was not believed. He took the view that gaps in  W3's  knowledge  of
    critical issues,  such  as  false  documents  relevant  to  Immigration
    Officers and other related matters, demonstrated that  W3  was  not  an
    Immigration Officer, and had not been, since 1998, in  the  immigration
    service.  Mr Jacobs may be right that  Mr  Davison's  findings  do  not
    specify rejection of all aspects of W3's claim, but what  can  be  said
    with certainty is that they contain no positive findings. (We also note
    that before Mr Davison W3's account of his  detention  experiences  had
    changed so that the sexual relationship with the lady was described  as
    consensual.). There was no appeal against  the  Tribunal's  refusal  of
    permission to appeal this decision.


226.  Even if we had found there was some earlier concession  which  somehow
    survives, it went no further  than  acceptance  that  W3  had  been  an
    Immigration Officer at N'Djili airport. And even if we  assume  (as  we
    are prepared to do for the purposes of the analysis which follows) that
    he was such, that does not lead us to accept the truth of  the  account
    W3 has given of procedures at the airport and Kin Maziere. We  continue
    to count against him that he is someone who was not believed previously
    in most material respects. He is a failed asylum seeker.

227.  W3 is also someone who clearly has a vested interest in his  portrayal
    of procedures at the airport being believed, since, as he noted in  his
    May 2007 statement, he is "building a fresh claim for  asylum".  He  is
    also someone who has been actively involved sur place in  the  campaign
    around this case, addressing at least two public  meetings  about  this
    intended country guidance case in his own name.

228.  We are not satisfied by W3's attempted explanations as to  the  change
    in his story  about  his  presence  at  the  airport  in  2000.  It  is
    noticeable that W3 had originally claimed to  have  been  working  (and
    photographed working) for the DGM at the airport in 2000.  As  set  out
    above, W3 now says that claim was wrong and that he had been advised by
    his  then  representatives  not  to  correct  it.  Yet  at  his  asylum
    interview, when he was specifically asked if  he  wished  to  make  any
    changes on 16 June 2003, he did not do so. He maintained that falsehood
    when conducting his appeal through legal representation  in  July  2004
    before an Adjudicator, Mrs  N.  Bircher.  He  continued  it  before  Mr
    Davison despite having changed his original  legal  representation.  We
    can find no reason why the matter could not have been corrected then if
    the correction was true. The willingness to deceive stands as a  factor
    against W3's credibility.

229.  We also reject  W3's  explanation  of  his  earlier  presence  at  the
    airport that somehow  he  was  at  the  airport  in  2000  temporarily,
    collecting monies for charity. We note  the  witness  statement  of  NN
    lodged in support of an  appeal  by  W3,  dated  21  October  2004  and
    postdating the hearing before Mr Davison, stating that NN was a regular
    visitor to the airport, had met W3 in 1998 and had subsequently seen W3
    in 2000 at the airport where "he was working at the  checkpoints".   NN
    describes fleeing the DRC in 2001 and says of W3: " I  further  confirm
    that since 2000 to the time I fled the country I saw him  (W3)  at  the
    airport and that I often liaised with him for the  proper  facilitation
    of paperwork." It appears that the  statement  of  NN  was  written  to
    buttress W3's original claimed presence at  the  airport  in  2000.  As
    regards W3's recent claim that he had in fact been at  the  airport  in
    2000 as a temporary measure for two months collecting  for  charity  as
    part of the war effort, we find this  difficult  to  square  with  NN's
    account of seeing W3 "often" during this period and  we  did  not  find
    satisfactory W3's attempt to explain why, if he  was  collecting  money
    for charity, that would have  been  at  checkpoints.  NN  described  W3
    facilitating immigration, not charity, paperwork.

230.  For the sake of clarity we do not mean by the above to imply  that  we
    found the statement of NN reliable evidence of W3's  employment  as  an
    Immigration Officer. Its principal significance for us is its  lack  of
    consistency with W3's more recent evidence.

231.  So far as W3's recent evidence is  concerned,  we  consider  that,  as
    with W1 and W3, the picture he presents is  significantly  at  variance
    with that given in other more reliable sources.

232.  We also note that the account W3 has given in  his  recent  statements
    is notably different in certain respects  from  that  he  gave  in  the
    course of his asylum claim and appeal.  He  made  no  mention  then  of
    torture and rape at the airport as being commonplace  and  he  did  not
    seek to base his fear on return upon what would  happen  to  him  as  a
    failed asylum seeker. Strangely, despite feeling impelled  (along  with
    W2) to write an open letter in January  2004  to  European  governments
    about abuse at the airport, he did not  deem  it  important  enough  to
    mention to Mr Davison in the context of his own appeal. And, so far  as
    this document is concerned, the account it gives  does  not  extend  to
    describing routine torture or rape at the airport. In translation  this
    letter is said to be "For the attention of countries  of  the  European
    Union and human rights organisations concerning  the  repatriations  of
    Congolese nationals to the Democratic Republic of Congo", and to  throw
    light on the ways in which deported asylum seekers are treated on their
    arrival in the DRC. It purports to set out categories of deportees  who
    have made 'declarations' which call into question  the  credibility  of
    the regime in the DRC.  It is said the returnees are arrested  directly
    at the foot of the plane, stripped of everything they  have  of  value,
    watches, telephone, jewellery, shoes,  money  and  clothes,  and  after
    interview are transferred to specialised security services such as  the
    ANR/DEMIAP or the Military  Court   in  order  to  be  interviewed  and
    punished.  However, we note  that  this  document,  which  purports  to
    recite the dangers faced, makes no reference whatsoever to rape at  the
    airport, nor to torture. Nor does it mention as normal  procedure  that
    deportees/failed asylum seekers are transferred to Kin Maziere.

233.  Despite very close resemblance between most of W3's  and  W2's  recent
    evidence,  there  are  some  significant  differences.  In  particular,
    whereas W2 had never heard  of  questions  being  asked  about  illegal
    emigration networks, W3 said it was common.

234.  There are also significant internal inconsistencies in  W3's  evidence
    regarding procedures at the airport and at Kin Maziere. On the one hand
    he  describes  deportees/failed  asylum  seekers  as  being   routinely
    tortured and raped and having all their  money  and  possessions  taken
    from them. He also points out how hazardous it is for airport staff  to
    seek to release anyone on a bribe.  Yet  elsewhere  he  estimates  that
    around 10% can succeed in passing through the airport unharmed  by  use
    of bribery. Originally in evidence  before  us  he  said  that  he  had
    attended (as a primarily note-taking  assistant  to  his  superior  who
    would conduct the interviews) around 100 interviews  of  failed  asylum
    seekers at Kin Maziere including many with women. Yet in May 2007, when
    describing his work together with his superior at Kin Maziere he stated
    at para 25 that: "I only ever interviewed  one  woman  during  my  time
    attending Kin Maziere."  When asked to explain the apparent  difference
    W3 was evasive: on  the  one  hand  accepting  that  the  interview  in
    question was conducted with his superior present,  on  the  other  hand
    suggesting (for the first time and in direct contradiction to  what  he
    had said earlier) that on occasions, as here,  he,  not  his  superior,
    conducted the interview.  W3's claims in several places  about  torture
    and rape being endemic and airport officials doing  all  this  brazenly
    are also somewhat at odds with his statements elsewhere  that officials
    at the airport had to watch their back as the government tries to catch
    them out in wrongdoing. W3's claim of the  systematic  seizure  of  all
    returnees' property (baggage, personal possessions,  jewellery  and  so
    forth) belies what is otherwise said to be the  case,  namely  releases
    can be secured from the airport on payment of a bribe, bearing in  mind
    it was also part of W3's evidence that few  relatives  are  present  at
    arrivals. We note too that W3 appeared to us to have limited  knowledge
    of what is revealed on an aircraft  manifest  and  the  extent  of  his
    knowledge on who is  returning  appears  to  be  a  variance  with  the
    generally understood position.

235.  We did not find W3's explanation of the nature of his own  involvement
    in wrongdoings at the airport satisfactory. In his May  2007  statement
    he clearly described himself as laughing and joking with his boss after
    the latter had just raped a woman returnee. He made no mention  of  any
    reservations he felt or expressed. Yet before us he said that he was  a
    humanist and had only behaved in this way so as not to stand out and be
    considered disloyal. We find it most unlikely, if W3 was  one  of  many
    teams that worked at the airport, that he would have been able  not  to
    participate in the routine abuses he described, without  it  coming  to
    the attention  of  his  team  and  giving  rise  to  doubts  about  his
    motivation and/or  reliability  in  the  job.  We  find  (even  on  the
    assumption he was an Immigration  Officer  at  the  airport)  that  the
    claimed activities did not occur.

236.  We do not find W3's evidence of significant DRC  'contacts'  credible.
    We do not accept that  someone  at  his  (relatively  lowly)  level  of
    claimed employment should have high level of contacts still in the DRC.
    Nor do we find credible his explanation for why high ranking  officials
    would wish to risk contact -openly  communicating  by  ordinary  mobile
    phone- with someone regarded by the Kabila regime as a traitor.

The IK Article and the Observer 16 September 2007  evidence  and  additional
comments on W1,W2 and W3
237.  In their evidence W2 and W3 referred to the evidence of IK who in  the
    article which appeared on  the  Congoscopie  website  on  4  July  2006
    described himself as having been  an  Immigration  Officer  at  N'Djili
    airport until 2005. IK's article refers to W1 arresting people  at  the
    airport  "...until the  days  his  conscience  was  awaken  and  become
    himself a target of his masters". IK also refers to  the  arrest  of  a
    relative of the sometime head of DGM at the airport,  Mr  Yamboua,  for
    assisting W1's departure from the DRC. IK claims to  have  assisted  at
    the arrest of W2 by the COM service for refusing to stamp  entry  visas
    in the passports of  two  Rwandans  who  were  claiming  to  belong  to
    President Kabila's family despite the intervention of a MONUC  official
    accompanying them. IK goes on to  say  that  in  October  2002  W2  was
    "...again accused of assisting W1 to escape to exile".W2  claimed  that
    IK, a DGM officer, and W3 were in one of the photographs he produced.

238.  We do not find this article's contents are reliable and  we  find  the
    comments on it by W2 and W3 only create further difficulties  regarding
    the  reliability  of  their  own  evidence.   There   are   significant
    differences between IK's account and that given by W2 and W3. IK refers
    to the arrest of a man, JM, for assisting W2's escape; whereas W2 makes
    no mention of this man's involvement in his escape. In contrast to IK's
    account of W2 refusing to stamp entry visas in the passports of the two
    Rwandans claiming to be Kabila relatives and  being  accompanied  by  a
    MONUC representative, W2 denies knowing that the two men's arrival  was
    on a UN or MONUC plane or that they had told him they were relatives of
    Kabila. W2 makes no reference to any MONUC representative. W2 does  not
    refer to IK's presence  at  his  own  arrest.  W2  claims  to  have  no
    knowledge of being implicated in the escape of W1 and  his  sources  in
    the DRC  had not told him he was charged for helping W1 escape. Yet  IK
    states that W2 was  convicted  and  sentenced  in  absentia  for  this.
    Whereas IK refers to W2 being arrested for a  second  time  in  October
    2002 (for assisting W1 to escape to exile), W2 refers to being arrested
    only once. IK says that he witnessed the arrest of W3  in  March  2003,
    who was accused of being in connivance with the rebellion in the  east.
    W3, somewhat differently, said his arrest was  over  the  admission  in
    Kinshasa of a relative who was on a wanted list and another  person  of
    Rwandan origin.  (We deal below with the man who identified himself  as
    a Kin Maziere torturer in the 16 September 2007 Observer article).

239.  In reaching our conclusions on the evidence of the airport  witnesses,
    W1, W2 and W3 in particular, we have taken into account the fact  that,
    although they differed on certain  matters,  there  was  a  significant
    degree of consistency between the accounts they gave of descriptions of
    the layout of the airport buildings for use by the DGM, the presence of
    other  security  services,    the   procedures   for   expellees   upon
    disembarkation, the perception of failed asylum seekers as  "traitors",
    the nature of the ill treatment said to be meted out to  failed  asylum
    seekers at the airport and at Kin Maziere and the use of bribery taking
    oppressive form.  W2 and W3 also described in very  similar  terms  the
    training they received as DGM officers.  What are we to make  of  these
    similarities, bearing in mind the existence of serious shortcomings  in
    the account each has given and  the  fact  that  their  evidence  about
    abuses  at  the  airport  (along  with  that  given  by  the   Observer
    interviewee) was strikingly  at  odds  with  that  contained  in  other
    reliable sources?  Mr Jacobs submitted that the  fact  that  the  three
    witnesss agreed on so many elements  of  their  evidence  showed  that,
    whatever shortcomings we might find in it, it might well  be  true.  In
    other words, he relies on the similarities between the evidence of  the
    three sources as an additional factor in his favour.

240.    We  have,  of  course,  given  that  submission  the  most   anxious
    consideration. We accept without hesitation  the  proposition  that  if
    three witnesses who are, and whose  evidence  is,  independent  of  one
    another, give similar accounts of an events or events, that is a factor
    pointing to the truth (or basic truth) of what is  described.  But  the
    suggestion of the existence of an alternative reason for the similarity
    destroys much of the basis of  that  argument  unless  the  alternative
    reason is excluded. Here, despite the  witnesses'  vigorous  claims  to
    have had no discussions with one another about the evidence  they  were
    to give, we have reached the view that any similarities  between  their
    accounts is overwhelmingly likely to be the result of such  discussions
    rather than a pointer to the truth of what they said. In short,  we  do
    not believe the claim of non-collaboration. Indeed, the very fact  that
    they chose to make that claim in the circumstances  which  we  describe
    below suggests to us that not only was there  collaboration,  but  that
    the witnesses knew that, if admitted, it would affect our view of their
    evidence.

241.  We have in mind the following circumstances in particular.  First,  it
    is clear that all three knew each other in the  DRC.  They  all  agreed
    about that and we know that not only had W2 and W3 been work colleagues
    in the DRC but also that all three shared the same  influential  mentor
    from university/college days. Secondly, despite  each  of  them  basing
    their own accounts of why they had fled the  DRC  to  claim  asylum  on
    quite distinct and different grounds, the evidence  they  have  adduced
    has each of them present at key incidents in their escape stories. Thus
    IK said that W2 was accused of assisting W1 to escape. W3 said  he  was
    at the airport the day that W2 escaped. Thirdly, all  three  have  been
    involved in one or more meetings convened mainly within  the  Congolese
    community in the  UK  in  late  2006/early  2007  whose  specific  aims
    included discussing and collecting evidence about  airport  abuses  for
    this appeal. As already noted W1 was identified in a publicity document
    handed out at one of these meetings in Birmingham  in  March  2007  and
    both W2 and W3 have quite openly paraded their willingness to speak out
    on the issue central to this appeal, regarding the  claimed  abuses  at
    N'Djili airport and thereafter. Fourthly, none of them (save for W1  in
    the briefest of comments) mentioned  anything  specific  about  airport
    abuses in the course of his own asylum claim, despite ample opportunity
    for them to have done so and despite the obvious relevance of  evidence
    of such abuses to their claim to fear risk on return. Fifthly, none  of
    them can be said to be disinterested in  the  outcome  of  this  appeal
    insofar as it affects his own position: W2 and  W3  are  failed  asylum
    seekers who have expressed a specific interest in making a fresh claim;
    W1 continues to give evidence in the asylum appeals of  others  and  he
    has held himself out to certain others, e.g.  E1,  as  having  reliable
    direct (pre-departure) knowledge of abuses of failed asylum seekers  as
    well as reliable indirect knowledge from high-level  sources.  Sixthly,
    since arrival in the UK all three have identified  themselves  publicly
    as being critics of the Kabila regime.

242.  Thus we do not consider that  the  similarities  in  the  evidence  of
    W1,W2 and W3 reflect a true state of  affairs.   On  the  contrary,  we
    think they tend to suggest that their evidence prepared for  this  case
    concerning abuses  at  the  airport  (and  at  Kin  Maziere)  has  been
    orchestrated and organised to support a false case about  risk  at  the
    airport and at Kin Maziere for failed asylum seekers.

243.  For the above reasons, looking at  the  evidence  of  W1,  W2  and  W3
    together with all the other evidence, we do  not  find  credible  their
    claims of ill-treatment of returnees or deportees at the airport or the
    real likelihood of routine onward transfer of failed asylum seekers  or
    deportees to DGM's Kin Maziere or other security services detention  as
    claimed by them.

Miss Jenny Cuffe's Evidence
244.  With one caveat  we  considered  Miss  Cuffe  a  generally  impressive
    witness. We are not judges of journalistic performance, but we can well
    see why her account of her trip to Kinshasa in 2005  and  her  intrepid
    efforts within a short time-frame to contact a range of individuals and
    groups there won her accolades. However, as she very candidly  said  to
    us at the hearing, she had not sought to  ask  a  number  of  questions
    pertinent to any scientific or properly empirical investigation of  the
    issue.  She had not asked to see the ID of any  of  the  failed  asylum
    seekers nor could she recall asking any for any document or details  of
    their asylum claims and reference numbers. She had worked  to  a  tight
    deadline and had not done any follow-up with the Home Office in the  UK
    or any of the  equivalent  government  departments  in  other  European
    countries where failed asylum seekers said they had been returned  from
    (so as to check,  for  example,  whether  such  persons  had  left  the
    UK/other European states when they said  they  had).   Of  course,  her
    subjects may not have had any documentation  and  may  not  necessarily
    have been able or willing to help with such  details,  but  it  remains
    that she did not ask.

245.  Although in her statement she said she was very  careful  not  to  use
    people whose credibility she doubted (and she records  finding  one  or
    two individuals she questioned -including one failed  asylum  seeker  -
    untrustworthy), she agreed with the Tribunal that her general  approach
    to all those she interviewed was to take what  they  said  "on  trust".
    Bearing in mind the opinion of one of the leading experts  on  the  DRC
    (E1) that asylum seekers often invent their  stories,  that  there  are
    strong economic incentives for people  to  lie  and  that  there  is  a
    significant 'illegal' emigration network in the DRC, we  do  not  think
    that  Miss  Cuffe's  approach  to  her  interviewees  was  sufficiently
    rigorous. She  said  she  had  not  heard  of  anything  about  illegal
    emigration networks in the DRC, something which  E1  described  as  the
    central preoccupation of DGM questioning and which the  April  2006  EU
    report described as a significant aspect of the  problems  relating  to
    expellees of all kinds.  We do not seek to  criticise  her  unduly  for
    adopting a trusting approach and ignoring a key aspect of  the  problem
    she was investigating. Given the limited information she had to  go  on
    before she went to Kinshasa and the  remarkable number  of  individuals
    she managed to meet, talk to and in some cases record in a  very  short
    space of time, it could fairly be said that as a journalist she covered
    her subject as well as could be expected.  But  in  terms  of  reliable
    evidence, we find very little in her report which  assists.  The  cases
    she identified remain essentially unsubstantiated.

246.  We would also observe that, insofar as Mr Jacobs sought  her  help  in
    interpreting  what  she  thought  the  senior  ANR  official  meant  by
    returnees who said 'bad things' about the government being at risk, her
    answer at the hearing is difficult to reconcile with the  rest  of  her
    interview with him. If this man had considered that the  mere  fact  of
    being a failed asylum seeker meant they had said bad  things,  then  it
    does not make sense that he would have given the answer he did  as  set
    out in paragraph 21 of her statement ("I asked him how  he  would  know
    what had been said [by way of 'bad things'] about the DRC and  he  told
    me that the ANR had spies in lots of embassies around  the  world...").
    It may also have shown more balance to have at least  used  this  man's
    evidence in her programme, since  it  was  quite  specifically  to  the
    effect that ill treatment of failed asylum seekers had not happened  on
    his watch.

247.  That brings us to  the  caveat  we  noted  at  the  beginning  of  our
    assessment of her as a witness.  As much as we admire her  journalistic
    endeavour, we consider that the  concluding  words  of  her  BBC  World
    report exceeded the  boundaries  of  her  own  fact  finding.  Although
    mentioning in her statement that she  set out  to  try  and  get  "hard
    evidence" her concluding statement, that "we discovered that there  are
    failed asylum seekers in this city [who] were beaten and   locked  away
    in prison without trial  or  hiding  in  fear...",   went  well  beyond
    anything that she  was able to substantiate.  Having said she  set  out
    to get "hard evidence", she should  have  acknowledged  that  what  she
    obtained was not such.

248.  The limitation of her reports as evidence in a judicial  setting  were
    encapsulated for us in her statement that it is a great  shame  that  a
    more scientific study has not been done.

Miss Atherton's Evidence
249.  We found Miss Atherton a straightforward and sincere witness. She  did
    not seek to hide the fact that she was a campaigner  committed  to  the
    cause of halting removals to the DRC because of her own concerns  about
    the process and results based on  her  own  information  and  opinions.
    However, as she readily accepted,  she  had  largely  taken  people  on
    trust.  It is plain that she has taken very considerable trouble to try
    and obtain particulars about when individuals were  returned  and  what
    had happened to them during the removal process, on arrival at  N'Djili
    airport and afterwards.  However, for the most part she did not know or
    had simply assumed that all were failed asylum seekers. In the light of
    that knowledge we find it unhelpful  that  she  nowhere  addresses  the
    question of why she was prepared to  take  people's  stories  on  trust
    notwithstanding that their  asylum  claims  had  been  rejected.   Miss
    Giovannetti contends that given the indications in the background  that
    many DRC asylum seekers appear to have got to the UK with the  help  of
    illegal immigration networks and to have told untruths in  the  context
    of their asylum claims,  assessment  of  their  accounts  of  what  has
    happened to them on and since return cannot be  accepted  uncritically.
    We agree. We note that of the 14 cases Miss  Atherton  presented,  four
    have since returned to the UK -  an apt reminder (underlined by the VSV
    view expressed in its 2004 report that virtually  every  failed  asylum
    seeker wishes to try again) that on return failed asylum seekers do not
    necessarily cease to try returning and will  know  that,  in  order  to
    succeed in any claim for asylum made on re-entry,  they  will  have  to
    establish that they have been persecuted or suffered serious  harm  and
    ill-treatment in the DRC since  returning there.  Whilst we  take  into
    account the evidence they have related directly or indirectly  to  Miss
    Atherton and whilst we accept that there  is  a  degree  of  similarity
    between many of their narratives, we consider that ultimately  none  of
    these accounts of ill-treatment on return has been substantiated. As we
    shall return to below, many are second, third or fourth hand  accounts.
    Even those which are relatively detailed raise  as  many  questions  as
    they seek to answer.

DW's Evidence
250.  We did not hear from DW but we have no reason to  doubt  his  personal
    integrity. It remains that we find Mr DW's written evidence of  limited
    assistance insofar as determining the principal issue in this  case  is
    concerned.  it may be true that the cases of  DRC  asylum  seekers  are
    sometimes  handled  poorly  by  non-specialist  immigration  solicitors
    (although we think to use the  word 'invariably' suggest  a  desire  to
    overstate the real position). But, even assuming that  is  correct,  it
    does not necessarily  follow  that  they  are  prevented  thereby  from
    presenting their claim adequately to Home Office officials or that,  if
    refused, they are not afforded a proper opportunity  to  present  their
    case before an immigration judge. That DW says that he had arranged  in
    3 cases for persons he knows and trusts to attend  N'Djili  airport  to
    find what has happened to returnees, is  of  little  assistance  to  us
    without knowing who these people are and on what basis their word is to
    be accepted. In the one case in which there was any  kind  of  evidence
    apart from the returnees or his sources or friends and family - that of
    Case 16 - that evidence (from the British Embassy Kinshasa)  was  quite
    contrary to the individual's own claims about his family  in  the  DRC.
    We come back to the point, which we have emphasised when analysing Miss
    Atherton's evidence, that, so far as we know, all of the six  cases  he
    has presented are failed asylum seekers whose credibility may well have
    been rejected. Not even to address the issue  of  whether  or  in  what
    circumstances it is justifiable to regard them nonetheless as  credible
    in respect of a fresh claim  -  based  on  alleged  abuses  during  the
    airport return process - was a serious weakness in his approach.

E1's evidence
251.   For  reasons  already  mentioned,  the  Tribunal  did  not  have  the
      opportunity to hear E1's evidence in relation to the general issues in
      this case tested in oral evidence.  He is someone whose  past  reports
      on the DRC this Tribunal has accorded considerable weight, although it
      is fair  to  say  that  the  Tribunal  has  sometimes  made  important
      qualifications. One of the reasons why the Tribunal takes E1 seriously
      as a country expert is that for the most part he recognises  the  need
      for an approach of critical enquiry. He acknowledges  that  there  are
      special difficulties involved in researching the issues and that it is
      important not to take all that one is told at face-value. As  we  have
      seen, it is his finding that there  is  an  active  "illegal  emigrant
      network" operating in the  DRC  which  colludes  with  at  least  some
      N'Djili airport officials. Taken together with his  finding  that  the
      very poor economic and social  conditions  in  DRC  provide  a  strong
      incentive for people to emigrate to affluent  countries  for  economic
      reasons, it makes very good sense to us why he would find, as he  said
      his research did find, that "in many cases"  stories  told  by  asylum
      seekers were invented. It is a point which we have counted against the
      views expressed in certain other witness statements in this case, that
      they appeared to overlook these considerations and  to  take  most  of
      what they were told on trust.

252.  We also consider E1 to be generally  an  impartial  expert.    He  has
      shown in the past that his position on  the  issue  of  failed  asylum
      seekers can change over time. The emphasis he places on the importance
      of taking full account of  fluctuating  circumstances  reinforces  our
      confidence that he has no preconceived or fixed notions. We would also
      reiterate  the  point  made  by  previous  Tribunal  panels,  that  he
      possesses an impressive in-depth knowledge  of  the  DRC.  Perhaps  we
      should also mention that we take into account that  E1's  reports  for
      this case were prepared in response to time-limits.  Hence we  do  not
      count against them that certain parts of them merely regurgitate older
      analyses, and that some passages do not seem to follow  on  from  ones
      before.

253.  Having said that, we do have  a  number  of  concerns  about  the  two
      reports which he has prepared for this appeal. First, on the key issue
      with which we are concerned in this case -  the  treatment  of  failed
      asylum seekers at N'Djili airport - his reports are deeply equivocal.

254.  On the one hand he states on more than  one  occasion  that  returnees
      without valid travel documents are at risk  on  return  because  "they
      are  normally  transferred"  to  the  central  administration  of  the
      immigration service and in  this  way  "held  hostage"  by  virtue  of
      cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.  We  shall  call
      this "Position A".

255.  On the other hand he states on more than one occasion that an  airport
    official's  "normal course of action" will be to ask a returned  failed
    asylum seeker for a bribe in exchange  for  letting  him  go  and  that
    "everything can be settled  by  paying  money".   It  is  only  if  the
    returnee refuses to pay that "all kinds of pressure, including physical
    pressure" will be exerted. We shall call this "Position B".   Typifying
    this position is a passage where he  contrasts  failed  asylum  seekers
    with ordinary travellers.  He states that "[i]n many  cases,  they  are
    released against payment of a bribe;  when a risk factor  is  involved,
    they are detained for shorter or longer periods".

256.  Having examined these two reports very carefully,  we  are  unable  to
    find that this equivocation is  isolated  or  incidental;  although  he
    shows no express awareness of the  fact,  the  two  positions  co-exist
    throughout his report.

257.  This fundamental schism in his reports is clearly discernible  in  his
    treatment of the Jenny Cuffe BBC report, recent  UNHCR  documents,  the
    Home Office COI Report of February  2007 and the April 2006  EU  report
    on Illegal Migration. As we have seen,  UNHCR's  position  on  rejected
    asylum seekers has consistently been that they are not as such at risk.
     In his first report, in a passage  we  have  already  highlighted,  he
    states that UNHCR's  information  "confirms"  that  "returnees  without
    valid travel documents are at risk on  return"  because  they  will  be
    imprisoned.  In actual fact the  position  he  here  describes  as  his
    position (Position A), and UNHCR's position, are poles apart.

258.  The Cuffe report, as noted elsewhere,  concludes  that  failed  asylum
    seekers are at risk on return by virtue of  the  procedure  at  N'Djili
    airport or subsequently. Yet in his  second  report  E1  described  his
    report as "consistent" with hers insofar as:

         "There is indeed no  evidence  that  asylum  seekers  as  such  are
         persecuted. But they all have to pay a bribe for their release.  If
         they refuse to pay or are unable to pay they are detained as a  way
         of pressurising them."

259.  Once again, the position he takes here (Position B)  is  not  in  fact
    consistent with  Cuffe's report, whose concluding paragraph (as we  saw
    earlier) clearly implies that failed asylum seekers as such do face ill-
    treatment.

260.  When dealing with the Home Office  COIS  Report  he  states  that  its
    paragraph 36.03 is "consistent with the contents of this  report  ...";
    yet, as already noted, paragraph  36.03 states that there  is  no  real
    risk of failed asylum seekers being specifically targeted  for  adverse
    treatment. He goes on to leave uncriticised several other paragraphs of
    this report which repeat the same position  as  set  out  in  paragraph
    36.03.   Once again his position as described here (Position A) is  not
    consistent with paragraph 36.03.

261.  We find it surprising that  E1's second  report  should  only  address
    the April 2006 EU Report in a concluding section  commenting  on  other
    matters recently drawn to his attention as a result of this  case  (and
    then only indirectly by reference to a passage from  it  cited  in  the
    COIS Report). Leaving that to one side, however, despite that  report's
    clear conclusion that there  was  "no  reliable  evidence"  of   failed
    asylum seekers  being  specifically  targeted  for  harassment  by  the
    security services, the only point E1 takes issue with in this report is
    the suggestion that harassment is "as much or as  little"  as  ordinary
    travellers face.

262.  Miss Giovannetti sought to argue that E1's two reports for  this  case
    are inconsistent with the position  E1  took  before  the  Tribunal  in
    December  2005 when he said that he "had not heard  of  violence  being
    used at the airport during interrogations" (see AB  and  DM,  paragraph
    17). We do not think that is wholly correct.  As  we  have  just  seen,
    there are many passages in his reports for this case in which he adopts
    or says things consistent with Position B and his Position B is also in
    line with his 2005 position. According to Position B, physical violence
    is only resorted to if the returnee refuses to pay (or  cannot  pay)  a
    bribe but that, except when there is  a  risk  factor  specific  to  an
    individual, returnees can and  do  pay.  So  the  divergence  from  his
    earlier position only arises in those passages where he adopts Position
    A.

263.  Mr Jacobs at one point sought to argue, by cross  reference  to   E2's
    definition in her first report  (at p.19) of  "interrogation"   in  the
    DRC as always being accompanied by ill-treatment of  some  kind,   that
    any reference by E1 (or indeed anyone)  to "interrogation" at   N'Djili
    airport entails  an  acceptance  of  ill-treatment  in  the  course  of
    questioning. However, even in respect of E1's Position A, it  does  not
    seem to be his view that the interrogation carried out of failed asylum
    seekers at the airport amounts to any kind of ill-treatment.  We accept
    that some of his terminology can be read as meaning that in isolation -
    e.g. his reference to failed asylum seekers being "held  hostage".  The
    crux of his Position A is that, whilst being pressured to pay  a  bribe
    is harassment, it is only at the point arising if a person  refuses  to
    pay a bribe, or at the point when he  is  transferred  to  a  detention
    centre - or both - that this pressure takes a physical form or  becomes
    what he elsewhere refers to as "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment".

264.  The principal concern we have about E1's reports relates to  the  fact
    that insofar as he adopts Position  A,  he  appears  (contrary  to  his
    avowed objective of  pursuing  a  critical  inquiry)  to  base  himself
    heavily in uncritical fashion on  just  one  type  of  source.  Despite
    saying that he has drawn his reports' main conclusions on the basis  of
    a reference to several different types of sources  (his  second  report
    mentions four different types), it is evident that  when  it  comes  to
    what he says in passages enunciating his Position A about processes  at
    the airport, he relies heavily, if not  exclusively,  on  contacts  who
    have worked or are working there in the past two years. In one  respect
    it would seem very logical to seek information  (discreetly)  from  the
    organisation whose staff  are  said  to  include  perpetrators  of  ill
    treatment against returned failed  asylum  seekers,  especially  as  he
    elsewhere  highlights  the  difficulties  in  accepting  what   alleged
    "victims" of mistreatment by airport officials  have  to  say  at  face
    value.  But in another respect such heavy reliance is troubling,  since
    on his own account corruption on the part of DRC  officialdom  is  rife
    and there is a degree  of  collusion  between  some  airport  officials
    (including at a senior level) and illegal emigration networks. He  also
    mentioned that the inner circle of the Kabila regime has had  to  fight
    hard to maintain its  control  over  airport  personnel  and  over  the
    direction of airport affairs. He depicts the sacking of Yambua  as  the
    result  of  adverse  reaction  to  his  attempts  to   combat   airport
    corruption. He highlights too that there is administrative chaos at the
    airport and a number of services co-exist.  Although  they  collaborate
    over information relating to failed asylum seekers, they appear on  his
    account (as on E2's) to jealously guard their own roles.  We note  that
    neither  his 2006 nor his 2007 report takes into account  as  a  source
    the April 2006 EU HoM report and, when commenting on the summary  given
    of this report in the Home Office May 2007  COIS  Report,  E1  did  not
    express any major disagreement with the views expressed by the  EU  HoM
    in that report. Bearing in mind the above  factors,  we  find  it  very
    surprising that he nowhere appears to question any of  the  information
    he has received from his airport sources about ill treatment of  failed
    asylum seekers generally. In respect  of  them  his  normally  critical
    approach appears to have deserted him.

265.  Then there is the matter of E1's treatment of VSV and  ASADHO  in  the
    context of what they told UNHCR (as reported by UNHCR in their response
    paper  April  2006).   Miss  Giovannetti  sought  to   make   much   of
    shortcomings in E1's treatment of the VSV and ASADHO evidence.  If  her
    criticisms were intended to imply that both of  these  NGOs  should  be
    regarded as wholly objective and wholly  reliable,  we  would  consider
    they went too far. We simply do not have enough facts to reach  such  a
    categorical view and, in relation to ASADHO, we know that one  of  E1's
    sources reports that on at least two occasions a member of  ASADHO  has
    taken a bribe in return for  helping  supply  documentation:  see  E1's
    second report footnote 8. That information at least raises a  question-
    mark.  However, where we do agree  with  her  is  that  the  criticisms
    largely miss their mark. It is far from clear to us that when he  wrote
    either of his reports E1 had actually read VSV's 2004 report. One would
    certainly have expected any  researcher  professing  expertise  on  the
    topic of returned failed asylum seekers to have studied such  a  report
    carefully. But, leaving that difficulty to one side, we think it highly
    unlikely that the  VSV  2004  report's  reference  to  "police  special
    services" being charged with the detention of  returnees  was  anything
    other than a simple mistake.  As to the average size of the bribes,  E1
    himself (in common with  a  number  of  other  sources)  gives  varying
    amounts, so there is clearly a margin of  difference  involved  in  any
    estimates. The figures given by VSV still amounted to very  significant
    amounts as compared to the pay levels of airport officials.

266.  What about E1's criticism of UNHCR's  19  April  2006  statement  that
    "VSV has an office at the airport"?   It has to be  considered  in  the
    context of the other evidence, parts of which are in conflict.  On  the
    one hand we have items such as  E2's first report  in  which  she  says
    that a journalist asked to investigate was unable to confirm  that  VSV
    had an office at the airport and a post-hearing e-mail from  E2  saying
    she was told by a senior government official that there  is  definitely
    no such office). On the other hand, we  have   items  as  the   British
    Embassy confirmation that a VSV office does exist. In weighing up  this
    evidence we think it important to look first at what the 2004 VSV  says
    about this in its 2004 report. That report casts considerable light  on
    the  matter  because  it  shows  very  detailed  knowledge  of  airport
    topography (which is consistent with what we have from  other  sources)
    and because it makes clear that what VSV itself has laid  claim  to  is
    having had a presence at the airport in order to  undertake  monitoring
    and (such that someone from VSV attends there on a part-time basis:  on
    average three times a week in the course of his monitoring duties. This
    report also talks about concrete plans for an office to be opened soon,
    but not about such an office existing at the time of the report.

267.  So far as the situation since VSV wrote its report  is  concerned,  we
    are satisfied that there is no valid reason to conclude  that  VSV  has
    not secured some kind of office at the airport. Bearing in mind that we
    learn from E1 and E2 that some of  the  DRC  government's  negotiations
    with EU governments over returnees have been  treated  sensitively,  we
    would be surprised if arrangements made by it with a human  rights  NGO
    such as VSV regarding monitoring would have been made widely known even
    to most airport officials. Nevertheless we do not rule out that VSV may
    have exaggerated its monitoring role post-2004 in  some  quarters;  and
    its own concern (expressed to Jenny  Cuffe)  about  lack  of  resources
    tends to support the view that it has not  been  able  to  sustain  its
    monitoring activities in the way it envisaged. But even treating VSV in
    this way as having only a part-time monitoring function,  its  report's
    conclusions about what they found are in our  view  extremely  relevant
    evidence. Neither E1 nor E2 nor any of Mr Jacob's submissions persuades
    us otherwise.

268.  Insofar as E1 seeks to query VSV's motives and integrity, we  find  it
    very odd (i) that his first report refers to VSV as a "very active  and
    reputed human rights NGO" and (ii) that both of his reports are replete
    with references - in the main text  and  footnotes  -  relying  on  VSV
    reports/information for assessment of detention conditions in the  DRC.
     ASADHO materials are also heavily relied on. It is not in dispute that
    VSV and ASADHO are two of the four main human rights NGOs operating  in
    the  DRC  and  that  both  are   taken   seriously   by   international
    organisations as  well  as  by  a  number  of  embassies  in  Kinshasa.
    Furthermore, inasmuch as E1 ventures the opinion that VSV may have been
    tempted for financial reasons (to obtain funding)  to  portray  a  view
    about the treatment of failed asylum seekers close to that of  the  DRC
    government, that is very hard  to  square  with  E1's  own  recognition
    elsewhere that VSV has been an outspoken critic of the  government  and
    has continued to speak out in strong terms about a wide range of  human
    rights  abuses.   The  fact  that  E1  himself  chose  to  go  for  NGO
    information about failed asylum seekers only to VSV and ASADHO, out  of
    a very large number of NGOs active in Kinshasa, itself suggests that he
    must have been satisfied hitherto that they had relevant  evidence.  It
    is also difficult to see why VSV would  have  wished  to  have  avoided
    finding failed asylum seekers were at risk (if they were),  when  their
    funding source has consistently been a French charity. There is nothing
    at all to suggest that this charity is pro-Kabila. Or to  suggest  that
    VSV would have any political motives for avoiding such a finding if the
    evidence had warranted it. Regarding E1's suggestion that VSV  has  not
    done any serious compilation of data, it is difficult to understand why
    E1 thinks his sources should be in a position to decide this, since  he
    himself records that they were refused access  to  VSV  files  on  this
    topic (VSV told them it  considered  these  confidential  information).
    Whether or not E1's sources were aware of the   contents of VSV's  2004
    report (it would appear not and perhaps this is the same file to  which
    they were refused access), we have seen it and it clearly does contains
    a detailed documentation of data.  As made clear  in  our  analysis  of
    E2's evidence, we do not feel we have enough  information  to  be  sure
    that the VSV's investigation of the  cases listed in  its  2004  report
    was as thoroughgoing as portrayed, but, equally certainly,  we  see  no
    valid  reason  to  consider  it  was  manufactured.   The  VSV   report
    highlights the fact that the returnees it interviewed were very worried
    about talking to anyone about their  situation.  None  of  the  persons
    detailed in the VSV report who were visited by E2's organisation denied
    that they were failed asylum seekers. We have also been told that there
    is  great "fear and shame" felt by failed asylum seekers who face being
    mocked  by  neighbours  and  that  people  in  the  DRC  are  generally
    suspicious about inquiries made by strangers into their  histories.  We
    also know that VSV is well known to be  a  thorn  in  the  government's
    side. Bearing these matters in mind, it is not as such a  strong  point
    to raise against VSV's report that none of those approached by  E2  and
    her organisation (over 2 years after  the  event)  acknowledged  having
    been visited by VSV.

E2's Evidence
269.  We find it necessary to exercise a degree of caution  when  evaluating
    E2's reports.  We have no concerns about her personal integrity and  it
    is clear she has put a great deal of time and effort  into  seeking  to
    get to the truth about what happens to deportees refouled to  the  DRC.
    However, for someone put forward as an expert, her  language  is  often
    tendentious and, read in isolation, one can find a number  of  sweeping
    generalisations.  For example, she states early on in her  report  that
    "all deportees are taken to the DGM headquarters in the  city"  and  in
    another item of evidence she states that "Everyone  who  sought  asylum
    abroad" is "punish[ed]" hard".  Yet later on in her report she  herself
    points out that some deportees can pass through the airport unharmed on
    payment of a bribe by relatives.  Whereas in some places  her  position
    is that all deportees are punished, in others her position is that such
    punishment could (at least occasionally) be avoided if they have family
    members at the airport to receive them.  In  one  place  in  her  first
    report her position appears to be that any form  of  questioning  by  a
    government official anywhere in the DRC will be an interrogation having
    ill treatment as one of its components. The empirical  basis  for  this
    sweeping generalisation is not identified. Although describing  herself
    as someone who seeks to investigate and find facts, she appears much of
    the time to have her  mind  made  up  already.   Thus,  purely  on  the
    strength of contact with an individual from an NGO she has never  heard
    of before, regarding a person reported to her by a UK source as being a
    failed asylum seeker who had suffered ill-treatment on return (WY), she
    straightaway concludes (in  her  second  report)  that  WY's  case  was
    "typical of the manner in which the current regime treats Congolese who
    have been refouled from the UK".  Most worryingly, she appears  not  to
    have asked  any of the persons she  has  spoken  to  who  claim  to  be
    returnees suffering ill-treatment a number of important basic questions
    such as whether  they  were  ordinary  deportees  (e.g.  with  criminal
    records) as distinct from failed asylum seekers and whether, if  failed
    asylum seekers, they had been found credible  by  European  authorities
    dealing with their asylum claims  and  whether  they  could  help  with
    reference numbers and permission to call for their asylum  files.  More
    generally there is little anywhere to suggest that she  has  applied  a
    critical scrutiny to the accounts she has been given (by way of example
    see our analysis below of her treatment of WY's case).

270.  We find her main criticisms of VSV and UNHCR somewhat  unsatisfactory.
     To say that UNHCR is not actively involved with the issue of  rejected
    DRC asylum seekers is unfair, since it is apparent that since the  mid-
    1990s UNHCR has regularly issued specific  position  papers/letters  on
    the return of failed asylum  seekers  to  the  DRC  and  in  them  made
    reference to specific local inquiries having been  made  on  this  very
    issue.  To state that "UNHCR exists for refugees and not for the safety
    of rejected asylum seekers" shows  serious  ignorance  of  UNHCR's  own
    policy and practice. So far as sources are concerned, it is clear  that
    her underlying criticism is not that UNHCR is vague about them but that
    it was at fault not to have consulted with certain other  human  rights
    NGOs apart from VSV and ASADHO.  Given, however, that it is clearly her
    own view that it  is  futile  consulting  organisations  that  are  not
    actively involved in this issue, it  is  not  obvious  why  such  wider
    consultation would have helped. We deal below with our doubts as to the
    depth of OCDH's and CODHO's experience of this issue. In any event, the
    evidence before us indicates that  both VSV and  ASADHO  interact  with
    the other main human rights NGOs:  indeed her  own  (first)  report  at
    footnote 40 comments that ASADHO together with  the   OCDH  and  Female
    Action Network (RAF) provided a joint report for  the  UN  Anti-Torture
    Commission held on 7-25 November 2005.

271.  We also  find  it  odd  that  E2  should  rebuke  UNHCR  for  lack  of
    information  and  consultation,  when  it  is  clear  her  own  reports
    sometimes do the same. Neither her first report of March 2007  nor  her
    second report of September 2007 nor her subsequent updating by  way  of
    letters and e-mails make any mention  of  the  April  2006  EU  report,
    despite the fact that much of it deals with the very topic her  reports
    seek to investigate. We remind ourselves here that it  is  one  of  the
    basic duties of an expert that he or she makes known  opinions  to  the
    contrary (see AIT Practice Direction 8A.5).

272.  Given the depth of experience E2  says  she  has  in  producing  fact-
    finding reports on individual asylum cases, we find it curious that she
    was not able to refer us to any court or tribunal approval  of  any  of
    her reports (even if she had, we  would  have  expected  her  to  state
    whether there were cases in which her evidence was not approved as well
    as cases in which it was). The only reference to her  by  the  Tribunal
    which she notes is VL, which in fact was clearly  sceptical  about  the
    case particulars provided by her organisation on that occasion.

273.  In general terms E2's reports are too ready  to  draw  inferences  and
    conclusions from individual  case  examples,  often  overlooking  quite
    basic difficulties with them.  For  example,  she  makes  much  of  the
    criticism  of  Belgian  government  claims  about  past  monitoring  of
    deportees. Yet the only example relating to the DRC which she  mentions
    concerns the case of Tabita, a five year old  Congolese  girl  said  to
    have been deported to Kinshasa on 18 October 2002 all on her own. We do
    not have enough information to assess whether that it is  correct,  but
    even assuming that it is and that she was not just returned on her  own
    but without there being adequate reception arrangements made  for  her,
    then it would indeed be a flagrant breach  of  international  standards
    relating  to  the  need  for  adequate   reception   arrangements   for
    unaccompanied minors: see e.g. Nsona v Netherlands (2001) 32 EHRR  170.
     But this example scarcely proves anything  about  the  deportation  of
    adults or of families with an adult.

274.  We underline  our  concern  that  E2's  reports  nowhere  address  the
    question of to what extent the deportees her  organisation  interviewed
    or heard about could be considered  credible  given  their  history  as
    failed asylum seekers. Of course, someone who is a failed asylum seeker
    may  not   necessarily  have  been  disbelieved  about  everything   or
    anything, but, in general terms,  if a person is a failed asylum seeker
    there is absolutely no reason (absent  evidence  to  the  contrary)  to
    assume that they have been found credible in the course of their asylum
    claim. Hence any approach to evidence from a failed asylum seeker which
    treats it as truthful simply on trust is exceedingly problematic.    E2
    was asked about this in cross-examination and said that she and/or  her
    organisation  brought  their  considerable  experience  to  bear   when
    assessing what she/they were doing.   We are bound to say we  see  very
    little evidence of any real scrutiny. On  her  own  account,  the  main
    priority of her and her organisation when contacting such people is  to
    win their trust.  That is entirely understandable, but, in the  absence
    of an indication in E2's reports of the issue of an  individual's  past
    credibility or lack of it being addressed, even with those  individuals
    she and her organisation were able to interview thoroughly, this  is  a
    serious flaw in her methodology. This is not to say that  she  has  not
    shown real diligence in some respects,  for  example  in  writing  down
    telephone  interviews  and  in  video-recording  some  interviews.   In
    Appendix B of her first report she refers to  being  able  in  February
    2006 to interview a number of people in a "special  setting"  in  which
    statements were taken in their presence of  two  persons  and  a  local
    group attempting to "provide help  to  people  forced  to  return  from
    Europe and unable to survive". But unfortunately  she  does  not  match
    these measures with other basic empirical steps and, as  a  result,  we
    are left with a body of evidence with very little substance.

275.  Despite the claim in her reports that she has maintained an  objective
    approach to the evidence, we consider that quite frequently she appears
    to rely on bare assertions. For example in  Appendix  B  of  her  first
    report,  when  describing  the  approach  her  organisation  took  when
    interviewing deportees she writes:

         "Our approach was as follows: we wanted to listen to people who had
         themselves been expelled. To do  this  we  had  to  overcome  their
         mistrust of us, as up to this point, they had  been  only  bullied,
         first in Europe, then  again during the  journey  and  finally  yet
         again in the Congo."

276.   Whilst  she  does  refer  in  her  reports  to  some  complaints   of
      mistreatment by officers in different  European  cities  of  deportees
      during the removal process, she nowhere analyses these as  to  whether
      they are objectively established. Yet from the above it is clear that,
      to her mind, "bullying" by officials of EU governments is the norm.

277.  Insofar as E2 relies  in  her  reports  on  sources  who  are  persons
      working at the airport or with contacts who work at  the  airport,  we
      have  the  same  difficulty  as  we  identified  when  analysing  E1's
      evidence. We are  not  persuaded  that  she  has  applied  a  critical
      assessment to all that they have told her  or  her  organisation;  she
      does not appear to have considered whether, or to what  extent,  their
      evidence could be coloured  by  involvement  with  illegal  emigration
      networks.

278.  In summary we are not persuaded by  E2's reports and updating  letters
      and  e-mails  that  her  main  conclusion  -  that  deportees  face  a
      consistent pattern of ill-treatment or serious harm at  the  hands  of
      DRC authorities either when they return to the airport or at  a  later
      date - is justified.

Overview
279.  In order to assist our task of deciding the issue  of  whether  failed
    asylum seekers are at risk on return  to  the  DRC,  we  ask  the  same
    question as the Tribunal posed in VL: what  sources  amongst  the  many
    placed before us can we attach most weight to  and  why?   We  consider
    that the following sources merit very considerable weight being  placed
    upon them.

DRC: EU Report on Illegal Migration, 12 April 2006
280.  This report was written by the EU Heads of Mission  (EU  HoM)  in  the
    DRC and was made public on 12 April 2006. We earlier  referred  to  the
    summary given of it in the COIS Report for November  2007.  However,  a
    full copy of the report was furnished to us  by  the  respondent.   Its
    Executive Summary states:

            "The principal  reasons  for  migrating  from  the  DRC  remain
            economic.  The  shattered  economy  and  lack   of   employment
            opportunities mean that there are large  numbers  of  Congolese
            who wish to seek a better life  in  Europe.   Whilst  cases  of
            genuine asylum do exist on occasions, for the most part this is
            used as a cover for economic migration.


            Some  resort  to  increasingly  sophisticated   and   desperate
            measures to enter the EU in order to  claim  asylum,  including
            forgery, using  clandestine  migration  networks  and  overland
            travel  to  North  Africa   and   attempting   to   cross   the
            Mediterranean.


            The Congolese authorities are not able to rein in this problem,
            and in some cases individual migration officials are complicit.
            High level contacts  do  show  though  those  senior  Congolese
            politicians are aware of the issue's importance to EU states.


            Voluntary repatriation is not widely taken up by failed  asylum
            seekers.   Current  methods  of   forcible   repatriation   are
            unsatisfactory.


            Charter flights of failed asylum seekers back to the  DRC  have
            not taken place since 2003 [NB. This  was  written  before  the
            UK's February 2007 charter flight].   The DRC authorities  have
            resisted attempts by member states  to  restart  them.  However
            many  member  states  have  signed  or  are   hoping  to   sign
            agreements to allow charter flights  and  guarantee  a  minimum
            level of  service  from  Congolese  embassies  and  immigration
            directorates. Some who have signed  agreements  have  not  been
            satisfied with their results.


            There is no reliable evidence of failed  asylum  seekers  being
            specifically targeted for harassment by the security  services.
            Some returnees have been harassed, this is seen as  part  of  a
            trend of opportunist crime against random civilians  by  unpaid
            or underpaid  officials.   Harassment  at  N'Djili  airport  is
            experienced by a majority of  travellers,  both  Congolese  and
            foreign.


            Some claims of abuse have been manufactured by  so-called  NGOs
            linked to clandestine migration networks and then picked up  by
            more reputable NGOs."


281.  From the body of the report it is  clear  that  EU  HoM  were  closely
    aware of allegations made about the treatment of failed asylum  seekers
    and had done something about investigating them. At section 5 they note
    that some European media, as well as some Congolese NGOs, have recently
    reported failed asylum seekers to the DRC experiencing ill-treatment on
    arrival.  The report states:

           "EU  embassies  present  in  Kinshasa  have  investigated  those
           allegations and  have  found  no  objective  evidence  of  those
           returning to the  DRC  being  specifically  targeted  for  abuse
           simply because  they  sought  asylum.   In  investigating  these
           allegations, members of EU embassies  spoke  to  lawyers,  human
           rights activists and members of  the  local  press  as  well  as
           members of the  political  parties  represented  in  government.
           They also  paid  visits  to  detention  facilities  and  N'Djili
           airport.


           Allegations of arbitrary detention were found to be  false,  and
           in some cases, the  NGOs  that  made  the  allegations  of  ill-
           treatment and detention had links to the  Ngulu ("pig") networks
           that facilitate illegal immigration."

282.  What is clear from this report is that,  in  response  to  allegations
    conveyed to them, EU HoM took  active  steps  to  investigate,  in  the
    course of which they consulted widely.   We  observe  that  this  is  a
    document signed by all EU HoM in Kinshasa, each of whom can  safely  be
    inferred to have their own local services and contacts on  the  ground.
    The report is also self-critical, e.g. the Executive  Summary  and  the
    report's section 4 notes problems with the current strategies governing
    charter flight returns and enforced individual returns and at section 6
    it makes a number of recommendations, including that EU HoM:

           "continue to monitor the  conditions  experienced  by  returning
           failed  asylum  seekers  through  airport  and  prison   visits,
           contacts  with  NGOs  and   sharing   information   with   local
           embassies."

283.  The contents of this report also  confirm  what  we  know  from  other
    sources  about  specific  steps  taken  by  certain  EU  Member   State
    governments to investigate allegations of ill-treatment on return.

UNHCR Position Statements
284.  In previous country guidance cases on the DRC  the  Tribunal  has  set
    considerable store by UNHCR position papers, in view of the  fact  that
    they have been sourced directly from the field office in  the  DRC  and
    cleared by UNHCR Headquarters in Geneva  (see  e.g.  VL  paras  53-54).
    Turning to the most recent UNHCR position as expressed in the 19  April
    2006 "Response  to  Information  Request",  we  think  it  particularly
    significant that this was written in specific  response  to  the  Jenny
    Cuffe BBC report.  This response states:

           "... after the press coverage in the UK late November 2005 about
           the reported problems faced by failed asylum  seekers  who  were
           forcibly returned to the  DRC,  the  UNHCR  Office  in  Kinshasa
           contacted various organisations and institutions in  an  attempt
           to gather more information.  This included organisations such as
           the  Congolese  Immigration  authorities  (DGM),  the   National
           Committee for Refugees (CNR),  IUM,  MONUC  and  national  human
           rights NGOs.  In addition, it sent staff to the airport on  days
           of arrivals of flights from Europe"

    (see also UNHCR comments to the Advisory Panel on County Information on
    16 October 2005 Home Office  Country  Report  for  DRC,  8  March  2006
    www.apci.org.uk).

285.  The response went on to state that  UNHCR  was  not  aware  of  failed
    asylum seekers being detained or tortured at the airport.

286.  Criticism has been levelled at other passages in this  response  which
    refer, inter alia, to VSV having an office at the airport  and  closely
    monitoring the situation and which  also  place  reliance  on  ASADHO's
    assessment.  We have explained above why we think these criticisms  are
    largely misplaced, but, even if we leave to one  side  this  response's
    reliance on VSV and ASADHO sources, it makes clear that UNHCR has  also
    consulted other sources as well and at certain times has actually  sent
    UNHCR staff to the airport on days of arrival of flights  from  Europe.
    The response is careful not to exaggerate its findings - it  emphasises
    that arrivals at the airport are "difficult to monitor  and  the  UNHCR
    does not have a regular presence at the airport" and  it  is  quick  to
    qualify its specific conclusions with the  words  "[f]rom  the  limited
    information available to the UNHCR ...". In  view  of  the  very  close
    attention UNHCR has given to the  issue  of  the  treatment  of  failed
    asylum seekers in the DRC over a number of years, and the active way in
    which it sought to have checks made once it learnt of the  adverse  BBC
    report, we think that it is a weighty source.  We also remind ourselves
    that the UNHCR is heavily involved in assisting the  voluntary  returns
    of former refugees  from  the  DRC  (from  such  countries  as  Zambia,
    Tanzania, Burundi, Angola and Sudan) back to their home villages to all
    parts of the DRC since the end of the war in 2003.   We  are  confident
    that when UNHCR has any concerns about the way any category of  asylum-
    related returnees is being  received, it makes this known.

Individual Embassy and   EU Government Assessments
287.  We have already highlighted the EU HoM  report  of  April  2006  which
    clearly represents a unanimous view.  We have from this  report  or  in
    separate  form  evidence  of  some  individual  Embassy   or   national
    government assessments.


288.  The EU Report at section 4B refers to the Dutch position:

           "Following investigation, the updated 'Ambtsericht'  (the  Dutch
           MFA's, general country information on the DRC) of September 2005
           confirmed that, according to independent and  reliable  sources,
           returned Congolese asylum seekers from Europe, whose request for
           asylum was rejected and whose judicial appeals  were  exhausted,
           have encountered  no  problem  with  the  DGM  upon  arrival  in
           Kinshasa."

289.  The British Embassy letter of 28 July 2007  confirms  that  the  Dutch
    government position remains to similar effect.

290.  The EU Report refers to  the  work  of  the  French  "Airport  Liaison
    Officer" at N'Djili airport who meets flights carrying  returnees  from
    Schengen countries to  ensure  returnees  hold  a  satisfactory  travel
    document.

291.  We have a  great  deal  of  evidence  about  the  British  Embassy  in
    Kinshasa's activities in relation  to  the  issue  of  returned  failed
    asylum seekers.  Given that Mr Jacobs has made a number  of  criticisms
    concerning the handling  of  matters  relating  to  this  case  by  one
    particular Embassy official (who we shall refer to  as  Mr  X),  it  is
    noteworthy that Embassy correspondence (which includes the TSol  letter
    of 14 September 2007) on the issue of failed asylum seekers includes  a
    letter from the former Ambassador  as  well  as  from  another  current
    Embassy  official  and  there  is   nothing   to   suggest   that   the
    correspondence we have does not represent the view  of  the  FCO.   The
    contents of the  former  British  Ambassador's  letters  written  on  6
    February 2006 are summarised at 36.03 of the July 2007 COIR  Report  on
    the DRC.  We also  had  more  recent  correspondence  before  us,  some
    passages to which we have already made reference.  This  correspondence
    confirms, inter alia, that the Embassy has taken an active interest  in
    the issue of the treatment of failed asylum seekers.  Prior to 4  April
    2007 the only allegations it had received of abuses of returned  failed
    asylum seekers were the Jenny  Cuffe  BBC  report,  an  e-mail  from  a
    political party of expatriate Congolese and two  cases  raised  by  MPs
    (the allegation in respect of one of these was described by the Embassy
    as an obvious fabrication).  Subsequent to 4 April 2007 the Embassy had
    received other allegations.  They were mostly connected to the February
    2007 charter flight, although one related to 2005.   These  allegations
    were said  to  "have  not  been  substantiated  by  the  investigations
    conducted by the Embassy".  The correspondence also includes an  e-mail
    dated 28 February 2007 giving details  of  the  charter  flight  of  27
    February 2006.  Its conclusion was that there were no obvious abuses of
    human rights, but that the Embassy would continue to "keep our ears  to
    the ground" for any allegations that members of the returned group have
    suffered abuse since their return.

292.  This last comment typifies,  in  our  view,  another  feature  of  the
    Embassy's approach, namely that the  Embassy  maintains  a  significant
    range of contacts in Kinshasa in a position to  comment  relevantly  on
    issues  relating  to  returned   failed   asylum   seekers,   including
    individuals within other Embassies and local NGOs.  It  is  also  in  a
    position to raise matters of concern with the DRC authorities  involved
    in the airport return process at a high level.

VSV and ASADHO Evidence
293.  The Tribunal's view is that considerable weight should attach  to  the
    factual information given by the VSV as well as to the general VSV  and
    ASADHO assessments of the treatment of failed returned  asylum  seekers
    as conveyed to the UNHCR.   Whether  or  not  both  organisations  have
    sometimes exaggerated or (in the case  of  ASADHO)  sometimes  provided
    documents for money, there is almost unanimous  consensus  between  the
    British  Embassy  evidence,  the  evidence  of  E1  and  E2  and  other
    background sources that these are two  of  the  four  main  active  and
    committed human rights NGOs in the DRC.  Their work in  exposing  human
    rights abuses committed by the DRC authorities in detention  facilities
    has been commended at UN level and we note that E1 draws heavily on  it
    for is own assessment of human rights abuses in the DRC.  It  is  well-
    documented that the VSV leader has faced arrest and  detention  at  the
    hands of the DRC authorities on several occasions, yet has  carried  on
    his exposure of government shortcomings.  We see no basis  for  E1  and
    E2's speculation that VSV may have ulterior motives for taking what  it
    considers to be a similar view to the DRC government on  the  issue  of
    failed returned asylum seekers.  We have some criticisms  of  the  2004
    report on the treatment of expellees, but think it most  unlikely  that
    it was fabricated.

294.  As already indicated, however, we are prepared to  accept  that  VSV's
    monitoring activities are not as full or as continuous as may sometimes
    have been suggested or thought: to that extent  the  UNHCR   Response's
    reference to VSV "closely monitoring" the situation may  be  incorrect.
    However,  we  do  not  find  that  the  absence  of   any   independent
    corroboration of the existence of a VSV office at N'Djili Airport  -and
    the categorical claim  to  the  contrary  by  one  of  E2's  sources  -
    establishes that there has  not  been  such  an  office.   The  British
    Embassy information given in the 28 July 2007 letter on  this  is  very
    specific:

           "VSV say they are paying a rent of $96 pcm to the RVA (Congolese
           airport authority) to maintain a small office on the first floor
           of the airport building above the check-in area  (known  as  "la
           rotunde").  They also have an access pass given by  the  RVA  to
           enable them to carry out the monitoring more effectively."


295.  This information also accords with what VSV itself says  in  its  June
    2004 report. From the 2004 report it is clear that this office had  yet
    to open in June 2004 and it would appear from what the organisation has
    said more recently that it is not manned or used all the time.   It  is
    very likely, we think, that what the VSV representative interviewed  in
    2005 by Jenny Cuffe said was  correct,  that  its  ability  to  monitor
    returnees at the airport was hampered by  "a  lack  of  resources".  It
    would appear that not all its projects have gone ahead  year  on  year.
    Yet there has been nothing said to suggest that VSV  advertises  itself
    to travellers, although there  is  reference  in  its  2004  report  to
    reception of expellees and it is clear the NGO wanted to  have  a  more
    visible role at the airport.  We do not know anything about  the  local
    investigative journalist said by E2 to have found no evidence  of  such
    an office, but without more knowledge of who  this  journalist  is  and
    what inquiries he or she made and of whom, we are  not  persuaded  that
    this investigation should be treated as at all  conclusive,  especially
    given that the  UNHCR  and  British  Embassy  sources  appear  to  have
    discussed the matter with other local  sources.   We  acknowledge  that
    E2's latest e-mail of 26 September 2007 raises further doubts based  on
    what a high-level source working in a different  government  department
    says he was told by the commander of the RVA,  but  for  reasons  given
    earlier we have reservations about the reliability of her sources.

296.  In the same letter of 28 July the  British  Embassy  official  reports
    speaking to VSV about the 26 February 2007 charter flight.  He writes:

           "... they gave an account of the return process which matched my
           own recollections,  so  personally  I  believe  that  they  were
           monitoring on that particular day ..."


297.  We note that the Embassy official making  this  assessment  showed  in
    the same letter that he took into account VSV's:

           "tendency to exaggerate some abuses for maximum  impact  in  its
           initial declarations before being able to  verify  whether  they
           are true or not.  This has led to some climb-downs on their part
           in the past.  All respondents also noted that VSV  automatically
           take a de facto position of opposition  against  the  government
           despite its stated independence."

298.  Such an assessment does not suggest that the Embassy has relied on  an
    uncritical assessment of VSV work; yet it has still been satisfied that
    VSV is doing some real monitoring of failed asylum seekers.

299.  As regards E1's tentative suggestion that  VSV  might  be  hiding  the
    truth about the treatment of failed asylum seekers in  order  to  "make
    their opinions all the more credible in case they  defend  a  political
    asylum seeker themselves", we find this difficult to  square  with  the
    fact that we could find only two references to the VSV  taking  up  the
    case of a failed asylum seeker (that mentioned by Jenny Cuffe in her 18
    May 2007 statement and that referred to by E2 in  the  form  of  a  VSV
    press release about a JN).  The British Embassy official in his 28 July
    2007 letter states that VSV had told him in meetings he  had  had  with
    them that they:

           "occasionally receive threats and criticisms from other NGOs and
           people connected to clandestine migration, because  VSV  refuses
           to help asylum claims by writing human rights appeals on  behalf
           of paying individuals."

300.  We remind ourselves here of the evidence  from  a  number  of  sources
    that there are very large numbers of NGOs, official and unofficial,  in
    the DRC and that getting anything done by any of them  requires  money.
    The EU governments and international bodies with a presence in Kinshasa
    have clearly made a judgment that  not  all  of  them  are  bona  fide.
    Additionally the 2006 EU Report states:

           "Allegations of arbitrary detention [of failed  returned  asylum
           seekers] were found to be false, and in some cases the NGOs that
           made the allegation of ill-treatment and detention had links  to
           the Ngulu networks that facilitate illegal immigration."

301.  In our view the above indicates that there are good  reasons  why  the
    British  Embassy  (in  common  with  other   foreign   government   and
    international  organisations)  in  Kinshasa  prefers  to  limit   their
    dealings to NGOs with a proven reputation. Below we set out our reasons
    for considering that an NGO heavily relied upon by E2 appears  to  have
    made a blatantly false statement in a letter of complaint addressed  to
    Kin Maziere about the case of WY.   In  cross-examination  E2  admitted
    that she had not heard of this NGO previously and  with  hindsight  the
    way it explained why it  was  only  helping  one  person  from  the  27
    February 2007 charter flight was  odd.   In  our  view  E2's  readiness
    nevertheless to rely on such an NGO's evidence demonstrates the need to
    attach  weight  primarily  to  NGOs  that  EU  HoM  and   international
    organisations  have  found  to  be  active,  effective  and   generally
    reliable.

302.  The suggestions made by Miss Cuffe and E2 that VSV is  only  concerned
    with Rwandan failed asylum seekers are far too tenuous.

303.  It remains important to pay close attention to what VSV actually  says
    in its 2004 report. It does not specifically deal  with  failed  asylum
    seekers, although  it  would  appear  from  its  5  "illustrative  case
    studies" of "expellees" that the "irregular residence" of many of  them
    in a Western country has been accompanied by an unsuccessful claim  for
    asylum. It deals  with  enforced  returns  of  all  kinds.  So  far  as
    methodology is concerned, its recording of individual cases shows  that
    clear  particulars  were  sought  of   identity,   address,   date   of
    repatriation, the country from which the person is arriving and  flight
    details and they are also asked the reason for their expulsion. It goes
    on to give specific details of the 70 odd cases. That reflects  a  much
    more empirical approach than we have  seen  taken  by  CDHH,  OCDH  and
    CODHO. It is also clear from the report that some care is taken to gain
    the confidence of expellees so as to furnish  VSV  with  details.  From
    what is said the monitoring process VSV described extends to  follow-up
    visits.

304.  However, there are discernible shortcomings in the report. The  report
    is somewhat tendentious in clearly wanting to urge  particular  reforms
    on the part of Western governments to their procedures for dealing with
    involuntary returnees. It appears to argue  from  a  set  view  -  that
    forced repatriations by Western countries are oppressive. Obviously VSV
    is entitled to its own value judgments, but it  weakens  its  claim  to
    provide an objective account.  It is not a criticism  of  VSV  that  it
    does not distinguish between failed asylum seekers and other  types  of
    expellees, since it did not set out to do so. But its failure to do  so
    reduces to some degree its value to us as evidence. In the same way  as
    we have noticed with the reports from UK NGOs, there is  no  indication
    that when assessing the evidence given by the expellees interviewed who
    were failed asylum seekers (and the proportion the latter comprised  is
    left unclear), VSV has examined whether they are failed asylum  seekers
    found not credible in respect of their asylum claims and  whether  that
    has implications for  the  credibility  of  their  claimed  experiences
    during the airport return process. It is not  made  sufficiently  clear
    how many of the expellees listed faced demands to   pay  a  bribe:  the
    report describes this as frequent, but of the 5 case examples given  in
    any detail, only one makes that allegation.  The statement that it  has
    recorded "around 50 cases of expulsion" is difficult to square with the
    attached schedule which gives basic details of around 70 expulsions. It
    does not specify anywhere that follow-up visits are made in every case.
    There are also the points noted by E1 and E2,  that  there  is  an  odd
    reference to "the police special services office, which has a branch at
    N'Djili airport" and there are 4 or 5 cases of double-counting.

305.  To a degree we think that in respect of some of these shortcomings  we
    can  make  allowances  for  them:  the  reference  to  "police  special
    services" appears likely to be inadvertent; whether  or  not  different
    figures of expulsion cases recorded are given, the  report  contains  a
    precise list of cases. We also  know  the  specific  conclusions  which
    UNHCR drew from information provided by VSV regarding risk to  rejected
    failed asylum seekers. And, in respect of  the  February  2007  charter
    flight, we also know what VSV said to British  Embassy  official  Mr  X
    about this flight.

306.  Miss Giovanettti has  submitted  that  the  contents  of  this  report
    support her case. Mr Jacobs, by contrast, has consistently seen  it  as
    inimical to his central contention that failed returned asylum  seekers
    to the DRC receive ill-treatment.  In  point  of  fact  the  report  is
    somewhat more nuanced than either party has mentioned. As already noted
    it  does  at  one  point  contend  that  expellees  suffer   "degrading
    treatment" as "subjects  without  rights"  who  have  no  sure  way  of
    recovering their assets and other personal belongings  that  have  been
    "wrongly taken". (It is hard to say whether the latter is  a  reference
    to what happens on return - the lack of any reference to this happening
    except in one of the 5  illustrative  case  studies  suggests  not;  or
    whether it refers to the fact, emphasised elsewhere, that expellees are
    often said to be  picked  up  in  the  expelling  country  for  removal
    "without having the opportunity to return  to  their  home  to  collect
    their  belongings").  At  another  point  it  refers  to   the   forced
    repatriation of expellees as "a form of persecution".

307.  However, so far as its own recording of what  happened  in  around  70
    cases is concerned, the only clear mention of any difficulties is  when
    it refers to there being "frequent reports of extortion of  assets  and
    personal belongings by officers who  think  the  expellees  are  hiding
    money on them when they are repatriated". We also know that when  UNHCR
    asked them as to their view, either they summarised it  as  being  that
    rejected failed asylum seekers do not face ill treatment on  return  or
    UNHCR, applying legal criteria, considered that this is what the  facts
    of their report and other investigations showed.

308.  It is  difficult  to  follow  what  the  report  means  to  say  about
    "persecution"  of  returned  expellees,   since   in   one   place   it
    categorically says they are not persecuted, yet in another it says that
    they are. In any event, the references the report makes  to  "degrading
    treatment" and to "persecution" are plainly made in the context of  the
    particularly dim view this organisation  has  of  forced  repatriations
    from Western countries in general. VSV may well have been justified  on
    the evidence it had in describing the plight of expellees  as  a  sorry
    one, but what they describe  as  "persecution"  -  "being  "obliged  to
    return empty-handed, something which is seen as a serious  failure  not
    only by the individuals concerned but by their home communities"  -  is
    clearly not sufficient to amount to persecution for Refugee  Convention
    purposes (or serious harm for humanitarian protection purposes  or  ill
    treatment for Article 3 purposes). Insofar as  the  report  appears  to
    refer to expellees having no sure way of recovering  their  assets  and
    other personal belongings in the countries expelling them and  to  them
    "not having the opportunity to return to their  pre-departure  home  to
    collect their belongings",  however,  the  empirical  basis  for  these
    generalisations is significantly lacking.

309.  Overall, we think that even though VSV's report is  somewhat  partisan
    in its approach to  its  subject-matter,  and  its  methodology  leaves
    something to be desired, it does contain a very significant  amount  of
    basic factual information concerning its monitoring over the  period  1
    January 2003 - 15 April 2004. Very significantly, it records around  70
    cases of returnees without making  any  mention  of  physical  violence
    being used and the only specific misconduct it  notes  relates  to  the
    demanding of money and the taking of possessions. Taken  together  with
    other pieces of evidence, e.g.  the  UNHCR  Response  and  the  British
    Embassy correspondence, it is also apparent that VSV has  continued  to
    play some kind of monitoring role, including in respect of the February
    2007 charter flight. Despite its own view that the problems  of  forced
    repatriation can amount  to  persecution  or  ill  treatment,  what  it
    describes  is  not  something  which  meets  the  legal  criteria   for
    persecution, serious harm or ill treatment.

310.  We would emphasise that  E2 and others may well be  correct  to  point
    out  that  there  are  deficiencies  in  the  current  procedures   for
    monitoring of returned failed asylum seekers at the N'Djili airport and
    afterwards. However, we do not agree with E2 that there is not even any
    "incidental" (as opposed to systematic) monitoring. We have  seen  that
    monitoring has been done periodically by VSV, UNHCR and officials  from
    various Embassies. And the fact that such incidental monitoring has not
    discovered any ill treatment remains a highly significant  fact,  since
    what is being contended for by Mr Jacobs (and some of his witnesses) in
    this case is that at the airport and thereafter there is a  "consistent
    pattern" of abuse in the form of physical mistreatment. In our view the
    available evidence points strongly to a conclusion  that  there  is  no
    such pattern.

311.  It is time to say that we did have evidence from two other NGOs  whose
    reputation and integrity appears to be  as  well-regarded  as  VSV  and
    ASADHO.  In particular, reference was made by Jenny Cuffe to  the  head
    of the Observatoire Congolaise de Droits l'Homme.  We were also told by
    E2 that CODHO was another NGO with  a  sound  reputation  and  relevant
    evidence.  However, for reasons we shall come to we have serious doubts
    that these two NGOs had the experience they claimed about the cases  of
    failed asylum seekers who have suffered ill treatment. In our view  the
    cases mentioned by these two organisations (some of which on inspection
    were not about returned failed asylum seekers in any event) amounted at
    best to unsubstantiated stories: CODHO's head was  essentially  reliant
    on the credibility of the accounts given to him.  E2 stressed that  she
    believed that this NGO head would have taken care  to  satisfy  himself
    that the cases he referred to had substance, but if that  were  so,  we
    would have expected that we would have  been  able  to  supply  greater
    particulars and some corroborative evidence.  We also noted that  every
    case raised by the OCDH official he had first learnt about from E2, not
    from his own "long" (indigenous) experience.

Evidence of E1 (Position B)
312.  At first sight it may  seem  odd  to  include  E1's  evidence  in  the
    section detailing the sources to which we attach  considerable  weight,
    since we have earlier said that his reports are deeply equivocal and we
    have noted our disagreement with some parts of E1's assessment  in  his
    two reports (the parts  taking  Position  A).   However,  as  explained
    earlier, this reflects  the  fact  that  although  E1's  assessment  is
    equivocal, it is only in respect of his Position A that  his  reasoning
    and sourcing appears fallible and the  preponderance  of  his  evidence
    otherwise is that it is only failed  asylum  seekers  who  (because  of
    specific risk factors such as a criminal history)  are  transferred  to
    detention facilities  elsewhere  who  are  at  risk  of  ill-treatment.
    Consistent with his earlier  reports  on  this  topic  since  2004,  E1
    considers that, absent any specific reasons  for  interrogating  failed
    asylum seekers more closely  (such  as  the  existence  of  a  criminal
    record), the main interest of airport officials is in trying to  obtain
    a bribe from them.  Generally speaking, his position is that (1) it  is
    only if such a bribe (which he says can be paid either by the  returnee
    himself or by relatives at the airport) cannot be paid that  this  type
    of harassment can take a physical dimension and lead to a transfer into
    detention; and (2) generally returnees are able to pay such bribes.

313.  We consider that E1's evidence as to the risk of being asked to pay  a
    bribe (his Position B) is reasonably likely to  be  true.   It  marches
    closely with the April 2006 EU Report comment that some returned failed
    asylum seekers:

           "... do face low-level harassment at N'Djili  airport,  such  as
           being asked for bribes and having items  'confiscated'  (stolen)
           from  their  luggage.   However,   such   behaviour   from   the
           authorities is not confined to  this  particular  group  -  most
           regular travellers through N'Djili experience this at some time.
            Travellers arriving from Europe are  sometimes  assumed  to  be
           better off financially and therefore an easy target.  There  are
           also some security agents  who  abuse  their  power  and  target
           civilians, this generally has opportunist crime as  its  primary
           motivation."

314.  In his latest report E1 takes issue with the  apparent  equation  made
    in the above passage between the situation of travellers  and  returned
    failed asylum seekers.  However, we do not think that this is what  the
    above passage asserts.  It states that seeking to extract bribes is not
    "confined" to failed asylum seekers; it does not  state  that  ordinary
    travellers are subjected to demands to pay a bribe to the same  degree.
    (If this passage was purporting to suggest the treatment was  routinely
    the same for both categories, we agree with E1 that it appears far more
    common - indeed virtually routine  -  in  respect  of  returned  failed
    asylum seekers.) In any event, E1 does not challenge  the  findings  of
    the 2006 EU Report otherwise.

315.  It is convenient at this point to address the issue  of  whether  this
    type of harassment amounts to ill-treatment.  Ms Giovannetti  is  quite
    right to point out that the case she has  had  to  meet  has  been  put
    principally on the  basis  that  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  are
    routinely  targeted  for  ill-treatment,  indeed  ill-treatment  of   a
    particularly egregious kind: amounting to a  widespread  administrative
    practice of routine torture, rape  and  wholesale  dispossession.   The
    appellant's case has not been put on the basis that, even if we do  not
    accept that this is the case, failed asylum seekers are still  at  risk
    because of the oppressive nature of  the  procedure  in  which  airport
    officials on (and sometimes after) entry  pressurise  such  people  for
    bribes. Nonetheless the topic is one which we need to address.

316.  The topic has three interrelated aspects. One concerns the  extent  to
    which failed asylum seekers are likely  to  face  demands  for  bribes.
    Another concerns  the  nature  of  the  bribe-asking  and  bribe-taking
    involved. The other concerns  whether  failed  asylum  seekers  are  in
    general able to negotiate the bribe-asking process (if  and  when  they
    encounter it) by paying a bribe sufficient to  ensure  that  they  pass
    through airport controls unharmed.

317. As regards the extent to  which  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  are
    likely to face requests/demands for bribes, the evidence  in  our  view
    points to the conclusion that they may very  commonly  find  that  they
    face such requests/demands. Even the  effect  of  the  British  Embassy
    official's evidence was that this was the norm except  when  there  was
    some special situation which might make airport officials  less  likely
    to make such demands, e.g. the presence of a foreign  embassy  official
    in the context of a charter flight return. We would accept,  therefore,
    that in general failed asylum seekers (and to a lesser degree  ordinary
    travellers) are faced with pressure to pay a bribe.


318. So far as the nature of the bribe-asking and  bribe-taking  process  is
    concerned, we would first of all observe that it does not  seem  to  us
    that the mere seeking of a  bribe  can  itself  amount  to  inhuman  or
    degrading treatment, even if  the  request/demand  itself  is  illegal.
    Furthermore, we take it  as  uncontroversial  that  bribe-asking  is  a
    significant problem in a number of airports around the world, including
    some in developed countries.  Turning  to  the  situation  in  the  DRC
    generally, it is clear from the background  evidence  that  corruption,
    especially in the form of low-level bribe-taking  or  bribe-giving,  is
    endemic and many transactions faced by citizens and their families  and
    friends in their everyday lives involve having to pay bribes. The  COIS
    Report of 31 July 2007 in a subsection headed "Corruption" refers to  a
    number of sources identifying the need to pay bribes  to  officials  in
    the state and private sector. Among the examples given  is  that  of  a
    commission set up to combat customs fraud being disbanded after it  was
    discovered charging an illegal tax on all traffic  passing  across  the
    border with Zambia. The US State Department  Report  covering  2006  is
    quoted as stating:


            "...weak financial controls and lack of a functioning  judicial
           system  encouraged  officials  to  engage  in  corruption   with
           impunity. Many civil servants, police and soldiers had not  been
           paid in years, received irregular  salaries,  or  did  not  earn
           enough to  support  their  families,  all  of  which  encouraged
           corruption. For example, local authorities continued  to  extort
           "taxes" and "fees" from boats travelling on many  parts  of  the
           Congo River."


    By contrast with developed states such  as  the  countries  of  Western
    Europe, therefore, it can be seen that there is often  a  blurred  line
    drawn by state officials between official and unofficial taxes and fees
    and this is understood by citizens and others who  have  dealings  with
    them.


319. Secondly, in our view the evidence does not demonstrate that the bribe-
    asking which takes place at N'Djili airport is generally accompanied by
    threats of violence or the actual use of  violence.  The  2006  EU  HoM
    report found that "harassment" at N'Djili airport is experienced  by  a
    majority of travellers, both Congolese and foreign,  but  it  does  not
    describe this harassment as being of an oppressive  character.  If  the
    requests/demands for bribes  were oppressive in nature we consider this
    would have been identified in this report  and  in  the  other  sources
    which we have found reliable, in particular  the  assessments  made  by
    individual embassies, the UNHCR evidence, the  VSV  evidence  and  E1's
    evidence.

320.   The  final,  interrelated,  aspect  concerns  whether  failed  asylum
    seekers are in general able to negotiate the bribe-asking process (when
    they encounter it) by paying a bribe sufficient  to  ensure  that  they
    pass through airport controls unharmed. In our view the  main  body  of
    reliable evidence indicates that normally failed  asylum  seekers  (and
    ordinary travellers) do not have  their  money  and  jewelry  or  other
    personal effects taken from them on arrival  and  also  indicates  that
    normally they are able to negotiate passing through airport controls by
    paying a bribe in circumstances which  are  generally  not  oppressive.
    Much of the contents of E1's reports are consistent with  this,  seeing
    the motivation of airport officials as being  principally  directed  at
    assessing what amount it  will  be  practicable  to  extract  from  the
    individual returnee. The only  one  of  VSV's  five  illustrative  case
    studies which mentioned bribes  referred  to  officials  accepting  the
    "little amount of money he had on  him  (roughly  9  dollars)  and  his
    cigarettes". E1 (although differing strongly with VSV as to the amounts
    involved)  does  not  indicate  that  the  amounts   requested/demanded
    normally present any particular problem for the returned failed  asylum
    seekers except where there are special risk factors.  Additionally,  we
    had no evidence to indicate that failed asylum seekers  facing  removal
    from the UK are prevented from travelling back to the  DRC  with  their
    own personal effects (including monies). We have no  reason  to  think,
    therefore, that they will be unequipped to deal  with  requests/demands
    for bribes should they be faced with such. Here we bear in  mind  that,
    notwithstanding the lack  of  consensus  in  the  reliable  sources  of
    evidence as to the levels of bribes asked for at  the  airport,  it  is
    clear that the earnings of most  DRC  government  officials,  including
    airport officials are extremely low. In the context  of  a  country  in
    which the vast majority of the population live on the equivalent of $US
    0.2  a day, even what in Europe would be  regarded  as  "spare  change"
    would amount to  a  very  considerable  amount  in  the  eyes  of  such
    officials. We reiterate the evidence contained  in  E1's  first  report
    that even a judge at the Court of Appeal earns a monthly salary  of  20
    US dollars and a clerk of the court earns 8 US  dollars  (there  is  no
    supplement for lodging, health care or transport).  Thus  there  is  no
    basis for supposing that any traveller from  the  West  -  even  failed
    asylum seekers - will be unable to satisfy the requests/demands  for  a
    bribe, which are exceedingly  modest  by  Western  European  standards.
    Therefore it is unnecessary  to  inquire  into  whether  failed  asylum
    seekers returned to the DRC by the UK would have  significant  sums  on
    them when they return: even loose change will do.

321.  We cannot rule out that there may  be  isolated  instances  where  the
    demand for a bribe takes an oppressive form or where the  sum  demanded
    is sufficiently significant to render that demand oppressive in  effect
    (because of what is threatened if the  bribe  is  not  paid).  However,
    bearing in mind the lack of any satisfactory evidence  of  bribe-asking
    taking oppressive forms, we consider that such instances will be  rare.
    There is no reason to think that, in relation to the  bribe-asking  and
    bribe-taking  process,  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  are  at  any
    significantly different level of risk than ordinary travellers.

322.  We would emphasise that in reaching  the  above  conclusions  we  have
    taken into account that there were items of (or parts of) the  evidence
    before us indicating that bribes demanded can  be  prohibitively  large
    sums and that returnees can be detained because they have no money, but
    taken as a whole we did not find those items (or parts of the evidence)
    reliable.  Whilst  we  are  prepared  to  accept  that  in  rare  cases
    prohibitive sums may be demanded and/or persons  are  detained  because
    they cannot pay, the evidence as a whole does not demonstrate that this
    is generally happening or that it happens sufficiently to give rise  to
    a real risk of it happening to returned failed asylum seekers as such.

323.  Accordingly we are not persuaded that for deportees or  failed  asylum
    seekers the difficulties they  commonly  face  in  being  expected  and
    required to pay a bribe amounts to treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR
    or to serious harm.

324.   The  same  cannot  be  said,  however,  for   the   nature   of   the
    requests/demands for bribes once a person is transferred  to  detention
    facilities elsewhere.  We of course have not found that  failed  asylum
    seekers will be transferred in this way, but for individuals  who  will
    face such transfer because of specific risk factors (e.g. those who are
    on a wanted list), the preponderance  of  the  evidence,  at  least  as
    presented to us in this appeal and (with  express  concession  by  Miss
    Giovannetti for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal),  is  that,  once  in
    detention  away  from  the  airport,  they  will  be  in  an  extremely
    vulnerable situation characterised by physical and verbal  abuse  of  a
    serious kind. They are no  longer  involved  in  a  process  which  can
    normally be negotiated by paying a bribe in circumstances which are not
    oppressive.  They  have  lost  their  liberty  and  face  targeted  ill
    treatment.

Other Evidence
325.  Having identified and given our  reasons  for  attaching  considerable
    weight to certain sources, we need to explain why we have  decided  not
    to attach significant weight to other sources or  other  parts  of  the
    evidence   which   have   been   relied   upon   by   the   appellant's
    representatives.    Since   we   have   already   analysed   the   main
    sources/evidence falling into this category, we can for the  most  part
    simply note them here very briefly.

326.  Evaluating E1's evidence has proved  problematic:  as  already  noted,
    his  reports  contain  support  for  two  contrasting  viewpoints:  one
    indicative of a practice of ill-treatment of failed asylum  seekers  on
    return, the other not.  What we found significant when  analysing  E1's
    statements in support of the former position (Position A), is that they
    appear to rely unduly on what he has learnt,  directly  or  indirectly,
    from officials working,  or  with  recent  experience  of  working,  at
    N'Djili airport.  In this regard we find it difficult to see the  basis
    on which he is as prepared, as much as he  plainly  is,  to  take  what
    these sources say about mistreatment of failed asylum seekers at  face-
    value, notwithstanding his recognition elsewhere of complicity  between
    some airport officials and illegal emigration networks.  We  note  that
    these sources did not furnish documents or particulars to support their
    claims, even though we know from other reports in the  past  (and  E2's
    reports) that such documents or particulars can sometimes be  produced:
    E2, for example, was able to get hold of  the  airport  record  of  the
    names and details of persons on the 27  February  2006  charter  flight
    from London.

327.  The evidence of E2 we have found to have significant shortcomings  and
    we do not find that she  was  an  expert  who  properly  fulfilled  the
    requirements of impartiality and readiness to address the existence  of
    evidence pointing to  the  contrary  in  an  appropriate  way.  We  are
    prepared to accept  that E2 (at least on some occasions) has been found
    to furnish very  helpful  and  reliable  evidence  in  the  context  of
    individual asylum claims she has been asked to investigate; and nothing
    we say is intended to deprecate such work.   But researching individual
    asylum cases based on adverse experiences whilst living in the DRC  and
    seeking to research the issue of risk arising from the  return  process
    to broad categories of persons (collective and individual returnees  as
    a group) are very different matters and, in relation to the latter type
    of research, there  are  a  number  of  glaring  shortcomings  in  E2's
    methodology and approach. Whilst admiring the painstaking work done  by
    E2 in her efforts to  investigate  concerns  expressed  about  returned
    failed asylum seekers, we find that much of her evidence is marred by a
    lack of empirical inquiry and the taking of a fixed partisan position.

328.  As regards the airport witnesses, we have  found  the  bulk  of  their
    evidence extremely unsatisfactory. We did not consider  that  we  could
    attach any significant weight to the IK  article  or  to  the  Observer
    story from the man who said he had worked as a torturer at Kin  Maziere
    and who, even though  happy  to  have  his  name  and  picture  printed
    therein, was not  prepared  to  have  his  evidence  tested  in  cross-
    examination before us.

329.  Concerning the evidence of Jenny Cuffe, Elizabeth Atherton and DW,  we
    have no concerns about their sincerity and good faith, but we have  not
    found the ways in which they have gone about  collecting  the  evidence
    and seeking to test it, to have yielded any substantiated cases of ill-
    treatment of any returned failed asylum seeker.

330.  As regards the two main NGOs which have  identified  particular  cases
    of concern to them - CDHH/OCDH and CODHO - we have serious doubts as to
    their claimed experience of cases of concern made known to them in  the
    past and we observe that in general they  have  simply  relied  on  the
    truth of what has been told to them, without showing any  awareness  of
    the surrounding  circumstances  which  indicate  that  stories  can  be
    invented and purely economic motives may sometimes be involved. That is
    particularly striking in relation to RK's account of his  "Case  6"  in
    which  he  describes  receiving  a   visit   from   a   failed   asylum
    seeker/deportee from Holland in the company of a DGM officer who wished
    to help the man. RK then recounts as fact this officer's account to him
    that at the airport "when deportees arrive at the ...airport, they  are
    systematically arrested and taken to DGM cells in Kin Maziere in Gombe"
    where they stay in detention for 48 hours.

331.  We also remind ourselves that RK of CDHH/OCDH is  reported  as  having
    attended as a speaker at one of  the  UK  meetings  organised  by  Miss
    Atherton and others in  early  2007  to  raise  awareness  amongst  the
    Congolese community of the issues involved in this case and to seek out
    anyone with relevant evidence. Whether or not that means that  he  sees
    himself as an advocate rather than  a  fact-finder  on  this  issue  we
    cannot say, but it is a cause for caution. We  find  it  very  hard  to
    understand what RK could mean in his letter of  11  September  when  he
    writes of having "long experience" in relation to deportees  and  their
    experiences on return to the DRC. All of the cases  he  furnishes  some
    details of were ones which were, he says, brought to his  attention  by
    E2's organisation. Furthermore he mentions that the British Embassy  in
    Kinshasa knows the OCDH very well.  He  then  notes  that  the  Embassy
    "never contacted us in regard to deported failed  asylum  seekers".  By
    the same token, we infer that he never contacted  the  British  Embassy
    about such cases, nor does he mention contacting the embassies of other
    European countries responsible for deporting the cases he mentions. Why
    not is far from clear.

332.  As regards CODHO, aside from the fact that  the  information  it  gave
    was extremely vague and  sketchy,  we  note  that  Miss  Cuffe  in  her
    statement identified the representative she met from this NGO as one of
    only two people she interviewed whom she found untrustworthy.

333.   Perhaps  the   main   case   dossier   on   which   the   appellant's
    representatives relied was the case of WY.  We have not  as  yet  dealt
    specifically with it so it is necessary that we do so now.

The Case of WY
334.   In  her  second  report  E2  explained  that  she  was  requested  by
    solicitors Trott & Gentry to undertake investigations  in  Kinshasa  as
    regards the fate of the Congolese who were  removed  to  Kinshasa  from
    London on the 26 February 2007 charter flight.  She did the work during
    27-28 June 2007.  As already noted, she received  a  witness  statement
    from a "reliable partner" who had observed the arrival  from  beginning
    to end and had assessed that the formalities at the airport took  place
    without obvious rough treatment.  However, her efforts to establish the
    validity of "alarming information from a number of sources in  Britain"
    were in vain, "since we did not receive any  directions/information  on
    how to make contact with the victims or their nearest  relatives".   We
    pause to observe that this does not suggest that the briefing Trott and
    Gentry gave was very much help, but we shall  assume  there  were  good
    reasons for that. In any event she states that the only information she
    was able to gather from "primary sources" concerned WY.   It  is  clear
    from the final two paragraphs of E2's report  that  she  regarded  WY's
    account as truthful: indeed it led  her  to  say  that  WY's  case  was
    "typical of the manner in which the current regime treats Congolese who
    have been refouled from the UK".

335.  We take a very different view of WY's case. To  be  fair  to  E2,  she
    made the assessment in her report on the basis of limited evidence  and
    acknowledged during cross-examination that the NGO who put her in touch
    with WY was one which was not previously known to her  and  she  agreed
    that it was odd it was not acting on behalf of any of the other charter
    flight returnees.  Nevertheless we are surprised that she  should  have
    been so ready to validate it.

336.  Our reasons for finding WY unreliable are various.  There is first  of
    all the nature of the communication with him upon which E2 relied.  She
    never met him face-to-face.  She only met  the  NGO  intermediary,  JP,
    President of the Congolese Commission against Torture.  Initially  this
    man had agreed E2 could meet WY at a location to  be  indicated  later.
    However, on the  agreed  day  the  intermediary  refused  two  proposed
    venues.  Although E2 was then able  to  arrange  to  telephone  WY  and
    conduct a telephone interview, she records that  at  the  end  of  this
    interview WY "told me he would be prepared to meet  me,  if  that  were
    useful".  Yet nothing more was then arranged,  nor  does  E2  give  any
    clear explanation why it was not.

337.  Second, despite E2 emphasising that WY was able to tell her  "in  good
    chronology and in detail" what had happened to him, his  chronology  is
    markedly different from that given by  the  intermediary  (JP)  is  his
    letter dated 28 February 2007.  According to WY (as recorded by E2)  he
    had arrived at N'Djili in the early hours of 27 February  2007.   After
    passing through controls, he and his family were  met  by  his  younger
    brother who took them to his house.  Around 3-4 in the morning, men  in
    uniform (and some in civilian clothes) raid  his  brother's  house  and
    take him (WY) away.  They stop in a dark part of Mount Nafula and  beat
    him with barbed wire.  He then refers to suffering further beatings  in
    a cachot (private, secret detention cell) the  "next  morning".   "That
    evening" (which cannot  have  been  earlier  than  the  evening  of  28
    February) he is interrogated by a commander, shown photos of himself at
    demonstrations in London and then beaten further.  He is then put  back
    in the cell with two other prisoners.  "During the night" he  is  taken
    out of the cell, driven off in a jeep and thrown into the  bush.   When
    he regains consciousness he is taken by some  people  to  a  Red  Cross
    dispensary, where he is taken care of for three days.   He  then  rings
    his wife who comes and fetches him.  Several weeks  go  by  and  on  or
    around 24 March he goes to the British Embassy to submit an application
    for an NGO vacancy to do voluntary work.  He  submits  his  application
    and leaves them a copy of his diploma.  After listening  to  him,  they
    promise to "study the file".  He  then  leaves  the  Embassy  premises.
    Barely:

           "... two steps outside the gate, under the eyes of  the  Embassy
           staff, I was abducted.  A jeep came after  me  and  another  one
           from the other side, and they blocked the road, and I was picked
           up and thrown into one of them.  The staff at  the  Embassy  can
           tell you what they saw."

338.  He is then taken to Kin Maziere.  "If you meet with me",  he  says,  I
    [will] describe the space to you in exact detail".  He  says  that  two
    more days pass.  They ask him for money,  which  (conveniently)  he  is
    able to produce from a pocket where it was sewn inside.  He phones  his
    brother.  He continues:

           "My brother arrived.  I said: Alert that J.P. from the NGO,  and
           alert the family.  Explain  also  to  the  Red  Cross  what  has
           happened."


339.  Three further days pass and he is released.

340.  There is no mention in this account of any  visit,  whilst  he  is  in
    detention, from an NGO and, indeed, the clear impression  he  gives  is
    that his own first contact with an NGO was not until several days after
    24 March when he asks his brother to "Alert that J.P. from the NGO."

341.  By contrast, the 28 February 2007 letter from JP states that his NGO:

           "hereby wishes to convey you its indignation on the issue of the
           case of [W], expelled from Great Britain and  detained  in  your
           institution at Kin Maziere since yesterday 27/02/07 ...


           Our organisation objects forcefully to the (use of) torture  you
           apply in your institution, because this unfortunate (individual)
           bears traces of torture on his body."  (emphases added).

342.  This letter plainly implies that this NGO or  someone  known  to  them
    had either seen WY or heard from WY so as to know he "bears  traces  of
    torture on his body".  Yet, as we have seen, there is no mention by  WY
    of anyone from outside having contact with him until very  late  on  28
    March or 29 March at the earliest.  Mr Jacobs sought to argue  that  WY
    simply forgot to mention that JP must have visited  him  on  27  or  28
    February.  But (leaving aside that JP's letter clearly  identifies  the
    appellant's detention in Kin Maziere as being on the 27th, not the 28th
    February) there is no mention of that by either WY or JP in his letter.
     For WY to have been visited by an NGO  would  have  been  a  momentous
    event which he would not have omitted to mention.  Furthermore, to have
    gained access on 27 or 28 February JP would have had to have  had  some
    information as to WY's whereabouts; yet (to repeat) on WY's own account
    there is no mention of any contact being made with JP until his  second
    claimed period of detention, weeks later.

343.  Thirdly, WY's claim  to  have  spoken  with  someone  at  the  British
    Embassy and to have had his abduction by men in two jeeps who  "blocked
    the road" witnessed by Embassy staff  is  flatly  contradicted  by  the
    British Embassy who were specifically asked  to  check  their  records.
    The Embassy letter of 2 July 2007 says that there was "no record of any
    interview being conducted as stated by the claimant known as [WY]"  and
    no knowledge of any alleged abduction that took place  outside  Embassy
    grounds sometime after 23 March 2007.  It adds:

           "Movements and events directly outside the Embassy  grounds  are
           monitored 24 hours a day by CCTV and  by  Ghurkha  Guards.   Any
           such events would  have  been  reported  to  the  post  security
           manager."

344.  Fourthly, if WY had indeed gone to the British  Embassy  a  few  weeks
    after having been picked up and tortured in the way he described, it is
    very difficult to understand why he  did  not  mention  these  horrific
    experiences to anyone to whom he spoke at the British Embassy.  We know
    from other sources that there was at least one British Embassy official
    monitoring the charter flight returnees. WY plainly knew  this  because
    he refers to his wife  making  a  specific  complaint  to  the  British
    Embassy official present at the airport, regarding theft of her luggage
    and to this official promising to look into it.  Yet  WY  says  nothing
    either about his wife's complaint or, more  tellingly,  about  his  own
    traumatic experiences within hours of leaving the airport. We  consider
    that if WY's account were true, he would surely have felt it  important
    to tell British officials what suffering their forced return had caused
    him.  We also know from the Adjudicator's determination of  his  asylum
    claim on 16 December 2004 that he had worked for the  US  Embassy.   On
    his own account, although it was not accepted by  the  Adjudicator,  he
    had asked that Embassy for, and it had produced a report saying that he
    had departed the post because of political threats and the Embassy  had
    even intervened to secure his release from detention.  Plainly  WY  was
    well aware, therefore, of the  possibility  of  asking  for  help  with
    troubles from an Embassy.

345.  Fifthly, as regards the letter purporting to be from  someone  in  the
    ICRC facility based at Ceite in Mt Nafula, Kinshasa, dated 2 March 2007
    we consider we can place no reliance upon it.  The  part  of  the  form
    which requires the details of  sender  and  addressee  are  blank,  the
    correct signature space is unused and there is no independent  evidence
    that the person who has signed it in the "date"  section  is  from  the
    ICRC and was present at the Mt Nafula Ceite on the  date  claimed.   In
    her letter of 16 September 2007, E2 mentions obtaining  the  number  of
    the person in charge of the Red Cross, regional section Limete [a  name
    is given] who confirmed to her that the Red  Cross  has  correspondence
    and photos of WY's case and  that  if  the  British  Red  Cross  wanted
    further confirmation, that would be no problem at all.  However,  there
    has been no further confirmation. We are  bound  to  say,  given  other
    concerns we have with WY's account, that in any  event  we  would  have
    required very precise and corroborated confirmation from ICRC of  their
    dealings with WY and what WY had told them before.

346.  Sixthly, the photograph which has been  produced  to  us  as  being  a
    photograph of WY when he was in the care of the ICRC at Mt  Nafula  has
    not been authenticated by anyone in the ICRC at Mt Nafula  as  being  a
    true likeness of the person known to them as (if in fact  he  was)  WY.
    There is also the problem  that  the  only  photograph  that  has  been
    produced to us of the  WY  who  claimed  asylum  in  the  UK  does  not
    obviously match the photos said to have been sent (originally)  by  the
    ICRC Ceite.

347.  We note further that despite Trott & Gentry asking E2 to conduct  some
    further inquiries of WY (and others) in  September,  very  few  of  the
    evident difficulties with his account were conveyed to E2  for  her  to
    comment on or put to WY.

348.  In any event the very most  that  the  Red  Cross  evidence  (even  if
    genuine) would show is that WY was beaten up and ill-treated. It is not
    suggested that the Red Cross could verify who his attackers were.

349.  WY's account of the charter flight return  process  is  also  at  odds
    with that given by the two British Embassy officials, one of  whom  (X)
    was present throughout the whole operation, the  other  for  the  first
    part.  In  X's letter of 28 July 2007 he points out that,  contrary  to
    what WY states, none of the returnees  had  passports,  water  was  not
    handed out by British Embassy staff; and there were no military in  the
    room in which the DGM interviews took place. X's letter states  further
    that he checked the Kinshasa  Field  Office  of  MONUC's  Human  Rights
    Division and was told they had  no  record  of  the  only  27  February
    deportee called WY.  He also  checked  the  prison  register  for  Kin-
    Maziere for 27 February (the day WY alleges he was detained) and  found
    the names of no-one who was on the 26 February charter flight.  He also
    comments that the number of security service personnel described by  WY
    as detaining him was "uncharacteristically excessive in relation to the
    manner in which similar arrests have been made and documented by the UN
    and others".

350.  There is  another  aspect  of  WY's  account  of  the  charter  flight
    operation  which  does  not  ring  true.  It  arises  from  his  latest
    conversation with E2 in which he asserted that his  "asylum  file"  was
    handed over to the DRC authorities. For that  to  have  happened  there
    would have had to be a serious breach of  Home  Office  procedures.  Mr
    Jacobs has wisely not sought to argue that  such  a  breach  must  have
    happened in this case, but in any event we find that such a breach  did
    not happen.

351.  The last reason we have for finding WY's account  unreliable  is  that
    the accounts he and his wife gave of difficulties with the  authorities
    in respect of his original asylum claim were rejected by an Adjudicator
    on 16 December 2004 for want of credibility.  Save for  accepting  that
    he was employed by the US Embassy in Kinshasa for two periods,  one  in
    1993, another from 1995 until he left the DRC and that he and his  wife
    may have been  low-level  UDPS  members,  the  Adjudicator  disbelieved
    virtually  everything  else.  The  Tribunal  upheld  the  Adjudicator's
    determination on 22 January 2005.  The  fresh  evidence  we  have  been
    presented with regarding his case and experiences since, have not stood
    up to scrutiny.

The Appellant's Central Submissions
352.  Although we have of course to consider all of the available  evidence,
    we also think it right to draw attention to the fact that we have found
    the central planks of evidence on which the appellant's representatives
    have relied replete with shortcomings. As  is  evident  both  from  the
    campaigning publicity surrounding this case (which Ms Atherton  and  at
    least  two  other  witnesses  have  been  involved  in)  and  from  the
    correspondence we have seen from the appellant's solicitors and from Mr
    Jacobs' submissions from the outset of this case, they regarded this as
    a country guidance case in which key airport witnesses would be able to
    demonstrate from their own  experience  patterns  of  abuse  of  failed
    asylum seekers during the return process and in which there would  also
    be failed asylum seekers who had got back to the UK willing  and  ready
    to give oral evidence.  They also considered that they had a dossier of
    other cases which either individually or cumulatively would corroborate
    their central contentions.

Witnesses Who Did Not Materialise
353.  As will be apparent, in the event there were no failed asylum  seekers
      among the witnesses giving evidence at the hearing of this appeal.  At
      first sight it might seem surprising that  anyone  should  be  talking
      about individuals who have been removed to the DRC as witnesses before
      a UK Tribunal.  However, at the end of the first two and a  half  days
      of hearing in July, the appellant's representatives had  given  notice
      of their intention to call one witness said  to  be  a  failed  asylum
      seeker who, having been returned, was  back  in  the  UK  (his  asylum
      appeal having been dismissed and he having been removed from the UK to
      the DRC on 25 January 2005): he had managed to return to the UK  on  5
      October 2005 (Bundle 2, Tab 5).  In the event  this  witness  did  not
      attend  and  the  statements  the  appellant's   representatives   had
      submitted relating to his case were not relied upon.

354.  The same proved to be the case with a  second  witness,  AB.   At  the
      beginning of the second phase of the hearing (in September), Mr Jacobs
      made an application that he be able  to  call  this  further  witness.
      Given that we had been faced with the withdrawal of evidence  relating
      to the only other witness said to be a failed asylum  seeker  back  in
      the UK, we decided, exceptionally, to grant  Mr  Jacobs'  application.
      Miss Giovannetti  said  she  was  content  that  we  take  this  step,
      notwithstanding  the  difficulties  it  put  in  her  way  by  way  of
      preparation.  However, the day before AB was due to give  evidence  Mr
      Jacobs said he had been instructed that this individual did  not  wish
      to give evidence as he had an outstanding (fresh) claim  and  did  not
      wish to jeopardise that by possibly having his  evidence  in  his  new
      claim made the subject of prior  judicial  findings.  We  had  written
      evidence from Miss CC to  similar  effect.  Insofar  as  we  had  some
      evidence concerning AB over  and  above  that  which  was  before  the
      Tribunal in VL, it has not caused us  to  change  our  view  that  his
      account lacked coherence and is essentially unsubstantiated.

355.  As already noted, it was Ms Atherton's evidence before us that in  the
    lead-up to this hearing she knew of the cases  of  four  failed  asylum
    seekers who had managed to return to the UK having  been  deported  and
    three of them had told her they were prepared to give evidence to  this
    Tribunal.  We do not know for certain if two of them were the same  two
    just described but we shall assume so.  The evident  effort  which  had
    gone into preparing statements and supporting evidence  in  respect  of
    these two witnesses demonstrates that at one point both must have  been
    advised (properly in our view) that it  would  not  be  detrimental  to
    their pending fresh applications/appeals to give  evidence  before  us.
    Although we had evidence from W1 about death threats made  to  him  and
    evidence from Miss CC about death threats  made  to  her,  it  was  not
    submitted by Mr Jacobs that  either  of  the  aforementioned  potential
    witnesses had been the subject of threats. The first had  earlier  been
    placed  on  our  list  of  persons  protected  by  our  Anonymity   and
    Confidentiality order and we had indicated  that  the  order  would  be
    amended to include the second.

356.   We  are  none  too  impressed,  therefore,  with  their   last-minute
    withdrawals.  It is not for us to speculate as to why they decided  not
    to give evidence.  All we can observe  is  that  two  opportunities  to
    assist this Tribunal  by  having  evidence  in  person  as  to  alleged
    mistreatment  on  return  to  N'Djili  airport  subjected   to   cross-
    examination, were lost.

357.  We should also mention another airport witness who Mr Jacobs had  told
    us in July would be providing a statement and would be called  to  give
    evidence.  At the beginning of the September hearing on 17 September Mr
    Jacobs said that this man would not be giving evidence and no statement
    from him was forthcoming.  Yet this potential  witness,  we  note,  had
    been ready to give his story to the  Observer on 16 September 2007; his
    story as reported was that  he  had  been  a  member  of  the  personal
    security corps of the former President Lauren Kabila  and  had  himself
    been involved in or a witness to many acts of torture  carried  out  at
    Kin Maziere, "many" of whose inmates "have been deported from  the  UK,
    France and Germany".   This  article  carried  his  name  and  picture,
    captioned as "a repentant  secret  policeman".  That  this  individual,
    despite feeling able to give his name and have his photo  appear  in  a
    national newspaper, proved unready to  give  evidence,  did  little  to
    enhance the weight we felt able to attach to his account as set out  in
    this article. In our view his evidence therein,  being  unsubstantiated
    and untested, does not assist us.

27 February 2007 Charter Flight
358.  Although we have dealt with several aspects of  the  evidence  we  had
    relating to what happened to the failed asylum seekers returned on  the
    27 February 2007 charter flight, it is right that we set out separately
    our reasons for finding that considered as a whole it does not  support
    Mr Jacobs' principal submissions about failed asylum seekers facing ill-
    treatment on return.

359.  Mr Jacobs has very properly drawn our attention to  various  items  of
    evidence in support of his  contention  that  those  returned  on  this
    charter flight met with ill-treatment.  The most  detailed  account  we
    were presented with (via E2) concerned WY, whose evidence we have dealt
    with separately and need not repeat here save to reiterate that we find
    it seriously flawed.  Ms Atherton's statements contain details of seven
    persons said to be on the 27 February 2007 charter flight.  RK  of  the
    NGO CDDH, mentions a family that  was  on  the  flight,  but  gives  no
    details. DW refers to another person on this flight ("Case 21"),  whose
    friend had not  contacted  him  (DW)  as  he  had  promised  he  would.
    However, as, Ms Atherton agreed, she took what  she  was  told  by  the
    returnees she spoke to or contacted "on trust".  She  did  not  appear,
    when giving their stories, to consider the relevance of the  fact  that
    all but one were found not credible by adjudicators after a careful and
    detailed assessment of their evidence (the only exception  was  Case  8
    who was believed in relation to being a UDPS  member  and  having  been
    arrested and detained after a demonstration in January  2005,  but  was
    not believed about his claims to an incident of arrest and detention in
    June 2005 or any further incidents).  Of course, as already noted,  the
    fact an asylum seeker has been  untruthful  in  one  process  does  not
    necessarily mean that he is untruthful when in another process, but  it
    is well-established that, in the absence of special circumstances, past
    lack of credibility is relevant to assessment of current credibility.

360.  Nor, as noted earlier, did Ms Atherton ask any of her  charter  flight
    returnees about whether they had criminal records or whether they  were
    persons whose removal was deemed to be unconducive to the public good.

361.  Despite Miss Atherton's best efforts, several of the accounts she  has
    furnished lack important details.  Generally speaking we  find  all  of
    the cases she identified (including those removed individually on other
    dates) to raise as many questions as they are said to answer.  Why,  in
    particular, did none of the seven or any relative or friend not seek to
    report what they say happened to them to the British Embassy or a local
    human rights NGO or sections of the media in Kinshasa who are  critical
    of the government?  It will have been  visibly  apparent  to  all  that
    there was at least one British Embassy official in  attendance  at  the
    airport and it is reasonable we think, to  assume  that  at  least  the
    adults among the 40 returnees would be well aware  that  any  story  of
    troubles experienced by  any  of  them  on  this  flight  would  be  of
    potential interest to the British Embassy or human rights NGOs  or  the
    media in Kinshasa/DRC. We do not accept that all would been too fearful
    to take such steps, since it is clear from the background evidence that
    many individuals who have suffered ill treatment at the  hands  of  the
    current regime have felt able to complain and have their cases taken up
    by NGOs, the media and in some cases international bodies.

362.  It cannot be overlooked either that  the  evidence  obtained  is  from
    persons whose identities  could  not  be  confirmed  because  the  only
    contact was over the telephone and in some cases the account  given  of
    ill treatment is not even first hand.

363.  Counterposed to the evidence Ms Atherton  and  others  have  assembled
    about the 27 February  charter  flights,  are  a  number  of  items  of
    evidence which we consider possess considerably greater weight.

364.  There is first of all the British Embassy evidence.

365.  Significantly we have as part of this a copy of  the  internal  e-mail
    sent by the British Embassy official (X) by way of report to other  FCO
    officials in London, the very next day. So it is a near-contemporaneous
    account, written before there was any indication  of  complaints.    He
    reports that he was present throughout the entire operation and  it  is
    clear from what he goes on to say that he was able to witness  the  DGM
    interviews  at  close  hand.   He  describes  the  outward  flight   as
    "generally calm save for a few disruptive individuals".   Upon  arrival
    the documents of all of the  40  failed  asylum  seekers  ("FAS")  were
    checked by the Director of N'Djili airport and found to  be  in  order.
    The FAS were then taken to an ante-room away  from  the  main  arrivals
    hall to be interviewed by DGM staff.  He states:

           "The interviews were mercifully free of the  extortion  that  is
           sometimes a reality for ordinary Congolese returning to  N'Djili
           after foreign trips.  DGM staff mainly  sought  to  confirm  the
           nationality of the returnees.


           They also asked questions about the returnees' time  in  the  UK
           and their treatment during the return.   All  of  the  Congolese
           complained about the security  before  and  during  the  flight,
           particularly the  use  of  handcuffs  and  pre-flight  detention
           times.  Many said they had been forced to leave large quantities
           of personal belongings in the UK.  Some of the DGM staff, though
           remaining helpful, questioned UK policy - referring  to  alleged
           cases within the 40% of children who had been sent back with one
           parent whilst the other remained in the UK and  two  (confirmed)
           cases of children born in the UK.


           After about an hour and a half processing, 38 of  the  FAS  were
           allowed to leave, where the majority of them were met by  family
           and/or friends.  We  were  not  able  to  witness  all  of  them
           departing, but at least 25 of the group were definitely able  to
           leave the airport terminal unmolested.   DGM  staff  assured  us
           that all 38 were at liberty.  Two even reached this  Embassy  to
           enquire ambitiously about appeals and visas before midday."


366.  He then describes the circumstances surrounding the  two  persons  who
    the DGM staff did not accept were DRC nationals and were then returned.
     His e-mail ends by saying that the Embassy "will continue to keep  our
    ears to the ground for any allegations that  members  of  the  returned
    group have suffered abuses since their return".

367.  By the time of the next Embassy communication dated 28 July  2007  the
    same official has learnt of some allegations having been made about the
    27 February charter flight in relation to the case  of  WY.   He  notes
    three contradictions between WY's account  and  his  own  recollection:
    some of the returnees had passports, only A4 [laissez passez] documents
    were provided by the Congolese Embassy in London; British Embassy staff
    did not hand out water; and there were no military in the room in which
    the DGM interviews took place.  He also says that he checked the prison
    register of Kin-Maziere for 27 February "and found the names of  no-one
    who was on the 26 February charter flight".

368.  In his 13 September letter the same official comments:

           "In my time in Kinshasa, the vast majority of  evidence  I  have
           seen suggests that returnees to the DRC are not abused - and the
           only claims we ever receive that this is not the case  from  the
           UK, not from within the DRC."

369.  We  also  know  that  when  subsequent  allegations  from  UK  sources
      regarding the 27 February charter flight were referred to the  British
      Embassy, they were investigated but found to be  unsubstantiated  (see
      14 September letter).

370.  We also have a statement of a JC, a Senior Executive  Officer  of  the
      Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) stating that he observed the first
      part of the operation at N'Djili airport in DRC following the  charter
      flight of February 2007 (up  to  the  point  when  the  returnees  had
      embarked on a bus after an initial documentation check by the Director
      of N'Djili airport). The remainder of his account reports what  X  had
      told him about the operation thereafter in more detail,  following  it
      becoming known that there was to be a Tribunal case dealing  with  the
      charter flight operation. It is  in  very  similar  terms  to  what  X
      himself recorded in his e-mail the  day  after  the  charter  flight's
      arrival.

371.  We mention next an item of evidence which is  of  unproven  value  but
    which gains significance from the fact that it  was  from  one  of  the
    sources whom E2 considers reliable.  As already noted she stated in her
    23 June 2007 report that:

           "About the arrival of the charter plane we  received  a  witness
           statement from a reliable  partner  of  ours  who  observed  the
           arrival from  beginning  to  end.   The  formalities  at  N'Djli
           airport took place without obvious rough treatment, though those
           leaving the plane were very stressed, according to his report."

372.  We asked E2 to produce a copy of this report, which she said  she  had
      received in e-mail form.   In  a  letter  of  26  September  2007  she
      apologised for being unable to locate it, although she had  asked  the
      person who sent it to her to look for it and send it.  We  mention  it
      here because it highlights one of the difficulties facing Mr Jacobs in
      seeking to rely on what evidence the appellant's  representatives  had
      been able to obtain about the 27 February charter  flight.   A  report
      from one of these sources, said by E2 to be reliable, gave an  account
      which does not easily match that given by several other informants.

373.  Then there is the monitoring by the VSV of this  charter  flight.   We
      do not have any statement from VSV confirming this  directly,  but  in
      his 28 July letter the British Embassy official who was  also  present
      throughout the operation describes a recent meeting with this  NGO  at
      which he discussed this charter flight with them.  He states that they
      gave  an  account  of  that  return  process  which  matched  his  own
      recollection, so personally he believed they were monitoring  on  that
      particular day.
374.  To summarise, we consider that  viewed  as  a  whole  the  allegations
      regarding the ill treatment of failed  asylum  seekers  on  return  to
      N'Djili airport on 27 February 2007 either have not  withstood  closer
      scrutiny or remain unsubstantiated. (It has not been  our  purpose  in
      this determination to analyse what will happen on  return  to  persons
      who are not mere failed asylum seekers but have a particular  military
      or criminal history that is known, or is likely to  become  known,  to
      the DRC authorities on return - e.g.  persons  who  are  deserters  or
      persons who have a criminal record or who for other  specific  reasons
      may be on the "wanted" list held at the airport. However,  we  see  no
      reason to take a different view regarding such persons than that taken
      by previous Tribunal country guidance, which is essentially  that  the
      claims of such persons would need to be looked at on a  case  by  case
      basis.)

375.  In passing we would observe that  the  pros  and  cons  of  EU  States
    carrying out collective removals in the form of charter flights is  not
    for us. The subject is a controversial one.  Nevertheless  we  are  far
    from persuaded that E1 is right to maintain that collective removals to
    the DRC are "more dangerous" than individual  removals.   At  least  as
    regards the 27 February charter  flight,  we  have  accepted  that  the
    version given by the British Embassy (consistent with what was said  by
    the source who wrote E2 a report about it) is not reasonably likely  to
    be untrue. That being so, it would appear  that  the  presence  of  the
    British Embassy staff during the return  operation  and  the  knowledge
    that there is high-level contact involved between British Embassy staff
    and the Head of the airport worked to lessen the degree  of  harassment
    which the failed asylum seekers faced from  airport  officials  wanting
    money.  We have not been able to attach credence to the various  claims
    made about ill-treatment by security service agents after  the  airport
    stage, whether outside the airport or at the places where returnees  go
    to stay.

Evidence of Specific Cases of Abuse of Returnees Generally
376.  Although we have dealt immediately above with the 27 February  charter
    flight returnees (which account for seven of Ms  Atherton's  cases  and
    also include WY), it is salient to consider the body of evidence  about
    abuses of returnees on various dates collectively.  In addition to  the
    charter flight cases  we  had  a  further  7  cases  identified  by  Ms
    Atherton, 6 identified by DW  (although his Case 21 is the same  as  Ms
    Atherton's Case 12) and 6 identified  by  CDHH  in  its  letter  of  11
    September 2007.  In addition to  the  individuals  mentioned  by  Jenny
    Cuffe in her 2004 BBC report, she briefly mentions in  a  14  September
    2007 letter two or three more which she had retrieved from  her  notes.
    We also had communications from a DRC  barrister,  PM,  mentioning  two
    cases and an OCDH letter identifying two cases.  E2's first  report  at
    Appendix B mentions another 14 or so cases.  Her second report mentions
    two others. Some of the cases  also  refer  to  other  individuals.  So
    although we have stopped our own  numbering  at  Case  29,  there  were
    further cases before us, albeit mostly in very skimpy form.

377.  Some of the above cases are persons said to have been refouled in  the
    1990s but most are persons said to have  been  refouled  between  2000-
    2005, although a lesser number give a date in  2006-2007.   Apart  from
    the Atherton and DW cases almost all are  persons  said  to  have  been
    refouled by Dutch, Belgian or French authorities.

378.  Evidence relating to some of these cases - that of AB in particular  -
    has already  been  considered  by  the  Tribunal  in  previous  country
    guidance cases.

379.  Extremely few of these cases have been ones identified by  local  NGOs
    or other sources in  the  DRC:  indeed  the  largest  number  of  cases
    mentioned by any DRC NGO - the six described in the CDHH letter  of  11
    September 2007 - are all said to have been brought to  their  attention
    by a European source (E2).

380.  This leads us to  reiterate  our  earlier  comment  that  we  find  it
    significant that so few cases appear to have been  raised  directly  by
    the said victims or their families or friends with anyone in the DRC in
    a position to possibly assist. Not as far as we know with  any  of  the
    Embassies of the countries who refouled  them  and  certainly  not  the
    British Embassy, despite the fact that all would have been told by  the
    authorities of these countries that the return process  would  be  safe
    for them. Not with any of the active human rights NGOs. Not with any of
    the international bodies such as UNHCR, MONUC, IOM and the  Red  Cross.
    Not with the media despite there being a variety of media  outlets  who
    regularly report stories critical of the government and its actions.

381.  Many of the accounts given about these  cases  are  exceedingly  scant
    and so take matters very little further.  As already noted, those which
    do give some degree of detail leave many important unanswered questions
    and at best amount (with one or two exceptions) to evidence at  second,
    third or fourth hand.  There has been no procedure made apparent on the
    part of any person taking down  these  case  details  for  testing  the
    accounts  or  for  asking  the  individuals  concerned   for   material
    particulars about their immigration histories, any criminal  record  or
    (with one or two exceptions) for any supporting documents.  In all  but
    one case those whose asylum claims have been traced and produced by the
    respondent (despite being given very little by  way  of  proper  notice
    about most of the UK-related cases) disclose  that  they  were  persons
    whose  credibility   about   past   ill-treatment   was   rejected   by
    adjudicators.

382.  We have considered whether, notwithstanding the lack of  substance  to
    each of the cases considered  individually,  there  is  nevertheless  a
    cumulative weight which should be attached to them.  The  argument  for
    so considering them is that  they  evidence  a  persistent  voicing  of
    concerns by NGOs and  others  in  several  European  countries  over  a
    considerable period of time and that there is a significant  degree  of
    consistency between  their  accounts.   The  difficulty  we  have  with
    attaching cumulative weight to this body of evidence, apart from  their
    individual  forensic  shortcomings,  is  that  we  consider  there  are
    surrounding circumstances which cast serious doubt on  the  motives  of
    those who have alleged they  have  been  victims.   The  vast  majority
    (certainly the UK cases) are persons who have been found  not  credible
    in their appeals and who, we know from other  sources,  are  likely  to
    have made their way from the DRC in the first place with  the  help  of
    illegal migration networks.
383.  Having made personal ties in European countries and experienced a  far
    higher standard of living than obtains in the DRC, it  is  very  likely
    that some (if not many) of these people will want to return to  the  UK
    or Europe.  They  may  well,  therefore,  have  a  vested  interest  in
    claiming that they were mistreated  on  return.   Of  course,  ulterior
    motives of this kind may be absent, but what we have to bear in mind is
    the general context in which  evidence  of  this  kind  is  sought  and
    obtained in untested and undocumented  form.  As  regards  the  claimed
    consistency, these accounts disclose as many divergencies  as  they  do
    points of agreement.

384.  As can be seen, therefore, the central planks of the case  mounted  by
    the appellant's representatives have proved not to bear the weight they
    sought to put on them; in some cases they have collapsed very badly.

385.  Despite  concerted  efforts  by  a  significant  number  of  people  -
    lawyers, NGOs and others - and despite there having been a long lead-in
    period to the hearing and conclusion of this case during which  members
    of the UK's DRC diaspora have been encouraged by  leaflets  and  public
    meetings in over six cities to come forward with cases, we  have  found
    no evidence to substantiate  the  claim  that  returned  failed  asylum
    seekers to the DRC as such  face a real risk of persecution or  serious
    harm or ill-treatment.

386.  Given  the  great  deal  of  time  and  effort  that  the  appellant's
    representatives have put into this case, it is appropriate that we make
    clear the following. In the event of any  future  investigations  being
    conducted of returned failed DRC asylum seekers, those concerned should
    take steps to ensure that basic relevant particulars are sought. Public
    funds, not to mention valuable judicial  resources,  are  involved  and
    must not be expended uselessly. In particular, we consider  that  where
    someone is known to have been a failed asylum seeker in the UK, initial
    efforts should be directed to obtaining (with authorisation) details of
    that person's asylum claim and the outcome of any  appeal.  As  vividly
    illustrated by the case of WY, that would  at  least  ensure  that  the
    investigations into their  claims  about  abuse  on  return  have  some
    external reference point for gauging the truth of what is now claimed.

The "subjective" parts of the case
387.  We turn now to the particular circumstances of the  appellant's  case,
    beginning with a summary of her claim. A screening interview took place
    on 3 February and additional questions were asked on 14 February.   She
    lodged a statement dated 22  February  and  completed  a  statement  of
    evidence form (SEF)  dated  28  February.   There  was  a  full  asylum
    interview on 21 March 2006.

388.  The Secretary of State decided to refuse the  appellant's  application
    on 28 March 2006. The appellant's claim was summarised in  paragraph  7
    of the refusal letter as follows:

           "You were born in Lumbumbashi and are of Muluba  ethnicity.  You
           are a practising Catholic.


           Both of your parents  were  active  members  of  the  Union  for
           Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS).  Your father was President
           of the Yolo district of Kinshasa. Your parents were kidnapped by
           soldiers and detained.  In 2001 your father was killed and  your
           mother released.


           After being arrested a second time your mother decided  to  flee
           and came to the United Kingdom (UK) and  the  family  went  into
           hiding.  As far as you know, you are the  only  member  of  your
           family supporting the UDPS now, although you were all brought up
           with the beliefs.


           You were married with a traditional wedding  in  December  2002.
           You have two step daughters.


           When you left school in 2001 you enrolled at University to study
           for a nursing degree, but you did not have  the  opportunity  to
           complete it.


           You joined the UDPS in 2003 as an active member, before that you
           only attended meetings on a weekly basis.  Your role was to work
           with and mobilise the young  female  members  in  your  section.
           Your husband was President of the district of Makala  where  you
           lived. His role was to  report  to  the  National  President  Mr
           Tshisekedi.  He was often away dealing with party activities.


           You and your husband were arrested on  30  June  2005  during  a
           march. You were both taken  to  IPK  [Inspection  de  police  de
           Kinshasa] (formerly Circo).  Lots of people were  arrested  from
           different political parties. You were detained until 4 July 2005
           as the National President of UDPS and other groups put  pressure
           on the government.


           You were told to stop your activities by the authorities.  On  7
           July 2005 you attended a huge  meeting  in  the  second  stadium
           called  Tata  Raphael  in  Kinshasa  and  you   continued   your
           activities.


           On 3 August 2005, 8-10 men entered your house, you assumed  they
           were soldiers as they carried guns. They knocked  on  the  door,
           and said if you did not let them in they would kill you. You hid
           in a room under the bed, but when your step daughter cried  they
           found you and started to beat you,  with  their  guns  and  long
           batons.


           You and your sister were stripped and raped, whilst your husband
           was beaten as he  was  attempting  to  prevent  the  rape.  Your
           husband collapsed and did not move. You and  your  husband  were
           taken away to IPK detention centre, you knew  your  husband  was
           dead. You have not seen him since.


           You were detained for four days, on  the  second  day  you  were
           questioned by the Police Chief  in  charge  of  IPK  about  your
           husband and Frank Kangundar [sic].  After  four  days  you  were
           taken to another prison and raped again,  you  then  became  ill
           from the treatment you had received and the lack of food and bad
           hygiene.


           At the beginning of October 2005 you were  taken  to  Mama  Yemo
           Hospital and you had two guards accompany you at all times. On 6
           November 2005 you escaped with help from the UDPS  members.  You
           asked for a nurse you knew [] to help you.  You went for a  test
           in the laboratory and on the way back to your room, [the  nurse]
           and other members of the UDPS created a disturbance, and as  the
           guards went to sort it out you got taken outside to a  car,  and
           you were driven to Kinsuka.


           You remained in hiding.  Your brother in law arranged for you to
           flee the DRC via an agent.  You left Kinshasa on 1 February 2006
           and you landed in Congo Brazzaville and stayed  in  the  airport
           with the agent. You fled  to  the  UK  via  an  unknown  African
           country. You arrived in the UK on 3 February 2006.  You  claimed
           asylum at the Home Office in Croydon on 3 February 2006.


           You have stated that if you  return  you  fear  the  government,
           because you are wanted by them."

389.  The Secretary of State considered that the appellant would not  be  of
    interest to the authorities because she was such a  low  level  member.
    It was not accepted that the appellant had been detained alone  in  the
    second detention centre in the light of the  background  material.   It
    was not believed that the  appellant  was  taken  to  hospital  because
    medical treatment was not free of charge  and  the  appellant's  family
    were, on her account, not aware where she was.

390.  Even if the appellant had been arrested,  as  she  had  been  released
    after a few days,  this  confirmed  she  was  of  no  interest  to  the
    authorities.

391.  No evidence had been provided of any connections that the  appellant's
    husband had with Franck Kangundu or Tshisekedi.

392.  In paragraph 14 of the letter the Secretary  of  State  believed  that
    the appellant came to the United Kingdom to join her  mother  and  that
    she was aware that she was coming to the United Kingdom.

393.  A point was taken on s.8 of the Asylum and Immigration  (Treatment  of
    claimants etc) Act 2004 as the appellant's agent had produced a  forged
    passport apparently with the appellant's own picture to a  Home  Office
    official as if it were a valid passport.  The appellant was served with
    a notice of the decision on 29 March 2006 and a notice  of  appeal  was
    lodged by Biscoes Solicitors on 13 April 2006.  The grounds  of  appeal
    are  not  particularly  informative  but   take   points   on   asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights grounds.

The Appellant's case
The Appellant
394.  The appellant was called and gave evidence through an  interpreter  in
    Lingala.  She adopted her statements.  At the interview she  had  given
    the date of the death of Franck Kangundu as 2/3 August 2005.  That date
    had been given to her by a relative but she now understood the  correct
    date was 3 November 2005.

395.  The appellant had joined  the  UDPS  in  2003  and  she  came  from  a
    political family.  UDPS meetings were held at  the  family  home  every
    Saturday and as the appellant grew up she started taking  an  interest.
    She married her husband in 2002 and his position was President  of  the
    Makala district branch of the UDPS.  The  appellant  said  her  husband
    visited President Tshisekedi quite often, two or three  times  a  week.
    He was also in contact with Remy Masamba (the Secretary General of  the
    UDPS) and Alexis Mutamba (the National Secretary  of  the  UDPS).   The
    appellant's husband would  see  these  people  quite  often,  sometimes
    meeting at the President's house.

396.  The appellant was first arrested on 30 June 2005  at  a  demonstration
    about  the  elections.   Everyone  was  arrested  on  the  march.   The
    appellant was taken to IPK where  she  remained  for  four  days.   The
    detainees were released after the Presidents  of  the  various  parties
    met.

397.  The second  detention  was  on  3  August  2005.   The  appellant  was
    arrested at her house and taken again to IPK.  She  was  asked  if  she
    knew Franck Kangundu.  The conditions in the cell were very bad and she
    was given no food or medical treatment.  She  was  given  food  in  the
    second jail where she fell ill.  She was raped on several occasions  by
    the Chief of the Prison.  She was beaten up and the food was  not  good
    and the water was dirty and the conditions were deplorable.

398.  She was ill-treated because she was being  questioned  about  Kangundu
    and her husband.  The appellant  denied  knowledge  of  Kangundu.   Her
    husband knew Kangundu well because they were friends.  They would  meet
    at their house or elsewhere.

399.  One day the appellant became ill with a pain  in  her  stomach.   When
    she asked to go to the toilet she collapsed and found  herself  in  the
    Mama Yemo Hospital where she had been a  trainee  nurse  in  2001.   On
    arrival she was in bad shape but was given injections and antibiotics.

400.  She was helped by a nurse, with whom  she  had  worked  as  a  trainee
    nurse.  This nurse was also a UDPS activist.  She  was  Head  of  Care.
    The appellant explained her predicament to her and she said  she  would
    assist the appellant to get out of the hospital.

401.  On the day she  escaped  the  appellant  was  going  to  the  hospital
    laboratory for tests.  In the corridor a group of about  twenty  people
    created a disturbance and the appellant was taken out of  the  hospital
    and she went into hiding outside the capital in Kinsuka for two  and  a
    half months.  She then crossed over to Brazzaville  by  canoe  and  the
    arrangements were made by her younger sister's husband.  She had had no
    contact with other family members at that stage.  She got a  plane  and
    transited to another country and she did not know what country  it  was
    because she remained at the airport.  She then took a plane to the UK.

402.  In the UK the agent who  had  accompanied  her  left.   The  appellant
    telephoned a number she had been given and she spoke to her mother  who
    was surprised because she was not aware of the appellant's whereabouts.
     She had last seen her mother in 2002 when she had  been  arrested  and
    she did not know that she was in the  United  Kingdom.   She  had  been
    given her number by her younger sister who had got it from her mother's
    friend, AN, where her younger siblings were staying.

403.  After her mother's arrest in 2002 she had taken her  younger  siblings
    and stayed with AN but after an argument they left, leaving the younger
    sisters with AN.

404.  The appellant said her husband died on 3 August  2005.   He  had  been
    beaten up when the soldiers raided their house.  She had heard from her
    cell in Makala that he had never been seen again.  In Makala there  was
    one girl - two girls including the appellant.

405.  The appellant denied that she was no more than a low level  member  of
    the UDPS.  She mobilised young mothers and girls so they could join the
    party.  She recruited people.  She said she recruited many  people  but
    was not specific about numbers.

406.  Reference was made to the UDPS cards in the appellant's  bundle.   She
    referred to her own UDPS cards, and said that her  husband's  card  had
    been sent to her younger sister who had taken them to DHL.  There  were
    also her mother's UDPS  card  and  identity  card  as  well  as  arrest
    warrants.

407.  The address on the warrants was  number  3  although  the  appellant's
    address was in fact number 5.  The documents had  nevertheless  reached
    her correct address.  It was plain that the  authorities  had  searched
    her accommodation.

408.  The appellant had two stepchildren who were staying with  her  younger
    sister in Kinshasa.  The appellant's mother and younger  sisters  lived
    together in the UK. Although the appellant lived on her own she was not
    far away and saw them each day.  If she were to be returned to the  DRC
    she would be killed because she had escaped.  The  appellant  confirmed
    that Kangundu had died on 3 November 2005 and said  she  had  recruited
    some twenty to thirty people for the UDPS.

409.   The  appellant  was  cross-examined  and  asked  about   her   family
    circumstances.  She said she had one brother and a sister (NK) born  on
    5 May  1982.   She  had  two  other  sisters  born  in  1987  and  1992
    respectively.  The younger sisters did not have the same mother as  the
    appellant.

410.  The appellant was asked about when the younger  sisters  had  come  to
    the United Kingdom and said she did not  know.   They  had  come  years
    before her.  She had last seen them in the DRC at a party  in  December
    2003.  The appellant was referred to the respondent's bundle at page 32
    and it was suggested that  she  had  given  a  different  account.  The
    appellant said that in referring to the  party  in  December  2003  she
    remembered that it had been in December but  she  did  not  know  which
    year.  It must have  been  December  2002.   The  party  had  been  for
    Christmas and it was after she had left AN's house.  She had left  AN's
    house in 2002 although she did not remember the month.  She had had  no
    contact with her two younger sisters after she had got married.

411.  After her mother's arrest in January or February 2002 she  had  stayed
    with AN but had not stayed long, for perhaps two or three months.   She
    had gone to join her husband and stayed with him and she had  not  seen
    her siblings but she  had  invited  them  to  the  Christmas  party  in
    December 2002.  The appellant was asked why, at her screening interview
    she had said she had last seen her sisters in May 2004.  The  appellant
    said she did not know.

412.  The appellant explained how she  had  obtained  her  mother's  number.
    Her mother had found someone in the United Kingdom  to  make  enquiries
    and she had given her  AN's  number  and  that  person  had  given  the
    mother's number.  She had had no contact with her mother  between  2002
    and 2006.  The appellant's sister had got the number when she had  gone
    to look for her other sisters - when she had got to AN's  she  had  not
    found them but she had been given the number. She did not know  whether
    AN had had the number by 2004.  Her sisters  had  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom between 2004 and 2005.  Although the appellant's  sisters  knew
    where she was they did not come back  or  let  her  know  her  mother's
    telephone number and she had not very much contact with them.

413.  The appellant said she had last seen her  sister,  NK,  when  she  had
    fled to Kinsuka.  She had given someone NK's address  and  someone  had
    told NK where the appellant was.

414.  The appellant was alone in Kinsuka and  UDPS  members  had  found  her
    sister.  She had travelled to Kinsuka in a minibus and the UDPS members
    had not told her their names.  One member had brought her sister to her
    on one occasion and that had been the last time she had seen her.  This
    was roughly a month before she had left the country. The appellant  was
    reminded that at her screening interview she had said she had last seen
    NK on 30 January 2006 somewhere in Kinshasa. The  appellant  said  that
    this was roughly a month after she escaped.  It was pointed out that it
    was the night before she said she had left the DRC.  The appellant said
    she had last seen her the month before she  had  left,  not  the  night
    before she left.  She had escaped from the hospital in November and had
    not seen her  in  December.   She  had  forgotten  the  date.   It  was
    suggested to the appellant that she would remember  seeing  her  sister
    the night before her departure.

415.  The appellant said it had not been  many  days  before  her  departure
    that she had seen her sister and she had seen  her  sister  in  Kinsuka
    rather than Kinshasa.

416.  The appellant was asked about her interview  and  how  it  had  arisen
    that two mistakes about her staying in a  hotel  had  been  made.   The
    appellant said that in Brazzaville she had not stayed  in  a  hotel  as
    recorded.  She had remained at the  airport  and  was  waiting  for  an
    aircraft.  She had gone by canoe to  Brazzaville.   The  interview  had
    been read back to her and the appellant had corrected the reference  to
    the hotel.  She had stayed in a restaurant  at  the  airport.   It  was
    pointed out that the appellant  had  not  corrected  the  reference  to
    seeing her sister in May 2004.  The appellant said she had not known if
    she had met with them in May 2004.

417.  The appellant  agreed  that  she  spoke  Lingala,  French,  a  bit  of
    English, and Swahili.  However, she had  not  known  the  name  of  the
    airport where she had stayed for only a few hours.  She had  stayed  in
    the waiting room.  If there had been announcements on the aircraft  she
    had not heard them and  there  were  no  signs  at  the  airport.   Any
    announcements at the airport had not been heard by  her.   She  had  no
    idea of the country where she was.  When she had got off  the  aircraft
    it was possible they were talking in a language, possibly English,  but
    at that time she did not know any English.

418.  The appellant agreed that she had said that Franck Kangundu  had  been
    killed in August 2005 - the day her house  had  been  raided.   It  was
    pointed out that E1 had said that Kangundu had been killed in  November
    and not in  August  whereas  on  being  questioned  by  Mr  Jacobs  the
    appellant had said November and that a relative had told  her  that  it
    had been in August.  The appellant said that when she had verified  the
    matter she had been told it was November not in August.   She  had  not
    been told the day she was arrested.  She had been  told  when  she  was
    about to leave the country by her sister, NK.

419.   party in his district when she had met him.  When they had first  met
    they had hidden their relationship from her parents.  She had been aged
    between 17 and 19 when she had first met  her  husband  in  about  1996
    although she could not be specific.  He had come to meetings  at  their
    house two or three times a month  from  1996/1997  approximately.   The
    appellant's father was President  of  Yolo  Sud  and  her  husband  was
    President of Makala, a sub-division of the Funa section of the UDPS  in
    Kinshasa.  Her father  had  gone  to  Makala  but,  although  they  are
    neighbouring districts in Kinshasa, it was a little bit far away.  Only
    the Presidents would go from one district to the other.  The  Secretary
    of State had not been able to identify her husband but this was because
    it had been the Yolo district that had been checked.

420.  The appellant denied that she was a low level member.   She  gave  the
    name of a man (Emma) whom she said  was  the  UDPS  secretary  for  the
    Makala district.  She also referred to the name of her husband's deputy
    [PS] but she had no contact details.

421.  The appellant was asked to give details of the structure of  the  UDPS
    in Kinshasa.  The appellant said there were three local branches.   She
    referred to Funa and Mohambu.  Yolo Sud was  a  branch  in  Yolo.   The
    Federation was Yolo which was part of Funa.  Makala was within Yuhuele.
     The appellant's husband  was  responsible  to  the  President  of  the
    Yuhuele Federation.  The President of  Yuhuele  was  called  [A].   The
    appellant was asked whether there could be three  or  more  federations
    and she replied "there could be five to  seven.   In  the  Makala  area
    there was  Ngaba  and  the  environs."  She  did  not  know  any  other
    Presidents apart from [A].

422.  The appellant was asked why she could not explain  the  motto,  emblem
    and slogan of the UDPS at interview.  The appellant said she  had  been
    unable to explain because she was still in shock.   She  was,  however,
    aware of the slogan because she repeated it at all the  meetings.   The
    appellant was reminded that she was being asked about these matters  at
    her main interview in March and not at her screening interview.

423.  The appellant  was  asked  whether  she  had  requested  the  UDPS  to
    organise the release of her mother or find out  what  had  happened  to
    her.  The appellant said that at the time of her  mother's  arrest  she
    did not know that her husband was in regular contact with UDPS  leaders
    because she did not know  everything  about  him.   She  came  to  know
    everything about him only when she lived with him.  The  appellant  was
    reminded that she had said that she had left AN's house and lived  with
    her husband.  The appellant agreed that when she lived with him he  had
    told her.  The appellant said she had attended some UDPS  meetings  and
    asked about her parents but they were never found.  The  appellant  had
    joined the UDPS in 2003 but had found no trace of her parents.

434.  During the course of the appellant's second arrest she was  held  with
    other prisoners but had not spoken to them.  She had not been held in a
    cell on her own.  There had been another girl  there.   However,  after
    two days the girl had been taken away and the appellant remained on her
    own. She had been raped in this prison not the IPK prison and had  been
    taken to hospital from this  prison.   This  was  in  September/October
    2005.  She had had a scar because of an earlier appendicitis  operation
    which had gone wrong in the mid-1990s.

425.  She had not sought medical attention on her arrival in  the  UK  -  it
    had taken some time to arrange.  She secured accommodation in April and
    then was able to make arrangements  to  find  a  doctor.    No  medical
    evidence had been produced.

426.  The arrangements for the appellant's departure from the DRC  had  been
    made by the husband of her younger sister.  The appellant was  reminded
    that at interview she had said that the agent had been arranged through
    the UDPS.  The appellant said that the financial arrangements had  been
    made by her sister's husband and UDPS members had arranged  the  agent.
    The UDPS had not known that the appellant was coming  to  the  UK  only
    that she was coming to a country where she could get protection.  There
    had been one UDPS member called [ER] who had been in contact  with  the
    agent.

427.  The appellant's sisters had come to the  UK  on  their  own  passports
    arranged by the embassy and paid for by her mother.

428.  The appellant was asked why her landlady  kept  the  accommodation  in
    Kinshasa available to the  appellant.   The  appellant  said  this  was
    because the door had been damaged and her belongings were inside and so
    it was not possible for her landlady to rent out the accommodation.  In
    re-examination the appellant was asked about the date her  sisters  had
    come to the United Kingdom.  It was possible, she said,  that  she  had
    last seen NK on 30 January 2006.  She had many problems and it was  the
    first interview she had had.  She was asked why  she  had  not  changed
    various mistakes at the interview and said that sometimes she  had  not
    read it through.  The Home Office interpreter  had  not  been  good  at
    Lingala.  At the fuller asylum interview on 21 March 2007 the appellant
    said she understood the interpreter but some questions  she  could  not
    follow.

429.  She had left AN's house with NK.  She had gone to her husband  and  NK
    had gone to live with her husband.  She had last seen  her  sisters  at
    the Christmas party.  They had not yet known about their mother.   They
    would have told the appellant had they known.

430.  She had last seen  NK  in  Kinsuka  not  many  days  before  she  left
    Kinsuka.   She had arrived in Brazzaville on 1 February 2006 and stayed
    in Brazzaville for some hours. The flight to the other African  country
    had not taken very long.

431.  Some forty to fifty people attended the meetings in her house and  she
    would not describe herself as a high level UDPS member - she  mobilised
    the mothers and the young girls - Counsel referred to his note  of  the
    appellant's earlier evidence "I was not only low level I was mobilising
    the mothers and the young girls."

432.  Miss Giovannetti said there was  a  line  of  enquiry  which  she  had
    omitted and she  asked  the  appellant  some  further  questions.   The
    appellant confirmed she had been raped in her  cell  and  no  one  else
    apart from the Chief of the Prison had been present.  Guards were there
    when the chief had come in.  The chief had raped her  and  asked  about
    Kangundu and if the appellant wanted him to protect her, the  appellant
    should be his wife.  She did not know whether anyone else had seen  the
    rape but she thought the guards might have seen.

433.   The  appellant  was  referred  to  page  12,  paragraph  12,  of  the
    appellant's bundle where she had said  she  had  been  raped  on  three
    occasions and on each occasion she had  been  raped  by  two  men.  The
    appellant then said that the Chief had raped her  first  and  also  the
    guard who came during the night. This was not the guard  who  had  been
    present when the commander had come in but the night  guard.   She  had
    been raped on three occasions, once by the Chief and twice by the night
    guard.   The appellant was asked why she  had  not  said  this  in  her
    statement. The appellant said there had been guards.

434.  In re-examination by Mr Jacobs it was put to the  appellant  that  her
    evidence at the hearing was not exactly the  same.   She  said  it  was
    difficult to talk about, but accepted  that  there  was  an  inaccurate
    account in the statement.  The appellant said that her present  account
    was the accurate one.

435.  The appellant was asked by the Tribunal about details of her  journey.
    She had stayed in a restaurant not at a hotel.   They  had  gone  to  a
    hotel in Brazzaville just to get changed.  They had travelled by  night
    by canoe to get to Brazzaville.  They had not  checked  into  a  hotel.
    The journey from Kinsuka to Kinshasa was not that long  a  journey  and
    could possibly take some one and a half hours.  Kinsuka was on the  way
    to Bas Congo.

The appellant's mother
436.  The appellant's mother gave evidence and confirmed that she  had  been
    granted refugee status following a successful appeal to an  Adjudicator
    (Mrs D Witts) and produced the photographs including photographs of her
    with the President Tshisekedi.  There was  also  a  photograph  of  her
    attending a demonstration at Parliament.

437.  The appellant had been able to make contact with  her  family  in  the
    Congo after her interview when she had got in touch with the  Congolese
    committee.   She had met a woman called VK with whom she had  lived  in
    the same area in the Congo and VK had telephoned her mother to try  and
    find AN.   VK's mother went to see AN and told her that the appellant's
    mother was in London.  The witness learned that only  the  two  younger
    children were with AN and the grown ups had left.  AN  said  that  life
    was quite hard and the witness had agreed to help.  AN  said  that  she
    did not know the whereabouts of the appellant and NK. The younger girls
    did not know where the appellant was.  The younger  children  were  now
    with the witness after the witness had applied for family  reunion  and
    they had arrived on 30  March  2004.  The  witness  described  how  the
    children were not her natural children and their father  had  had  them
    outside of wedlock.

438.  She had next had contact with the  appellant  when  she  had  come  to
    London Airport. She did not know that the appellant was  coming.    She
    asked the appellant how she had got her number and she said that NK had
    given it to her. She was now in contact with NK.  She did not know  the
    appellant's husband - he was someone who had come to party meetings.

439.  The witness said that she was involved in the UDPS  in  the  UK.   She
    had attended two meetings, one when Kabila had been in the UK.  She had
    attended three protests.  She was in the Portsmouth Branch of the  UDPS
    as was the appellant.   They attended meetings once a month in the home
    of one of the members in Portsmouth. She saw the appellant almost every
    week  and  helped  her  as  she  had  back  pain.   She  had  her   own
    accommodation from NASS otherwise they would live together.

440.  In cross-examination the witness was asked about the children and  she
    said she had brought them up as their mother.  They were born  in  1987
    and 1992 and had come to her in 1988/1990 and  1993/1994  respectively.
    Her husband had died in 2001 after Kabila's death  and  that  was  when
    they had problems.

441.  They had been brought up as a close family unit.  She considered  that
    the eldest daughters should have been looking after the young ones  and
    was shocked to learn they had abandoned them.

442.  She had joined the UDPS before her husband and before he had held  the
    position of President of Yolo Sud.  In her own appeal she had described
    his position as Vice Secretary.  The witness said that her husband  had
    not been a secretary.  At first he had been and later on he had  become
    a President.  The appellant came from a UDPS family - the UDPS was like
    a church.  The appellant had already been actively  involved  when  the
    witness had left the DRC.  She had been going to a lot of meetings  and
    special events and had issued invitations  to  those  events.  She  had
    contacted the UDPS in Sheffield.

443.  The witness was asked if she had  requested  the  UDPS  to  trace  her
    family in Kinshasa.  She replied that during that  time  she  had  been
    more interested in the younger children. Miss Giovannetti put it to the
    witness that her blood daughters did not know whether she was alive  or
    dead and she had taken no steps to contact them.  The  witness  replied
    that she had done everything possible.  She had had a lot of  problems.
    She thought she would look for the young ones first and then she  would
    search for the grown ups.  She had waited for a five  year  period  and
    had then got UK citizenship "but with God's  help  the  appellant  came
    herself and so now I am reunited with all of them."

444.  The young daughters had arrived on 30 March 2004.  She  described  how
    the appellant had telephoned from the airport.  She told the  appellant
    to stay where she was and she would telephone a friend to collect  her.
    VK picked her up, took her to the Home Office and then the witness came
    to meet the appellant.

445.  The appellant was not in a good physical condition when  she  arrived.
    The witness said that she had told the appellant they should finish the
    asylum procedure  and  then  she  would  be  given  accommodation.  The
    appellant had had an operation as a young  child.   She  had  tried  to
    register the appellant with a GP but the GP had refused  to  take  her.
    The appellant had arrived on Friday and the witness had taken her  home
    on Sunday 5 February.  She had not taken her to a hospital as  she  had
    not collapsed.  They had a GP at a dispensary.

446.  The witness said she was in contact  with  NK  since  the  appellant's
    arrival.  She had only telephoned the witness after the arrival of  the
    appellant.  They had the telephone number of the witness but they never
    telephoned because they had no money.  It was pointed out that  it  was
    said that NK's husband had financed the journey.  The witness said that
    her husband was not there.  If her husband had been there it would have
    been easy for her to make the call.

447.  The witness  said  in  re-examination  that  the  younger  children's'
    father had died in 2001.   AN had looked  for  the  appellant  and  her
    sister but could not find them.  She would have looked around the local
    area.  NK's husband was in South Africa and had left some food for  his
    wife in the fridge but she could not afford to spend $10 on a telephone
    call.

448.  In questions from the Tribunal the witness  said  that  the  appellant
    had telephoned her from the airport in the morning.  She had given  her
    friend the details about her address and  so  on  and  these  had  been
    written down and given to the appellant for her  to  reproduce  in  the
    interview.  The young children were 14 and 9 respectively in  2001  and
    they had been living with the witness since they were 2.

JK
449.  The next witness to be called was JK, President of  the  UDPS  in  the
    UK.  He produced his letter dated  27  June  2006  and  relied  on  his
    statements dated 18 June 2007  and  26  June  2007.   He  had  got  the
    information from the  Kinshasa  Headquarters  and  had  spoken  to  the
    National Secretary.  He had spoken to the UDPS  National  Secretary  in
    Kinshasa, Alexis Mutamba.  He  had  then  spoken  to  the  UDPS  Branch
    Secretary for Makala - Emma Kuna.  Mr  Kuna  had  got  the  information
    about the appellant  from  persons  who  had  been  arrested  with  the
    appellant. The witness had not asked any more questions.  He  spoke  to
    President Tshisekedi once a month. Remy Masamba was  the  UDPS  General
    Secretary and Maitre Mukendi was a solicitor, the National Adviser.  He
    would not hold information in his role - the membership information was
    held by the National  Secretary.    Alexis  Mutamba  was  the  official
    person who could confirm the details.

450.  In reference to the British  Embassy  letter,  the  witness  said  the
    appropriate person to talk to was Marie  Nzeza  who  was  the  National
    Secretary who dealt with UDPS diplomacy.  The witness did not  know  of
    the other individuals mentioned in the letter.

451.  The witness was asked about the slogan the appellant had  referred  to
    in answer to question 46 at her interview (Progres  Unit�  Amour).  The
    witness said the first two words were  familiar  to  him  and  not  the
    third.  There were various mottos for the UDPS such as "Be  strong  the
    UDPS will win" or "Carry on fighting you will be freed" or  "UDPS  will
    govern".

452.  It was not surprising that the appellant would have  little  knowledge
    because the UDPS were persecuted and did not have  time  to  teach  the
    members properly.

453.  The structure of the UDPS was (from the bottom up) cell,  sub-section,
    section, federation.  In Kinshasa there was formerly one federation but
    it was now divided and there were four - 1. Funa, 2. Tshangu,  3.  Mont
    Amba and 4. Lukanga.

454.  In cross-examination JK said that the initial letter had been  written
    at the request of the appellant who had come to  raise  an  immigration
    issue and she had asked the UDPS to support her case.  He had sent  the
    letter to her solicitor as the UDPS dealt with third parties.   It  was
    pointed out that the initial letter had  been  addressed  to  "whom  it
    might concern" rather than a solicitor.  This contrasted with  a  later
    letter sent directly to the solicitors.

455.  The witness said he had originally spoken to  the  National  Secretary
    Alexis Mutamba and then had spoken to Emma Kuna.   Alexis  Mutamba  did
    not know of the appellant.  As the solicitor had wanted  to  know  more
    that was why he had been permitted to  speak  to  Mr  Emma  Kuna.   The
    appellant had not told the witness about  her  husband's  activities  -
    about giving information at a high level.  As to his being in  personal
    contact with President Tshisekedi, Tshisekedi  received  all  sorts  of
    people - any Congolese could say they were in contact with Tshisekedi.

456.  As far as information from the UDPS in the DRC, the  witness  said  he
    was trying his best.  If possible he would  get  information  from  the
    National President.  With reference to paragraph  8  of  his  statement
    dated 18 August 2007 Emma Kuna had told JK that  the  information  came
    from two ladies but he did not know that included  the  appellant.   It
    was pointed out that the appellant said no ladies were present  and  no
    person could have seen.  JK said that the security forces detained  and
    used sexual methods to dishonour people and maybe it was presumed  that
    she had been raped. He would not like to guess.

457.  He agreed with E1's evidence that  anything  could  be  achieved  with
    money. However, the UDPS was special and run  by  volunteers.   Efforts
    were made to fight against the issuing of false documents purporting to
    have been issued by the UDPS.

458.  Emma  Kuna  was  the  right  person  to  give  information  about  the
    appellant and her husband.  Emma Kuna had told him about two women  who
    knew the  appellant  had  been  raped.   When  asked  whether  all  the
    information had come from  Emma  Kuna  the  witness  said  that  Alexis
    Mutamba had made a lot of enquiries and had used  the  network  to  get
    information.  The official UDPS slogan had never  been  "Progres  Unit�
    Amour".  The official slogan was "Libert� Justice Travaille".  However,
    most members had no good knowledge of this slogan.

459.  In the UK the UDPS had 350 paid up members and another  1,000  members
    in the community. Some 50 to 100 members had  contacted  him  in  2007.
    People who used  the  motto  described  by  the  appellant  would  know
    something about the UDPS.  They could accept the motto.  There were  no
    doubts in the case about the appellant's and her  husband's  honesty  -
    Alexis Mutamba had given Emma Kuna's number and Alexis trusted Emma.

460.  In answer to questions from the Tribunal the witness said that  Kalamu
    and Makala were next to each other.  He thought Kalamu was in Fona  and
    Makala was in  the  Mont  Amba  Federation.   Alexis  Mutamba  was  not
    responsible  for  membership.   The  membership  was  for  the   Branch
    Secretary in charge of the membership.  Much of the  information  would
    have come from the Makala district.

Evidence of E1 Regarding the Appellant's Case
461.  The Tribunal heard from E1 on the parts of  his  report  dealing  with
    the appellant's case.  The issues of  returned  failed  asylum  seekers
    generally were to be dealt with at the adjourned hearing.  E1  referred
    to his report dated 31 May 2006.  The position as  set  out  there  was
    still valid.  Despite small initiatives that  had  no  bearing  on  the
    overall situation of human rights, the current state of the DRC was  as
    lacking in organisation as it had always been.  The composition of  the
    government lacked direction and the Prime Minister was not  capable  of
    executing his task.

462.  E1 spoke about the  Kangundu  affair.   The  newspaper  "La  R�f�rence
    Plus" was one of the better newspapers and distributed  mostly  in  the
    urban areas.  Mr Kangundu had been murdered on 3 November 2005 with his
    wife at home.   E1 referred to his report at pages 80 and  114  of  the
    appellant's bundle.

463.  There had been a  personal  rivalry  between  the  Interior  Minister,
    Mbemba, and the Deputy Secretary General  of  the  People's  Party  for
    Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), Lukiana.  The situation  was  very
    tense in the run-up to the elections in 2005 and  both  parties  needed
    funds but it was not in the interests of either or any party to  reveal
    the state of corruption.  This issue was swept  under  the  carpet  and
    President  Kabila  was  involved  in  the   embezzlement   too.    Some
    journalists published articles on the corruption issues.  Kangundu  was
    collaborating with politicians very close to Kabila and he had obtained
    information about the embezzlement of funds and there was a threat that
    he would publish the information and accordingly he was  killed  before
    he did so.  There was a threat to all journalists implicit in his death
    that they should not publish any more information about embezzlement in
    the presidential party.  The information is set out at page 50  of  the
    consolidated bundle at paragraphs 18.09 and 18.10.   The evidence about
    the affair at page 220 was also correct as at the date  of  publication
    although there had now been a trial of  those  involved  in  Kangundu's
    death.  Although  there  had  been  convictions  one  person  had  been
    convicted in absentia having been  miraculously  liberated  before  the
    trial.  One could deduce that he knew too  much.   There  had  been  no
    mention at the trial of those behind the murder and the whole issue was
    still very sensitive.  In August  2005  the  UDPS  constituted  a  real
    threat to the government because it had mobilised Kinshasa against  the
    postponement of elections and there was a real  fear  the  transitional
    government would break down and any information that  would  have  been
    transmitted  would  have  been  explosive  and  all  involved  in   the
    transmission of information would have  been  very  closely  monitored.
    The appellant's account was plausible.

464.  E1 said that the perception of involvement with  the  Kangundu  affair
    might  constitute  an  element  of  risk  on  return.   Regarding   the
    appellant's escape, the Prison Director would notify an escape  to  the
    judicial authorities to avoid being accused of complicity.  Information
    would be passed to the Prosecutor General  who  would  issue  a  search
    warrant and a list would be kept at the  airport.   Escapees  would  be
    arrested on return and might not leave the country.

465.  If the appellant was perceived to be a threat to a key person  in  the
    regime she would be at risk from the regime.

466.  With reference to the embassy letter in  the  respondent's  bundle  at
    page 3, the appropriate person to ask for  information  would  be  Remy
    Masamba as he was responsible for membership.

467.  E1 was asked about the appellant's husband's name.  The last name  was
    a common name - like Jones.  The middle name was also very typical.  E1
    had no particular knowledge of the other individuals specified  in  the
    letter.

468.  Makala and Kalamu were part  of  Funa  district.   Yolo  was  part  of
    Kalamu.   There  were  four  districts  and  four  federal  Presidents.
    Reference was  made  to  page  3  of  the  respondent's  bundle.    The
    appellant's surname  was a typical Lubu Kasai name.    There  was  Lubu
    Kasai and Lubu Katenga.  The Lubu Kasai were UDPS  while  Lubu  Katenga
    supported  Kabila.   The  Lubu  Kasai  had  no  physically  identifying
    characteristics to identify them as such.

469.  E1 was taken to his comments on the appellant's witness  statement  at
    page 114 of the bundle and confirmed  what  he  said  there.   Politics
    tended to be a family affair.  If a person's father  was  involved  all
    the family would be considered to be sympathisers and  activists.    It
    was suggested to E1 that the appellant's claim that she  mobilised  the
    female members to the party - was that something  daughters  would  do?
    E1 replied "you could not say it was automatic - it was plausible."  It
    was not implausible that the appellant would be kept alone in a cell in
    detention.  He was referred to what he had said about a transfer  to  a
    medical centre being something which could be done without payment "but
    mostly in a situation where the sick prisoner is agonising" - see  page
    115 of the bundle.   That meant when a  person  was  on  the  brink  of
    death.  The only rule was one of arbitrariness.

470.  While rape was common in the DRC that  was  less  so  in  Makala.   In
    Makala it was a question of sexual harassment.  A person was  asked  to
    provide services of a sexual nature.  Rape happened  less  in  ordinary
    prisons and was more prevalent in obscure detention centres.

471.  The risk factors for  the  appellant  were  her  connection  with  the
    Kangundu affair, her  perceived  involvement  with  activists  and  her
    escape which would have been recorded. There was also the  question  of
    the generalised risks facing failed asylum seekers which would be dealt
    with at the adjourned hearing.

472.  E1 was then cross-examined.  On  the  Kangundu  affair,  it  had  been
    considered shocking  nationally  and  internationally.   E1  was  asked
    whether in any of the coverage it had been suggested that the UDPS  had
    been involved.

473.  E1 said that Kangundu's contacts with Mbemba dated back  to  the  UDPS
    period.  He had no current link with the UDPS. There was  a  perception
    that information had been passed  but  no  proof.   Mbemba  could  keep
    personal relationships with UDPS members.  It  could  be  deduced  that
    sensitive information had not been passed to the UDPS because the  UDPS
    would have published it particularly  at  the  sensitive  time  of  the
    events.  Was it plausible, E1 was asked, that Mr Kangundu would provide
    information to the UDPS.  E1 replied that it was certainly risky.  They
    would not have discussed explosive issues otherwise those issues  would
    have been published.  President Tshisekedi would have several  networks
    and Mukendi would have been one network.

474.  E1 could not confirm whether or not the appellant's  father  was  UDPS
    President for Yolo District (see page 114 of the bundle). He had  never
    been asked to undertake the research.  He had  been  asked  to  provide
    details in other cases but not in this case.   He had not been asked to
    check about detainees  following  the  arrest  on  30  June.   It  was,
    however, a matter that could be checked.

475.  E1 was asked whether someone like the appellant would  know  the  four
    federations in Kinshasa.  E1 said that  many  activists  who  were  not
    officials did not have a deep  knowledge  of  the  party's  structures.
    Female members were often kept out of politics as politics was regarded
    as a man's affair.

476.  E1 was referred to questions that had been posed by the  Home  Office.
    E1 said he had never been  instructed  by  the  solicitors  to  do  the
    research.

477.  Mr Jacobs intervened to say that the appellant's  representatives  had
    decided to obtain the material from the UDPS  directly.   The  Tribunal
    asked Mr Jacobs why there had been  no  response  to  the  Home  Office
    letter.  Counsel said that the solicitors had taken the view  that  the
    expert would cover the point generally and that  the  UDPS  could  deal
    with the evidence directly.  The letter from the Home Office read  like
    a cross-examination of the expert.  There  was  no  need  to  do  local
    research when the material was available from the horse's  mouth.   The
    Tribunal asked whether the effect of the evidence so far was  that  the
    horse's mouth was Mr Kuna.   Reference was made to an e-mail  from  the
    solicitors dated 23 June 2006 which strongly suggested that  they  were
    going to  instruct  the  expert  and  an  Immigration  Judge  had  made
    directions that a response from E1 was to be served on all the parties.



478.  Counsel said that the point could be dealt with in submissions.

479.  E1 commented that the report  had  been  compiled  under  pressure  of
    time.  Appearances and impressions were more important than reality.

480.  In answer to questions from the Tribunal,  E1  confirmed  that  Makala
    was a neighbouring commune to  Kalamu.   They  were  both  fully  urban
    areas.  The appellant's husband went to meetings in Kalamu  and  Makala
    and that was plausible.  The President of an area such as Makala  would
    be a person of note and respect.  The appellant's husband's name  would
    probably have been known in other parts of the Federation.  However, in
    the DRC people liked titles and it was not always very clear  what  the
    title covered.  People  might  not  therefore  know.   To  some  extent
    activism might extend their profile at a local level.   As  these  were
    big urban districts it was possible someone  would  not  know  all  the
    officials.  It was possible that ordinary UDPS members did not know the
    Presidents of neighbouring communes.  He would expect Mukendi  to  know
    but his official function was not clear.

481.  Regarding escapes, the question was tied  to  the  importance  of  the
    person who escaped. However, the general rule was one of arbitrariness.



482.  Miss Giovannetti asked whether, if  everything  could  be  settled  by
    money, the UDPS  was  immune?  E1  said  it  was  a  question  of  risk
    assessment.   If a bribe was accepted a person might  be  dismissed  or
    arrested.   It might be a question of asking a higher bribe or refusing
    the request.  This was a general rule.

483.  Counsel asked whether the appellant's escape would be reported and  E1
    said he presumed so.

484.  When the hearing was adjourned until September to deal primarily  with
    evidence going to the risks on return for failed asylum seekers,  among
    the documentary evidence presented to the  Tribunal  at  the  September
    hearing  was  material   relevant   to   the   appellant's   individual
    circumstances. In a letter dated 30 July 2007 to  an  official  at  the
    British Embassy Aka Mantsia wrote on behalf of the National  Presidency
    of the UDPS, that the Makala section of the UDPS had confirmed that the
    appellant's husband had been the President of the  Makala  Section  and
    that the appellant "was also a  member  of  that  section  tasked  with
    mobilising mothers." Mr Mantsia continued that both the  appellant  and
    her husband had been arrested on account of their UDPS  activities,  on
    30 June 2005 (after which they were released) and then again in  August
    2005 at their home. The appellant's husband  had  since  been  reported
    missing while the appellant "was forced  to  leave  the  country."  The
    appellant's husband had worked "on sensitive documents"  as  a  Section
    President. Further details were withheld on grounds of  confidentiality
    or security.

485.  In an undated letter to the  appellant's  representatives  Mr  Mantsia
    said that he had been present at a meeting  between  the  same  British
    Embassy official and President Tshisekedi on  26  July  2007  when  the
    President had been asked whether the names  of  the  appellant  or  her
    husband had mean anything to him. The President answered that the party
    had many members and it would therefore be difficult  to  answer  these
    questions with precision without an enquiry. He never denied  [infirm�]
    knowing the names (the text had originally been translated as "He never
    confirmed knowing the names, but this was said to be  explained  by  an
    interpreter's  mistake).  Mr  Mantsia  had  no  reason  to  doubt   the
    information provided by the Makala branch, and it would be contrary  to
    the ideals of the party to lie  to  the  President.  His  colleague  Mr
    Mukendi could not recall a meeting with the  British  Embassy  official
    although he had given someone the name  of  the  current  President  of
    Yolo.

486.  The British Embassy commented on Mr Aka Mantsia's letter in  a  letter
    to the Treasury Solicitors dated 3 August  2007.  In  addition  to  the
    points raised in the letter the same official  had  not  been  able  to
    obtain confirmation that the appellant's father had been  President  of
    Yolo Sud or other matters pertaining to the  appellant's  parents.  The
    official commented that:

           "I have some reason to doubt the credibility of  these  answers,
           as none of the UDPS members that I or my colleagues spoke to had
           ever heard of these names before now - at which point the Makala
           branch became involved. The members we spoke to (prior  to  this
           point)  have  frequent  dealing   with   many   UDPS   branches,
           particularly in Kinshasa (Makala is a suburb  of  Kinshasa)  and
           would be in an excellent position to know branch Presidents; The
           fact that four middle-ranking and senior interlocutors  did  not
           know these names at all suggests to me that  this  could  be  an
           entirely local initiative."


487.  In an email dated 14 September 2007 the Embassy official gave  further
    details of the enquiries he had undertaken. He stated that at no  point
    was Tshisekedi in the same room with him when he (the Embassy official)
    met Aka Mantsia. Aka Mantsia's letter was inaccurate.

Submissions Relating to the Appellant
488.  We set out here the submissions relevant to the  "subjective"  element
    of the appellant's case. We do this for convenience although we  should
    make it clear that we have set the appellant's evidence in the  context
    of the entirety of the objective  evidence  and  made  our  credibility
    assessment taking into account all the material before us.

489.  Mr Jacobs referred to his skeleton argument. He noted that it was  not
    in  dispute  that  were  the  appellant  to  suffer  imprisonment,  the
    conditions  would  be  such  as  to  infringe  her  Article  3  rights.
    Accordingly, evidence that could have been adduced on that matter  from
    the expert had not been.

490.  It was also not in dispute that the country guideline case of  MM  was
    not challenged by the Secretary of State - it was  still  too  soon  to
    conclude that the UDPS was not perceived as a threat.

491.  Mr Jacobs submitted that the credibility of the  appellant  should  be
    accepted, her bearing and demeanour were to be taken into account.  She
    was nervous and emotional and distressed when recalling  the  traumatic
    details. Where there were any  inconsistencies,  the  low  standard  of
    proof should be borne in mind. Furthermore, giving evidence was  not  a
    memory test and the appellant was a victim of rape  who  had  witnessed
    the murder of her husband. She required hospital treatment.

492.  The paranoia of the Kinshasa government was heightened because of  the
    evidence relating to She  Okitundu  and  there  would  be  an  enhanced
    interest because of the appellant's coming  from  the  United  Kingdom.
    Paranoia was indeed an important element in the appellant's case  which
    centred around Franck Kangundu who had known her husband for some time.
    The expert evidence about Kangundu was endorsed by the Journalistes  en
    Danger Report.

493.  The appellant had given the name and address  of  the  R�f�rence  Plus
    newspaper  at  interview.  The  background   material   supported   the
    appellant's case that she would be of  interest  since,  following  the
    death  of  her  husband,  she  would  be  the  remaining   conduit   of
    compromising information.

494.  If the appellant's account were credible  she  would  be  at  risk  on
    asylum and Article 3 grounds and  her  past  ill  treatment  bore  upon
    future risk (Demirkaya [1999] Imm. A.R. 498).

495.  The Secretary of State had  sought  information  about  the  appellant
    from the wrong UDPS branch. Counsel referred  to  the  British  Embassy
    official's letter of 3 August 2007 and  the  enquiries  made  by  those
    instructing him of Aka Mantsia - we were referred to the  letter  of  6
    September 2007. The point about Tshisekedi not having heard  about  the
    appellant and her husband had been clarified.

496.  The Secretary of State had failed  to  disclose  information  that  he
    obtained. Enquiries had been made of the  wrong  district  and  in  the
    light of the information received had  tried  to  put  forward  adverse
    credibility points which did not stand up. The British Embassy official
    had not been frank  with  the  court  and  instructing  solicitors  had
    reservations about his conduct.

497.  The official in an email expressly  denied  Tshisekedi's  presence  at
    the meeting and the letter that he did  not  disclose  (but  which  the
    solicitors had managed to lodge) made it quite clear that  the  request
    was made of Tshisekedi. The appellant's evidence had been confirmed and
    corroborated by the UDPS leadership and leant  considerable  weight  to
    the appellant's account.

498.  Further support was given by the appellant's  mother's  evidence.  The
    appellant's mother had been found credible by  an  adjudicator  in  her
    asylum appeal and she  confirmed  the  background  of  the  appellant's
    account and the fact that she had been from a politically active family
    where there had been frequent  political  meetings.  The  determination
    confirmed the appellant's father's ill  treatment  and  death  and  the
    mother's relationship to President Tshisekedi.  This  relationship  was
    confirmed by the photographs.

499.  The appellant's mother had been held in detention on her  own  as  had
    the appellant, contrary to the point made by the Secretary of State.

500.  JK had spoken to Emma Kuna and had been able to  establish  the  facts
    through local officials. There were the letters from Aka Mantsia.

501.  E1 in his first report specifically referred to the  appellant's  case
    and confirmed  that  political  allegiance  was  a  family  affair.  He
    confirmed that the situation in the DRC was explosive and  the  country
    was rife with corruption. The prison conditions were appalling and  the
    security service considered themselves to be above the  law.  Rape  was
    prevalent.

502.  The background material (emphasising that the UDPS were  carrying  out
    a show of force in January 2005) set the appellant's arrest in context.
    The UDPS had a significant  chance  of  destabilising  the  government.
    There was evidence about Franck Kangundu.

503.  The appellant would face  risks  on  return  being  viewed  as  having
    brought dishonour on the country. She would be interrogated  about  the
    facts that gave rise to the original asylum claim. If returned as  part
    of a collective return that would give rise to the greatest risk.

504.  The appellant's escape would be recorded and would aggravate the  risk
    on return. It was clear she would suffer ill treatment at the airport.

505.  Miss Giovannetti acknowledged that the giving of evidence was  not  to
    be regarded as a memory test  but  inconsistency  and  vagueness  about
    matters of great personal significance could  properly  be  taken  into
    account. An example was the account of the rape and Mr Jacobs had asked
    the appellant which account was true. Another example was the date when
    she had last seen her younger sisters - was it May  2004  or  Christmas
    2002. There were also inconsistencies about the circumstances in  which
    she  had  last  seen  NK.  The  account  of   her   travels   contained
    implausibilities.

506.  The appellant had not been taken to hospital  in  the  United  Kingdom
    despite her claimed serious illnesses and had just got paracetamol from
    her mother.

507.  She was a  claimed  high  level  UDPS  activist  who  could  not  even
    describe the UDPS logo. In relation to the slogans, JK had said no more
    than that the appellant might say these things.

508.  The Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant  was  a  high
    level activist. It was accepted that the appellant was a low level some
    time member of the UDPS.

509.  In relation  to  the  appellant's  mother's  evidence  there  were  no
    documents to show that the younger sisters  had  been  brought  to  the
    United Kingdom legitimately. This was an important point. The documents
    had been requested since July. Why had  the  alleged  high  level  UDPS
    connections not been used to help to find the family?  There  was  also
    the question of why NK had not telephoned  her  mother  in  the  United
    Kingdom - it was said she  could  not  afford  to  telephone,  yet  her
    husband was said to be wealthy. She had not taken the appellant to  get
    medical treatment and no one had heard of her  father,  claimed  to  be
    President of Yolo Sud.

510.  In relation to the evidence concerning the membership of the UDPS,  E1
    had not been asked to confirm the involvement of the appellant and  her
    husband. Despite regular contact with  Tshisekedi  and  the  giving  of
    explosive information regarding government corruption there was nothing
    direct from senior figures, the information had come from branch level.

511.  It was not disputed that Franck Kangundu had been shot but it was  not
      accepted that the appellant or her husband  had  any  connection  with
      Kangundu.

512.  The evidence of the appellant's rape was said to be confirmed  by  the
      evidence of 2 women witnesses but the appellant had said that the rape
      had not been observed.

513.  Tshisekedi himself had not confirmed knowledge  of  the  appellant  or
      her husband whichever version of the translation was accepted.

514.  The British  Embassy  official  had  denied  speaking  to  Tshisekedi.
      Either he or Aka Mantsia was not telling the truth. The former  was  a
      career diplomat who had confirmed he had not seen Tshisekedi.

515.  Aka Mantsia had been used to keep Tshisekedi  at  a  distance  it  was
      said. It was all very murky. There was no clear explanation.

516.  Mr Jacobs, in reply on the personal aspects of the  appellant's  case,
      submitted that the appellant  may  have  found  matters  difficult  to
      recall but she was a rape victim who had been  traumatised.  Reference
      was made to the IAA Asylum  and  Gender  Guidelines.  There  had  been
      confusion about when she had last seen her sisters and NK.

517.  She had escaped hospital after her treatment had  been  concluded  and
      was therefore no longer in need of medical  treatment  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

518.  Most asylum seekers were unaware of  airport  procedures  and  so  her
      ignorance of such matters should not be held  against  her  (reference
      was made to the case of R (SD & T) v Secretary of  State  [2003]  EWHC
      1941 Admin (per Maurice Kay J).

519.  It was said she was unaware of  mottos  and  slogans  but  Mr  JK  had
    confirmed that different slogans could be used.

520.  The appellant's mother did not know the appellant's husband very  well
    and had made attempts to contact the appellant's through a friend.

521.  E1 had not been  asked  to  confirm  the  story  of  the  appellant  -
    instructing solicitors had gone  straight  to  the  party  itself.  The
    matter had been pursued down to branch level and Aka  Mantsia's  letter
    clarified matters.

522.  The appellant had clarified the question of the witnesses to the  rape
    in re-examination.

523.  While the Embassy official was a career diplomat his precise  position
    at the Embassy was not known (Miss Giovannetti  pointed  out  this  was
    incorrect).

Our assessment: the appellant's case

524.  In considering the evidence before us the Tribunal bears in mind  that
    the appellant was giving evidence under stressful  circumstances.   She
    was also telling us about events that had taken place some time in  the
    past.  We bear in mind that it is not possible for  asylum  seekers  to
    prove every aspect of their case and allowance must be made  for  this.
    We also take into account that some of the evidence related  to  highly
    personal matters and it was important to bear in mind  that  women  can
    have  valid  reasons  for  giving  unclear  evidence  about  rape.   In
    approaching the evidence we bear in mind the observations of the  Court
    of Appeal in Karanakaran v Secretary of State [2000] Imm  AR  p.271  in
    particular pp.293-294 of the judgment of Brooke LJ and we approach  the
    questions in  this  case,  "as  a  unitary  process  of  evaluation  of
    evidential  material  of  many  kinds   and   qualities   against   the
    Convention's criteria of eligibility for asylum." - see  Sedley  LJ  at
    p.305.  As already noted, both parties were agreed that when  assessing
    risks arising out of the appellant's  UDPS  involvement,  the  Tribunal
    case of MM should be treated as the applicable country guidance.

525.  We deal first with the appellant's oral  evidence.   We  found  her  a
    difficult witness.  Her answers were vague and having given the  matter
    careful consideration we did not attribute this vagueness to lapses  of
    memory or stress or similar cause.  We formed the clear impression that
    the appellant was attempting to avoid difficulties  that  more  clarity
    might expose her to.

526.  There are difficulties  with  the  appellant's  account  of  her  past
    experiences in the DRC. Her  account  of  her  husband's  death  lacked
    consistency. In her screening interview  she  last  saw  him  at  their
    house. Elsewhere she said she last saw him in the back of a  jeep  when
    they were taken to the IPK centre.

527.  In our view the accounts she has given about the rapes  have  differed
    very significantly.  In the appellant's statement  of  9  May  2006  at
    paragraph 12 she refers to being raped on three occasions and each time
    by two men.  The first  man  was  the  Commander  of  the  Prison  (the
    "Chief") and the second was an ordinary guard.  It was the  same  guard
    on each of the three occasions.  The appellant did not  give  the  same
    account to us at the  hearing.   Her  attempts  to  reconcile  the  two
    accounts in cross-examination in our view failed completely. There  was
    also the problem about whether she was  on  her  own  or  with  another
    person. At interview  the  appellant  stated  that  she  was  the  only
    prisoner detained in the second detention centre  (in  her  answers  to
    questions 65 to 67 at Annex  E  26  -  page  121  of  the  respondent's
    supplementary bundle number 1). In her statement dated 21 May 2006  the
    appellant said there was a woman in the  cell  initially  and  she  was
    alone once this woman was taken away.  She  blames  the  problem  on  a
    "misunderstanding". We do not accept this. The appellant was attempting
    to deal with a point made in the refusal letter that it was unlikely on
    the objective evidence that she would have been detained alone. In  our
    view she realised she  had  to  adapt  her  account  and  did  so.  The
    discrepancy has not been satisfactorily addressed in our  view.  Making
    every due allowance, we  cannot  accept  the  appellant's  evidence  as
    reliable on these important aspects of her case.

528.  The appellant said she went to AN's house but then left  it  after  an
    argument.  She was very vague about dates and  the  appellant's  mother
    accepted a suggestion from Miss Giovannetti that she was  shocked  when
    she heard that the appellant and her sister  had  abandoned  the  young
    ones.  We are not at all  satisfied  that  we  were  given  a  truthful
    account.  There are difficulties about the  dates  when  the  appellant
    says she last saw her younger sisters. In her screening  interview  she
    said she had last seen them in May 2004, whereas in her evidence before
    us the appellant was sure it was at a Christmas party  in  (after  some
    prevarication) 2002. There is a particular difficulty  about  when  the
    appellant last saw NK.  Was it the night before her departure from  the
    DRC in Kinshasa or was it sometime previously in Kinsuka? The appellant
    struggled to overcome the difficulties faced by the dates.  There  was,
    in our view, a further problem about who had made the arrangements  for
    the agent to assist in the appellant's departure.   The  appellant  was
    recorded as saying in the screening interview in answer  to  the  "What
    was the name of the agent and how  did  you  meet?"  [q.7.18  page  51,
    respondent's bundle] "Name: I don't know. Through my  UDPS  party."  In
    paragraph 21 of her statement dated 22 February 2006 [page  73  of  the
    respondent's bundle] the appellant stated  that  her  sister's  husband
    arranged for her to escape and flee the DRC; "He made contact  with  an
    agent and obtained the finances to pay the agent." In cross examination
    the appellant was asked who arranged the agent and the  appellant  said
    this was the husband of her younger sister and when she was referred to
    her answer at screening interview she said that he had been responsible
    for the finance and the UDPS had  arranged  the  agent.  We  found  the
    appellant's attempts to reconcile her accounts about how  she  had  met
    the agent unpersuasive. We are not satisfied we had heard  a  clear  or
    consistent or reliable version of events.

529.  There are other matters that we felt were  somewhat  problematic:  for
    example. The fact that the appellant's accommodation had not  been  re-
    let and had  been  left  empty  by  her  landlady.  We  also  found  it
    implausible that the appellant's sister had not  got  enough  money  to
    telephone the appellant's  mother.  We  were  not  satisfied  with  the
    appellant's explanation for not using her  husband's  high  level  UDPS
    connections to locate her long-lost mother - she claimed that  she  was
    not aware of the extent of her husband's contacts until she lived  with
    him.

530.  On political matters, the slogan put  forward  by  the  appellant  was
    not, as far as we could divine, the UDPS slogan although the  appellant
    claimed to have chanted it at meetings.   She was not able  to  mention
    very many political names.  This was perhaps  surprising  from  someone
    who claimed to be a mobiliser and whose husband was claimed  to  be  in
    contact with high level members.  On the appellant's  account  she  had
    had large meetings at her house for a number  of  years  on  a  regular
    basis.  Her information about the date of death of Kangundu was  wrong.
    Bearing in mind her claimed experience and active role as a  mobiliser,
    she did not  appear  to  have  sufficiently  accurate  or  satisfactory
    knowledge of the political organisation of the UDPS in  Kinshasa.   For
    example, she thought there  were  5-7   UDPS  federations  in  Kinshasa
    whereas it was common ground that as a matter of fact there  were  only
    4.

531.  We find the appellant's account of  her  departure  from  the  DRC  to
    raise significant difficulties.   On the appellant's account  she  left
    the DRC by canoe arriving in Congo  Brazzaville  where  she  stayed  in
    either a hotel or  a  restaurant.  We  did  not  find  the  appellant's
    explanation for the reference to a hotel compelling. There was also  in
    our view a clear discrepancy about where she had  gone.  She  had  then
    travelled to another country.  She  claimed  she  did  not  know  which
    country it was and there were either no announcements on the  aeroplane
    or signs at the airport or if there were  she  did  not  hear  them  or
    understand them or see them.  She waited for some time at  the  unknown
    airport and did not know where she was.  Again, though we bear in  mind
    the observations of Maurice Kay J in R (SD & T) v  Secretary  of  State
    (cited above), we do not find that the appellant's  professed  lack  of
    awareness of her situation and destination can be explained by  a  lack
    of awareness of airport procedures, reliance on  an  agent  or  similar
    cause identified in paragraph 9 of the judgment in that decision. We do
    not accept that the appellant has told us the truth about her travels.

532.  It has been the appellant's case throughout that she left the DRC  not
    knowing where she was going to.   It  has  been  the  appellant's  case
    throughout that she did not know whether her mother was alive or  dead.
     She did not know that her mother was alive in the United Kingdom.  She
    was not coming to join her mother.  Despite this, she was able to  ring
    her mother on arrival.

533.  The appellant seeks to explain this by saying she was given  a  number
    (not knowing it was her mother's) before her departure from the DRC  by
    her sister.  We regard it as astonishing that the appellant would  have
    made no enquiry about the  number.   We  simply  do  not  believe  this
    evidence. We do not believe either the appellant or  her  mother  about
    the issue of how the mother's number was communicated to the  appellant
    and about the claim that neither knew  about  the  whereabouts  of  the
    other.

534.  Turning to  events  within  the  United  Kingdom,  we  find  both  the
    appellant's and her mother's evidence about medical treatment difficult
    to follow.  We were not satisfied we were being told  the  truth  about
    this.

535.  We take into account that the appellant's mother  was  found  credible
    and  granted  refugee  status  following  a  successful  appeal  to  an
    Adjudicator and we take her evidence  then  as  a  starting-point  when
    assessing her  evidence  in  this  case.  We  remind  ourselves  again,
    however, that we are not bound by findings  of  fact  previously  made,
    where there is new or further evidence which casts a  different  light:
    see Ocampo [2006] EWCA Civ 1276 (and now AA (Somalia) [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    1040). We found the mother's evidence  about  the  two  young  children
    vague and unhelpful.  We are not at all satisfied  that  we  heard  the
    truth about how the appellant was able to give her mother's details  at
    the screening interview. (In addition, despite repeated  requests  from
    us to the appellant's solicitors, which they said they passed  on,  the
    appellant's mother has not been able to adduce  documentation  to  show
    the basis on which her children were  admitted  to  the  UK  and  still
    remain here.)

536.  We note the photographs  of  the  appellant's  mother  with  President
    Tshisekedi but it appears from the evidence of JK that being in contact
    with the President is not  particularly  remarkable  as  the  President
    received all people and anyone could claim to have been in contact with
    him. We also take into account the claimed arrest warrants but we  note
    that the addresses are incorrect and this diminishes  the  weight  that
    can be placed upon them and they need to be looked at in the context of
    the evidence of E1 at pages 103 to 104 of the appellant's bundle (pages
    56-57 of his report of 31 May 2006) that documents are not always  what
    they seem.

537.  So far as the evidence relating  to  the  appellant's  husband's  role
    within the UDPS in Kinshasa is concerned, we remind ourselves first  of
    all  that  prior  to  the  first  hearing  in  July   the   appellant's
    representatives were directed by the Tribunal to instruct  E1  to  make
    specific DRC-based inquiries about this matter. This direction was made
    after  the  appellant  had  expressly  sought  and  been   granted   an
    adjournment for this purpose. This direction was never  complied  with.
    We have set out earlier the procedural history concerning this  matter.
    In  our  view  the  appellant's  representatives  failed   to   explain
    adequately why they never instructed E1  to  make  such  inquiries.  Mr
    Jacobs says it was decided that such inquiries  could  be  more  easily
    made via  the  UK-based  UDPS  witness,  JK,  but  self-evidently  such
    evidence could not be independent. The fact that in  between  July  and
    September the appellant's representatives saw fit to make inquiries  in
    Kinshasa, once again, of  UDPS  themselves,  underlines  the  resulting
    problem, which is that we lack independent corroboration of some of the
    key claims made by the appellant and certain UDPS sources.

538.  JK's evidence about the appellant and her  husband  was  in  our  view
    principally conveyed to him by Emma Kuna  in  the  DRC.  JK  refers  in
    paragraph 8 of his witness statement dated 18 June 2007  to  Emma  Kuna
    stating that the appellant "has been raped, beaten and tortured by  two
    women members of the UDPS who have been in  detention  with  her."  The
    evidence conveyed is not consistent in our view  with  the  appellant's
    evidence about the circumstances when she was raped.  We  have  had  no
    statement from Emma Kuna, although we can see no reason why not. In any
    event he does not profess to have any personal knowledge of the  events
    he recounts and largely accepts what he has been told.

539.  As we have already observed, the appellant's evidence to us about  the
    rape was inconsistent in itself with her own  account.   We  take  into
    account the evidence of Aka Mantsia and the  comments  of  the  British
    Embassy official (X). We do not accept the challenge to the  official's
    integrity in this matter. We reject the suggestion that  he  was  being
    other than frank with the court. In respect of the claimed meeting with
    Aka Mantsia and Tshisekedi  we  prefer  the  evidence  of  the  Embassy
    official. The general tenor of the latter's evidence, which we  accept,
    is that there was  a  lack  of  awareness  of  the  identities  of  the
    appellant and her family at a senior level and such evidence  as  there
    was as a result of a "local initiative."

540.  In evaluating the appellant's evidence we also  of  course  take  into
    account the evidence of E1.   He  is  able  to  place  the  appellant's
    claimed account in its proper context.  The assistance to be given to a
    case such as the appellant's by an expert report is perhaps lessened by
    the evidence that anything can happen in the DRC since the general  and
    prevailing rule was one of arbitrariness.  We note that transfers to  a
    medical centre without payment are mostly done in a situation where the
    sick prisoner is on the point of  death  -  that  was  how  the  expert
    described the word 'agonising' at page 115 of the  appellant's  bundle.
    We note his evidence that politics in the DRC appears to revolve around
    the men of the household and we did not get the impression that E1  was
    altogether endorsing the appellant's case  that  she  mobilised  female
    members to join the party - when he was asked  whether  that  was  what
    daughters would do, he replied to the effect that  one  could  not  say
    that such a thing was automatic - it was plausible.

541.   While  we  take  into  account  the  evidence  of  E1,   he   himself
    acknowledged that his risk assessment was based on the assumption  that
    what the appellant told him was the truth and we do  have  considerable
    misgivings about the story told by the appellant to him. We  take  into
    account that the appellant was able to volunteer part of the address of
    the R�f�rence Plus and of Franck  Kangundu  at  interview  as  well  as
    certain details about the UDPS, but these were matters  in  the  public
    realm and, in any event, they do not dispel  the  general  reservations
    that we have about the appellant's account.

542.  We find it surprising that  the  appellant's  mother  should  be  more
    concerned about  the  young  children  than  her  own  daughters.   She
    concluded her evidence by saying "It was  a  great  surprise  and  good
    fortune that the appellant arrived, so to speak, out of the blue."   We
    simply do not accept this.  We believe that the appellant's arrival  in
    the United Kingdom was planned and organised.

543.  It has been accepted in this case that the appellant's UDPS cards  are
    genuine.  We take into account the points made by Mr Jacobs in his oral
    submissions and his  skeleton  argument.  However,  we  find  that  the
    appellant's activism for the UDPS was at the lowest possible level  and
    that her claim to mobilise women and girls is a gross exaggeration.  We
    find her generally to be an unreliable and evasive  witness.   We  find
    that she and her mother concocted a plan and this reflects adversely on
    the mother's credibility as well.  While we accept that the mother  had
    a determination in her favour, and we take into  account  the  positive
    findings then made, we have  additional  relevant  evidence  concerning
    some aspects of her account  which  were  not  known  to  the  previous
    adjudicator and we do not accept that the evidence that she gave before
    us was credible.   We find that her level of  activism  in  the  United
    Kingdom is of a low order. For the reasons  we  have  given  above,  we
    reject the appellant's claim to have been  arrested,  ill  treated  and
    raped and we do not believe the account given of her claimed escape and
    travels. We do not accept the claimed connection with  Franck  Kangundu
    or that the appellant has any profile whatever. In  short,  we  do  not
    accept the appellant's evidence save in so far as it has been  conceded
    by the respondent.

544.  For  the  above  reasons  we  conclude  that  the  appellant  has  not
    discharged the onus of proof on her to show that she has a well-founded
    fear of persecution or that there are substantial grounds for believing
    that she faces a real risk of serious harm  or  treatment  contrary  to
    Article 3 of the ECHR. The appellant's appeal stands to be dismissed.


545.  Her appeal on asylum grounds is dismissed.

546.  She is not eligible for humanitarian protection.

547.  Her appeal on human rights grounds is dismissed.
