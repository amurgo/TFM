Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr P Saini, counsel (instructed by Hanson Young
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 1  January  1988.  His
    application made on 27 July 2014 for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Immigration  Rules  was  dismissed  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Talbot  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  12
    November 2015.


 2. Judge Talbot was not satisfied that the appellant  had  established  to
    the standard of proof required that he genuinely intended and was  able
    to establish the business described in the business plan,  or  that  he
    genuinely intended to invest and had available  to  him  funds  for  at
    least �50,000 to put into the business.


 3. On 23 May 2016,  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Mandalia  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.  He  noted  that  the  Judge  found  at
    paragraph [14] that he was satisfied that the  appellant  had  actually
    established a company, that the company had entered into some  business
    contracts  and  that  it  was  not  a  mere  sham.  That  was  arguably
    inconsistent with his subsequent finding that  the  appellant  had  not
    established that he genuinely intended and was able  to  establish  the
    business as described in the business plan or to  invest  and  had  the
    funds available.


 4. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Saini, who did not represent him  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, relied on the grounds  seeking  permission  to
    appeal.


 5. The "majority" of the determination is in favour of the  appellant.  At
    paragraph [14] the Judge found, taking into account  all  the  evidence
    lawfully available, that  the  appellant  had  an  impressive  academic
    background, that he gave his answers at interview in  a  fluent  manner
    and that there was no point in the interview where the appellant lacked
    credibility. He was satisfied that the company established  was  not  a
    mere sham.


 6. Mr Saini submitted that it appeared that the appeal failed on the basis
    that the Judge reached a view that the business profits did  not  match
    that which had been projected previously in  the  appellant's  business
    plan.


 7. He contended that the Judge had regard to paragraph 245DD (h) regarding
    the viability and credibility of the claimed source of the  appellant's
    funds and his business plan. However, the summary of the  Judge's  task
    "did not sit well with the construction of the Rules  in  question  and
    the overarching purpose they pursue."


 8. In essence, he submitted that the Judge had already found at [14]  that
    the appellant met the requirements in  paragraph  245DD(h)(i)(2)  given
    that he has established a business  and  has  entered  into  contracts.
    However,  at  [16]  the  Judge  referred  to  an  apparent  significant
    discrepancy between the projections made in the business plan  and  the
    actual performance of the business in its first year.


 9. Mr Saini  submitted  that  that  approach  had  no  place  within  'the
    overarching  purpose  of  the  Rule'  that  is  aimed  at  rooting  out
    businesses which are not genuine. The Rule requires an assessment as to
    whether the application is genuine, evident from the use  of  the  word
    "genuinely" throughout the paragraph.


10. Having made the positive findings that  the  appellant  has  started  a
    genuine business which is not a sham  and  which  is  trading,  it  was
    "perverse" that  he  then  found  against  the  appellant  because  his
    business profits do not meet his business plan's expectations.


11. He submitted therefore that the Judge misunderstood and misapplied  the
    Rules, given that they do not require one to have a  business  that  is
    "viable" in terms of any profit  making  level  or  ability,  but  only
    whether the business is genuine or not. The Rules are not a  benevolent
    safeguard against genuine  entrepreneurs  making  bad  investments  and
    falling into losses. They are to safeguard against those  who  seek  to
    portray themselves as entrepreneurs when they are not and actually mean
    to perform another activity - paragraph 245DD(h)(iv), which requires an
    assessment that the applicant does not intend to take employment in the
    UK other than under the terms of paragraph 245DE.


12. He also  submitted  (ground  2)  that  there  was  a  factually  flawed
    assessment of the funds available against the  genuine  nature  of  the
    business contrary to the Immigration Rules. At [16] the Judge  observed
    that the funds available to the appellant from his father  in  Pakistan
    have remained in Pakistan. He observed that expenses have been incurred
    but no funds have been transferred from Pakistan,  which  was  held  to
    cast a serious doubt as to whether  the  funds  in  that  account  were
    actually available for his business use as claimed.


13. The Judge had however found that the business was not a sham  and  that
    expenses had been incurred and contracts entered into. It was not clear
    whether the Judge's "statement" at [16] represented a finding  of  fact
    or merely an observation. If this was a  finding,  there  was  then  an
    insufficiency of reasoning.


14. Moreover, the statement/finding referring to "serious doubt"  does  not
    establish a finding to the appropriate civil  standard.  All  that  the
    Judge should take  into  consideration  that  the  appellant's  genuine
    business is a profit making one. Accordingly, the  consequent  decision
    whether to transfer funds or not is clearly a business decision. It  is
    not a decision which bears upon the genuine  nature  of  the  business,
    particularly where the Judge acknowledged that there have been  set  up
    costs, that  these  have  been  paid  for  and  that  the  business  is
    nonetheless making a profit, albeit less than that predicted.


15. There was an additional  ground  relied  on  relating  to  the  alleged
    failure to put matters to the appellant concerning the compliance  with
    the terms of the contract.


16. On behalf  of  the  respondent,  Mr  Melvin  adopted  the  respondent's
    response under Rule 24. The Judge directed  himself  appropriately.  He
    correctly found that the appellant must satisfy  the  requirement  that
    the business was genuinely established and/or  that  the  money  relied
    upon was  to  be  genuinely  invested.  A  number  of  factors  in  the
    assessment as to whether the business was genuine had to be taken  into
    account.


17. Paragraph 245DD(h)(i)(2) has only one element that the  appellant  must
    satisfy. He also had to satisfy the requirements in 245DD(h)(ii)-(iv).


18. Accordingly, even though the Judge may have viewed the business not  to
    be  a  mere  sham  which  would  satisfy  paragraph  245DD(h)(i)2,  the
    appellant would still have to satisfy the  Judge  with  regard  to  the
    remaining sub-paragraphs as noted at [15] of the determination.


19. The finding made in relation to the finances was open to the Judge  and
    did not amount to a contradiction. He came to a "holistic  conclusion."
    Even though he was satisfied that the business was being run, the Judge
    was still entitled to find that  the  appellant  had  no  intention  of
    investing the �50,000. Mr Melvin relied on the decision  in  Ahmed  and
    Another (PBS - admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365.


20. In reply, Mr Saini submitted that the 'criticism' of the  appellant  on
    the basis that his actual profits did not meet the level he anticipated
    in his projected profits has no place within the overarching purpose of
    the Rule.


21. The assessment undertaken by the Judge may be relevant in  the  context
    of  an  application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as   a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant. That may be an appropriate occasion  to  assess
    the viability of the business.  All that needs to be satisfied  in  the
    initial application however is that the funds are available in order to
    ascertain whether the business they propose to run is genuine.


22. Mr Saini also submitted that the appellant  had  relied  on  Article  8
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  He  had  specifically  raised  grounds
    relating to his integration into British life, culture and society. The
    appellant had contended that the decision was contrary to his right  to
    private life as he had established  himself  in  the  UK  and  had  put
    considerable time and effort to starting his business in the UK.


23. He accordingly submitted that in the event of the  decision  being  set
    aside, it should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  decision
    to be made under the Rules as well as on Article 8 grounds.


    Assessment


24. The First-tier Judge stated that given the start up expenses  that  the
    appellant referred to, it was evident that he would have  made  a  very
    considerable loss in his first year and that his sales  figures  are  a
    fraction of what  was  projected  in  the  business  plan.  Whilst  the
    business performance does not always mirror past  business  projections
    the discrepancy here does cast some doubt on  the  credibility  of  the
    business plan in the first place.


25. I accept Mr Saini's submission that the Rules do not require  that  the
    applicant in the appellant's position has a business that is viable  in
    terms of its profit making  level  or  ability  but  only  requires  an
    assessment to gauge whether the business is genuine or not. The purpose
    of the Rules is not to guard against genuine entrepreneurs  making  bad
    investments and falling into losses. The assessment relates to  persons
    who hold themselves out as entrepreneurs and who do not  actually  mean
    to perform another activity in contravention of paragraph 245DD(h)(iv).




26. If an applicant has  made  a  successful  application  in  the  initial
    application for leave to remain, this will result  in  a  grant  for  a
    period of two years for leave  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.
    However, in order to qualify for indefinite leave  to  remain  in  that
    category, as referred to in paragraph 38 of Appendix  A,  the  relevant
    requirements which have to be satisfied include the award of points  as
    shown in Table 6 of Appendix A.


27. In refusing his application the respondent issued a  one  stop  warning
    under section 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.
    The appellant raised a claim under Article 8 as a ground of  appeal  in
    his statement of additional grounds. Mr Saini in his grounds of  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal raised a further ground of  appeal,  namely  that
    the Article 8 claim which had been raised had not  been  determined  by
    the Judge.  The failure to consider that claim amounted to an error  of
    law.


28. I accordingly  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved the making of errors on a point of law. I accordingly  set  it
    aside. The decision will have to be re-made. In  deciding  whether  the
    case should be remitted to the First-tier, I  have  had  regard  to  Mr
    Saini's submission that the Tribunal did not  consider  the  Article  8
    claim of the appellant which was raised before the First-tier Tribunal.




29. Having regard to the Senior President's Practice statement on remitting
    an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, I am satisfied that the extent of
    judicial fact finding necessary for a decision to be  re-made  will  be
    fairly extensive. I find that it would be just and fair  to  remit  the
    case, particularly as the appellant has not had his Article 8  (Private
    Life) appeal considered.


    Notice of Decision


    Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, the appeal is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (Taylor House) for a fresh decision
    to be made by another Judge.


    No anonymity direction is made.
