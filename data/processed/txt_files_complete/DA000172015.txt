                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Bhuiyan, Londonium Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to make a deportation order against him under Section 35A  and  Section
    5(1) of the 1971 Act.

 2. It is agreed between the parties that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in
    law at paragraphs 46 - 47 and 60 of the First-tier Tribunal decision in
    relation to the application of the jurisprudence of the European  Court
    of Human Rights as to the degree of offending and  the  length  of  the
    appellant's stay in the United Kingdom. .

 3. The respondent does not dispute that there is such an error of law  and
    it is agreed that I should set aside the decision as not in  accordance
    with the law and allow the appeal to the extent  that  the  appellant's
    application remains before the respondent for a lawful decision in  due
    course.

 4. There is an anonymity order made because the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    in his decision named the appellant's child.   That  is  not  a  public
    decision and I have not named the  child  in  this  decision.   It  was
    agreed at the hearing that  the  anonymity  order  should  be  revoked,
    subject to any written application which might be made by the appellant
    within the period of 14 days from the date of hearing  on  10  November
    2015. The anonymity order is hereby revoked.

 5. I therefore propose that the anonymity order be revoked after  14  days
    from the date of hearing subject to any written application  which  may
    be made on behalf of appellant during that period.

 6. The appellant is presently on bail.  The bail number is  TY18144.   The
    respondent is content for bail to continue  on  the  same  terms.   The
    appellant wishes to  seek  a  variation  of  the  bail  order,  but  no
    application has been made for such a variation.  The relevant  evidence
    is not available today.  That will be a matter which the appellant will
    have to deal with separately on another occasion. I continue bail to an
    Immigration Officer since these proceedings are now at an end.

Conclusions
The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal and remake it by allowing the appeal to the  extent  that  the
appellant's  application  remains  before  the  respondent  for   a   lawful
decision.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I do not continue that order pursuant to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and  the  anonymity  order  is  hereby
vacated.
