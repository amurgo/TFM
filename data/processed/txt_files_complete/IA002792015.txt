Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Welsh, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission  a  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M A Hall promulgated on 27th April 2015  dismissing  his
    appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse him leave
    to remain as a partner, and to remove him from the United Kingdom.

 2. The grounds assert a material error of law in the judge's consideration
    of the Immigration Rules and of Article 8.

 3. In the context of the Immigration Rules the complaint is that  although
    the refusal as at the date  of  decision  was  correct,  the  Appellant
    having no qualifying relationship because he was  not  married  to  his
    partner, and there was no two years' cohabitation, by the date  of  the
    judge's assessment the couple had married.  The grounds  continue  that
    had the judge conducted a proper assessment of the partner rules  under
    Appendix FM the Appellant would have met the requirements of the  Rules
    because a detailed examination of the  financial  evidence  would  have
    revealed that all the requirements of the Rules would  have  been  met,
    including the financial requirements as the Appellant and his wife were
    both working  and  had  a  joint  income  which  exceeded  the  �18,600
    threshold.

 4. In the alternative the grounds  contend  that  the  judge's  assessment
    under Article 8 ECHR was flawed because as the  only  issue  under  the
    Immigration Rules was the satisfaction of the relationship  requirement
    this was a case which benefited from the Chikwamba principle  and  that
    the Appellant's British  wife  could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to
    relocate to India given  that  she  is  British  born,  not  of  Indian
    ethnicity, unable  to  speak  the  language  and  unfamiliar  with  the
    culture.

My Consideration and Findings

Immigration Rules grounds

 5. The application was made when the Appellant had leave to remain in  the
    United  Kingdom  as  a  student  and  so  the  relevant  date  for  the
    satisfaction of the Immigration Rules in the appeal before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal was the date of hearing.   In  that  regard  the  parties
    obtained the benefit  or  detriment  of  any  change  in  circumstances
    relevant to  the  disputed  issues,  including  the  fact  of  marriage
    resulting in the Appellant beign able to show that as at  the  date  of
    hearing he met that part of the rule.The Respondent's refusal  decision
    was predicated on the  nature  of  the  relationship.   The  Respondent
    failed to assess the  financial  requirements.   The  approach  of  the
    Respondent ran the risk that in the event, as here, that the reason for
    refusal initially relied upon fell away, the Respondent's assessment of
    the financial requirements was not available  to  the  judge  from  the
    reasons for refusal letter. The Appellant  could  have  approached  the
    Respondent  in  connection  with  the  application  so  as  to  provide
    additional evidence. He did not. Absent any concession that  the  other
    parts of the rule were met he retains the obligation  of  demonstrating
    at the hearing that his evidence relating to those parts was sufficient
    to meet the requirements.

 6. In this case that meant that the Appellant needed to show  that  as  at
    the date of application he and his partner had a joint income in excess
    of �18,600 and that they had provided the  specified  evidence  of  the
    same to  the  Respondent  with  the  application.   In  the  event  the
    representative on the day, who did not  draft  the  grounds  of  appeal
    before me, conceded that the requirements of the Rules were not met and
    so there was no effort to demonstrate that the specified  evidence  had
    accompanied the application.

 7. Theses grounds' treatment of that position is flawed.   Given  that  it
    was  not  asserted  that  the  relevant  specified  evidence  had  been
    provided, the judge's failure to make any finding as to whether or  not
    it had, cannot give rise to any material error of law.

 8. Further, the bare assertion made in these grounds  that  the  Appellant
    and his partner had a joint income in excess of �18,600 falls far short
    of establishing the requirement of the Rules in terms of the  specified
    evidence. The requirements go to demonstrate that the couple have had a
    consistent and  stable  position;  hence  the  requirement  is  over  a
    specific length of time.

 9. Further, any suggestion (and it only remains a speculative  suggestion)
    that they could have met the specified evidence requirements,  does not
    give rise to a Robinson  obvious  point  that  the  judge  should  have
    investigated  or  called  evidence  about  in  order  to  decide.   The
    entitlement to remain based on  satisfaction  of  the  rules  is  self-
    evidently a Rules-based entitlement as opposed to Convention-based. The
    Robinson principle is limited to Convention issues.

10. The judge could have been invited to ascertain whether the  application
    of EX.1 excused any failure of the financial requirements of the Rules,
    including those regarding  specified  evidence.   However  he  was  not
    invited to do that.  In any event the test in EX.1 is whether there are
    insurmountable obstacles  to  the  Sponsor  relocating  to  India.   As
    defined in EX.2 that means very significant difficulties in  continuing
    family life in India, which could not be overcome or would entail  very
    serious hardship.

11. The judge considers the position of relocation of the Appellant and his
    spouse at paragraph 42 in the context of Article 8.

         "If the Sponsor decided to relocate to India, this  may  cause  her
         some hardship because it would mean living in  a  country  that  is
         completely unfamiliar, and being separated from her own family  and
         leaving her employment.  I do not however find that  this  hardship
         would mean that the Appellant's removal would be  disproportionate.
         It does not reach the threshold referred to in VW (Uganda)."

12. It is quite clear from that finding that the judge did not accept  that
    the evidence revealed insurmountable obstacles  of  the  character  and
    quality required in the Rules, so that in any event the  same  test  is
    answered negatively in the decision elsewhere.

13. In short, the grounds arguing error on the basis of  the  Appellant  in
    fact satisfying the immigration rules are not  made  out.  It  was  not
    argued, or evidenced, that  the  Appellant  could  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules, or that the position was excused through the
    application of EX.1.  The judge did not consider it.   It  was  not  an
    omission amenable to the Robinson principle being a Rules  rather  than
    Convention-based entitlement,  but  in  any  event  given  the  judge's
    consideration of the substantive test in the context of proportionality
    it is not an omission that is capable of establishing material error.



Article 8 ECHR outside of the rules

14. Turning to the Article 8  consideration  the  grounds  assert  material
    error in the context of Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002.

      i) Section 117(3): the  issue  of  whether  or  not  an  Appellant  is
         financially independent is not determined by the specified evidence
         and it is apparent that the judge has discounted  the  evidence  of
         the Appellant's own income.

     ii) Section 117(4):  the assessment of the weight to be  given  to  the
         Appellant's family life, because the family life is established  at
         a time when the Appellant is here lawfully, albeit in  the  context
         of a precarious leave to remain, should not have been determined by
         the insurmountable obstacles test and the judge should instead have
         been looking at Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40. which reveals that
         requiring the Appellant to go to India to make an  application  for
         entry clearance would be a procedural requirement because the Rules
         were in substance now met.  Before me Mr Welsh developed the  point
         to the contrary position: because  the  financial  out  of  country
         Rules were  more  arduous  than  the  in-country  position  because
         potential earnings of the Appellant could not be  used  to  satisfy
         the maintenance requirements, to the point that if he had to return
         to India to make an application  for  entry  clearance  on  current
         circumstances it would be refused.

15. This is not a case, as in Chikwamba, of someone being required to leave
    the United Kingdom purely for a procedural reason of making an  out  of
    country application which it was acknowledged was bound to succeed,  or
    where such a merely procedural requirement  was  a  grave  interference
    with family life taking into account the best interest of children.   R
    (On the application  of  Chen)  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00189  (IAC)
    points out that the Appellant would need to be able to show that  entry
    clearance from  abroad  would  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be
    significant interference with family life by temporary removal so  that
    the weight to be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining  entry
    clearance is reduced. The grounds  are  misconceived  in  relying  upon
    Chikwamba in the context of this case.

16.  The  grounds  fail  to  appreciate  the  evaluative  nature   of   the
    proportionality assessment. Nothing argued  here  can  be  said  to  be
    determinative in the appellant's favour so as to show the  decision  to
    be perverse, in particular the fact of financial independence as at the
    date of hearing, or the inability to meet the out of country  financial
    requirements. The rules provide the opportunity of making an in country
    application and the Appellant did not bring himself within them.    The
    judge was entitled to find that  that  position  ran  contrary  to  the
    public interest and to give it significant weight.   The  finding  that
    the spouse could relocate was a finding which was open to the judge  to
    make.  The burden is on the Appellant.  In this case the Appellant fell
    short in his application and the judge found that family life could  be
    continued in India, so that the proportionality  balance  fell  against
    the Appellant.  The judge was entitled to that conclusion.

17. The grounds reveal no material error of law.

Decision

18. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal on Immigration Rules and Article 8 grounds stands.

19. No anonymity direction is made.
