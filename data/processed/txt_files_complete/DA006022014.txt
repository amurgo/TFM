Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H Rackstraw Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the claimant:      Ms E Mendoza, Counsel instructed by Brar & Co


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and to
      avoid confusion I refer to her throughout as  "the  claimant"  or  the
      "Secretary of State"

   2. The Respondent is a citizen of Angola who was born  on  the  30  March
      1992.



Immigration history

   3. He has a vague immigration history and the exact date of his  entrance
      to the United Kingdom is not known.   He  says  that  he  entered  the
      United Kingdom in order to join his father.  His  step-mother  entered
      the United Kingdom on the 14 August 2000 and his father claims to have
      entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on the 5 February 2001 and so
      it is likely that he came  into  the  United  Kingdom  at  some  stage
      between August 2000 and February 2001.

   4. The Respondent's father and step-mother claimed asylum  in  their  own
      right, but the Respondent was not included as a  dependant  on  either
      claim.  He was however listed as  a  dependent  on  his  step-mother's
      application for Indefinite Leave to Remain dated 5  August  2008.   He
      was advised on the 19 September 2011, that he  was  not  eligible  for
      leave to remain in line with his step-mother, because  he  was  not  a
      dependant on her original  asylum  claim  and  he  was  not  therefore
      granted Exceptional Leave to Remain in line with her.

The Respondent's Criminal Activities

   5. On the 11 October 2010, the Respondent was convicted at Newcastle upon
      Tyne  District  Magistrates  Court  of  using  threatening,   abusive,
      insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or  provocation
      of violence and sentence  to  six  weeks  imprisonment  suspended  for
      twelve months.  He was also convicted of  assault  occasioning  actual
      bodily harm, for which he was sentenced to twenty  weeks  imprisonment
      suspended for twelve months and ordered to pay costs of  �40  and  �50
      compensation.

   6. This sentence was subsequently varied at  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  Crown
      Court on the 21 June 2013, when the  Respondent's  original  suspended
      sentence was imposed and he was sentenced to twenty  weeks  concurrent
      imprisonment.  On that day the Respondent was convicted  at  Newcastle
      upon Tyne Crown Court of affray which offence had  been  committed  on
      the 26 June 2011.  He was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment.

   7. The Respondent applied for leave to remain under  Family  and  Private
      Life Ten Year Rule on the 26 June 2013, and on the 30  July  2013,  he
      was served with notice of liability for deportation.  He  completed  a
      questionnaire and representations were  made  on  his  behalf  to  the
      Secretary of State.  It was decided that automatic deportation applied
      in the Respondent's case and on the 19 March 2014,  the  Secretary  of
      State signed  a  Deportation  Order.   The  Respondent  appealed  this
      decision to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal was heard at  North
      Shields on the 14 July 2014, by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gordon.

The First Tier Tribunal's decision

   8. At paragraph six of the determination the judge noted that the  appeal
      had been advanced on the basis that the Respondent was entitled to the
      benefit of the exception in Section 33(4) of the 2007 UK Borders  Act.
      This was because it was asserted that the deportation would breach his
      Article 8  rights.   The  judge  refers  to  Kabia  (MF:  para  398  -
      "exceptional circumstances")  2013  UKUT  00569  (IAC),  dealing  with
      paragraph 398 and noted that the new Immigration Rules, in respect  of
      claims advanced by foreign criminals seeking  to  resist  deportation,
      are a complete code and the exceptional circumstances be considered as
      the balancing exercise involves the application of  a  proportionality
      test as required by Strasbourg Jurisprudence.

   9. Having allowed the Respondent's appeal and concluded  that  Article  8
      Family and Private Life require that  the  Respondent  should  not  be
      deported, she said in paragraph 29 "I consider  that  the  Immigration
      Rules particularly Paragraph 276ADE(6) is  applicable."   She  allowed
      the appeal.

  10. The claimant challenged the determination and on the  11  August  2014
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission to the Secretary  of
      State and in doing so said this:

     "2  The grounds of appeal raise a number of points  that  amount  to  a
           complaint that the judge made a very generous balancing exercise
           in the [Respondent's] favour under Article 8 and failed to  give
           proper reasons as to why the [Respondent's]  circumstances  were
           exceptional.  There is a paucity of  reasoning  in  the  judge's
           determination which makes evident that the [claimant's]  grounds
           of  appeal  are  arguable.   The  judge  has  acknowledged   the
           [Respondent's] criminal offending was serious but  concluded  at
           paragraph 24 that the [Respondent's] deportation was "likely  to
           be a punishment to the [Respondent] rather  than  protection  of
           the interests of the British society." At paragraph 29 the judge
           said she did not consider that it was "necessary in a democratic
           society for the [Respondent] to be returned to Angola."

     3   The grounds of  appeal  argue  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by
           allowing the [Respondent's] appeal under Paragraph 276ADE.   The
           [claimant] submits that Paragraph 276ADE had not application  to
           the [Respondent's] case as this was a deportation  appeal.   The
           issue before the judge was not whether  the  [Respondent]  could
           meet the requirements of Paragraph 276ADE  but  whether  he  had
           established an exception to deportation under Section 33 of  the
           UK Borders Act 2007.  Given the  paucity  of  reasoning  in  the
           judge's determination it is not clear what  approach  the  judge
           has taken so all the grounds of appeal are arguable."

  11. Before me today Ms Rackstraw on behalf of the claimant relied  on  the
      lengthy grounds.  She pointed out that the grounds make it clear  that
      the judge has erred in two main respects.  Firstly, by considering the
      appeal under Paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules,  where  that
      paragraph is not at all relevant to deportation appeals  and  secondly
      in failing to recognise that the Respondent needs to demonstrate  that
      his circumstances are something above and  beyond  that  in  Paragraph
      399A or 399B to succeed under exceptional circumstances.

  12. The claimant maintained that the judge had simply failed  to  identify
      what it was that made the Respondent's circumstances exceptional.  She
      has failed also to undertake the balancing exercise and did not  weigh
      the balance of the public interest against that of the Respondent.

  13. Ms Mendoza pointed out that at paragraph 6 of her  determination,  the
      judge certainly alludes to Paragraph 398 and 399 and,  she  submitted,
      it must have been in the judge's mind that Paragraph 398 and 399  were
      relevant when she made her decision.  Counsel suggested that the judge
      adopted the right approach to the Respondent's credibility and applied
      the guidance set out in  Masih  (Deportation:  Public  Interest  Basic
      Principles) Pakistan [2012] UK UT 00046.

  14. At  paragraph  21  of  her  determination,  the  Judge  considers  the
      background to the offences and at paragraph 23 she  demonstrates  that
      she has taken  into  account  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks.   She
      properly considered the situation  as  it  was  at  the  date  of  the
      hearing.   Counsel  drew  my  attention  to  paragraph   16   of   the
      determination, which states that the Respondent has made a good  start
      to his licence, attending appointments offered and  presents  as  very
      motivated to engage in  offence  focus  work,  sentence  planning  and
      complying with conditions of licence.  This is  taken  from  a  report
      entitled "A Request for Offender Management Information on  a  Foreign
      National Prisoner" dated 20 February 2014.

  15. The judge also had  regard  to  the  Resolve  Post  Programme  report,
      paragraph 17 and to the psychological assessment carried out by  Barry
      Fowler on the 12 May 2014. That report concludes that it was not  seen
      that the Respondent's continued presence in the United  Kingdom  would
      be a detriment to British society.

  16. The judge makes her own assessment  as  to  the  risk  the  Respondent
      presents to the public in the absence of an OASYS report, but  in  the
      light of the psychologist's report and also  the  Offender  Management
      Information and a Post Programme Report (at paragraph  24)  the  judge
      concludes that deportation is  likely  to  be  a  punishment  for  the
      Respondent rather than the protection  of  the  interests  of  British
      society.  She comments that while the  punishment  of  the  Respondent
      with its consequent deterrence of others may be a perfectly legitimate
      aim of the policy behind automatic deportation it is  required  to  be
      balanced against the Respondent's individual interests  in  not  being
      deported, namely his rights pursuant to Article 8.

  17. The judge undertook a balancing exercise, Counsel submitted, and found
      exceptional circumstances at paragraphs 25,  26,  27  and  28  of  the
      determination.  At paragraph 25 the judge noted  that  the  Respondent
      had not been to Angola since his early childhood,  did  not  know  the
      language, knows no one there except  his  father  who  was  aggressive
      towards him. The Respondent has lived in the United Kingdom during his
      formative years, has siblings here  who  are  British  subjects,  been
      educated in the United Kingdom, speaks English  and  has  achieved  UK
      qualifications.  He knows nothing but  the  United  Kingdom  since  he
      arrived here at the age of 5. He has a partner here who is the  mother
      of his child and lives with her parents.

  18.  I  have  concluded  that  the  judge  did  materially  err   in   her
      determination.   He  determination  is  slightly  confused.  Paragraph
      276ADE(vi) had  no  application  in  this  appeal  since  this  was  a
      deportation appeal.

  19. Whilst the judge does refer to Kabia and to MF Nigeria at paragraph  6
      of the determination, she does not demonstrate that she has taken into
      account the requirements of Paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A.  Neither has
      she has undertaken  any  proper  assessment  of  the  risk  which  the
      Respondent poses  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  has  not,  therefore,
      undertaken a proper proportionality balancing exercise.

  20. The judge refers to the post programme report. This  is  Resolve  Post
      Programme report which actually says on the front page "Resolve  is  a
      moderate intensity cognitive behavioural  intervention  that  aims  to
      reduce violence in medium to high  risk  adult  male  offenders."  [My
      emphasis].  It should have been apparent to her on reading this,  that
      at some stage the Respondent has  been  assessed  as  being  either  a
      medium, or a high risk offender.

  21.  The  judge  does  refer  to  the  request  for  Offender   Management
      Information but, section 2  of  it  makes  it  clear  that  the  OASYS
      assessment completed on the 18 November 2013,  assessed  the  risk  of
      serious harm as being medium and those who are at risk are the general
      public.  The report says:

                       "A risk of physical harm should a  disagreement  turn
                  violent.  There is also a risk of emotional harm at  being
                  the victim of a physical assault and the impact  this  has
                  when having to deal with a  confrontational  situation  or
                  dealing with a difference of opinion under  the  influence
                  of alcohol and/or when looking to defend friends at a time
                  of perceived conflict."

  22. When considering the report  of  Mr  Fowler,  the  judge  should  have
      considered the OASYS assessment and considered whether Mr  Fowler  had
      taken it into account  in  his  report.   Her  failure  to  adequately
      consider the evidence before her meant that she was not in a  position
      to undertake a proper proportionality balancing exercise  and  I  have
      concluded that the judge's determination cannot stand. I set it aside.
       None of her findings shall stand.

  23. The matter will be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard
      afresh by a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Gordon.   There
      will be I believe six oral witnesses and it is suggested that  a  time
      estimate of at least four hours be allowed for this appeal.  There  is
      no need for an interpreter.

      I DIRECT that if it  is  available  or  can  be  obtained  from  those
      previously representing the Appellant,  the  OASYS  report  should  be
      filed with the First Tier Tribunal and served on the respondent by the
      Appellant, but in the absence  of  the  OASYS  report  the  First-tier
      Tribunal will of course consider the other documents to which  I  have
      referred.
