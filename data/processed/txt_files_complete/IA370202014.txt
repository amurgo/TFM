                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge A Devlin promulgated on 8 January 2015  which  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against a refusal of  leave  to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a United Kingdom citizen on all grounds.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 11 June 1987 and is a national of India.

 4. The Appellant first entered the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 student on 1
    August 2009 with leave  valid  until  22  November  2010.  He  made  an
    application to extend that leave which was granted until 15 March 2012.
    The Appellant then applied for a Tier 1 Post Study work visa which  was
    granted on 28 February 2012 until 28 February 2014.

 5. On 23 December 2013 the Appellant applied for leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Shahin Akhtar Husan Bhai  Shaikh  ('the
    sponsor'). The Appellant was notified that his application fell  to  be
    refused because he did not meet the financial requirements of  Appendix
    FM and the related evidential requirements  under  FM-SE.  However  the
    decision was put on hold pending the outcome of the case of MM.

 6. On 3 September 2014 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

      a) The Appellant's application was refused because he did not meet the
         income requirements of Appendix FM or the  evidential  requirements
         of FM-SE.

      b) The Appellant claims gross earnings of �24,174.28 from two  sources
         Fashion Bazaar and United Forecourt. The  bank  statements  do  not
         reflect the claimed income and the deposits made do  not  meet  the
         income threshold.

      c) There are no circumstances that warrant a grant  of  leave  outside
         the Rules.

The Judge's Decision

 7. The Appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In  essence  the
    Appellant stated that although he may not have fulfilled  the  finacial
    requirements at the date of application, he would be able to  meet  the
    requirement at the date of the appeal and therefore his  appeal  should
    be allowed.

 8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Devlin ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision. The Judge found :

      a) The Appellant did not meet the requirements of A1(2)(c) of Appendix
         FM-SE since he did not produce bank statements showing payments  of
         salary corresponding to the payslips for the six month period prior
         to his application. He did  not  accept  the  submission  that  the
         evidential requirements permitted any other construction.

      b) In relation to Article 8 outside the Rules he considered the annual
         tax summary which showed a taxable income  of  �20,434.23  and  the
         Appellant's submission that the underlying purpose of the financial
         requirements was met  and  therefore  it  was  disproportionate  to
         refuse the application for leave.

      c) The judge considered the practical  considerations  underlying  the
         evidential requirements. And found that they  justified  insistence
         that those requirements were met.

      d) He considered the submission that he should ignore  the  fact  that
         the Appellant could  make  another  application  from  outside  the
         United Kingdom but found it was not disproportionate to expect  him
         to do so.

 9. Grounds of appeal were lodged which argued :

      a) The Judge failed to take into account s 85(4)  of  the  Nationality
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

      b) The Judge failed to take into  account  the  evidence  in  the  tax
         document  that  showed  that  the  Appellant  met   the   financial
         requirements of the Rules.

      c) The Article 8 assessment was flawed failing to  take  into  account
         that the Appellant was well established in the United  Kingdom  and
         his wife would be unable to relocate to India.

      d) The Judge failed to take into account s  117b  of  the  Nationality
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

10. On 20 February 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne  gave  permission
    to appeal.

11. At the hearing I heard submissions from  Ms  Faryl  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that:

      a) The Appellant had evidence in the form of bank statements  to  show
         that the threshold of �18,600 was met at the time of the decision.

      b) In the alternative of the Appellant could not  meet  the  mandatory
         documentary  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  s  85(4)   of   the
         Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  takes  precedence  and
         the fact that he was bale to produce bank statements  and  payslips
         for the 6 months after the date of the decision  should  have  been
         accepted to show that he met the requirements of the Rules for  the
         6 months before the date of decision.

      c)  The Judge did not consider s 117 B of the Nationality  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002.

12. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Harrison submitted that :

    (a)    The  Appellant  did  not  produce  the  specified  evidence  and
         therefore it was open to the Judge to conclude that he did not meet
         the requirements of the Rules.

    (b)    It was nonsense to suggest that evidence for a six month  period
         after the date of hearing could be used to  meet  the  requirements
         for the six months prior to the decision.





Finding on Material Error

13. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

14. This was an application for leave to remain as the spouse of  a  United
    Kingdom citizen in which  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  provide  the
    evidence required by Appendix FM-SE in the form  of  salary  slips  and
    matching deposits into a bank account for the 6 month period  prior  to
    the date of decision because for most  of  that  period  payments  were
    largely in cash and not deposited into the bank.

15. I am satisfied that the Judge was required to find in  accordance  with
    Paragraph A1 of FM-SE   that  the  evidential  requirements  these  are
    mandatory requirements: the Appellant was unable to produce 6 months of
    bank statements which reflected 6 months payslips as required in A2  of
    FM-SE (c) .

16. In relation to section 85(4) I do not accept  that  the  interpretation
    advanced by Ms Faryl has any merit and  would  not  have  entitled  any
    different decision to have been made. The fact is before the  Judge  it
    was accepted that the Appellant could not  produce  payslips  and  bank
    statements reflecting those payments for the 6 month  period  prior  to
    the application .An in-country appellant does not  succeed  by  showing
    that he meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date  of
    the hearing.  He can succeed only by showing that the application  that
    he made would be successful at the date of the hearing. A decision on a
    matter under the Immigration  Rules  is  a  decision  on  the  detailed
    eligibility  of  an  individual  by   reference   to   the   particular
    requirements of the Rule in question in the context of the  application
    that that person has made. It is thus not open to an appellant to argue
    simply that, on the date of the hearing, he meets the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  He can  succeed  only  if  he  shows  that  the
    decision that was made was one which was not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  Section 85(4) allows him to show that by  reference
    to evidence of matters postdating the decision itself. In this case the
    Appellant did not produce the mandatorily required evidence before  the
    Judge and he was entitled to conclude that they could not succeed.

17. The Judge I accept did not consider section  117B  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  when  setting  out  what  is  a  very
    detailed consideration of Article 8 at paragraphs 37-62. However I have
    considered what was said by the Tribunal in Dube (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]
    UKUT 00090 (IAC) that  is not an error of  law  to  fail  to  refer  to
    ss.117A-117D considerations if the judge has applied the test he or she
    was  supposed  to  apply  according  to  its  terms;  what  matters  is
    substance, not form.

18. I have therefore considered whether in  determining  the  matter  under
    Article 8 the Judge took into account all of the  factors  set  out  in
    s117 in determining the public interest. The Judge I am satisfied  took
    all of the factors into account: the  public  interest  in  immigration
    control is taken into account in paragraph 52 (s117B1); The  fact  that
    the Appellant spoke English was part of the factual background  of  the
    case as he was a student (s117B 2);  the  Judge  accepted  the  taxable
    income of �20,432.23 which was above the minimum  income  threshold  at
    paragraph 38( s117 B3); the Judge took into account that the  Appellant
    had come to the United Kingdom as a  student  with  no  expectation  of
    remaining save in so far as he could meet the requirements of  Appendix
    FM and FM-SE in paragraph 60(s 117B 4).

19. I am therefore satisfied that in determining whether the  decision  was
    proportionate the Judge took into account all of the  relevant  factors
    and the weight he gave to them was a matter for  him.  I  am  satisfied
    that the findings he made in relation to the personal circumstances  of
    the Appellant and his sponsor at paragraphs 58- 61 were open to him  on
    the evidence before him.

CONCLUSION

20. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

21. The appeal is dismissed.

22. No anonymity direction is made.
