                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge   Sweet   sitting   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 7 July 2015) allowing to  a  limited  extent  the
    claimant's appeal against what the judge characterised as the  decision
    of the Secretary  of  State  dated  11  November  2014  to  refuse  his
    application for leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 2 Migrant,  and  to
    issue a  Section  151A  notice  to   a  person  liable  to  removal  in
    accordance with Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that the claimant requires anonymity for these proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background

 2. The claimant is an Indian national, whose date of birth is  16  October
    1981.  In June 2013 he applied for  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    visa, relying on  a  TOEIC  certificate  as  evidence  of  his  English
    language ability.  Before he had received a  decision  on  his  Tier  1
    application, on 6 June 2014 he sought to vary his application for leave
    to  remain,  by  converting  his  Tier  1  application  to  a  Tier   2
    application.  In support of his Tier 2 application, he did not resubmit
    his TOEIC certificate, but relied instead on his MBA degree certificate
    from Staffordshire University as  evidence  that  he  met  the  English
    language  requirement.   Later  in  the  same  month  the  Home  Office
    acknowledged receipt of his Tier 2 application.

 3. On 26 November 2014 Stephen Timms MP wrote to the Home  Office  on  the
    claimant's behalf to enquire about the progress of the application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.

 4. By letter dated 8 December 2014, Mrs Sajeev, assistant director in  the
    Customer  Services  Operations  Division,  responded  to  Mr  Timms  as
    follows:

         Our records show that Mr Jahubar Ali applied for  LTR  on  6  June.
         His application was considered and refused on 11 November.   Please
         find attached the refusal letter for your information.

         Mr Jahubar Ali has a right of appeal against the decision.  We have
         no record of any outstanding applications for Mr Jahubar Ali.

 5. Mrs Sajeev did not include a refusal letter  dated  11  November.   She
    enclosed instead an undated and unsigned IS15A notice addressed to  the
    claimant.  The notice contained a specific statement of  reasons.   The
    claimant was considered a person who sought  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom by deception.  For the purposes of the application dated
    13 July 2013, he had submitted a  TOEIC  certificate  from  Educational
    Testing Service to the Home Office in order for  them  to  provide  him
    with leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  ETS had a  record  of
    his speaking test.  ETS had undertaken a check  of  his  test  and  had
    confirmed to the Secretary of State that there was significant evidence
    to conclude that the certificate was fraudulently obtained by  the  use
    of a proxy test taker.  His scores from the test taken on 24 April 2012
    at the London School of Scholars had now been cancelled by ETS.  On the
    basis of information provided to her by ETS, the Secretary of State was
    satisfied  there  was  substantial  evidence  to  conclude   that   his
    certificate was fraudulently obtained.

 6. The notice went on to state that the claimant was  therefore  a  person
    who was liable to be detained pending a decision whether or not to give
    removal directions and, where relevant, his removal in pursuant of such
    directions.



The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. In the grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  claimant's
    solicitors said that the Home Office had yet to serve the claimant with
    a Refusal Letter giving reasons or a notice  of  immigration  decision.
    The claimant had only become aware of the refusal of his application as
    a result of what was communicated to his MP.  His solicitors  contended
    that the refusal was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   The  IS15A
    "refusal" wrongly referred to the Tier 1 application, when the relevant
    application was the Tier 2 application made on 6 June 2014.  He had not
    submitted a TOEIC certificate with the Tier 2 application.

 8. Before Judge Sweet, there was only an appearance by Ms Joshi on  behalf
    of the claimant.  She submitted the burden of proof  was  on  the  Home
    Office to prove any fraudulent conduct pursuant to the  case  of  Gazi.
    The Home Office had not provided a document  examination  report  or  a
    document verification report.  No decision had been made on either  the
    Tier 1 or Tier 2 application.  The claimant had not  obtained  a  false
    TOEIC, but now intended to make a fresh application as he had  been  in
    the UK for ten years.  He had not yet received a rebate for his fee for
    the first application, nor had his passport been returned to him by the
    Home Office.  His mother was ill with a cancer, and there should  be  a
    finding that there had been no fraud by him.

 9. The judge's findings were set out in paragraphs  [9]  to  [11]  of  his
    subsequent determination, which I reproduce verbatim below.

         9.   The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the civil standard
         of the balance of probabilities applies.  The Appellant appears  to
         have made two applications to the Home Office which are relevant to
         this appeal.  He had been in the UK as a Tier 4 student since  June
         2005, with valid leave (as extended) to 22nd June 2013.

         10.  On 22nd June 2013 he made a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application,
         which the Respondent says was dated 13th July 2013.  In support  of
         that application he provided his business plan, a  venture  capital
         document and a  TOEIC  certificate.   It  is  in  respect  of  that
         application that the Respondent claims that the  TOEIC  certificate
         (following a test  taken  on  24th  April  2012)  was  fraudulently
         obtained.   In  fact  the  Appellant  had  converted  his  Tier   1
         application to a Tier 2 application on 6th June 2014,  but  he  has
         not received the refusal decision.  A letter from the Respondent to
         his MP of 8th December 2014 (at page 43 in the  bundle)  refers  to
         that application being refused  on  11th  November  2014,  but  the
         refusal letter has not been received, nor was it  attached  to  the
         letter  to  the  MP.   The  Appellant  has  submitted   two   TOEIC
         certificates, but I am satisfied that there is no evidence from the
         Respondent in the form of a DER or DVR showing that the certificate
         (or either certificate) was false.  The burden of proof is  on  the
         Respondent to provide this evidence, pursuant to Gazi, and  he  has
         not done so.  In order to seek leave  to  remain  in  the  UK,  the
         Appellant did not use a TOEIC certificate, but his  Masters  degree
         and his employer's sponsorship letter.

         11.  For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the  appeal  should
         be allowed to the extent that the  Respondent  should  provide  the
         refusal letter of 11th November 2014  in  respect  of  the  Tier  2
         application  made  on  6th  June  2014.   The   Respondent   should
         reconsider his decision  in  light  of  the  documents  which  were
         submitted with that application,  namely  the  Appellant's  Masters
         degree  and  employer's  sponsorship  letter,  and  make  a   fresh
         decision.  That decision should not be made on the basis of a TOEIC
         certificate which was not submitted with the  Tier  2  application.
         If the decision is not in the  Appellant's  favour,  he  should  be
         allowed to make a fresh appeal or to withdraw both his applications
         and make a  fresh  application,  without  any  regard  to  previous
         alleged fraud.  The Respondent should also consider his  Article  8
         ECHR claim.   It  would  also  refund  the  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
         application fee of ï¿½1,051 and return his passport.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

10. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal,  arguing  that
    the judge had materially erred in finding that the First-tier  Tribunal
    had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  The claimant did not  receive  an
    appealable immigration decision.  His IS15A notice only referred to the
    claimant's liability to removal, and did not constitute  an  appealable
    immigration  decision  under  Section   82(1)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

11. The Home Office's reply to the MP's  enquiry  erroneously  mentioned  a
    refusal decision of 11 November 2014 when no such decision had in  fact
    been served on that date.  Even if it had been, the refusal  would  not
    have been appealable because the Tier 1 application of 13 July 2013 was
    out of time, and  therefore  a  decision  on  it,  (or  on  the  varied
    application under Tier 2) would not have been an immigration  decision.
    The claimant's previous Tier 4 leave expired on 22 June 2013.  Although
    the 13 July 2013 application was cited in the IS15A notice, as that was
    when the TOEIC certificate from ETS was  submitted,  it  could  not  be
    construed as a decision on that application.

12. Accordingly, any findings  on  the  exercise  of  deception  were  both
    premature and inappropriate.  The  Tribunal  had  no  power  to  direct
    matters such as a refusal letter for a non-appealable decision, or  the
    refund of an application fee when the application had been varied.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

13. On 16 November 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford  granted  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is  arguable  that  the  IS15A  notice  was  not  an  appealable
         immigration decision and the Secretary of State is yet to serve  an
         appealable decision on the [claimant].  The duty judge  listed  the
         matter  for  hearing  on  the  preliminary  issue  of  whether  the
         [claimant] had an in-country right of appeal but Judge  Sweet  does
         not appear to have engaged with this issue.

         It is arguable that Judge Sweet did not have jurisdiction to direct
         matters set out at paragraph 11 of his decision.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

14. Although not cited to me, I have taken account of R (On the application
    of Sheraz Mehmood and Shahbaz Ali) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 744 in which the Court of  Appeal  addressed
    two questions which have a bearing on this appeal.  The first  question
    is whether a person whose leave to be in the United  Kingdom  has  been
    invalidated by the Secretary of State, who has also made a decision  to
    remove that person at a time when an application by that person  for  a
    variation of his leave is pending, has the right to an in-country right
    of appeal: "the Section 10 question".  The answer is no,  unless  there
    is a separate and earlier decision to refuse to vary the person's leave
    to remain, giving that person an in-country right of appeal against the
    refusal to vary leave to remain. In the case of Mr Ali, this introduced
    a second question,  "the sequencing question", which the Court posed at
    paragraph [7]:

         Does the sequence of the notices of decision invalidating his leave
         and the decision refusing his application for a  variation  of  his
         leave mean that his right is to an in-country appeal  whatever  the
         answer to the first question?  Is the relevant date the date on the
         decision letter when it was assumed it was made, or is it the  date
         on which notice in writing of the decision was given to Mr Ali?

15. Mr Ali was refused leave to remain on the grounds that  he  cheated  in
    his English language test.  In Mr Ali's case, a Deputy  Judge  rejected
    the submission that the decision refusing to vary his leave  was  taken
    before the Section 10 removal decision.  She recognised that  the  date
    on the refusal letter could  give  the  impression  it  was  the  first
    decision in time but she found it was  also  intended  that  a  removal
    decision would be served  first  and  immediately  before  the  refusal
    decision.  She found the notice of the removal  decision  was  in  fact
    served on Mr Ali first, as was the intention, and  the  refusal  letter
    was served on him afterwards.

16. The Court of Appeal  upheld  the  Deputy  Judge.   At  paragraph  [42],
    Beatson LJ said that the fact that internally the  Secretary  of  State
    may have decided to refuse Mr  Ali's  application  to  vary  his  leave
    before making a decision to remove him was  legally  irrelevant.   What
    was legally relevant was the date and time of the service of notice  in
    writing to the person  affected.   Until  then  there  was  legally  no
    decision.

17. In contrast to the facts of Mr Ali's  case,  in  this  case  there  has
    neither been service of an immigration  decision  nor  has  there  been
    service of a Section 10 removal notice.

18. It was part of the claimant's case before the First-tier Tribunal  that
    he had not been served with  an  immigration  decision  in  respect  of
    either his Tier 1 application or his Tier 2 application.  It  was,  and
    is, thus common ground between the parties that the IS15A  notice  does
    not constitute an appealable immigration decision under  Section  82(1)
    of the 2002 Act.  As there has been  no  decision  on  the  appellant's
    application for leave to remain as a Tier  2  Migrant,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear  an  appeal.  There  was  no
    legally no decision against which the  claimant  could  pursue  an  in-
    country appeal.

19. Although the Home Office stated in a letter to the MP that the claimant
    had a right of appeal, this "concession" was legally erroneous.   While
    the First-tier Tribunal should in the ordinary course of events  accept
    a factual concession by the Home Office, it cannot accept a  concession
    which is legally incorrect.

20. The claimant has not been  served  with  a  valid  Section  10  removal
    notice, so he is effectively in legal limbo.  There is no  remedy  that
    the Tribunal can provide  for  this  situation  in  the  context  of  a
    statutory appeal.  It would be wholly inappropriate for me to issue any
    directions  to  the  Secretary  of  State  either  in  respect  of  the
    outstanding Tier 2 application, or in respect of an  inchoate  decision
    to issue a Section 10 removal notice on the grounds  of  deception.   I
    can  only  observe  that  the  current  state  of  affairs  is   highly
    unsatisfactory, and it needs to be addressed as a  matter  of  urgency.
    Mr Nath agreed with Ms Joshi that this should be done, and he undertook
    to use his best endeavours to ensure that the Home Office followed  due
    process and  complied  with  the  necessary  formalities  so  that  the
    claimant will know in the near future where he stands legally.

21. In written submissions Ms Joshi sought a wasted costs order against the
    Secretary of State. But while the Home Office was  wrong  to  encourage
    the claimant in the belief that he had a right of appeal, the  claimant
    was wrong to bring an appeal in circumstances where his legal  advisers
    knew that there was not an appealable immigration decision. So  it  has
    not been unreasonable for the Secretary of State to defend  the  appeal
    on the grounds of want of jurisdiction,  and  the  claimant  must  look
    elsewhere for financial compensation.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law,  and  so
the decision is set aside and the following  decision  is  substituted:  the
