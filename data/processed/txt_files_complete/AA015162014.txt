For the appellant:     Mr P Thornhill, of Thornhills Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry, date  of  birth  8.6.74,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge De Haney, who dismissed on all grounds  his  appeal  against  the
    decision  of  the  respondent  to  refuse  his   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    7.5.14.

 3. Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 1.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge De Haney should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. It is claimed that the appellant became the vice-president  of
    the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in 2010 and was involved in organising
    meeting, sorting out voter lists and basic problems. He also claims  to
    have organised demonstrations. In May  2010  the  appellant's  brother,
    also a PPP member, was kidnapped by the Pakistan Muslim  League  Narwaz
    (PMLN)  and  died  on  26.5.10  from  injuries  sustained  during   his
    detention. The matter was pursued by complaint to the police, resulting
    in the arrest and  prosecution  of  two  men,  Aslam  and  Parvez.  The
    criminal proceedings concluded in April 2013 when they  were  sentenced
    to 7 years imprisonment.

 7. It is the appellant's account  that  during  the  criminal  proceedings
    lasting some 3 years, from about February 2011  he  was  threatened  by
    PMLN members to drop the case.  These  threats  were  reported  to  the
    police. On 30.5.13 the appellant was attacked and beaten in his car and
    abducted.  He  was  further  beaten  and  tortured  sustaining  serious
    injuries until he was left outside the hospital on  4.6.13.  He  claims
    that he knew his attackers and that they were members of the  PMLN.  On
    discharge  from  hospital  on  10.6.13  the  appellant   relocated   to
    Islamabad, hiring a nurse and gunman for protection whilst remaining in
    hiding. When he switched his mobile phone on a month later he began  to
    receive anonymous threats to kill him and harm his wife  and  children.
    He reported the matter to the police on  27.7.13  but  they  said  they
    couldn't help him as he had no evidence. He decided to flee to  the  UK
    for the safety of himself and his family,  arriving  in  Manchester  on
    4.8.13. He cannot return to Pakistan because he fears he would  face  a
    real risk of unlawful killing and torture and  serious  and  individual
    threat to his life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence.

 8. In the refusal decision of 12.2.14, the Secretary of State rejected the
    claim that his brother was kidnapped and killed by PMLN members or that
    any prosecution of those involved took place. The  claim  that  he  was
    himself kidnapped and subsequently threatened was  also  rejected.  The
    Secretary of State concluded  that  the  appellant  would  be  able  to
    relocate within Pakistan and that he would be able to obtain protection
    of the authorities within the Horvath standard.

 9. At �45 of the decision, Judge De Haney accepted that it  was  at  least
    reasonably likely that the appellant's brother was killed in the manner
    alleged. At �46  the  judge  was  also  prepared  to  accept  that  the
    appellant was reasonably likely to have been abducted and  detained  as
    claimed. However, at �47 the judge concluded  that  the  appellant  was
    released "due to a combination of pressure from the police to whom  his
    wife had reported his disappearance, and by the  other  market  traders
    and powerful bodies." The judge rejected at �48 that the appellant  was
    in continual  fear  from  opposition  members  or  that  he  needed  to
    immediately flee Pakistan, or even to go into hiding.

10. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  submit
    that the judge must have accepted  that  the  appellant  suffered  ill-
    treatment whilst detained but did not accept any ongoing  risk  to  the
    appellant after his release, with reliance being placed, by the  judge,
    on a report, which it is submitted was not  material  to  the  time  in
    question. It is further submitted that the judge  has  failed  to  have
    sufficient regard to evidence pointed to a greater risk  of  arrest  to
    political opponents of the government. It is further submitted that the
    judge erred in failing to accept that the appellant was able to  remain
    in Pakistan to pursue the prosecution of those who killed  his  brother
    because at that time the party which  the  appellant  supports  was  in
    power. Finally, it is submitted that the judge failed properly to apply
    guidance in relation to internal relocation.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Zucker  pointed  out  that  the
    judge found the appellant an unimpressive witness (see  �42).  However,
    the judge accepted that the appellant's  brother  was  killed  and  the
    appellant was abducted as claimed. "It is arguable that the judge ought
    not to have allowed himself to  have  been  influenced  by  the  school
    reports if the appellant was  detained  and  then  released  after  the
    school year had been completed so that the report related to an earlier
    time.

12. "It is also arguable that the judge attached too  much  weight  to  the
    appellant remaining in Pakistan to pursue his  brother's  killer  given
    the change of government was  some  time  later.  All  grounds  may  be
    argued."

13. The Rule 24 response submits that it was clear that the  appellant  was
    able to survive 3 years in Pakistan during court  proceedings  and  was
    neither murdered by his brother's attackers or  their  associates,  nor
    targeted for being a political activist.

14. The Secretary of State also counterclaims that the positive credibility
    findings at  �45  and  �46  are  inadequately  reasoned.  Certainly  no
    reasoning is provided within those paragraphs and it  is  not  entirely
    clear from the  decision  why  the  judge  reached  those  conclusions.
    However, in the light of my conclusion as to the appellant's grounds of
    appeal, these errors were not material  to  the  decision  and  do  not
    require the decision to be set aside and remade on that ground.

15. �2 of the grounds suggests that because the judge accepted part of  the
    appellant's case relating to his brother's death and his own abduction,
    that the judge must also have accepted  that  he  was  tortured  during
    detention,  given  the  medical   evidence   which   was   capable   of
    corroborating his version of events.

16. The Rule 24 response submits that the judge provided good  reasons  for
    concluding that the appellant did not demonstrate a real risk on return
    to his home area. That the judge accepted some parts of the appellant's
    case does not indicate  that  other  parts  were  accepted  and  it  is
    speculation to suggest so. The appellant was found  to  be  an  evasive
    witness who failed to give his evidence in a straightforward manner and
    was very prone to exaggeration. In the circumstances, only those  parts
    specifically accepted  by  the  judge  can  be  regarded  as  accepted.
    However, it may be concluded from the judge's statement at �46 that the
    appellant was reasonably likely to have been "abducted and detained  as
    claimed," that this included the account of mistreatment in  detention.
    This is perhaps supported by �54, where the judge accepted that "whilst
    I accept that what the  appellant  claims  happened  to  him  may  have
    happened it is also clear that he believed there was a  sufficiency  of
    protection..."

17. The grounds seek to rely on this issue in �3 of the grounds to complain
    that whilst the appellant  had  suffered  serious  injury  whilst  held
    captive by his political enemies, the judge was not prepared to  accept
    that he was in fear of his political  opponents  after  discharge  from
    hospital or that he needed to seek international  protection.  However,
    there is nothing inconsistent in these findings, and it was open to the
    judge to  accept  certain  parts  of  the  appellant's  case  and  give
    substantial reasons for not accepting that the  appellant  was  in  any
    real fear from opposition political members or that he needed to  flee.
    In essence, this ground of appeal is argumentative and seeks to reargue
    the negative findings of the judge  which  were  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence and for which cogent reasons were given. In essence, the judge
    found that the appellant's behaviour post-release undermined the  claim
    to be in fear or need international protection,  or  need  to  go  into
    hiding. It is also clear that at �44 the judge  found  the  appellant's
    repeated evasions and failure to satisfactorily answer why he should be
    targeted after the conclusion of the prosecution when he had  not  been
    so targeted during the three preceding years. I find that the judge has
    made clear findings on this  issue  which  were  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence and justified by cogent reasons.

18.  Another  ground  of  appeal  criticism  is  that  in  reaching   these
    conclusions the judge relied on school records  of  an  almost  perfect
    attendance. The judge also relied on the fact that  the  appellant  was
    able to remain in Pakistan in order to finance selling his business and
    transferring funds to enable him to set up in business in the UK. At �3
    the grounds suggest that as the appellant was abducted in May 2013  and
    was not discharged from hospital until June 2013 the attendance  record
    could  not  conceivably  relate  to  the  time  of  his  abduction  and
    detention, and thus unfairness has resulted from this error.

19. I do not accept that there is any material error in relying in part  on
    the school report. The school record shows that it covers the  2012  to
    2013 academic year. It allows of only two terms, first and  second.  In
    each term the child's record is almost A+ in all subjects. It is  clear
    that the report is for the end of year VI and notes that the  child  is
    promoted to class VII. The personal comments of the headmistress  speak
    of the child in the past tense and wished her luck. Whilst  attendances
    are only noted for 82 of the 83 days in the first term and there is  no
    entry for attendance in the second term, it is clear from the marks for
    the  second  term  that  the  child  must  have  been   present.   More
    significantly, no reference is made to any absences by either of  those
    making personal comments about her progress. I find it follows from the
    above that whatever may or may not have happened to the appellant,  his
    child was able to continue at school,  progressing  very  well  in  all
    subjects,  with  no  difficulties.  This   entirely   contradicts   the
    appellant's claim that his  children  were  taken  out  of  school  and
    undermines the appellant's factual claim and the need to flee Pakistan.
    In the circumstances, I find no error in the judge's treatment  of  the
    school record.

20. �4 of the grounds of appeal suggest that in reaching his conclusion  on
    sufficiency of protection, the judge overlooked the  changed  political
    scene in Pakistan following the 11.5.13 elections, when  PMLN  won  the
    election, ousting the PPP of which the appellant was member. At �44 the
    judge noted Mr Thornhill's submission that  this  change  of  political
    power was the reason why the appellant would now be  targeted  and  was
    not targeted whilst the PPP was in power and  the  background  material
    suggests that the police are  more  willing  to  prosecute  members  of
    opposition parties.

21. However, even if the appellant's party is no longer in power, he is not
    facing any prosecution or action  against  him  from  the  authorities.
    Further, it is significant that the judge found that the appellant  was
    released because of pressure in part from the police. The abduction was
    on 30.5.13, which was after the change in political  control,  yet  the
    police were still assisting the appellant, and his  wife  had  reported
    his abduction to the police. Further,  given  that  there  had  been  a
    change of political control in favour  of  those  associated  with  his
    abductors and the killers of his brother, there was  ample  opportunity
    to kill the appellant and rely on their  political  control  to  expect
    that as they were in power there would be little risk of prosecution, a
    viewpoint consistent with Mr Thornhill's  reliance  on  the  background
    information. This scenario  is  ample  justification  for  the  judge's
    conclusion that the appellant was not at any real risk and even  if  he
    were,  he  could  access  meaningful  protection  from  the  police  in
    Pakistan. Once again, this ground of appeal appears to be no more  that
    a disagreement with the findings of the judge and conclusions to  which
    he was entitled to come and for which cogent reasons have been given.

22. With regard to the issues of relocation,  Mr  Thornhill  relied  on  SA
    (Political activities - international relocation) Pakistan  [2011] UKUT
    30, as in that case the appellant claim was to fear persecution at  the
    hands of the PPP, who were  in  opposition  at  that  time  whilst  the
    appellant was a member of PMLQ. It is curious that this is  the  mirror
    image of the appellant's claim, including the murder of a brother,  but
    on this occasion the violence was perpetrated by the PPP.

23. The Tribunal in SA held that the internal  relocation  principle  could
    not require a political activist to live away from  his  home  area  in
    order to avoid persecution at the hands  of  his  political  opponents,
    which was akin to the pitfalls of requiring a person to act contrary to
    his normal behaviour in order to avoid persecution  highlighted  in  HJ
    (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31. The appellant in SA did not have  the  prominent
    political profile of his brother, but  he  had  been  an  active  party
    worker attending numerous political gatherings over a  lengthy  period.
    The Tribunal held that it was  unjustified  not  to  regard  him  as  a
    political activist and found that any return to  his  home  area  would
    expose him to a real risk of serious harm against which  he  would  not
    receive adequate protection. "In our judgement also, the only  way  the
    appellant could achieve safety by  relocation  was  if  he  effectively
    decided to live in hiding or in political exile." It is clear from  the
    foregoing that the Tribunal found that the appellant in SA was not able
    to obtain adequacy of protection in his home area.

24. In the light of the foregoing, if the appellant in the  present  appeal
    can properly be regarded as a political activist in the  same  or  more
    significant way than the appellant in SA, internal relocation would not
    a viable option if it would mean giving up his political  activity  and
    having to live in hiding. It  is  not  clear  to  me  that  this  would
    necessarily follow and as the PPP is a  mainstream  party,  whether  in
    power or opposition, the appellant would be able to engage  in  similar
    political activism elsewhere in Pakistan.  This  may  well  distinguish
    this appellant from SA. However,  the  judge  did  not  consider  these
    factors and thus I consider it only fair to proceed on the  basis  that
    internal relocation is not a viable option, on the basis of SA.

25. However, the situation of the appellant in SA is  rather  different  to
    the appellant in the present appeal, as found by Judge De Haney. In SA,
    the Upper Tribunal found that the appellant had neither sufficiency  of
    protection nor a viable option of relocation and his factual claim  was
    accepted. In the present case, the  considerations  of  relocation  and
    sufficiency of protection were findings addressed  in  the  alternative
    the primary  conclusion  at  �48  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    substantiate his claims that he is in continual  fear  from  opposition
    members or needed to either  go  into  hiding,  or  seek  international
    protection outside Pakistan. On that basis, neither internal relocation
    nor sufficiency of protection is an issue crucial to the outcome of the
    appeal. It follows that as the relocation finding was addressed in  the
    alternative,  any  error  in  respect  of  the  judge's  conclusion  on
    relocation cannot amount to a material error of law.

26. It is not entirely clear whether the judge in fact  accepted  that  the
    appellant was a political activist, but even  if  he  can  be  properly
    described as a political activist  in  the  light  of  SA,  and  is  in
    consequence in need of protection, it is clear from  the  determination
    that the judge found that there was sufficiency of protection from  the
    authorities in Pakistan, that his family had relied on the police; that
    he had already benefited from their actions to secure his release;  and
    that all of his behaviour before  leaving  Pakistan  demonstrated  that
    there was a sufficiency of protection for him in Pakistan.  This  issue
    is addressed at length in the decision and I find that  the  judge  has
    provided cogent and strong reasons for reaching this conclusion,  quite
    independent of the issue of internal relocation.

27. In the circumstances, I find no error of law  in  this  regard  and  no
    material error of law in the decision when read as  whole  such  as  to
    require it to be set aside and remade. I do not find  the  decision  or
    the reasoning perverse or irrational, but on the contrary a  conclusion
    the judge was entitled to come and for which cogent reasons  have  been
    provided. There is no merit in the grounds of appeal.



Conclusions:

28. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
