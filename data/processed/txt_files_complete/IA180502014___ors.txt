Representation:

For the Appellant:     Barrister instructed by Lewis Kennedy Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Witwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.       The appellants are citizens of India born on 11 December  1979,  15
   February 1980, 20 June 2003 and 10 August 2005. They are  a  family.  The
   appellant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent  refusing  the
   appellants  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  General  Student  and  her
   dependents. As it was accepted at the hearing of the First-tier  Tribunal
   that the appeals of the second, third and  fourth  appellant's  rests  or
   falls with that of the first appellant, I will also  consider  the  first
   appellant's appeal, and refer to her as "the appellant".


2.      Permission to appeal was given by first-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy
   on 26 March 2015 stating that  it  is  arguable  that  an  error  of  law
   occurred because the bundle of documents  submitted  by  the  appellant's
   representatives in December 2014 failed to find their way to  the  appeal
   file, hence the Judge was unaware of this evidence. It  was  stated  that
   this is more an error of law on the part of the  Tribunal  administration
   rather than the Judge.


       First-tier Tribunal's Findings


3.       The  first-tier  Tribunal  Judge  stated  the  following   in   the
   determination, which I summarise. The  appellant  applied  for  leave  to
   remain under the points based system and the  appellant  was  awarded  30
   points in respect of CAS. She was not  however,  awarded  any  points  in
   respect of maintenance/ funds. The appellant has  not  demonstrated  that
   she has in her possession �5600 for 28  consecutive  days  prior  to  her
   application to meet the  requirements  of  the  Tier  4  General  Student
   maintenance requirements.


4.       The appellants were not  present  at  the  hearing  of  the  appeal
   neither were they represented. They have also not provided  the  Tribunal
   with additional grounds of appeal and also and most importantly a  bundle
   of documents with represents their evidence in respect of the appeal.


       Grounds of Appeal


5.       The decision of the Judge mentioned  that  the  appellant  was  not
   present at the hearing of appeal  and  nor  were  they  represented.  The
   appellant faxed the additional witness statement and "most importantly  a
   bundle of documents which represents their evidence  in  respect  of  the
   appeal." The appellant "faxed the additional grounds,  witness  statement
   and proof of postage of bank statement before the date of decision of the
   Home Office to the Tribunal by fax on 11 December 2014 and  unfortunately
   these documents were not considered by the  IJ.  The  appellant  herewith
   enclosing the entire bundle along with the fax call report"


       The hearing.

   6.       At the hearing I heard submissions from both  parties.  For  the
      appellant the appellant's representative said he  does  not  have  the
      bundle of documents because the solicitor did not keep a copy. He said
      that he has proof that documents were  faxed  to  the  Tribunal  which
      included the appellant's bank statements to demonstrate that  she  had
      the requisite funds in  her  bank  account  to  meet  the  maintenance
      requirements of the Immigration Rules.






 Is there a material error of law in the  determination  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal?


7.      The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  and
   found that the appellants cannot succeed under the Immigration  Rules  as
   there is no evidence of funds in the appellant's account  of  �5600  held
   for 28  consecutive  days  prior  to  her  application  which  meets  the
   maintenance requirements for further leave to remain as a  student  under
   the points based system.


8.       The Judge in his determination  stated  that  appellants  were  not
   present at the hearing of the appeal and nor were  they  represented.  He
   stated that the appellants have not provided the Tribunal with additional
   grounds of appeal and also and "most importantly a  bundle  of  documents
   with the appellant claims represents their evidence  in  respect  of  the
   appeal". The Judge was  therefore  aware  that  there  was  a  bundle  of
   documents that the appellant claimed she had provided but there were  not
   before him.  As the appellant were not at the hearing, they could not  be
   asked about these documents.

   9.       The appellant provided a fax receipt from his  solicitors  which
      she says demonstrates that some papers were sent to the respondent  on
      11 December 2014. This fax receipt however does not  demonstrate  what
      documents were faxed to the respondent. The appellant claims that they
      were bank  statements  which  would  have  satisfied  the  maintenance
      requirement. At the hearing however I was  informed  that  these  bank
      statements are not available and a copy of the  bank  statements  have
      not been kept by the solicitors.

  10. I cannot accept that the bank statements could not have been  provided
      if they had been genuinely sent to the Tribunal.  At  the  hearing  as
      there was no explanation for why duplicates  of  the  bank  statements
      were not obtained  from  the  appellant's  Bank.  There  was  also  no
      statement from the Solicitors that  they  sent  the  appellant's  bank
      statements and did not retain a copy for their file. The  fax  receipt
      only demonstrates that some papers were faxed but  this  does  not  of
      itself demonstrate that they were bank  statements  which  would  have
      satisfied the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules.


  11. The Judge was entitled to find on the evidence  before  him  that  the
      appellant does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  for
      further leave to remain with her dependents  in  the  United  Kingdom.
      This is an attempt by the appellant to claim that  she  satisfied  the
      requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  by  merely  providing  a  fax
      receipt  without  providing  the  documents  themselves  and   without
      explanation.


  12. There was no submissions made to me  that  these  documents  would  be
      available at a further hearing, in the event that I  was  to  find  an
      error  of  law.   The   appellant   is   represented   therefore   her
      representatives must have known that production of  the  claimed  bank
      statements with  the  requisite  funds  would  have  strengthened  the
      appellant's claim that the solicitors  sent  bank  statements  to  the
      Tribunal. The bank statements were not on the Court file and also  not
      in the Home Office file and as it happens they were also not available
      at the hearing before me.


  13. The Judge  did  not  fall  into  material  error  by  not  considering
      documents which were not before him  because  the  appellant  has  not
      demonstrated that bank statements were  sent  by  fax.  There  was  no
      credible evidence before me upon which I can conclude  that  the  bank
      statement had been sent to the Tribunal  which  the  Judge  failed  to
      consider.


14. I therefore uphold the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  as
   not being erroneous in law.



DECISION

The appellant's appeal is dismissed
