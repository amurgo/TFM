                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Almanfoud's  appeal
against the respondent's decision to refuse to vary his leave to remain  and
to remove him from the United Kingdom following the refusal  of  his  asylum
claim.

For the purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the Secretary  of  State
as the respondent and  Mr  Almanfoud  as  the  appellant,  reflecting  their
positions as they were in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of Libya, born on 29 December  1975.  He  arrived
in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2013, having  previously  entered  the
UK in 2008 as a dependant on his wife's Tier 4 visa and  returned  to  Libya
in May 2012 after the revolution. He re-entered the UK with leave  to  enter
as the dependant of his wife but applied, on 24 October 2013,  to  vary  his
leave to that of  a  refugee.  His  application  was  refused.  He  appealed
against that decision. His appeal was heard by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
22 July 2015 and was allowed.  The  Secretary  of  State  has  been  granted
permission to appeal that decision.

The Appellant's Claim

The appellant was born in Tripoli, in  Libya,  and  is  married  with  three
children, all born in the UK. He initially came to the UK with his wife  who
had been granted a Tier 4 student  visa.  He  was  opposed  to  the  Gaddafi
regime and whilst in the UK he attended demonstrations against  the  regime.
He also contacted the cultural attachï¿½  at  the  Libyan  Embassy  in  London
protesting against Gaddafi. After the revolution, in May 2012,  he  returned
to Libya with his family, intending to stay  there  permanently.  He  worked
for the local council in the accounts department in his parents' village  of
Khomes and then started working as a volunteer for a  charity  or  committee
in the same building, in April 2013, supporting victims of  criminal  gangs,
encouraging people to report crimes and gathering information about  Gaddafi
followers and passing  the  information  on  to  certain  organisations.  He
received telephone threats and threatening texts accusing him of being anti-
Gaddafi, of having attended anti-Gaddafi  demonstrations,  and  of  being  a
traitor. In June 2013 he was shot at when driving his car with  his  family.
He had stopped working for the committee by that time as  a  result  of  the
threats made to his life. On 15 July 2013  he  was  kidnapped  by  an  armed
group and was held for a week and tortured before escaping. He went to  stay
with his relatives. He reported to the police and they took  photographs  of
his injuries from the torture. He also  heard  that  his  house  was  burned
down. He could not relocate to another part of Libya because the gangs  were
everywhere and he would be recognised wherever he went.  He  therefore  left
Libya and came back to the UK. He had no problem leaving Libya from  Tripoli
airport because he was protected by the revolutionaries.

The respondent considered that the appellant did not fall  within  the  risk
factors in AT and Others (Article 15c;  risk  categories)  Libya  CG  [2014]
UKUT 318 as he had no links to the Gaddafi regime and  had  an  anti-Gaddafi
profile. He had had no problem travelling to Tripoli airport from  his  home
and leaving the country because he was protected by the revolutionaries  and
he could therefore safely return to his home area. In any event he was  able
to internally relocate within the country. The  respondent  did  not  accept
the appellant's account of having attended  anti-Gaddafi  demonstrations  in
the UK and did not accept his account of his kidnapping  and  detention.  It
was not accepted that the photographs of injuries and scars relied  upon  by
the appellant constituted evidence supporting his account of  the  cause  of
the injuries. The respondent considered that the appellant would not  be  at
risk  on  return  to  Libya,  that  he  was  not  entitled  to  humanitarian
protection and that his removal would not breach his human rights.

First-tier Tribunal Judge Dearden, in his decision of 31  July  2015,  found
that the appellant had given a truthful account of his experiences in  Libya
and accepted that he had suffered persecution in the  past.  He  found  that
the appellant could not safely relocate to another part of  Libya.  He  also
found that the situation in Libya had deteriorated to an extent that it  now
fell within Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive and  thus  required
departure, in the appellant's case, from the  country  guidance  in  AT.  He
allowed the appeal on asylum and human rights grounds.

The Secretary of State's appeal

The respondent sought permission to appeal Judge Dearden's decision  on  the
grounds that he had failed to provide adequate reasons  for  departing  from
the country guidance in AT, in particular given  that  the  evidence  relied
upon by the judge reflected the evidence that was before the  panel  in  the
country guidance case.

Permission was granted on 1 September 2015 by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
the grounds raised.

At the hearing before me Ms Johnstone accepted that the judge's  credibility
findings  were  not  challenged  and  relied  upon  the  grounds  on   which
permission had been granted. Mr Brown submitted  that  the  evidence  before
the judge was not the same as that before the panel in the country  guidance
case but was up-dated evidence which justified a departure from the  country
guidance. He submitted that there were two issues before the  judge,  namely
the specific risk  on  return  to  the  appellant  and  the  possibility  of
internal relocation, and the general risk under Article 15(c).  The  grounds
had focussed only upon the latter. Ms Johnstone, in  response,  referred  to
the last paragraph of the respondent's grounds. She conceded that there  had
been more up-to-date background information before the judge.


I advised the parties that, in my view, there was  nothing  in  the  grounds
justifying the setting aside of the judge's  decision.  My  reasons  for  so
concluding are as follows.

Consideration and findings.

It is the appellant's claim  that  he  had  been  actively  opposed  to  the
Gaddafi regime, and that as a result of his known anti-regime activities  he
had been threatened when working for a committee in Libya, had been shot  at
whilst driving his car, that he  had  been  kidnapped  and  tortured  before
escaping and that his house had been burned down. All of  this,  he  claims,
was due to the fact that he was considered to be a traitor  by  the  militia
and  armed  gangs  supporting  the  Gaddafi  regime.   Whilst   noting   the
respondent's views about the credibility of  the  appellant's  account,  and
whilst taking some issue  with  parts  of  the  appellant's  account,  Judge
Dearden nevertheless placed significant weight upon a  medical  report  from
the Medical Foundation in concluding that  the  appellant's  account  was  a
truthful one. The respondent did not take issue with  that  finding  and  Ms
Johnstone confirmed that the  positive  credibility  findings  made  by  the
judge were not challenged. Neither  was  there  any  issue  taken  with  the
judge's implied finding that the appellant was at  risk  on  return  to  his
home area. That was a matter which I specifically raised at the hearing  and
it was clear that that was not a matter under challenge.

What the respondent was challenging was the judge's  finding  in  regard  to
internal relocation, but in the context  of  his  findings  on  the  general
situation in Libya for the purposes of Article  15(c).  Mr  Brown  submitted
that, in challenging the judge's findings in that regard, in particular  his
departure from the country guidance in AT,  the  respondent  had  failed  to
separate  the  two  distinct  issues  of  the  appellant's  own   particular
circumstances  as  regards  internal  relocation  and  the  general  country
situation for the purposes of Article 15(c). I agree that that is the  case,
although it seems to me that the judge conflated the issues  himself  to  an
extent. Nevertheless, I would agree with Mr Brown that there was  sufficient
evidence before the judge to justify his conclusion that  the  circumstances
in Libya had deteriorated to such a level, since  the  country  guidance  in
AT, that the  appellant  had  demonstrated  that  he  could  not  safely  or
reasonably relocate to another part of the country.


Whether or not the judge was entitled to conclude that the  evidence  before
him justified a departure from the guidance in AT  in  relation  to  Article
15(c) in general terms is not material, given that that was  not  the  basis
upon which he allowed the appeal. Indeed he made no finding on  humanitarian
protection. What the judge did  was  to  consider  the  background  evidence
before him  and  the  expert  report  in  the  context  of  the  appellant's
particular circumstances, as he noted at the penultimate paragraph  of  page
11 of his decision, and to conclude that it was not safe or  reasonable  for
the appellant and his family to relocate to another part of the country.  At
page 11, he specifically quoted that part of the expert report referring  to
remnants of the Gaddafi regime existing throughout  Libya  and  engaging  in
persecutions  and  assassinations  of  those  that  they  believed   to   be
responsible  for  the  regime's  defeat.  Clearly,  that  was   particularly
pertinent to the appellant's situation. As such, it is clear that the  judge
did not allow the appeal on generalised grounds, based on  evidence  already
considered in the country guidance, as the  respondent's  challenge  appears
to suggest, but he gave reasons for concluding that the appellant  had  made
out his claim based on his own individual circumstances.

Accordingly I find that the judge did not err in law as the grounds  assert.
He undertook a detailed and careful  assessment  of  the  evidence  and  the
existing country guidance and reached a conclusion  that  was  entirely  and
reasonably open to him on the basis of that evidence.




DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision. The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
allow the appellant's appeal stands.
