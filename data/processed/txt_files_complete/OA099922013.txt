                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal with permission by the Secretary of  State  from  the
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Robinson,  who  allowed  the
    claimant's appeal against refusal of entry clearance as a  spouse.   It
    was accepted that the claimant  could  not  bring  himself  within  the
    Article 8 ECHR provisions at Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended). The First-tier Tribunal  allowed
    the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds outside the Rules.

 2. The facts are not in dispute.  The claimant is a Somali citizen and his
    United Kingdom citizen spouse is of Somali origin.  She is a recognised
    refugee and cannot be expected to go  and  live  in  Somalia  with  the
    claimant.  The parties married in Egypt in 2012.

 3. On 30 January 2013, the claimant applied to the Entry Clearance Officer
    in Cairo, Egypt, for entry clearance to enable him to join the  sponsor
    in the United Kingdom.  The sponsor's income was insufficient  to  meet
    the requirements of the Rules and the parties did not have the required
    savings to make up the shortfall.  The application was refused. In  the
    decision under appeal the Secretary of State said as follows:

         "Your sponsor is not exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  as
         defined by paragraph E-ECP 3.3.  I am not able to take into account
         any potential employment you have available to you in the UK or any
         offers of financial support from third parties.  In order  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the Rules your sponsor needs a  gross
         income of at least �18,600 per annum.  From the  evidence  provided
         your sponsor's gross income  from  her  employment  with  Wellfield
         Education and New Look totals �11,538.30.  In order to qualify  you
         and your  sponsor  require  �7,061.7  x  2.5  plus  �16,000  equals
         �33,654.25 in savings in order to meet the financial  requirements.
         You have provided evidence that you have �6,256 in savings, however
         you and/or your sponsor have not held it continuously for the  past
         six months and this amount is not sufficient to meet the  financial
         requirements.  I therefore refuse your application under  paragraph
         ECP-1.1.(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP 3.1)."

    The claimant does not dispute that that is a  fair  assessment  of  his
    application under the Rules and that he could not meet the Rules.

 4. The claimant is living in Egypt where he is a  student.   He  does  not
    have employment there.   Since their marriage, the sponsor has  visited
    him twice, and also investigated the possibilities of working in  Egypt
    if she joined him.  It has not been suggested on  the  parties'  behalf
    that she would not be permitted to live with  the  claimant  in  Egypt;
    rather, the claimant contends that as she  is  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom and has employment and family members here, it is  unreasonable
    to expect her to do so.  The sponsor's statement is set out in full  at
    paragraph 9 of the determination and at paragraphs 15 to  18  she  says
    this:

         "15. Since my wedding took place in 2012 I have visited my  husband
             on two occasions to  meet  him.  The  copies  of  my  passport
             containing entry/exit stamps are included in the bundle 15.  I
             could not stay for longer periods with husband in Cairo due to
             my employment commitments.

         16.  My husband is currently unemployed because he cannot engage in
             long-term employment commitments.   He  intends  to  start  in
             employment immediately upon arrival in the UK.

         17.  My husband is fluent in Arabic, English and  Somali  languages
             and his prospects for employment are extremely high.

         18.  I keep in contact with my husband on  the  phone,  emails  and
             using Skype.  I use Vonage for calling my husband in Cairo and
             the billing is shown in the bank statement."

 5. I am grateful to Ms Akande for her skeleton argument on behalf  of  the
    claimant which  explains  clearly  at  paragraphs  29-30  thereof,  the
    circumstances relied upon on behalf of  the  claimant  and  sponsor  as
    exceptional, and  which  she  considered  formed  the  basis  of  their
    successful appeal in the First-tier Tribunal.  The circumstances are as
    follows:  the claimant is a Somali citizen with limited leave to reside
    in Egypt, but no right of permanent residence there; the couple  depend
    wholly on the sponsor's income from her United Kingdom employment;  the
    claimant is unemployed;  the  relationship  between  the  claimant  and
    sponsor; the unreasonableness of expecting the sponsor to give  up  her
    home and work in the United Kingdom, coupled with the lower  likelihood
    of her finding employment in Egypt; the claimant's three languages  and
    good qualifications, which would enable him to find work easily in  the
    United Kingdom;  the level of  the  sponsor's  post-decision  earnings,
    such that the couple are 'financially self-sufficient' and would now be
    able to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules;  the  unlawfulness  of
    expecting the sponsor, a refugee, to live with the claimant in Somalia;
       the sponsor's private and family life and the lack  of  any  family,
    social or cultural connections between the claimant,  or  the  sponsor,
    and Egypt; the distress,  hardship,  cost  and  delay  of  any  further
    application; and the  maintenance  of  fair  immigration  control.   Ms
    Akande contended that since the First-tier Tribunal Judge had mentioned
    the Home Office entry clearance guidance, he must have  had  regard  to
    it, despite there being no further mention of it in his decision.

 6. It is difficult to see what is exceptional about those  factors.   Many
    couples marry when one of them lives overseas and the other is  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Sometimes difficult decisions will have to be made  if
    they are unable to show the level of income which the Rules require, as
    to whether to continue to live separately or  to  live  together  in  a
    country where they can do so, but in less convenient circumstances, and
    with the United Kingdom citizen leaving wider  family  members  behind.
    These are the ordinary circumstances of a marriage  contracted  between
    nationals of different states. It is not suggested now, and it was  not
    suggested at the hearing, that there was  any  legal  obstacle  to  the
    sponsor going to Egypt to live with the claimant.  The  claimant  is  a
    highly qualified man who would be an asset  to  any  employer  once  he
    decides to seek employment.

 7. The core reasoning in the First-tier Tribunal determination is set  out
    at paragraphs 35 to 39 thereof:

         "35. It is apparent that this couple are unable to live together in
             Somalia  due  to  the  sponsor's  refugee  status.   This  was
             accepted on the respondent's behalf at the appeal hearing.

         36.  I take the view that it would be unreasonable  to  expect  the
             appellant and his wife to live in Egypt.  It is apparent  from
             his visa that the appellant has limited leave to  live  there.
             He went to Egypt to study.  It is unknown whether the  sponsor
             would qualify for a visa to live in Egypt and even if she were
             given leave to enter it is very doubtful whether she would  be
             able to find work there.  Any move to Egypt would of necessity
             involve her giving up her  work  and  home  in  the  UK.   Her
             parents and siblings reside here  and  are  British  citizens.
             Her family life outside her marriage is entirely based in  the
             UK.  Neither she nor her husband appears to have  any  family,
             cultural or societal connection to Egypt.

         37.   The  respondent's  right  to  maintain  consistent  and  fair
             immigration controls is an important right which in most cases
             outweighs the right of an individual's right to  enjoy  family
             life in their country of choice.  I have taken account of  the
             findings of the High Court in MN  relating  to  the  financial
             requirements of the Immigration Rules which apply  to  British
             citizens and recognised  refugees.   I  was  informed  at  the
             hearing that an appeal by the Secretary of State is pending in
             the Court of Appeal.

         38.  When assessing the circumstances  of  the  appellant  and  his
             spouse in the present case I take the view that based on their
             circumstances at the  time  of  the  decision  to  refuse  the
             application they are financially self-sufficient. At the  time
             of the appeal hearing their circumstances are  such  that  the
             appellant  satisfied  the  financial   requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules based on his wife's apparent earnings.

         39.  I considered whether it would be right to dismiss  the  appeal
             in  the  expectation  that  the  appellant  submit   a   fresh
             application which is likely to succeed.  I take the view  that
             this would involve significant additional cost and some delay.
              I consider that this course of action would involve  hardship
             and distress which is unnecessary and not in the interests  of
             justice."

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge unfortunately did  not  engage  with  the
    guidance given by Mr Justice Sales (as he then  was)  in  Nagre  before
    concluding at paragraph 40 that the circumstances of the  claimant  and
    his spouse are exceptional and the decision to refuse  entry  clearance
    disproportionate.

 8. There are two plain errors of law in the  passage  which  I  have  just
    quoted, the first being the absence of a disciplined  consideration  of
    Nagre exceptionality, that is to say, the circumstances under which the
    Secretary of State's should  exercise  her  residual  discretion  under
    Article 8 outside the Rules, and the second the reliance on the  couple
    being 'financially self-sufficient' at the date of decision.

 9. In relation to Article 8 outside the Rules, the failure to consider and
    apply the guidance in  Nagre  and  subsequent  cases  which  deal  with
    exceptional circumstances has  led  the  judge  to  conclude  that  the
    circumstances of these parties are such  as  to  entitle  them  to  the
    exercise of discretion outside the Rules.  That was an error, and it is
    material, since had he given consideration to the question whether  the
    circumstances of the parties were 'exceptional and compelling',  in  my
    judgment he could not properly have concluded in the claimant's favour.
    The parties married when the claimant was studying in Egypt.  There  is
    no evidence from the claimant as to why with his talents, he could  not
    work there, or that his wife cannot join him in Egypt as it appears she
    has contemplated doing.

10. As regards the financial position of the claimant and  sponsor  at  the
    date of application, applying the decision of the Court of Appeal in MM
    & Ors, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985, the Secretary of State was entitled  to
    set an income level which must be met by a sponsor wishing to be joined
    by her husband.  At paragraphs 138-139 and 151 in the judgment of  Lord
    Justice Aikens, he said this:

         "138.    ... The UK partner's statutory right to reside in  the  UK
         "without let or hindrance" is, in my view,  a  personal  right.  It
         cannot be extended to others. Nor can the rights of a  person  with
         refugee or HP status be extended to others. There is nothing in the
         1971 Act or the common law that grants a "constitutional right"  of
         British citizens to live in the UK with non-EEA partners who do not
         have the right of abode in the UK  and  who  are  currently  living
         outside the UK. Of course, I accept that the UK partner (whether  a
         UK citizen of a refugee or person with HP) is entitled  to  respect
         of his or her right to marry and to found a family. But  those  are
         not absolute rights; there is no absolute right to marry and  found
         a family in the UK if it involves marriage to a non-EEA citizen who
         then wishes to reside in the UK. In Quila Lord Wilson accepted that
         the principle stated by the majority of the ECtHR in Abdulaziz,  to
         the effect that Article 8 did not impose a general obligation on  a
         member state to facilitate the choice made by a married  couple  to
         reside in it, was "unexceptionable".  With  respect,  I  agree.  In
         Quila the obstruction on the married couple exercising their choice
         of where to live was created by the total ban on marriage visas for
         those under 21. It was this total ban on all marriages with a  non-
         EEA citizen under the age  of  21  which  constituted  "a  colossal
         interference" with Article 8 rights.

         139. In this case the obstruction on  the  choice  of  the  married
         couple (or on two partners) to live in the UK is  a  financial  one
         which effectively prevents  all  UK  partners  whose  earnings  and
         savings are below a certain amount (as calculated by the  new  MIR)
         from being able to sponsor the entry of their non-EEA partner.  The
         new MIR must therefore constitute a very  significant  interference
         with the Article 8 rights of a UK partner who cannot fulfil the new
         MIR conditions. Whether or not, in law, the non-EEA  partners  have
         "Article 8 rights", plainly their  private  and  family  lives  are
         affected if their UK partners cannot fulfil the requirements. ...

         151.          I am very conscious of the evidence submitted by  the
         claimants to demonstrate how the new MIR will  have  an  impact  on
         particular groups and, in particular, the evidence  that  only  301
         occupations out of 422 listed in the  2011  UK  Earnings  data  had
         average annual earnings over �18,600. But, given the work that  was
         done on behalf of the Secretary of State to analyse the  effect  of
         the immigration of non-EEA partners and dependent children  on  the
         benefits system, the level of income needed to minimise  dependence
         on the state for families where non-EEA partners enter the  UK  and
         what I regard as a rational conclusion on the link  between  better
         income and greater chances of integration, my  conclusion  is  that
         the Secretary of State's  judgment  cannot  be  impugned.  She  has
         discharged the burden of demonstrating that  the  interference  was
         both the minimum necessary and strikes a fair balance  between  the
         interests of the groups concerned and  the  community  in  general.
         Individuals will have  different  views  on  what  constitutes  the
         minimum income requirements needed to accomplish the stated  policy
         aims. In my judgment it is not the court's job to  impose  its  own
         view unless, objectively  judged,  the  levels  chosen  are  to  be
         characterised as irrational, or  inherently  unjust  or  inherently
         unfair. In my view they cannot be."

11. Having regard to that firm guidance, the First-tier Tribunal's views on
    whether the parties were financially self-sufficient at a  level  lower
    than �18600,  or  the  required  amount  of  savings  to  make  up  any
    shortfall, cannot engage Article 8 outside  the  Rules.   Not  only  is
    there nothing exceptional  about  a  sponsor  spouse  being  unable  to
    demonstrate the right income level, but there is clear  authority  that
    the Secretary of State is entitled to impose that restriction.   A near-
    miss (which this was not) is  still  a  miss  and  the  judge  was  not
    entitled to have regard to the ability of the parties to  manage  on  a
    lower income. There is nothing else in the parties' circumstances which
    reaches  the  level  of  exceptional   and   compelling   compassionate
    circumstances for which the Secretary of State ought to have considered
    exercising her discretion outside the Rules.

12. The proper approach for these parties  is  that  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal rejected at  paragraph  39:   if  the  parties  now  meet  the
    requirement of the Rules  then  the  claimant  should  make  a  further
    application, submitting the evidence now available.  Alternatively, the
    sponsor could proceed with her plans to live and work in Egypt if  that
    is what the parties prefer.

13. Accordingly I find that there is a material error of law in the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision.  I set it aside  and  substitute  a  decision
    dismissing the appeal.
