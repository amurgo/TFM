 For the Appellant:        Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:        Mr T S Chodha, Counsel



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Background
   1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission against a decision of
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Burnett  allowing  Mr  Harb's  appeal
      against her decision to refuse to  issue  him  a  permanent  residence
      card. Although the Secretary of State is now  the  appellant  in  this
      appeal and Mr Harb is the respondent, it is more convenient  to  refer
      to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal.  I  shall
      refer to Mr Harb as "the appellant" from now on and the  Secretary  of
      State as "the respondent".


   2.   I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.


   3. The appellant is a citizen of Lebanon, born  on  25  April  1976.  His
      wife, Ms Migle Harb, nï¿½e Tomkeviciute, is a citizen of Lithuania,  who
      exercised her right as an EU citizen to travel to the UK  to  work  in
      around September 2005. She met the appellant shortly afterwards.  They
      married on 20 October 2007. Their  daughter,  Maya,  was  born  on  25
      October 2008. Ms Harb developed  pre-eclampsia  during  pregnancy  and
      Maya was born prematurely at  only  28  weeks.  Sadly,  she  developed
      significant disabilities and has been diagnosed with diplegic cerebral
      palsy. As a consequence, Ms Harb has not returned to her  former  work
      in hotels. Since June 2009 Ms  Harb  has  received  Disability  Living
      Allowance for Maya and, since June 2010, Carer's Allowance.  In  April
      2011 she commenced some casual work from  home,  ironing  clothes.  In
      2012 the appellant and Ms Harb had another child.


   4. The appellant was granted a residence card valid for  five  years.  He
      applied for permanent residence on 31 May 2013, relying on  Ms  Harb's
      self-employment. However, his application was refused  on  7  November
      2013 because he had not provided evidence that Ms Harb  had  exercised
      her Treaty rights for 5 years (Regulation 15(1)(b) of the  Immigration
      (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  as  amended  ("the  EEA
      Regulations")). The reasons for refusal letter which  accompanied  the
      decision notice stated the appellant had only provided  evidence  that
      Ms Harb was working for two years. There was insufficient evidence  to
      show Ms Harb had been self-employed. The appellant appealed on generic
      grounds.


   5. Judge Burnett considered the appeal with care. He noted the  appellant
      did not pursue his case on the basis that Ms Harb was self-sufficient.
      He identified the key issue as being whether she had  been  exercising
      her Treaty rights between June 2008,  when  she  stopped  working  and
      studying,  and  September  2010,  which  ended  the  five-year  period
      following Ms Harb's arrival in the UK to work.  The  judge  considered
      the case of Shabani (EEA - jobseekers; nursery education) [2013]  UKUT
      00315 (IAC) and drew guidance from it on the issue of whether a  woman
      lost the status of worker by giving up work to  look  after  children.
      The Tribunal was bound by the decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
      Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v Dias [2009] EWCA Civ 807 to
      the effect that worker status was lost in such circumstances, although
      the Supreme Court had referred the point to the Court  of  Justice  in
      Sant Prix v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2012] UKSC 49.


   6. Judge Burnett interpreted Regulation  6(2)(a),  which  states  that  a
      person who is no longer working shall not cease to  be  treated  as  a
      worker (and therefore be a 'qualified person') if she  is  temporarily
      unable to work as the result of an illness or  accident.  He  reasoned
      that Ms Harb had left work to become Maya's carer due to her  illness.
      The judge held that the illness did not have to be  that  of  the  EEA
      national. He found Ms Harb was a worker during the relevant period and
      allowed the appeal.


   7. The respondent sought permission to appeal, arguing the judge erred in
      his application of Shabani, which had held that a woman who  left  the
      labour market to look after children did not retain her  status  as  a
      worker. Further the judge erred in his  interpretation  of  Regulation
      6(2) because the illness had to  be  that  of  the  qualified  person.
      Permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal.


   8. I heard submissions as to whether the judge made a material  error  of
      law. Mr Nath's submissions were brief. He said Ms Harb lost her status
      as a worker and the judge had therefore erred. Mr Chodha  pointed  out
      that Shabani had not been mentioned at the hearing. He  said  Ms  Harb
      had not wished to give up employment and to abandon the labour market.
      Instead this had been  forced  on  her  by  circumstances  beyond  her
      control. It had been planned that Ms Harb's sister  would  look  after
      Maya after she reached the age of  four  or  five  months  but,  given
      Maya's condition, Ms Harb was not willing or able to go  through  with
      this. Mr Nath agreed there were compassionate circumstances but argued
      the judge did not apply the law.


   9. I raised the  issue  of  whether  Ms  Harb's  inability  to  work  was
      temporary. Mr Chodha said the interruption was temporary as  shown  by
      the fact Ms Harb managed to take on some self-employment later on.


  10. Neither representative could assist me with any authority on the issue
      identified by Judge Burnett that the illness did not have to  be  that
      of the worker herself in order to preserve the latter's  status  as  a
      worker for the purposes of Regulation 6(2)(a).


  11. I reserved my determination.


   The issue for determination
  12. The parties are in agreement that the appellant's  application  for  a
      permanent residence card under Regulation 18(2) depends on whether  he
      can show that he has gained  a  permanent  right  of  residence  under
      Regulation 15(1)(b). There is no dispute about  the  fact  he  is  the
      'family member' (spouse) of  Ms  Harb.   He  must  show  that  he  has
      "resided in the United Kingdom with the  EEA  national  in  accordance
      with these  Regulations  for  a  continuous  period  of  five  years."
      Regulation 15(1)(b) has been the subject of guidance from the Tribunal
      (see, for example, in OA (EEA - retained right of  residence)  Nigeria
      [2010] UKAIT 00003), paragraphs 20 to 30).  The  appellant  must  show
      that he was residing with Ms Harb for  a  continuous  period  of  five
      years and that throughout that period she was  a  'qualified  person',
      within the meaning of Regulation 6.


  13. There are no issues about the fact the  appellant  and  Ms  Harb  have
      resided together in the UK for a continuous period of five years.  The
      only issue, as Judge Burnett identified, is  whether  Ms  Harb  was  a
      qualified person during the entirety of that period.  It  is  accepted
      she was employed until June 2008 when she left her employment  due  to
      pregnancy. The period under examination is  therefore  the  27  months
      between June 2008 and September 2010. The appellant argues  only  that
      Ms Harb was a 'worker', having abandoned his case  as  originally  put
      that she was self-sufficient. Ms Harb was not a jobseeker  or  student
      during the period. She  began  self-employment  after  the  period  in
      question.


   The law
  14. The relevant legal provisions are as follows. The EEA Regulations give
      effect to the UK's obligations under the Directive 2004/38/EC  of  the
      European Parliament and Council, of  29  April  2004  ("the  Citizens'
      Directive"). This states in relevant part as follows:


         "Article 7 Right of residence for more than three months


             1.   All Union citizens shall have the right of  residence  on
                  the territory of another Member  State  for  a  period  of
                  longer than three months if they:


                  (a)  are workers or  self-employed  persons  in  the  host
                      Member State; or


                      ...


                  (d)  are family members accompanying or  joining  a  Union
                      citizen who satisfies the conditions referred  to  in
                      points (a), (b) or (c).


             2.   The right of residence provided for in paragraph 1  shall
                  extend to family members who are not nationals of a Member
                  State, accompanying or joining the Union  citizen  in  the
                  host  Member  State,  provided  that  such  Union  citizen
                  satisfies the conditions referred to  in  paragraph  1(a),
                  (b) or (c).


             3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1(a), a Union  citizen  who
                  is no longer a worker or self-employed person shall retain
                  the status  of  worker  or  self-employed  person  in  the
                  following circumstances:


                  (a)  he/she is temporarily unable to work as the result of
                      an illness or accident;


                  (b)  he/she is in duly recorded  involuntary  unemployment
                      after having been employed for more than one year and
                      has registered as  a  job-seeker  with  the  relevant
                      employment office;


                  (c)  he/she is in duly recorded  involuntary  unemployment
                      after completing a fixed-term employment contract  of
                      less than a year or after having become involuntarily
                      unemployed during the first  twelve  months  and  has
                      registered  as  a  job-seeker   with   the   relevant
                      employment office. In this case, the status of worker
                      shall be retained for no less than six months;


                  (d)  he/she embarks on vocational training. Unless  he/she
                      is involuntarily unemployed,  the  retention  of  the
                      status of worker shall require  the  training  to  be
                      related to the previous employment.


             ..."


  15. These provisions are given effect in domestic law by Regulation  6  of
      the EEA Regulations which, at the time in question, read as follows:


         ""Qualified person"


         6.   (1) In these Regulations, "qualified person"  means  a  person
                who is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-


                (a)    a jobseeker;


                (b)    a worker;


                (c)    a self-employed person;


                (d)    a self-sufficient person; or


                (e)    a student.


           (2)    A person who is no longer working shall not cease  to  be
                treated as a worker for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if-


                (a)    he is temporarily unable to work as the result of  an
                    illness or accident;


                (b)    he is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after
                    having been employed in  the  United  Kingdom,  provided
                    that he has registered as a jobseeker with the  relevant
                    employment office and-


                    (i)    he was employed  for  one  year  or  more  before
                        becoming unemployed;


                    (ii)   he has been  unemployed  for  no  more  than  six
                        months; or


                    (iii)  he  can  provide  evidence  that  he  is  seeking
                        employment in the United Kingdom and has a  genuine
                        chance of being engaged;


                (c)    he is involuntarily unemployed and  has  embarked  on
                    vocational training; or


                (d)    he has voluntarily ceased  working  and  embarked  on
                    vocational training that  is  related  to  his  previous
                    employment.


           (3)    ..."


  16. The Tribunal has previously confirmed that the provisions of  the  EEA
      Regulations relating to temporary inability to work  are  faithful  to
      the terms of the Citizens Directive (see, for example,  FMB  (EEA  Reg
      6(2)(a) - 'temporarily unable to work') Uganda [2010] UKUT 447  (IAC),
      paragraph 25).


   Determination
  17. There is no dispute about the underlying  facts  in  this  appeal.  In
      order to determine whether Judge Burnett made a material error of  law
      and therefore a decision dismissing the appeal has to be  substituted,
      I have asked myself  whether  Ms  Harb  was,  between  June  2008  and
      September 2010, a 'worker' for the purposes of EU law  notwithstanding
      the fact she had given up her job. This breaks down into the following
      questions:


             (1) was Ms Harb's inability to work temporary?
             (2) was Ms Harb's inability to work the result of an illness?
             (3) can Ms Harb rely on the illness of Maya?


  18. The first point to note in interpreting these provisions is  that  the
      term 'worker' must be interpreted broadly in EU law because it defines
      the scope of a fundamental freedom provided for by the TFEU (see,  for
      example, Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg Case 66/85,  [1986]  ECR
      2121, at paragraphs 16-18).


  19. Secondly, Recital 5 of the Directive emphasizes the  need  for  family
      members to be able to move with Union citizens.


  20. Thirdly, the CJEU has recently held that Article 7(3) of the Directive
      does not contain an exhaustive list of the circumstances  in  which  a
      migrant worker who is no longer  in  an  employment  relationship  may
      nevertheless continue to benefit from that status (see  Saint  Prix  v
      Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Case C-507/12, paragraph 38).




  21. That case decided that Article 45 TFEU must  be  interpreted  to  mean
      that a woman who gives up work because of the physical constraints  of
      the late stages of pregnancy and the aftermath of  childbirth  retains
      the status of worker provided she returns to work or finds another job
      within a reasonable period after the birth of her  child.  Given  Maya
      was born on 25 October 2008, it is at least arguable Ms Harb  retained
      her status as worker until at least the end  of  2008  on  that  basis
      alone. However, as this falls well short of the  five-year  qualifying
      mark, the appellant must rely on showing she was temporarily unable to
      work as a result of Maya's illness.


   Was Ms Harb's inability to work temporary?
  22. As noted, Mr Chodha referred to the fact Ms Harb started some work  in
      April 2011. However, the situation must be judged by reference to  the
      facts in existence in the period  in  question,  ending  in  September
      2010. To put it another way, facts  taking  place  after  that  period
      cannot be used to prove the existence of the  situation  seven  months
      earlier.


  23. The meaning of "temporary" was considered in FMB (Uganda).  This  held
      as follows:


         "A state  of  affairs  is  'temporary'  if  it  is  not  permanent.
         Accordingly, for the purposes of reg  6(2)(a)  of  the  Immigration
         (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, a person whose inability
         to work as a result of illness or  accident  is  not  permanent  is
         temporarily unable to work."


  24. In reaching their conclusions, the Tribunal did not attempt to suggest
      any limit to the time for which a state of  affairs  can  properly  be
      described as 'temporary'. However, in arriving  at  their  conclusions
      they noted that the provision providing for permanent residence on the
      ground of permanent incapacity from work requires  a  person  to  show
      more than two years' continuous residence (see Article 17.1(b) of  the
      Directive). This provides support for the notion that  Ms  Harb  could
      theoretically show she was temporarily unable to work for the 27-month
      period in question.


  25. Turning to the facts again, I note that, following her birth, Maya was
      received care for three months  in  the  Special  Care  Baby  Unit  in
      Chelsea and Westminster  Hospital,  during  which  time  she  suffered
      bleeding in the brain followed by hydrocephalus. A shunt was  inserted
      in January 2009. The diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made during  this
      time. Maya was slow to grow and had initial feeding difficulties.  She
      started to sit independently at 14  months  and  started  crawling  in
      about May 2011. She has had fits and has been  given  a  diagnosis  of
      epilepsy. She has  hip  displacement  which  may  require  surgery  to
      correct. She has global developmental delay. Since September 2013 Maya
      has attended John  Chilton  School,  where  she  receives  speech  and
      language therapy.

  26. I note that Ms Harb's witness statement explains that Maya needed full-
      time nursing, as she suffered from pain, coughing and vomiting.  There
      were times she did not  sleep  all  night.  There  were  many  medical
      appointments to attend. Maya's disability was such  that  her  husband
      could not have managed to take care of her. Ms  Harb  has  established
      herself in the work force by remaining employed for almost three years
      prior to taking maternity leave. She intended to return to  work  when
      Maya was born. She was prevented from fulfilling that intention by the
      imperative need to provide  care  for  Maya.  It  is  likely  Ms  Harb
      retained an intention to return to employment when  the  circumstances
      permitted.  From the perspective of the exercise  of  her  freedom  of
      movement, she had not left the workforce as at September 2010.


  27. I shall therefore proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  first  question,
      whether Ms Harb's inability to work was temporary, can be answered  in
      the affirmative.


   Was Ms Harb's inability to work the result of an illness?
  28. This question requires the appellant to demonstrate the  cause  of  Ms
      Harb's giving up work was Maya's illness. Plainly the reason  Ms  Harb
      did not return to work was  to  care  for  Maya  due  to  her  medical
      conditions.


   Can Ms Harb rely on the illness of Maya?
  29. The final question is  perhaps  the  most  difficult  hurdle  for  the
      appellant  to  surmount.  He  seeks  a  wide  interpretation  of   the
      Regulation which, on the face of it, makes provision for  workers  who
      are temporarily unable to work due to their own accident  or  illness.
      Judge Burnett relied on the absence of a pronoun to limit the  illness
      in question to that of the worker. Had the intention been to limit its
      effect in this manner, this could have easily  been  achieved  by  the
      insertion of the words "his or her".


  30. I have  already  noted  the  guidance  of  the  Court  of  Justice  in
      interpreting these provisions  in  paragraphs  18  and  19  above.  In
      addition, I note the Court of Justice agreed with the Commission  that
      a Union citizen would be deterred from exercising her right to freedom
      of movement if she risked losing her status as worker  if  she  became
      pregnant (see paragraph 44). EU law guarantees special protection  for
      women in connection with maternity. Whilst a wider interpretation than
      that called for by the facts of this case may not be  permissible,  it
      seems to me that the special protection given to women by  EU  law  in
      connection to pregnancy and the subsequent diagnosis of Maya's serious
      illness are sufficient to bring  Ms  Harb  within  Regulation  6(2)(a)
      during the period in question.


  31. In conclusion, I find that Judge Burnett's decision does not contain a
      material error of law and shall stand.




DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material  error  of
