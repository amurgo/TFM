                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms H Cosgrove, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i) The  respondent's  decision  dated  20  March  2018,  refusing  the
         appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         (although these are generic only, and do  not  raise  any  specific
         issues).

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Handley, promulgated on 12 June 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed on 26 June 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge S H Smith, dated 12 July 2018.

 2. Mr Govan did not concede that paragraphs 1 and 3 of the grounds  showed
    error, but he accepted that paragraph 2 made a good point.  At [36]  it
    was accepted that the appellant was due to attend court.  At  [37]  and
    [38], however, the case is decided on the basis of  the  Iranian  state
    having shown no previous adverse interest in the  appellant,  and  that
    all that might be apparent about him would be illegal  exit  from  Iran
    [on which no express conclusion seems  to  be  made]  and  return  from
    Britain; which, applying country guidance,  did  not  show  a  risk  of
    persecution.

 3. Mr Govan said that the apparent finding in favour of the  appellant  at
    [36] might well be only a  slip,  given  the  findings  otherwise  made
    comprehensively against him; but that the decision should be set aside,
    and remitted to the FtT for a fresh hearing.

 4. Ms Cosgrove said that the finding at [36] was positive, and not just an
    error of expression.  She supported that by reference  to  [35],  where
    the judge found it clear that the appellant had been arrested and fined
    under the laws about  alcohol  consumption.   She  submitted  that  the
    findings of previous adverse attention from the state, even in  absence
    of other positive findings, put the appellant  into  a  category  where
    likely scrutiny on return showed a  risk,  and  the  outcome,  applying
    country guidance to the findings, should be  reversed.   Alternatively,
    she said that if the findings were simply muddled, the  outcome  should
    be a rehearing.

 5. I indicated that the decision  would  be  set  aside,  as  agreed,  and
    reserved my decision on what should follow.

 6. I am not satisfied that the FtT made findings clear enough  to  support
    the contrary conclusion.  The decision of  the  FtT  is  therefore  set
    aside, and stands only as a record of what was  said  at  the  hearing.
    The remedy is a rehearing in the FtT, with a  view  to  clear  findings
    being made on the extent to which the appellant establishes his  claims
    (including the mode of his exit  from  Iran,  his  available  modes  of
    return, whether scrutiny is likely, and what any scrutiny may bring  to
    light).

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
