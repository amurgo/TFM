                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For the sake of continuity and ease of reference, I shall refer to  the
    appellant in these  proceedings  as  Secretary  of  State  and  to  the
    respondent as the claimant.

 2. This is the remaking of the decision in the claimant's appeal following
    my error of law decision, promulgated on 8 April 2019, in which I found
    that the First-tier Tribunal had materially erred in law. My  error  of
    law decision is appended, below. In summary, I concluded that the First-
    tier Tribunal had, in light of relevant case-law, been  wrong  to  have
    found  that  the  claimant  had  a  "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship" with her granddaughter, V, within the meaning of  section
    117B(6)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  as
    amended ("NIAA 2002").

 3. I set the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  aside,  retained  the
    appeal in the Upper  Tribunal,  set  the  matter  down  for  a  resumed
    hearing, and, on 3 June 2019, issued directions to the parties.

 4. By way of very brief background, the  claimant  is  a  dual  US/Russian
    national. She has resided in the United Kingdom since August 2011. That
    leave expired on or about 20 March  2017  and  she  has  been  in  this
    country unlawfully ever since. Her article 8 claim is, and  always  has
    been, predicated upon a close relationship with V (now aged 8  �),  one
    that has developed in the context of what can properly be described  as
    at the very least a "complicated" set of familial circumstances.



The issues in this case

 5. As matters now stand, the relevant issues in the claimant's case can be
    summarised as follows:

      i.  does  the  claimant  have  a  "genuine  and  subsisting   parental
         relationship" with V within the meaning of section 117B(6)(a)  NIAA
         2002, and, if she does, would it be unreasonable  to  expect  V  to
         leave the United Kingdom;

     ii. if section 117B(6) NIAA 2002  does  not  apply,  can  the  claimant
         succeed on article 8 grounds in any event.

 6. In light of the findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  there  is  no
    dispute that the claimant has family life with V.

 7. It is accepted by the claimant that she cannot satisfy the requirements
    of the relevant Immigration Rules.



The evidence before me

 8. In remaking the decision, I have  had  full  regard  to  the  following
    sources of evidence:

      i. the Secretary of State's original appeal  bundle,  under  cover  of
         front sheet dated 15 October 2018;

     ii. the claimant's original appeal bundle, indexed and paginated 1-20;

    iii. the claimant's supplementary appeal bundle, served preparation  for
         the resumed hearing, indexed and paginated 1-50;

     iv. oral evidence from the claimant, a full note of which is  contained
         in the record of proceedings.

 9. The substance of the claimant's written evidence  is  contained  within
    three witness statements, dated 21 April 2017 (the Secretary of State's
    bundle), 15 January 2019 (claimant's original appeal  bundle),  and  12
    June 2019 (claimant supplementary appeal bundle).



The parties' submissions

For the Secretary of State

10. Mr Whitwell relied on the Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for  refusal
    letter, dated 14 June 2018. In respect of section 117B(6)(a),  both  of
    V's parents had parental responsibility for her and  provided  relevant
    care. There was no evidence from V's mother.  The  mother  was  clearly
    involved in her daughter's life. Notwithstanding any difficulties  that
    the  mother  might  be  facing,  she  maintained  a  genuine   parental
    relationship with V. V's father was involved in her life. Although  his
    circumstances were complicated, he nevertheless provided care  for  his
    daughter. Mr Whitwell posed the rhetorical questions of why an order of
    the Family Court had not been varied if the mother's circumstances were
    as bad as claimed, and why V's father had not sought to have  her  live
    with him in Surrey.

11. Outside the context of section 117B(6), the existence  of  family  life
    between the claimant and V was confirmed.  However,  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision  was  in  all  the  circumstances  proportionate.  The
    claimant had been in the United Kingdom on a  precarious  basis  before
    her leave to remain ended. She has not  been  in  this  country  for  a
    particularly long period of time. She cannot meet any of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules or the requirements of section 117B(6). It was  noted
    that the psychologist's report on V does not mention  that  the  mother
    has problems with alcohol. The reference in that report  to  "immediate
    family" suggests that V would have support from family  members  beyond
    simply the claimant. In respect of  the  possibility  of  V  developing
    Separation  Anxiety  Disorder,  it  was  noted  that  the  author  used
    speculative terms in her report.

For the claimant

12. Ms Panagiotopoulou relied on  her  skeleton  argument.  She  noted  the
    positive findings made by the First-tier Tribunal. She acknowledged the
    absence of the order from the Family Court, but relied on the  evidence
    that had been provided. It was submitted that V lived within  what  was
    described as a "dysfunctional" family setting. The  mother  was  unable
    and/or unwilling to provide real  emotional  care  for  a  daughter.  V
    clearly spent  a  lot  of  meaningful  time  with  the  claimant.  With
    reference to R (on the application of RK) (section  117B(6):  "parental
    relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC), there  were  distinguishing
    features in the present case, namely  that  V's  parents  had  divorced
    years ago. V was not part of a functioning  family  unit  in  a  normal
    sense. V was about to move school in  September  2019.  This,  combined
    with the circumstances in which  she  currently  found  herself,  would
    create turmoil for  her.  Reliance  was  placed  on  the  psychological
    report. V's  best  interests  clearly  required  the  presence  of  the
    claimant.



Findings of primary fact

13. It is right to say  that  some  aspects  of  what  is  on  any  view  a
    complicated set of familial circumstances are not  entirely  clear-cut.
    However, I do not have to be sure about the evidence, only satisfied on
    the balance of probabilities that it is essentially reliable. The First-
    tier Tribunal found the evidence before it to be credible, noting  that
    much of that evidence had not in fact been challenged by the  Secretary
    of State (see, for  example,  [41]).  In  addition,  the  Secretary  of
    State's challenge to the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  not
    based upon the findings on the  evidence,  but  focused  instead  on  a
    misdirection in law as regards the effects of those findings.

14. With these points in mind, and having regard to the updated written and
    oral evidence before me, I find that  I  have  been  presented  with  a
    reliable and truthful account of all relevant circumstances  pertaining
    to claimant and,  importantly,  V.  Consistency  and  plausibility  run
    through the evidence as a whole. Whilst it certainly  would  have  been
    better if I had received additional evidence  from  V's  mother  and/or
    father, and if I had been provided with the order of the  Family  Court
    (subject to any relevant disclosure issues),  these  omissions  do  not
    materially undermine the evidential picture.

15. I find that V is a dual British/US national and has  lived  her  entire
    life in the United Kingdom. V is the daughter  of  the  claimant's  own
    daughter. I find that the claimant established a close  bond  with  her
    granddaughter from the point of her arrival in 2011. It is clearly  the
    case that this close bond has, over the course  of  time,  strengthened
    significantly as result of the factual circumstances I now set out.

16. V's parents separated soon after her birth. I am satisfied that  mother
    suffered from post-natal depression and, as the claimant  has  put  it,
    she "did not take to motherhood". I accept that the claimant  took  the
    decision to remain in the United Kingdom (lawfully at  that  stage)  to
    help with her granddaughter's care in what  were  even  at  that  early
    stage, difficult circumstances. I find that the claimant took an active
    role in V's life.

17. I find that in early 2012 the claimant  and  V,  who  had  been  living
    together in London, moved, with V going to  live  with  her  father  in
    Surrey whilst the claimant went to Hampshire. It appears  as  though  V
    spent the weekdays at school there, living with her  father,  and  went
    back to London to spend weekends with  her  mother.  I  find  that  the
    claimant was seeing V regularly during this period. At some point,  the
    claimant moved into a lodge in the grounds of  V's  father's  property.
    The claimant has resided there ever since.

18. V's father divorced her mother. I find that in June  2014,  V's  father
    married again. His new wife moved into the Surrey property. I find that
    the father and his wife had two children together.

19. At some point, and I cannot be sure as to when this was, an  order  was
    obtained from the Family Court concerning V's living  arrangements.  On
    the evidence as a whole, it is more likely than not that V was to spend
    50% of the time with her mother and 50% with her father. However, I  am
    also satisfied that V was not  to  live  with  her  mother  alone,  but
    required the presence of  additional  adult  in  the  household.  I  am
    satisfied that this was an account of the mother having what must  have
    been relatively significant difficulties in respect  of  her  parenting
    ability. These cannot have been so serious as to  warrant  V's  removal
    from that setting. However, I am willing to accept that at  least  part
    of another's problems arose from misuse of  alcohol  to  a  greater  or
    lesser extent. I accept the claimant evidence that in 2012 a nanny,  L,
    lived with V and her mother in  London,  where  V  was  then  going  to
    school. In January 2018, L left her position. I find that the  claimant
    moved into the London address in place of L and undertook a  good  deal
    of responsibility for V's emotional and practical well-being. I  accept
    the claimant evidence that the mother was not always present and  would
    on occasion be out all night or even  out  of  the  country  for  short
    holidays abroad.

20. The question of the mother's parenting ability is a  consistent  thread
    in the claimant's evidence. It is of course possible that the  claimant
    has significantly exaggerated what she has said about her own daughter.
    However, taking the evidence as a whole, including that tested by cross-
    examination at the hearing before me, I regard what  she  has  said  is
    being essentially truthful. The tenor of her evidence has  reflected  a
    genuine desire to have helped her daughter, but  at  the  same  time  a
    resignation that matters simply have not improved over time and are, in
    her view, unlikely to do so in the future. I do accept that V's  mother
    has limited parenting skills and  that  assistance  from  the  claimant
    (whether this has been asked for not) has been very important,  if  not
    essential.

21. A specific example of the mother's difficulties with alcohol  has  been
    given in the most recent witness statement from the claimant. This  was
    also highlighted in the oral evidence. I accept that a recent  incident
    occurred in which the mother failed to pick V up from  school.  I  find
    that  when  the  claimant  contacted  the  mother,   the   latter   was
    intoxicated. The claimant believes that the mother may be seeking  help
    with her alcohol dependency, but this is unclear.

22. I find that the claimant's relationship with her own  daughter  has  to
    all intents and purposes, broken down. This is, I accept, due  in  part
    to a belief on the daughter's part that the claimant has sided with V's
    father,  and  also  due  to  the  claimant's  desire  to  produce   the
    psychologist report in this appeal, something strongly objected  to  by
    V's mother.

23. I find that a housekeeper has now been employed by the  mother  in  the
    London property.

24. As matters stand, V resides in  London  during  the  week  because  she
    attends a local school.

25. I accept that V will be moving school in September 2019. That school is
    also in London.

26. I turn now to the father's circumstances. I accept that he is currently
    going through a protracted divorce with the wife  that  he  married  in
    2014.  It  would  appear  as  though  the  divorce  is  proving  to  be
    acrimonious in many respects. I accept that there is an  order  of  the
    Family Court preventing V's father from living in the  Surrey  property
    whilst his wife and their two children are  staying  there.  V  is  not
    permitted to reside at that property whilst the wife is there. I accept
    that the wife then moves out of the house and resides elsewhere  whilst
    the father comes back in and stays there for a limited period. I  fully
    accept that V does not have a good relationship with the  wife  or  her
    step-siblings.

27. To further complicate matters, I find that  V's  father  is  in  a  new
    relationship and that he has a new baby with  his  current  partner.  I
    find that the father stays at a London property when he  is  unable  to
    reside in Surrey due to his wife's residence and  the  requirements  of
    the court order.

28. I accept the claimant's evidence and that provided  previously  by  V's
    father in his statement, that the latter is often out of United Kingdom
    on business.

29. I find that V has been generally living with her father at  the  London
    property when she is not residing with her mother.

30. I accept that V's father would like her to live with him on a permanent
    basis and perhaps attend school in Surrey. On the evidence  before  me,
    that is a decision that would be taken by the father if  he  considered
    the circumstances were appropriate and subject  to  what  may  well  be
    objections by the mother.

31. During this time, I find that it has been difficult for the claimant to
    spend as much time with V as she had in the past and  as  she  and  her
    granddaughter would like. I accept her oral evidence that at the moment
    V is spending every weekend with her and half height-term  holidays  as
    well.  These  are   temporary   arrangements,   which,   in   all   the
    circumstances, are in my view entirely credible: V's parents  are  both
    experiencing problematic issues of their own, in one way or another.

32. I turn to the psychological report by Dr Tamara Licht, dated 12 January
    2019 and included in the claimant's supplementary appeal bundle. I find
    that the author is suitably qualified and has expertise in  respect  of
    the matters on which she has provided her opinion. I place  significant
    weight upon her evidence. On the basis of the report I find that V does
    not currently suffer from any mental health problems. I  appreciate  Mr
    Whitwell's point on the use of certain speculative terms such  as  "if"
    and "may" in the report. To this extent, the expert is having  to  look
    into the future when giving a prognosis. I bear  that  in  mind  in  my
    assessment of the report as a whole. However, at page 25 of the bundle,
    Dr Licht does conclude that V's attachment to the claimant is  "secure"
    and that it is "highly likely that if [V] was to no longer be  able  to
    have physical contact with her  grandmother,  as  a  result  of  [E  K]
    potentially leaving the UK, [V] could  develop  symptoms  related  with
    Separation Anxiety Disorder". Thus, speculation is tempered by the  use
    of the phrase "highly likely".

33. Mr Whitwell is also correct  to  note  that  the  author  refers  to  V
    depending on her "immediate family". On the  face  of  it,  that  would
    appear to refer to a wider circle than simply the claimant. I find that
    it is more likely than not that this phrase was used intentionally  and
    that V's mother and father do play meaningful  parental  roles  in  her
    life, subject to what I say about their limitations

34. Finally, under the sub- heading of "prognosis", Dr Licht states that  V
    if were to develop Separation Anxiety Disorder, certain  therapies  may
    be able to assist her. I find that to be the case.



Conclusions on section 117B(6)(a) NIAA 2002

35. Section 117B(6) NIAA 2002 provides:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)       the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with a qualifying child, and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
         the United Kingdom."

36. In [43]-[44] of RK, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb provided  the  following
    guidance:

         "43.     I agree with Mr Mandalia's formulation that, in effect, an
         individual must "step into the shoes  of  a  parent"  in  order  to
         establish a "parental  relationship".    If  the  role  they  play,
         whether as a relative or friend of  the  family,  is  as  a  caring
         relative or friend but not so as to take on the role  of  a  parent
         then it cannot be said that they  have  a  "parental  relationship"
         with the child.  It is perhaps obvious to state that  "carers"  are
         not per se "parents."  A child may have carers who do not step into
         the shoes of their parents but look after the  child  for  specific
         periods of time (for example whilst the parents  are  at  work)  or
         even longer term (for example  where  the  parents  are  travelling
         abroad for a  holiday  or  family  visit).   Those  carers  may  be
         professionally employed; they may be  relatives;  or  they  may  be
         friends.  In all those cases, it may properly be said that there is
         an element of dependency between the child and his or  her  carers.
         However, that alone would not, in  my  judgment,  give  rise  to  a
         "parental relationship."

         44.      If a non-biological parent ("third party")  caring  for  a
         child claims such a relationship, its existence  will  depend  upon
         all the circumstances including whether or  not  there  are  others
         (usually the biologically parents) who  have  such  a  relationship
         with the child also. It is unlikely, in my judgment, that a  person
         will be able to establish they have taken on the role of  a  parent
         when the biological parents continue to be involved in the  child's
         life as the child's parents as in a case such as the present  where
         the children and parents continue to live and function together  as
         a family.  It will be difficult, if not impossible, to say  that  a
         third party has "stepped into the shoes" of a parent.

37. This view was essentially approved in the context of a statutory appeal
    at [55] of Ortega (remittal; bias; parental relationship)  [2018]  UKUT
    00298 (IAC).

38. There is now the judgement of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AB  (Jamaica)
    [2019] WLR(D) 227. The Court emphasised the point that cases  involving
    questions of parental  relationships  are  highly  fact-sensitive.  The
    paragraphs from RK, quoted above, were approved. The Court  also  found
    that there was no requirement for "direct parental care" to be given by
    the individual claiming to have a genuine  parental  relationship  with
    the relevant child.

39. As I mentioned in my error of law decision, there may be  circumstances
    in which a grandparent can be said to have stepped into the shoes of  a
    parent where the two biological parents are  involved  in  the  child's
    life, although examples of this will be exceptional.

40. For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the  claimant  does  not
    have a "genuine parental relationship" with V.  I  emphasise  the  fact
    that these reasons are to be viewed cumulatively.

41. First, it is undoubtedly  the  case  that  the  claimant  has  provided
    consistent and strong emotional support for  her  granddaughter  during
    what has been a life made more difficult for  her  (the  granddaughter)
    because of the circumstances of her biological parents. In short terms,
    whilst much around has been uncertain inconsistent, claimant has  stood
    as a constant source of love and uncomplicated devotion.

42. In addition, the claimant has, through the time spent with V over time,
    provided something of a haven. In addition to the emotional  importance
    of this, mentioned above, there has been a  practical  side,  namely  a
    physical space in which V has been able to  reside  at  fairly  regular
    intervals and get away from what must have been difficult (or at  least
    at times uncomfortable) circumstances in the other locations  at  which
    she has lived.

43. Second, it is case  that  the  claimant  has  not  made  the  important
    decisions in V's life, whether that  is  in  respect  of  schooling  or
    indeed where she has in fact resided over the course  of  time.  It  is
    clear that these matters have been in  the  hands  of  her  mother  and
    father, notwithstanding disagreements between them as to what might  be
    best for their daughter.

44. Third, the claimant does not have parental responsibility by virtue  of
    an order from the Family  Court.  That  is  not  decisive,  but  it  is
    relevant.

45. Fourth, despite the shortcomings of  the  mother  and  the  complicated
    personal  life  of  father,  they  have  both  maintained  a   parental
    relationship with V. Both have been  involved  in  important  decision-
    making  (see  above).  Both  have  accommodated  and  maintained  their
    daughter. When the evidence before me, cannot  properly  be  said  that
    they have abdicated their parental responsibilities towards V.  I  note
    that despite the mother's problems, there has  been  no  order  from  a
    court preventing her from caring for V at all. The claimant is not  the
    primary carer of V.

46. Fifth, the report of Dr Licht did not go so far as to indicate that the
    bond between the  claimant  and  V  is  so  strong  as  to  effectively
    constitute a  parent/child  relationship.  There  is  no  other  expert
    evidence, such as a report by an Independent Social Worker, which would
    support the existence of such a relationship.

47. Sixth, I acknowledge Ms Panagiotopoulou's point concerning RK  and  the
    fact that in the present case the parents are divorced. This  would  in
    principle  count  in  the  claimant's  favour.  However,  I  note   the
    observation of Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer at [39] of  SR  (Subsisting
    Parental Relationship - s117B(6)) Pakistan [2018] UKUT 00334 (IAC),  in
    which she said:

         "There are likely to be many cases in which both  parents  play  an
         important role in  their  child's  life  and  therefore  both  have
         subsisting parental relationships with the child, even  though  the
         child resides with one parent and not the other."

48. Thus, the breakup of the family unit, whilst potentially of  relevance,
    may not, on the particular facts of the case,  represent  a  matter  of
    real significance. In light of my findings and other  conclusions,  the
    fact that V's  parents  are  divorced  and  do  not  have  an  amicable
    relationship, has  a  limited  bearing  on  their  subsisting  parental
    relationships.

49. Bringing all of the above together, whilst for  reasons  that  I  shall
    come to in due course, there are compelling features of the  claimant's
    relationship with V, this is not one  of  those  exceptional  cases  in
    which it can be said that the claimant has effectively stepped into the
    shoes of a biological parent.

50. The claimant cannot therefore succeed by reference to  section  117B(6)
    NIAA 2002.



Conclusions on the wider article 8 assessment

51. I turn to a wider assessment of the claimant's article 8 case.

52. It is accepted that the claimant has family life with V. Even  if  this
    issue was in dispute, I  would  unhesitatingly  conclude  that  such  a
    relationship existed. On the evidence before me, the bond  between  the
    claimant and her granddaughter has, if not since  birth,  then  clearly
    over the course of time, gone significantly beyond the  sense  of  love
    that would ordinarily be expected between two such individuals.

53. The claimant has a private life in the United Kingdom, although seen in
    isolation from her relationship with V, this must be said to be  fairly
    tenuous.

54. The decision of the Secretary of State to refuse the  claimant's  human
    rights claim constitutes an interference with family life  and,  albeit
    by a narrow margin, the private life.

55. The Secretary of State's decision is in accordance  with  the  law  and
    pursues  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining  effective   immigration
    control.

56. In undertaking the proportionality exercise,  I  set  out  the  factors
    weighing in claimant's favour, and those counting against her.

Factors in the claimant's favour

57. V is a child affected by the decision under appeal. I therefore make  a
    best interests assessment. As is, I trust, clear from my  findings  and
    previous conclusions, V has found herself in a very  difficult  set  of
    familial circumstances, none of which are of course of her own  making.
    On the one hand,  her  mother  has  fairly  significant  problems  with
    alcohol misuse and has struggled  to  provide  stable  support  to  her
    daughter. There has been animosity from the mother towards the  father,
    and it is likely that this will continue. On the other hand, her father
    has created (if that is the correct term) a very  complicated  personal
    life for himself. His unsuccessful marriages, current relationship, and
    the other  children  arising  therefrom,  together  with  his  business
    activities overseas, have combined to remove stability from  this  side
    of V's life.

58. In the midst of this, is a young  girl  who,  whilst  not  wanting  for
    material possessions, undoubtedly has all the emotional needs of an 8 �
    year-old.

59. A, if not the, constant in her life has been the claimant, particularly
    in respect of emotional support and a person to whom she turns for  fun
    and stability. V's current circumstances, with her father's divorce not
    yet finalised and his commitment to  a  new  partner  and  their  baby,
    combined with the fact that she is due to change school in September of
    this year, enhances the reliance she places on the claimant.

60. The report of Dr Licht provides an important perspective as to what the
    future for V might hold. The report is in no way decisive, but it  does
    provide a sufficiently solid platform upon which I am able to  conclude
    that a rupturing of the relationship between  the  claimant  and  V  is
    likely  to  have  adverse  consequences  for  the  young  girl.   Those
    consequences may well be  mitigated  by  treatment,  but  my  view  the
    avoidance of such problems  arising  in  the  first  place  is  a  very
    important factor. The claimant's presence in V's life is, at  least  as
    matters currently stand, a significant means  of  providing  the  child
    with at least part of  the  support  mechanism  she  needs  during  the
    difficult familial scenario which surrounds her.

61. I conclude that it is very strongly in V's best interests  for  her  to
    have the claimant in her life on as constant a basis as possible.

62. I also take into account the fact that the  claimant  as  sacrificed  a
    good deal on her part in order to provide the care to V that  she  has.
    There is no question of the claimant wishing to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom simply because she prefers it. She has the nationality  of  two
    other countries and there is nothing to suggest that she could not live
    a relatively comfortable existence in either of them.

Factors in the Secretary of State's favour

63. The public interest in maintaining effective immigration control is, in
    and of itself, strong.

64. In this case, the claimant cannot meet the requirements of any  of  the
    relevant Rules, nor has she been able to rely on section  117B(6)  NIAA
    2002. I place additional weight on this.

65. The claimant's private life has been established and conducted during a
    period of precarious status  and  then  unlawful  status.  Leaving  her
    relationship with V to one  side,  I  would  significantly  reduce  the
    weight attributable to her private life in the United Kingdom.

66.  In  respect  of  the  family  life  she  enjoys  with  V,  whilst  not
    specifically addressed in section 117B, the precarious/unlawful  status
    is nonetheless a relevant consideration. However,  as  Rhuppiah  [2018]
    WLR 5536 indicates in respect of private life, a  reduction  in  weight
    may be mitigated where there are compelling features of  the  protected
    right in question. In this case, for reasons set out above,  there  are
    strong compelling features of the family  life  such  that  significant
    weight is still attributable to it.

Neutral factors

67. The claimant speaks excellent English and she  is  clearly  financially
    independent. These factors are of neutral value to the article 8 claim.

Final evaluative judgment

68. Having weighed up the competing factors, I conclude  that  the  balance
    tips in favour of the claimant. In light of the strength  of  V's  best
    interests, in particular  as  they  currently  stand,  removal  of  the
    claimant in consequence of the Secretary  of  State's  refusal  of  her
    human rights claim would be disproportionate. The margin of success  is
    not wide, but it very rarely would be.

69. I have emphasised the importance of V's current circumstances. This  is
    because they are  at  present  particularly  difficult  and  unsettled.
    However, it may be that matters relating to her father's  circumstances
    are resolved in due course. It may be that her mother obtains effective
    treatment for her problems.  This  is  a  case  in  which  there  is  a
    realistic prospect of V's situation improving. This in  turn  may  well
    have an impact on the claimant's ability to  obtain  further  leave  to
    remain in due course. She should not be under the misapprehension  that
    her success in this appeal will inevitably lead to  settlement  in  the
    United Kingdom.

70. The claimant succeeds on article 8 grounds.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing E K's appeal on human rights grounds.


Anonymity direction

A  direction  was  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and   in   all   the
circumstances, including in  particular  the  fact  that  a  child  plays  a
central role in  this  appeal,  I  maintain  that  direction  in  the  Upper
Tribunal.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant ("the Secretary of State") against
    the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Oxlade   (the   judge),
    promulgated on 30 January 2019, by which she allowed the appeal of Miss
    E K ("the Claimant"), a dual national of  the  USA  and  Ukraine.   The
    appeal was against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  14
    June 2018, refusing the Claimant's human rights  claim,  which  had  in
    turn been made on 27 April 2017.

 2. In essence, the Claimant's case was as follows.  Having arrived in this
    country in August 2011 as a Tier 2 migrant, she became heavily involved
    in the life of her granddaughter, V, who was born in 2010.  V's  family
    circumstances were complicated.  Her mother (the  Claimant's  daughter)
    had suffered from post-natal depression  and  had  separated  from  V's
    father when the child was still a baby.   The  Claimant  had  taken  an
    active role in V's life, providing  emotional  and  practical  support.
    V's father remarried and had children with his new wife.   During  this
    period V was living with both her mother and her father,  the  majority
    of the time  being  spent  with  the  former.   However,  the  Claimant
    continued to see  a  lot  of  V.   The  family's  dynamic  was  further
    complicated when the father separated from his new  wife  and  began  a
    relationship with another woman who, at the time of the hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, was pregnant.  The Claimant's case  on  appeal
    was essentially that she had become a very important part of  V's  life
    to the extent that her removal from the United  Kingdom  would  violate
    protected Article 8 rights.




The judge's decision

 3. The judge had to deal with a difficult preliminary issue.  A report had
    been commissioned from a psychologist  in  respect  of  V's  wellbeing.
    Initially V's mother had  consented  to  this  report  being  produced.
    However, upon reading it she changed her mind and objected to it  being
    put in evidence for the purposes of the Claimant's appeal.  Ultimately,
    the report was not adduced in evidence (see [10]-[13] of the decision).



 4. Having described the evidence that was before her in some  detail,  the
    judge sets out her findings and conclusions at  [39]-[49].   She  notes
    the absence of  any  provisions  within  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the
    Rules")   relating   to   relationships   between   grandchildren   and
    grandparents.  That relationship in the present appeal  was,  concluded
    the judge, of singular importance given the very close bond established
    between the two of them, a  bond  that  has  arisen  out  of  difficult
    familial circumstances.  The circumstances are detailed in [41]  and  I
    have summarised them in paragraph 2, above.

 5. It having been accepted by her representative that the  Claimant  could
    not meet any of the provisions of the  Rules,  the  judge  goes  on  to
    consider Article 8 in its wider  context.   The  judge  concludes  that
    there was family life between the Claimant  and  V.  The  Secretary  of
    State's  decision  was  said  to  constitute  a  sufficiently   serious
    interference in the Claimant's family life in order to  engage  Article
    8. A number of factors arising under section 117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") are considered.

 6.  At  [47]  the  judge  poses  the  question,  "is  there  is  'parental
    relationship'?" (this being with reference to section  117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act).  She was of  the  view  that  the  term  was  undefined  but
    sufficiently wide enough to cover the  care  of  a  child  by,  amongst
    others, a grandparent.  On the facts of the case before her, the  judge
    concluded that the Claimant had effectively acted as a  "third  parent"
    to  V,  that  she  had  exerted  a  "stabilising  influence"   on   her
    granddaughter, and had provided a "haven" for her in  difficult  times.
    As a result, the judge concluded that the Claimant had a  "genuine  and
    subsisting  parental  relationship"  for  the   purposes   of   section
    117B(6)(a) of the 2002 Act.  At [48] the judge concludes that in  light
    of V's circumstances it would not be reasonable for her  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  On this basis, the Claimant's appeal was allowed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The Secretary of State asserts that the judge  misdirected  herself  in
    respect of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.  It is said that she failed
    to take into account relevant  case  law  including  Ortega  (remittal;
    bias; parental relationship) [2018] UKUT 00298  (IAC)  and  R  (on  the
    application of RK) (section 117B(6): "parental relationship" IJR [2016]
    UKUT 00031 (IAC), and that it was not  sustainable  to  have  concluded
    that the Claimant had a "parental relationship" with V.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyes  on
    19 February 2019.  He observed that the judge  had  arguably  erred  in
    reaching the core conclusion that she did and that there  was  arguably
    nothing exceptional about this case.




The hearing before me

 9. For the Secretary of State, Mr Whitwell provided  a  skeleton  argument
    upon which he relied, together with the grounds of appeal.

10. Ms Panagiotopoulou submitted that there were no material errors in  the
    judge's decision and that the grounds amounted to nothing more  than  a
    disagreement.  She emphasised the judge's findings of fact at [40]-[41]
    and submitted that a holistic view of the evidence had been taken.  The
    Claimant had had a deep involvement in V's life since  birth  and  that
    that life had involved a good  degree  of  "turmoil".   The  judge  was
    entitled to have concluded that the Claimant acted as a "third parent".
     In consequence, she had been entitled to conclude  that  there  was  a
    "parental relationship" within the meaning of section 117B(6)(a) of the
    2002 Act.  The cases of Ortega and RK  were  distinguishable  on  their
    facts.

11. In reply, Mr Whitwell submitted that section  117B(6)  simply  did  not
    contemplate  the  ability  of  a  grandparent  to   have   a   parental
    relationship.  In any event, even if such a relationship were  possible
    in principle, it could not be the case on  the  facts  of  the  present
    appeal.  He submitted that the judge had  not  allowed  the  Claimant's
    appeal  on  the  basis  of  exceptional  or  compelling   compassionate
    circumstances but solely on the basis of section 117B(6), and this  was
    something that she was not entitled to have done.



Decision on error of law

12. I conclude that the judge has materially erred in law.

13. The findings of  fact  in  respect  of  the  relationship  between  the
    Claimant and V are clear and in any event have not been  challenged  by
    the Secretary of State.  It was certainly open to the judge to conclude
    that there was family life between the Claimant and her  granddaughter,
    as it was for her to conclude that the  refusal  of  the  human  rights
    claim constituted a sufficiently serious interference with that  family
    life.

14. The central issue is the application of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act
    to the Claimant's case.  That provision states:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)       the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with a qualifying child, and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
         the United Kingdom."

15. Although it is right that the term "parental relationship"  in  section
    117B(6)(a) is not defined within the statute, it has been considered by
    the Upper Tribunal on two occasions; in Ortega and RK.  In [43]-[44] of
    RK, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb provided the following guidance:

         "43.     I agree with Mr Mandalia's formulation that, in effect, an
         individual must "step into the shoes  of  a  parent"  in  order  to
         establish a "parental  relationship".    If  the  role  they  play,
         whether as a relative or friend of  the  family,  is  as  a  caring
         relative or friend but not so as to take on the role  of  a  parent
         then it cannot be said that they  have  a  "parental  relationship"
         with the child.  It is perhaps obvious to state that  "carers"  are
         not per se "parents."  A child may have carers who do not step into
         the shoes of their parents but look after the  child  for  specific
         periods of time (for example whilst the parents  are  at  work)  or
         even longer term (for example  where  the  parents  are  travelling
         abroad for a  holiday  or  family  visit).   Those  carers  may  be
         professionally employed; they may be  relatives;  or  they  may  be
         friends.  In all those cases, it may properly be said that there is
         an element of dependency between the child and his or  her  carers.
         However, that alone would not, in  my  judgment,  give  rise  to  a
         "parental relationship."

         44.      If a non-biological parent ("third party")  caring  for  a
         child claims such a relationship, its existence  will  depend  upon
         all the circumstances including whether or  not  there  are  others
         (usually the biologically parents) who  have  such  a  relationship
         with the child also. It is unlikely, in my judgment, that a  person
         will be able to establish they have taken on the role of  a  parent
         when the biological parents continue to be involved in the  child's
         life as the child's parents as in a case such as the present  where
         the children and parents continue to live and function together  as
         a family.  It will be difficult, if not impossible, to say  that  a
         third party has "stepped into the shoes" of a parent.

    This view was essentially approved in the context of a statutory appeal
    at [55] of Ortega.

16. Both RK and Ortega had been published at the time of the hearing before
    the judge.  Unfortunately, she was either not referred to them  or,  if
    she was, failed to address the guidance provided therein. That omission
    is significant in this case because a key element of that  guidance  is
    that in situations where both biological parents in fact take an active
    role in a child's upbringing, as was clearly the case here, it will, in
    the great majority of cases, be very difficult for a third party,  such
    as the Claimant, to be able to show that they have  "stepped  into  the
    shoes" of a parent.

17. On the facts as found by the judge, whilst there clearly was  a  strong
    bond between the Claimant and V, the  former  had  never  had  parental
    responsibility in a formal sense, had never been a  primary  carer  for
    her granddaughter, and indeed had not been living with  V  for  even  a
    significant minority of the time.

18. It is true that in [47] the judge found that the Claimant had acted  as
    a "third parent" to V. However, this was done in  the  absence  of  any
    reference to the guidance provided by the Upper Tribunal and  in  light
    of a factual matrix that would, at least on  its  face,  have  made  it
    difficult to reach a sustainable conclusion in the Claimant's favour.

19. That is not to say that it is impossible to conceive  of  scenarios  in
    which a grandparent might acquire a "parental  responsibility":  as  RK
    makes clear, cases are highly fact-sensitive. However, it would need to
    be shown that  the  relevant  legal  approach  was  carefully  followed
    (including a consideration of the guidance provided by case-law),  with
    a sufficiently strong underlying factual basis, for this to be so.

20. In summary, the judge erred by failing to direct herself to  or,  as  a
    matter of substance, applying, the relevant guidance on the meaning  of
    "parental relationship" within section 117B(6)(a) of the 2002 Act.

21. I have gone on to consider whether it can be said that the judge  would
    have allowed the appeal on an alternative basis, having due  regard  to
    her findings of fact.  I acknowledge that on a reading of [39] and  the
    first sentence in [40], it could  potentially  be  said  that  she  was
    concluding that  there  were  exceptional  or  particularly  compelling
    circumstances in the case.  Having said that, what  follows  thereafter
    is an assessment of the factual situation, a  consequent  finding  that
    family  life  existed,  and  then  a   progression   through   to   the
    proportionality exercise.  At this crucial step, the judge is  squarely
    resting her decision on the basis of section 117B(6), not  on  a  wider
    Article 8 balancing exercise.

22. Therefore, it cannot be said with sufficient confidence  that  she  was
    intending to make either a primary or an alternative conclusion founded
    on a wider Article 8 assessment. Nor is it the case that, on the  facts
    found, it was inevitable,  or  close  to  being  inevitable,  that  the
    Claimant's appeal would have been allowed in any event.

23. In light of the above I conclude that the error in respect  of  section
    117B(6)(a) is material and I set the judge's decision aside.




Disposal

24. In the usual course of events I would be remaking the decision in  this
    appeal based upon the evidence before me.  However, Ms  Panagiotopoulou
    informed me that the Claimant was seeking to adduce the  psychologist's
    report referred to earlier in my decision and dealt with by  the  judge
    as a preliminary issue.  I was told that  the  Claimant's  relationship
    with V's mother, which had already been strained, had now  broken  down
    altogether.  I was asked to adjourn  the  appeal,  make  an  order  for
    disclosure of the psychologist's report and then hold a resumed hearing
    in due course.

25. Mr Whitwell did not object to this course of action.

26. I informed the representatives that I would consider the  issue  of  an
    order for disclosure, subject to my view on the error of law issue  and
    whether such an order would in all  the  circumstances  be  appropriate
    with reference to rules 2, 5(3)(d), 15, and 16 of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules 2008.

27. I have decided to adjourn this appeal  and  have  it  set  down  for  a
    resumed hearing in due course. A Directions Notice (including any order
    I make in relation to the  psychologist's  report)  will  be  sent  out
    separately.

28. The two core issues to be addressed at the resumed hearing are:

      i.  Does  the  Claimant  have  a  "genuine  and  subsisting   parental
         relationship" with V within the meaning of  section  117B(6)(a)  of
         the 2002 Act and, if she does, would it be unreasonable to expect V
         to leave the United Kingdom;

     ii. If section 117B(6) does not apply, can the Claimant  succeed  on  a
         wider basis Article 8 basis.







Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of  law
and I set it aside.

I adjourn this appeal for a resumed hearing in due course.
