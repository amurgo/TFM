                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M  Hollingworth  on  15
           April 2016 against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge Callender Smith who had allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal
           seeking settlement under Appendix FM as the  spouse  of  British
           Citizen in a decision and  reasons  promulgated  on  26  October
           2015.


      2.    The Respondent is a national of Jamaica, born  on  18  September
           1986.  There was no dispute about  the  genuine  nature  of  the
           marriage nor  its  subsistence.    The  issue  was  whether  the
           financial requirements (applicable at a  reduced  level  because
           the sponsor received the Carer's Allowance) were met.  The judge
           found that the financial requirements were met because the Entry
           Clearance Officer  had  misunderstood  which  of  the  sponsor's
           children were living at home.  The requirement was  �322.34  and
           the sponsor's income after rent was paid was �382.58.


      3.    Permission to appeal was granted because it was considered  that
           it was arguable that the judge had erred by failing to  set  out
           the evidential basis for his findings and by failing to  explain
           the issues surrounding admissibility.


      4.    Standard directions were made by the tribunal.


      Submissions


      5.    Mr Amunwa for the Appellant relied on  the  grounds  of  onwards
           appeal and his skeleton argument.  In summary he argued that the
           judge had been entitled to reach his  findings.   Plainly  there
           had been no serious opposition by  the  Home  Office  Presenting
           Officer who had been at  the  first  instance  hearing  and  the
           decision had accordingly been brief.


      6.    The tribunal considered it appropriate at this stage to  examine
           the bundle submitted by the Entry Clearance  Officer,  with  the
           assistance of both representatives.   It  was  agreed  that  the
           Entry Clearance Officer's  interpretation  of  the  Amended  Tax
           Credit Award and associated documents had been mistaken.  As the
           judge had found at [19] of his decision and reasons, only  three
           children were part of the sponsor's household at the date of the
           entry clearance application, not five  as  the  Entry  Clearance
           Officer had believed.


      7.    Mr Norton for the Respondent wished to add nothing further.




      No material error of law finding


      8.    In the tribunal's judgment the grant of permission to appeal was
           generous, although the extreme brevity of the  judge's  decision
           perhaps invited a grant.  Even when  the  appeal  had  not  been
           strongly opposed, it would have been sensible to have  explained
           that the ultimate source of the evidence  for  judge's  decision
           was within the documents  submitted  with  the  entry  clearance
           application, not in any post decision material.  That would have
           avoided disputes about admissibility.


      9.    While decisions of unnecessary length are  undesirable,  in  the
           present  appeal  somewhat  greater  clarity  of  reasoning   was
           desirable.  Nevertheless, it is now plain that the judge reached
           a sustainable decision on the evidence before him  and  that  no
           admissibility issues arise.  Any error of law was not  material.
           The onwards appeal must be dismissed.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  a
material error on a point of law and stands unchanged
