                            DECISION AND REASONS


Background

 1. The decision on error of law and directions made  on  9  June  2016  is
    appendixed to this  decision.   The  appellant  in  this  case  is  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department.  However  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal, where Mr Z was the
    appellant.

 2. As  indicated  in  my  decision  dated  20  June  2016  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination on risk on return contained an  error  of  law
    capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal and  that  part  of  the
    decision was set aside.  I further indicated, in adjournment directions
    dated 21 July 2016, that Judge  Dineen  also  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal under Article 8 on the sole basis of his  findings  on  risk  on
    return.  Therefore, the appellant's appeal also  falls  to  be  re-made
    under Article 8.  Judge Dineen's findings of fact were preserved.

 3. The appeal was initially adjourned to await the outcome  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal country guidance case of SSH & HR (illegal exit: failed asylum
    seekers) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308  (IAC).   The  appellant  was  given
    additional time to provide further information in respect of  both  his
    Article 8 appeal and the issues raised in the  country  guidance.   The
    appellant's representatives  lodged  a  consolidated  bundle  including
    supplementary witness statements for the appellant and for Mrs  Turner,
    his foster mother, further information including a  BBC  news  article,
    the appellant's college reference and an expert report  from  Professor
    Joff�, dated 26 August 2016.

The Hearing

 4. Although the skeleton argument  from  the  appellant's  representatives
    sought to re-open the issues of credibility  Mr  Abdar  quite  properly
    conceded that these issues were not before me and the skeleton argument
    was only relied on in respect of risk on return  and  Article  8  (from
    paragraphs [21 to 37]).

 5. I heard oral evidence from the appellant and  from  Mrs  Turner.   Both
    witnesses  adopted  their  supplementary   witness   statements.    The
    appellant gave  evidence  with  the  assistance  of  a  Kurdish  Sorani
    interpreter and  confirmed  at  the  outset  that  he  understood  that
    interpreter.  The evidence and the submissions of both parties  is  set
    out in full in the Record of Proceedings.  At the end of the hearing  I
    reserved my decision which I now give.

Risk on Return

 6. The appellant in written and oral evidence indicated that he  continued
    to fear returning to Iran and that he feared what would happen to  him.
    The appellant said that he is a Kurd and that he has seen on  the  news
    how Kurds are treated by the Iranians.  He also referred to recent news
    (a news article was attached) about an Iranian British woman jailed for
    no reason.  He referred to having seen Kurds being  hanged  on  YouTube
    videos.  The appellant again confirmed that he does not know where  his
    parents are and that he has tried to find them but cannot and  the  Red
    Cross do not have any news of his family.  Mrs  Turner  also  confirmed
    that she had tried to find his family and  had  been  unable  to.   The
    appellant confirmed that there was no one else in Iran that he knew.

 7. It was the appellant's case that he lived in Iran until he was 8  years
    old and that when he was 8 he was taken to live in Iraqi Kurdistan  and
    was educated there.  Judge Dineen  set  out  the  appellant's  case  in
    relation to his claimed difficulties including that his  father  stated
    they could not return to Iran from Iraq because of political  problems.



 8. Judge Dineen's findings which were preserved were as follows:

         "42. I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  father  was  in
             possession of an Iranian warrant for his arrest as  stated  by
             the appellant.  This is because of the  evidence  as  to  such
             warrants referred to  in  paragraph  27  of  the  most  recent
             refusal letter.  I do not find it credible  that  the  Iranian
             authorities would give the subject of a warrant a copy  of  it
             prior to arresting him, thus making it clear to  him  that  he
             should abscond.

         43.  In any event, the appellant's father had returned to a Kurdish
             area of Iraq and there is no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
             Iranian authorities could execute a warrant against him there.
              I am not satisfied that flight from Iraq to Europe would have
             been necessary to avoid the consequences of such a warrant.

         44.  Given the details of any involvement of the appellant's father
             in the activities of the KDPI  was  not  communicated  to  the
             appellant, I am not satisfied that his mother would have  told
             him that the people they regularly visited  were  involved  in
             the activities of that organisation.

         45.  The accounts of visits by them to  the  family  home,  and  of
             evenings away from that home taken by the appellant's  father,
             are not specifically  linked  to  any  evidence  of  political
             activity, and are consistent  with  many  other  explanations,
             including social activity by the appellant's father.

         46.  I am  not  satisfied  that,  if  the  appellant's  father  was
             involved in KDPI activity, he would have returned to Iran with
             the intention of making arrangements for his wife and child to
             move back there with him.

         47.  In all the circumstances therefore I am not satisfied  on  the
             lower standard  of  proof  that  the  appellant's  father  was
             involved in activities  against  the  Iranian  regime  as  the
             appellant has suggested."

 9. Although no specific findings were made therefore I accept that  it  is
    implicit in Judge Dineen's findings that he accepted that the appellant
    had lived in Iraq.  It is also implicit that it is  accepted  that  the
    appellant is an Iranian Kurd.

10. It was argued by Mr Abdar that reports  indicate  that  the  government
    disproportionately targets members of the ethnic and religious minority
    groups for arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention  and  harassment  and
    that the government's tendency to conflate all  assertions  of  Kurdish
    identity with a potential threat to the country's unity, makes Kurds in
    Iran  particularly  vulnerable   to   government   mistreatment.    The
    appellant's representative also asserted that there were  reports  that
    even Kurds who are not politically active face increasing  difficulties
    with the Iranian authorities including discrimination and harassment.

11. Professor Joff� in his expert report addresses the appellant's evidence
    and Professor Joff� also sought to offer his opinion in relation to the
    credibility of the appellant's account.  However Mr Abdar conceded that
    he was not  relying  on  this  opinion,  given  the  findings  of  fact
    preserved from the First-tier Tribunal.  Professor  Joff�  went  on  to
    find at paragraph 46 of his 26 August report:

         "I do not consider that his return  to  Iran  as  a  failed  asylum
         seeker, in itself, exposes him to any particular danger.   However,
         given the fact that he has had a lengthy  period  of  residence  in
         Britain, is Kurdish and, given his claim that his father  had  been
         politically involved in Iran, he is  likely  to  face  considerable
         official suspicion and, perhaps, detailed interrogation,  detention
         and possible ill-treatment upon return, especially if  the  Iranian
         authorities are aware of his father's background and  believe  that
         he may have information about it.  At least as serious is the  fact
         that he has spent eleven years in Britain  and  has  been  educated
         here after spending seven years in Iraqi Kurdistan.  He speaks very
         little Farsi, I am instructed, and knows little of life and culture
         in Iran.  He also has no family there and would therefore  find  it
         virtually impossible to re-integrate into a world with which he has
         virtually no familiarity."

12. Professor Joff� went on to express doubt about the  appellant's  return
    to Iran as he would need a laisser-passer.  To obtain such  a  document
    Professor Joff� indicated that the  appellant  would  need  details  to
    establish his Iranian nationality.

13. I am bound by the Upper Tribunal decision in SSH  &  HR  (above).   The
    head note reads as follows:

         "(a) An Iranian male whom it is sought to return to Iran, who  does
             not possess a  passport,  will  be  returnable  on  a  laissez
             passer, which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on  proof
             of identity and nationality.


         (b)  An Iranian male in respect of whom  no  adverse  interest  has
             previously been manifested by the Iranian State does not  face
             a real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3  rights  on
             return to Iran on account of having left Iran illegally and/or
             being a failed asylum seeker.  No such risk exists at the time
             of questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e.  of
             illegal exit and being  a  failed  asylum  seeker)  have  been
             established.  In particular, there  is  not  a  real  risk  of
             prosecution leading to imprisonment."

14. I am satisfied that applying this country guidance, the  appellant,  in
    respect of whom I am satisfied on  Judge  Dineen's  findings  of  fact,
    there has been no adverse interest manifested  by  the  Iranian  State,
    does not face either a real risk of persecution  or  a  breach  of  his
    Article 3 rights on return.

15. Although Professor Joff� asserted in  his  report  that  the  appellant
    would be likely to face considerable suspicion because of  his  lengthy
    period of residence in Britain, that he is Kurdish and "given his claim
    that his father had been politically involved in Iran" the latter is  a
    re-statement of the error into which Judge Dineen fell in finding  that
    the appellant would be at risk simply  by  recounting  to  the  Iranian
    authorities what has been found to be  a  false  account.   It  is  not
    accepted either by the First-tier Tribunal or here that  the  appellant
    established that his father was  involved  in  activities  against  the
    Iranian regime as he had suggested.

16. In relation to the particular situation of an Iranian  Kurd  the  Upper
    Tribunal in SSH & HR addressed this issue at paragraph 34:

         "It was not suggested to us that an individual faces risk on return
         on the sole basis of being Kurdish.  It  was  however  agreed  that
         being Kurdish was relevant to how a returnee would  be  treated  by
         the authorities.  For example, the Operational Guidance Note refers
         at 3.12.14 to the government disproportionally  targeting  minority
         groups, including Kurds, for arbitrary arrest, prolonged  detention
         and physical abuse.  No examples however have been provided of ill-
         treatment of returnees with no relevant  adverse  interest  factors
         other than their  Kurdish  ethnicity,  and  we  conclude  that  the
         evidence does not show risk of  ill-treatment  to  such  returnees,
         though we accept that it might be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a
         returnee otherwise of  interest.  [My  emphasis].   Accordingly  we
         conclude that it has not been shown that a person in  the  position
         of these appellants faces a real risk on return to Iran  either  on
         the basis of what would happen  to  them  when  questioned  at  the
         airport or subsequently if they were convicted  of  an  offence  of
         illegal exit."

17. Although therefore Mr Abdar sought to persuade the  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant would be  at  risk  because  of  his  Kurdish  ethnicity  the
    Tribunal concluded that  this  would  not  be  the  case  although  the
    Tribunal accepted that such might  be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a
    returnee 'otherwise of interest' to the Iranian authorities.  I am  not
    satisfied that it has been shown that the appellant would otherwise  be
    of interest given that he has been found not to be credible in relation
    to the claimed political activities of his father.

18. I have taken into consideration Professor Joff�'s report and  note  his
    expertise in this area.  However his opinion in  relation  to  risk  on
    return for the appellant was clearly predicated on the basis  that  the
    appellant's account  was  true,  which  it  is  not.   I  have  further
    considered that Professor Joff� also  concluded  that  the  appellant's
    return to Iran as a failed asylum seeker in itself did not  expose  him
    to any particular danger.  I accept that this is the case.

19. I have considered that although Professor Joff� took into  account  the
    fact that the appellant had "a lengthy period of residence in  Britain"
    as relevant and Professor Joff� went on to refer  to  eleven  years  in
    Britain, it was conceded by Mr Abdar that this was  a  mistake  as  the
    appellant only arrived in the UK in 2012.  Although I accept  Professor
    Joff�  earlier  in  his  report  set  out  the  appellant's  background
    including that he applied for asylum in the UK in 2012 it was not clear
    to me that Professor Joff�  did  not  in  error  later  in  his  report
    consider and rely on the appellant having lived in the  UK  for  eleven
    years.  Professor Joff� specifically refers to the  appellant  spending
    seven years in Iraqi Kurdistan and then eleven years in the UK  whereas
    I accept  the  appellant  spent  approximately  seven  years  in  Iraqi
    Kurdistan and four years in the UK.  I am not satisfied that this could
    be considered "a lengthy period of residence in  Britain"  in  the  way
    eleven years might be.  Even if it were it  has  not  been  established
    that the appellant would be at risk on  return  or  that  he  would  be
    otherwise of interest even taking into account the  cumulative  factors
    which are accepted including that he is Kurdish and  has  spent  eleven
    years outside of Iran and  that  there  is  background  information  in
    relation  to  the  government  disproportionately  targeting   minority
    groups, including Kurds..

20. It is also not clear from Professor  Joff�'s  report  whether,  in  the
    second half of paragraph 46 of  his  report,  when  he  refers  to  the
    appellant's residence in Britain being "at least as  serious",  whether
    he is referring to the appellant's risk on return  or  to  his  claimed
    inability to re-integrate to Iran as the latter is the  issue  that  is
    considered in the following sentence.  Even if I am wrong and Professor
    Joff� is arguing that eleven years outside  of  Iran  in  itself  is  a
    significant risk factor for the appellant I am not satisfied that there
    is  anything  in  the  evidence  including   the   background   country
    information which would cause me to depart from  the  country  guidance
    including of SSH & HR which would indicate  that  as  someone  with  no
    relevant adverse interest factors other than his Kurdish ethnicity, the
    appellant would not face a risk of persecution.  I find this to be  the
    case.

21.  It was not argued that the appellant falls  within  any  of  the  risk
    categories identified in SB Iran CG  [2009]  UKAIT  00053.   I  am  not
    satisfied that he does.

22. The appellant's asylum appeal falls to be dismissed.

Article 8

23. It was conceded by Mr Abdar that the appellant's appeal cannot  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules.  The respondent in the Reasons for Refusal
    Letter dated 6 March 2015 considered the appellant's private and family
    life.  The respondent was of  the  view  that  the  appellant  did  not
    qualify for leave to remain.  Consideration was given to paragraph 326B
    of the Immigration Rules which states:

         "Where the Secretary of State is considering a claim for asylum  or
         humanitarian protection under this  part,  she  will  consider  any
         Article 8 elements of that claim in line  with  the  provisions  of
         Appendix FM (family life) and paragraph 276ADE  to  276DH  (private
         life) of these Rules."

24. The respondent went on to find that the appellant met  the  suitability
    requirements but had not raised any claim as a partner or a parent.  In
    relation to private life the respondent considered that  the  appellant
    had been in the UK since June 2012 and would have a private life in the
    UK.  Consideration was given to his  private  life  but  he  failed  to
    demonstrate that he had twenty years' residence in the UK  or  that  he
    had spent half of his life residing continuously in  the  UK.   It  was
    also noted that the appellant had family and it  was  stated  that  the
    appellant failed to demonstrate that he  had  no  social,  cultural  or
    family ties in Iran.  It was considered that the  appellant  could  not
    meet the requirements of Rule 276ADE.

25. Although not specifically considered by the respondent it is clear that
    the relevant paragraph was paragraph 276ADE(vi):

         'is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in  the  UK  for
         less than twenty years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  applicant's
         integration into the country to  which  he  would  have  to  go  if
         required to leave the UK'.

26. Although as indicated Mr Abdar conceded that the  appellant  could  not
    succeed under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) I am independently satisfied that
    this is the case. Although it is accepted that the appellant has  lived
    for some part of his life in Iraq I am not satisfied that it  has  been
    established  that  there  are  very  significant   obstacles   to   his
    integration into Iran.  In reaching this  finding  I  have  taken  into
    consideration the background  country  information  and  expert  report
    including in relation to the stated difficulties experienced by  Kurds.
    The appellant's representative's skeleton argued that family members of
    KDPI members and sympathisers are harassed and at risk of imprisonment.
     However I am not satisfied that this is relevant  to  the  appellant's
    claimed difficulties in integrating into Iran as  it  is  not  accepted
    that his father was involved politically as claimed.

27. I have taken into consideration that the appellant has been  found  not
    to be credible in relation to his  asylum  account.   Although  he  was
    recorded in his original evidence as  stating  that  he  did  not  know
    anyone in Iran apart from a cousin and that  he  had  not  lived  there
    since he was 8 years old, he also stated that  he  feared  the  Iranian
    Government as the son of a person who has run away from  that  country.
    However that  has  been  found  not  to  have  been  established.   The
    appellant will therefore be returning  to  Iran  as  a  Kurdish  Sorani
    speaker.  Although it was indicated that he does not speak  much  Farsi
    it was not suggested that he had any language difficulties in living in
    Iran as a child.  Although he may have to regain more fluency in Farsi,
    the appellant has the advantage of having studied in the past including
    in the UK and has been able to learn English in a short time.  I am not
    satisfied that this would constitute very significant obstacles.

28. The appellant is an adult.  He has been assessed as having been born on
    13 January 1997 and is therefore 19 years old.  There was no suggestion
    that the appellant is in anything other than good health.  Although the
    First-tier Tribunal referred to the appellant having a cousin  in  Iran
    the appellant referred in oral evidence  before  me  to  an  uncle  but
    similarly indicated that he had no contact.  I  accept  that  both  the
    appellant and his foster parents assert that he  has  no  contact  with
    family in Iran.  However that is not the same as an ability to  contact
    family and I have given weight to the fact that the appellant  has  not
    been credible in respect of his core account.  Although it may well  be
    that his foster parents are not aware of any contact with Iran I am not
    satisfied that the appellant, as someone lacking in credibility  as  to
    the core of his account, has demonstrated that he would not be able  to
    contact either immediate or extended family in Iran on return.

29. Even if I am wrong in the above, although a lack  of  family  may  make
    reintegration more difficult for  the  appellant  after  a  significant
    absence from Iran, I am not satisfied that for a young Kurdish male  in
    good health that these would constitute very significant obstacles.  In
    reaching this finding I have taken into consideration all the  evidence
    including Professor Joff�'s conclusion that the appellant would find it
    virtually impossible to re-integrate in to 'a world with which  he  has
    virtually no  familiarity'.   However  as  noted  Professor  Joff�  was
    relying on the appellant's account as true.  I also note that Professor
    Joff� has not provided any adequate reasons why this would be the case.
     There was no consideration as to why Professor Joff� appears  to  give
    little or no weight to the fact  that  the  appellant  speaks  Kurdish,
    spent his early childhood in Iran and  then  lived  in  Iraq  with  his
    Iranian Kurdish family.   The appellant has also shown  himself  to  be
    very adaptable in learning English and integrating into life in the UK,
    a country with which he had no familiarity, within  a  short  space  of
    time, In these circumstances I am not satisfied that  any  difficulties
    the  appellant  may  experience  would  constitute   very   significant
    obstacles.

30. Therefore I am satisfied that the  appellant's  appeal  cannot  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules.

31. I therefore must go on  to  consider  whether  there  is  anything  not
    adequately addressed under  the  Immigration  Rules  to  be  considered
    outside the Rules under Article 8.  The appellant claims  to  be  in  a
    very close relationship  with  his  foster  family  and  I  heard  oral
    evidence from Mrs Turner.  Although it was not argued and I accept that
    the appellant could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  in
    relation  to  his  foster  family  I  am  satisfied  that   these   are
    circumstances are not addressed under the Immigration  Rules  and  that
    therefore consideration must be given  to  Article  8  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

32. In undertaking an assessment under Article 8 I have followed  the  five
    stage approach set out by Lord Bingham in R v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  It was argued that
    the appellant enjoys family life with the Turners.   I  have  carefully
    considered this claim and for the  reasons  set  out  below  I  am  not
    satisfied that he does.

33. The appellant has been living with the Turner family as a foster  child
    for four years since he was 15.  At that stage he  would  already  have
    been an adolescent and developing as an independent person.  Although I
    accept that he may initially have required additional assistance,  over
    and above what an average 15 year old might require, due  to  the  fact
    that he was separated from family and in a different country, I am  not
    satisfied  that  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  appellant  has
    established family life with his foster family.

34. I accept that the Turners and the appellant may  have  formed  a  close
    bond and that the Turners are fond of him.  I further accept  that  the
    appellant has proved himself to be  a  valuable  member  of  his  local
    community playing football and assisting neighbours and that he is well
    regarded by the wider Turner  family.   However,  there  is  no  formal
    family relationship between the appellant and the Turners.  Although  I
    accept that they were his foster parents this was under an  arrangement
    with the Council; Mrs Turner confirmed that she still receives payments
    in respect of the appellant.  I further  take  into  account  that  Mrs
    Turner was very clear that even if she did not receive  these  payments
    they would continue to have the appellant living with them  because  he
    was "special" and they have renovated their roof space to allow them to
    take other foster children.  However, a closer  bond  than  with  other
    foster children, with an individual who has been with  the  family  for
    just four years  and  who  is  now  an  adult,  does  not  in  all  the
    circumstances establish family life for the purposes of Article 8.

35. Even if I am wrong and family life was established when  the  appellant
    was a minor, the appellant is now almost 20  years  old.   Although  he
    still lives in the Turner household I  have  taken  into  consideration
    that  Mrs  Turner  confirmed  that  there  were  specific  arrangements
    including for individuals to stay in a foster home to the  age  of  21,
    and the age of 24 if in education, under the Pathway  Scheme.   I  have
    taken into consideration  that  both  the  appellant  and  the  Turners
    indicate that they love each other and that they provide emotional  and
    practical support.  However the appellant told the Tribunal that he  is
    now studying and gave information in  relation  to  the  motor  vehicle
    transportation course that he is  currently  in  the  second  year  of.
    After he completes the course  he  hopes  to  attend  university.   The
    appellant also regularly plays football and  clearly  therefore  has  a
    life beyond the home of his foster family.  I  am  satisfied  that  his
    bonds with the Turners do not go above and beyond bonds  between  adult
    children and their foster parents, such that family  life  would  exist
    for the purposes of Article 8.

36. However I am satisfied that the appellant has been in the UK  for  over
    four years and will have established  private  life  in  the  UK.   The
    decision of the respondent will interfere with that private life and is
    of such gravity as to potentially engage Article  8.   The  appellant's
    asylum appeal and consideration under the  Immigration  Rules  has  not
    been  successful  and  therefore  the  respondent's  decision   is   in
    accordance with the law and for the legitimate purpose  of  maintaining
    effective immigration control.  I therefore go on to consider the final
    question under Razgar in relation to proportionality.

37. In so doing I must consider Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act  2002,  the  public  interest  considerations.   I  have
    reminded myself that the maintenance of effective immigration  controls
    is in the public interest  and  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules (for the reasons I have  set  out
    above at paragraphs 25-30).  It  is  in  the  public  interest  and  in
    particular in the interests of the economic  wellbeing  of  the  United
    Kingdom that persons can speak English.  I accept  that  the  appellant
    has been attending an English course.  Although I have also taken  into
    consideration that he gave evidence with the assistance  of  a  Kurdish
    Sorani speaker, on balance, I am not satisfied that any weight attaches
    to this public interest given the appellant's ability  to  continue  on
    his  course  and  enjoy  daily  life  including  playing  football  and
    interacting with friends and neighbours.  However it is  clear  in  the
    Section 117 assessment this is no more than a neutral factor.

38.  It  has  not  been  established  that  the  appellant  is  financially
    independent.  I have considered the recent Court of Appeal decision  in
    Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    803 which sets out at paragraphs 61 to 65  confirmation  that  at  best
    factors in an appellant's favour  can  only  be  neutral  factors.   In
    addition Rhuppiah, at paragraph 65, found that  financial  independence
    means independence not just of the state but of others. Therefore I  do
    attach weight to the public interest in this regard.

39.  Under  Section  117B(5)(a)  I  have  attached  little  weight  to  the
    appellant's private life as it was  established  at  a  time  when  his
    immigration status was precarious.

40. I take into consideration all that was in  the  appellant's  favour  in
    respect of his good integration into local life in Faversham  including
    in the football club and with his foster  family.   I  also  take  into
    account his excellent relationship with his foster parents  and  foster
    family and I  have  considered  that  the  bundle  before  me  included
    evidence of the appellant's links to the community.  However I am bound
    to give little weight to that private life.  That does  not  of  course
    mean that a private life case can never succeed under Article 8  but  I
    am not satisfied that in this case that it can.

41. I have also taken into account that the appellant  claims  to  have  no
    contact with family in Iran and Mrs Turner also stated  they  had  been
    unable to contact them.  However, I rely on my findings above that I am
    not satisfied that the appellant has demonstrated that he would not  be
    able to contact either immediate or extended family in Iran on  return.
    Even if he could not, I rely on my findings under the Immigration Rules
    that this would  not  constitute  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    return.  However I do accept that the appellant has not lived  in  Iran
    since he was 8 years old (although he did live with his Iranian Kurdish
    family in Iraq)  and  I  take  this  into  account  in  his  favour  in
    considering the difficulties that he may have in reintegrating to  life
    in Iran, including his claim that he is now 'westernised' and Professor
    Joff�'s view that it would be 'virtually impossible'  for  him  to  re-
    integrate.  However the appellant has only been  in  the  UK  for  four
    years having lived the rest of his life in Iran and Iraq and I  do  not
    accept  therefore  that  adapting  again  to  this  culture   will   be
    particularly difficult for him. I rely on my  findings  of  fact  above
    (including paragraph 29) and I have considered that the  appellant  has
    gained skills including having completed the  first  year  of  a  motor
    vehicle transportation course, having passed  his  first  year  with  a
    distinction and as indicated above will have gained English skills.  He
    has also shown that he has been able to adapt to the UK  and  integrate
    well here.  I am satisfied that this will assist him in his efforts  to
    reintegrate into Iran.

42. In the alternative, if I am wrong and  the  appellant  has  established
    family life with the Turner family I am not satisfied that his  removal
    will be disproportionate.  The appellant is an  adult  and  is  in  the
    process of developing his own career interests  including  through  his
    success in his motor vehicle transportation course.  I have taken  into
    consideration his foster mother's concern that he will not be  able  to
    adapt to life in Iran without having completed that  course.   However,
    there was no adequate information before me that might suggest that the
    lack of  a  formal  qualification  would  prevent  the  appellant  from
    utilising the skills that he has learnt thus far  in  order  to  obtain
    employment on return.  The appellant although still young is at an  age
    when he will be establishing his  life  independently.   There  was  no
    adequate information or evidence to  suggest  that  either  he  or  the
    Turner family have any medical or other  issues  that  might  make  the
    separation from the adult appellant particularly difficult.   I  accept
    that there was oral evidence that the appellant has assisted an elderly
    relative of the Turners.  However there was no adequate information  to
    suggest that the Turner family cannot continue to support this relative
    as they have done in the past prior to the appellant's arrival.

43. Although I have taken into  account  all  that  is  in  favour  of  the
    appellant's private (and alternatively if I am wrong in relation to his
    family   life)   I   am   not   satisfied   that   his   removal   will
    disproportionately interfere with the appellant's Article 8 rights.

Decision

44. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  is  set  aside.   The
    decision is substituted as follows:

45. The appellant's asylum appeal is dismissed

46. The appellant's appeal on human rights grounds is also dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                                  APPENDIX


                   DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND DIRECTIONS

Background

 1. The appellant in this case is the Secretary of State.  However, for the
    purposes of the appeal before me, I refer to the parties as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal, where Mr Z was the appellant.

 2. The appellant in this case is  assessed  as  having  been  born  on  13
    January 1997 and is an Iranian national who entered the United  Kingdom
    in June 2012 and applied for asylum.  That application was refused  for
    reasons set out by letter dated 29 August 2012.

 3. The appellant was granted discretionary leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom until 13 July 2014 and made a further application  on  10  July
    2014.  That further application was refused in a letter dated  6  March
    2015 and the appellant was issued with a notice of decision  to  remove
    him to Iran.  The appellant appealed that decision and the appeal  came
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision promulgated on 13  April
    2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dineen  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal on asylum and human rights  grounds.   The  Secretary  of  State
    appeals that decision.

Error of Law

 4. The Secretary of State submitted that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Dineen
    had materially erred in allowing the appellant's appeal.  Having  found
    the appellant's account to be wholly without  merit  it  was  submitted
    that the appeal falls squarely within the country guidance of SB  (risk
    on return - illegal exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053.

 5. At paragraph [48] Judge Dineen referred to the case of SB as follows:

         "The decision (in SB) indicated that there would be no risk  to  an
         asylum-seeking person returning to Iran merely on account of  being
         a failed asylum seeker, unless there were  a  further  risk  factor
         such as having been involved in criminal proceedings in Iran before
         leaving".

 6. The respondent submitted  that  there  were  no  further  risk  factors
    advanced by the appellant and it was a misdirection therefore  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge to conclude that the appellant  would  be  at
    risk on return by revealing the content  of  his  claim,  despite  this
    being untrue, and that this would place him at risk of persecution.  It
    was argued on behalf of the respondent that if this were the  case  all
    failed asylum seekers would be risk on return by  the  very  nature  of
    attempting to obtain refuge in the UK as the account  that  they  would
    advance would be one that would contain an element that placed them  at
    risk from the Iranian authorities if it was discovered.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes in the permission decision dated 4 May
    2016 was of the view that it was arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to
    follow the current country guidance without giving adequate reasons for
    departing from it.  In addition, although not a ground of appeal before
    the permission judge, Judge Holmes noted that there was  a  substantial
    and unexplained delay in preparing the decision given that  the  appeal
    had been heard on 20 August 2015 but was not promulgated until 15 April
    2016.

Ground 1

 8. Mr Mills on behalf of the respondent relied on the  grounds  of  appeal
    and restated that the judge had not explained why the appellant even if
    he were to tell the Iranian authorities that  he  had  been  an  asylum
    seeker but this had not been believed, why does that put him at risk on
    return.  Mr Mills referred to the case law  which  indicates  that  the
    Iranian authorities' approach is intelligence-led and asserted that the
    judge had simply not given any adequate reasons for explaining  why  he
    would be at risk.

 9. It was Mr Ti's submission, both in his skeleton argument and before me,
    that SB is not country guidance in terms of failed asylum  seekers  and
    that the case is relevant to illegal exit.  Mr Ti relied  on  paragraph
    53 of SB which indicated that  the  Upper  Tribunal  did  not  seek  to
    conduct a comprehensive review of existing Tribunal guidance  on  Iran.
    Mr Ti submitted that it was therefore open to Judge Dineen  to  make  a
    finding that the appellant was at risk on the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before him, in particular the Amnesty International Report which  Judge
    Dineen referred to at paragraph 50 of his decision.

10. Mr Ti submitted in the alternative that Judge Dineen's decision was not
    inconsistent with the country guidance even if  SB  is  authority  that
    being a failed asylum seeker  does  not  give  rise  to  risk.   Mr  Ti
    submitted that there were many reasons for an asylum claim and  certain
    reasons, such as personal vendettas, domestic  violence,  fleeing  from
    criminal elements and family feuds, would not  attract  persecution  or
    serious ill-treatment from the authorities in Iran.

11. It was submitted that it was therefore consistent  to  say  that  while
    being a mere failed asylum seeker would not put a returning Iranian  at
    risk, certain types of asylum claim, for example those based  on  anti-
    government  or  anti-Islamic  conduct,  would  attract  persecution  or
    serious ill-treatment.  Mr Ti relied on paragraphs 21 and 50 of  SB  to
    support this argument, which indicated that if an  Iranian  arrives  in
    the country without a passport or any valid travel documents they would
    be arrested and taken  to  court  and  the  reason  for  their  illegal
    departure and whether they applied for asylum and  if  so  the  reasons
    would be examined.

12. Mr Ti relied on the Tribunal's consideration that  whether  or  not  an
    individual taken before  the  court  in  this  manner  suffers  adverse
    consequences depends on the outcome of the court's investigation.

13. Although this may be the case, I accept Mr  Mills'  argument  that  the
    most that the appellant could say was that  he  unsuccessfully  applied
    for asylum on the basis that he claimed that his father was involved in
    political activity but that this claim had  not  been  accepted.   This
    must be the case, as Judge  Dineen  found  at  paragraph  [47],  having
    considered the evidence that  he  was  not  satisfied  the  appellant's
    father was involved in activities against the  Iranian  regime  as  the
    appellant had suggested.

14. Mr Ti relied on RT  (Zimbabwe)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] UKSC 38.  It was his argument that the  finding  that
    merely being a failed asylum seeker  in  Iran  is  not  a  risk  factor
    appeared to be an extension  of  the  finding  that  those  who  exited
    illegally are not automatically at risk, which in turn is based on  the
    absence of reports of ill-treatment.  It was Mr  Ti's  submission  that
    the absence of reports of  ill-treatment  can  be  explained  by  human
    nature, that failed asylum seekers would not admit reasons for claiming
    asylum that would lead to ill-treatment.

15. As I indicated at the hearing, this was unsubstantiated speculation  on
    the part of Mr Ti and I do not find this to be properly arguable.   The
    case of BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return) [2011]  UKUT  36
    considered the RT (Zimbabwe) point that an appellant cannot be expected
    to lie about any activity, it was not considered that this would make a
    difference; the guidance in SB was confirmed.

16. Given his findings of fact and his findings at [48] I am not  satisfied
    that Judge Dineen has provided any  adequate  reasoning  for  departing
    from what remains the leading country guidance in relation to Iran that
    Iranians facing forced return do not in general face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution.  Although I accept  that  Judge  Dineen  referred  to  the
    Amnesty International Report at [50] of his decision  and  went  on  to
    refer to further reports from the Danish Refugee Council at [53] of his
    decision I am not satisfied that cogent reasons  have  been  given  for
    departing from country guidance.

Remaking the Decision

17. Although Mr Ti relied on the  comments  of  the  permission  judge  and
    argued that all of Judge Dineen's findings were unsafe given an  almost
    eight month interval between the hearing and the decision  (and  relied
    on the case of Sambasivam [1999] IAT RF 1999/0419/4),  I  referred  the
    parties to the more recent Tribunal authority  of  Arusha  and  Demushi
    (deprivation of citizenship - delay) [2012] UKUT 80 (IAC), which relied
    on the earlier Court of Appeal case of RK  (Algeria)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    868.  This establishes that there has to be a nexus between  the  delay
    and the safety of the decision.  Judge Dineen indicates that the  delay
    was in relation to pressure of work.  Although the delay is lamentable,
    the judge clearly set out the evidence that  was  considered  and  made
    clear findings on that evidence.  There were no  substantive  arguments
    before me that might establish that  the  delay  led  to  any  material
    challenge to those findings of fact.

18. I am therefore satisfied that the  findings  of  fact  in  relation  to
    credibility and the appellant's circumstances in Iran can stand.

19. Although I was initially disposed  to  remaking  the  decision  at  the
    hearing, following discussion with the parties it was agreed  that  the
    appeal would be relisted following the promulgation of the most  recent
    country guidance case on Iran (in the cases  of  SSH  and  HR  (Iran)),
    which was heard in the Upper Tribunal on 11 May 2016 and is due  to  be
    promulgated in the coming weeks.

20. Both parties  indicated  that  the  reconvened  hearing  could  proceed
    without further oral evidence.  I am satisfied that this  is  the  case
    given the findings that are before me.   However,  the  parties  should
    have an opportunity to make written submissions in relation to the  new
    country guidance case, which is due to  consider  the  issues  of  both
    illegal exit and failed asylum seekers.

Notice of Decision on Error of Law

21. The First-tier Tribunal's determination on risk on return  contains  an
    error of law capable of affecting the outcome of the  appeal  and  that
    part of the decision is set aside.

22. The decision on risk on return will be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

Directions

 1) The appeal succeeds to the extent set out above  and  the  decision  of
    Judge Dineen, in relation to risk on return only, is set aside.

 2) The decision on risk on return will be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    before a single judge.

 3) The respondent Secretary of State to file and serve written submissions
    no later than fourteen days before the reconvened hearing.

 4) The appellant's representative to file and  serve  written  submissions
    and an indexed bundle containing  any  material  to  be  relied  on  in
    relation to risk on return and the new country guidance, no later  than
    seven days before the reconvened date hearing, including submissions on
    whether the reconvened appeal should  proceed  on  the  papers  without
    further hearing.   The  bundle  is  to  separately  tabulate:  (i)  the
    evidence relied upon before the  First-tier  Tribunal;  and,  (ii)  the
    additional evidence that it is now sought to rely upon before the Upper
    Tribunal,

   Any failure to comply with these directions  may  lead  the  Tribunal  to
   exercise its powers to decide the appeal without a further oral  hearing,
   or to conclude that the defaulting party  has  no  relevant  information,
   evidence or submissions to provide.
