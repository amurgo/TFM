Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Nasim
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born in 1993.   She  appealed
    against a decision of the ECO, Islamabad made on  5  November  2012  to
    refuse her application  for  settlement  as  the  spouse  of  Mr  Allah
    Mohammed Musazie (the Sponsor) who is  a  naturalised  British  citizen
    living in London.

 2. The application was considered on the basis of the documents  submitted
    and was refused  under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1.(d)  of  Appendix  FM  with
    reference to Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules on the basis  that
    the Appellant had failed  to  submit  with  her  application  specified
    evidence in relation to the Sponsor's  'self-employment  in  a  limited
    company based in the UK'.

 3. In the Grounds of Appeal it was asserted that the Sponsor,  who  it  is
    not disputed is a director of 'Big Boyz Pizza Limited' is not  a  self-
    employed person but an employee of  the  company  and  the  application
    should have been considered on that basis.  Wage slips showing that  he
    was earning over the minimum income threshold of �18,600 at the date of
    decision had been submitted along with the other documents necessary to
    show employment.

 4. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 13 January 2014 which was  dealt
    with  on  submissions,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hembrough
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 5. His findings  and  reasons  are  at  paragraphs  [9]  to  [16]  of  his
    determination.

 6. He noted the submission on behalf of the Appellant that the Sponsor  as
    a director of the company was an employee, the company being a separate
    legal person from the Sponsor.  Accordingly,  to  meet  the  evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM he was required  to  submit  the  documents
    detailed at paragraph A.1.2 of Appendix FM-SE in  respect  of  salaried
    employment in the UK which he had done.

 7. The judge also noted the submission on behalf of  the  Respondent  that
    the Sponsor as the sole director,  secretary  and  shareholder  in  the
    company the reality was that he was self-employed for the  purposes  of
    the  Immigration  Rules  and  was  therefore  required  to  submit  the
    documents detailed at paragraph A 1.7 in respect of self-employment  in
    a limited company based in the UK which it  was  agreed  had  not  been
    done.

 8. The judge, (at [11]) whilst accepting the submission on behalf  of  the
    Appellant that in  company  law  terms  self-employment  in  a  limited
    company is a contradiction in terms, considered that in trying to  give
    meaning to the plain wording of the Rules such  does  not  fall  to  be
    construed with the same rigour that one might take when considering  an
    Act of Parliament.

 9. He continued (at  [12]):  'The  policy  underlying  the  financial  and
    evidential requirements of Appendix FM is that the Home  Secretary  has
    determined that a UK based Sponsor must provide evidence of  an  income
    of �18,600 per annum so as to enable him  to  adequately  maintain  his
    spouse.  In relation to  Sponsors  who  are  engaged  in  business  the
    Respondent is required to be satisfied that the business is viable  and
    providing a sufficient income to the  Sponsor  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM'.

10. He noted there were different evidential requirements depending on  the
    Sponsor's work status in the UK.

11. He considered the reality to be that the Sponsor in the present  appeal
    'is engaged in business on his own  account  in  exactly  the  sort  of
    scenario contemplated by paragraph 1.7'.  He did not consider that  the
    Respondent's 'inappropriate use of language in referring to  him  being
    self-employed in a limited company based in the UK should enable him to
    subvert the financial or evidential requirements of Appendix FM'.

12. He concluded:

         'A clear example is found in the instant case.  Although it appears
         that he paid himself a salary of the order of �21,250  out  of  the
         company its annual accounts for the period 4  October  2011  to  31
         October 2012 showed that it had made a trading loss for the  period
         of �20,372.  This sum is  almost  entirely  accounted  for  by  the
         salary drawn by the Sponsor.  The reality therefore is  that  there
         was no profit in the business from which to  draw  a  salary.   The
         accounts do not demonstrate that he has an income of �18,300  (sic)
         per annum.  It may be that  in  common  with  many  businesses  the
         Sponsor has in place arrangements with his bank and/or other  third
         parties to provide financial support for the  company  and  it  may
         well be trading within its agreed financial limits.   It  may  not.
         This is why additional  information  is  required  under  paragraph
         A.1.7'.

13. He concluded that it  being  accepted  that  the  application  was  not
    accompanied by the specified evidence in paragraph A.1.7 the appeal had
    to be dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

14. The judge went  on  to  consider  Article  8  concluding  that  as  the
    Sponsor's business was at date of decision not making any profit so  as
    to enable him to adequately maintain  the  Appellant  the  decision  to
    refuse the application was proportionate to the legitimate aim.  If the
    company was now trading profitably another application could be made.

15. The Appellant sought permission to appeal.  This was refused by a judge
    on 23 April 2014.

16. Application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal which was granted  on  30
    May 2014.

17. At the error of law hearing  before  me  Mr  Nasim  for  the  Appellant
    submitted that the judge had found that there was no factual dispute in
    this case.  The issue was a narrow one, namely, whether the Sponsor was
    employed or self-employed.  The documentation produced  clearly  showed
    him to be an employee.  Company law allowed for a  director  to  be  an
    employee.  The judge's determination should be set aside and remade  by
    allowing it.

18. Mr Jarvis supported  the  judge's  findings  and  conclusion.   On  the
    evidence before him he was entitled to construe  the  Rule  as  he  had
    done.  It was clear that the Appellant could not be maintained.

19. In considering this matter as the  judge  indicated  the  issue  was  a
    narrow one, namely, whether the Sponsor was self-employed, which  would
    require him to submit the documents specified  at  paragraph  A.1.7  of
    Appendix FM-SE or employed in  which  case  he  needed  to  submit  the
    documents specified at paragraph A 1.2.

20. The judge was correct to state that 'in strict company law terms  self-
    employment in a limited company is a contradiction in terms'.  However,
    in my view he was wrong to go on to state that 'the reality is that the
    Sponsor in the present appeal is engaged in business on his own account
    in exactly the sort of scenario contemplated by paragraph A 1.7.' Also,
    that he did not 'consider that the Respondent's  inappropriate  use  of
    language in referring to him being self-employed in a  limited  company
    based in the  UK  should  enable  him  to  subvert  the  financial  and
    evidential requirements of Appendix FM'.

21. In this case in the application form  (3.3)  it  was  stated  that  the
    Sponsor was in salaried employment as a director,  his  employer  being
    'Big Boyz Ltd'.  More significantly, documentation was  submitted  from
    HMRC which  included  the  employer  registration  and  PAYE  reference
    number.  There is also a P60 tax certificate  in  the  Sponsor's  name.
    The form shows the employer's details 'Big Boyz  Pizza  Ltd'  with  the
    employer PAYE reference number. There is also a contract of employment.

22. The Tribunal concluded that because the accounts indicated that he  was
    paid �21,250 and that the same accounts showed a trading loss of around
    �20,000 this sum almost entirely  accounted  for  by  the  salary,  the
    reality was that there was no profit in the business to draw  a  salary
    and that as such the account did not demonstrate that he has an  income
    of �18,600 a year.

23. The Tribunal also concluded  that  despite  the  inappropriate  use  of
    language by the Respondent  he  should  not  be  able  to  subvert  the
    financial or evidential requirements.

24. In my judgment, the undisputed evidence clearly shows that the  limited
    company, a separate legal person, was employing the Sponsor.  The  fact
    that the accounts show that his salary of over �18,600 constituted most
    of the company's trading loss is irrelevant.   It  remains  his  salary
    just as it would be his salary if there was no trading loss, just as it
    would have been irrelevant if his salary had been a small fraction of a
    large trading profit.

25.  In  my  view  the  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  concluding  that  the
    requirements to be shown were those of a  self-employed  person  rather
    than those of an employed person.

26. The decision is set aside to be remade.

27. Mr Jarvis submitted that were  I  to  conclude  that  the  Sponsor  was
    employed it was not clear that he met all the  evidential  requirements
    of A 1.2 in that while there was a P60 and wage slips and a contract of
    employment there was not a letter from the employer who issued the  pay
    slips giving the details set out in  A  1.2  (d).   I  note  there  are
    letters from the accountants acting for  the  limited  company.   These
    letters give the required information.  I consider that the accountants
    are clearly the agent of the employer for this purpose  and  that  such
    fulfils the requirement.

28.  The only other concern by Mr Jarvis was A1.2 (f). which  requires  the
    production of monthly personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the
    same periods as the wage slips showing that 'the salary has  been  paid
    into the account' in the name of the person. His concern was  that  the
    net income was not always shown to be the same as in  the  wage  slips.
    Whilst there were some discrepancies between the amount of  his  salary
    appearing on the pay slips and the amount transferred into the bank and
    showing on the statements, I  accept  the  explanation  that  this  was
    solely due to difficulties at  the  start  of  the  business  including
    finding a trained bookkeeper.  That explanation was not challenged. All
    the bank entries show clearly that the credits are from the company.  I
    conclude that the requirement to show that the 'salary  has  been  paid
    into an account' is satisfied.

29.  The  Appellant,  through  the  Sponsor,   satisfies   the   evidential
    requirements under A 1.2.

30. I conclude that the Appellant satisfies the Immigration Rules.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error  of  law.
That decision is set aside and remade as follows:

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
