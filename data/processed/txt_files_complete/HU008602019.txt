                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant  ("NA").   This
    direction applies to both the appellant and to  the  respondent  and  a
    failure to comply with this direction could lead to Contempt  of  Court
    proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 15 May 1985.  He
    arrived in the United Kingdom with entry clearance as the spouse  of  a
    British citizen on 16 October 2008 with leave  valid  until  3  January
    2011.  On 5 January 2011, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to
    remain as the spouse of a British citizen.  Having been granted limited
    leave to remain on 5 January 2011, an application for 'No  Time  Limit'
    was granted on 20 August 2013.

 3. Between 23  January  2014  and  12  January  2018,  the  appellant  was
    convicted on six occasions of eleven  offences,  including  an  offence
    against the person and a number of offences involving driving a vehicle
    whilst disqualified and uninsured.  A  number  of  different  penalties
    were imposed upon the appellant,  including  a  six  weeks'  period  of
    imprisonment on 8 December 2015, a twelve week period  of  imprisonment
    on 13 November 2017 and a four  month  period  of  imprisonment  on  19
    January 2018.

 4. Prior to the appellant's conviction on 18 January 2018, on 22  November
    2017 he was served with notice of a decision intending to deport him on
    the basis that his deportation was conducive to the public  good  under
    s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971.  The appellant made  submissions
    that amounted to a human rights claim.  He relied upon both Art 8 and 3
    of the ECHR in relation to the impact on his family and  private  life,
    including the impact upon  his  health  as  he  suffered  from  a  rare
    congenital condition known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
    which required him to receive a regular infusion of  a  blood  product,
    Factor VIII (Type 8Y).

 5. On 9 October 2018, the Secretary of  State  refused  his  human  rights
    claims under Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision  sent
    on 27 November 2019, Judge Richardson dismissed the appellant's appeal.
     In relation to Art 3, the judge applied the approach set  out  in  the
    House of Lords in N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31 and concluded  that,  despite
    accepting the evidence that without treatment the appellant  would  die
    within months, his situation  did  not  fall  within  the  "exceptional
    circumstances" to establish a  breach  of  Art  3  in  a  medical  case
    following N v SSHD.  In addition,  in  any  event,  treatment  for  the
    appellant's condition was available in Pakistan.

 7. The judge made no decision in relation to Art 8 on the basis that  that
    claim had been withdrawn at the commencement of the hearing.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.   The
    appellant's grounds challenged the  decision  on  a  number  of  bases.
    First, the judge failed to consider (because the Secretary of State had
    not referred the judge to  these)  a  number  of  policies  which  were
    relevant to disposal of the appellant's appeal.   Secondly,  the  judge
    erred in failing to apply the correct threshold to Art 3  claims  based
    upon a health condition set out in the Strasbourg Court's  decision  in
    Paposhvili v Belgium [2017] Imm AR 867.  Thirdly, the judge  failed  to
    give anxious scrutiny to the evidence, and  adequate  reasons  for  her
    finding, that treatment  in  Pakistan  was  available  and  accessible.
    Finally, the judge failed to consider Art 8 of the ECHR.

 9. The appellant was refused permission to appeal first, by the First-tier
    Tribunal on 3 January 2020; and secondly, by the Upper  Tribunal  on  4
    February 2020.  The appellant  lodged  Cart  proceedings  in  the  High
    Court.  Permission was granted by HHJ Jarman QC (sitting as a Judge  of
    the High Court) on 6 March 2020.  Thereafter, by order of HHJ Keyser QC
    (sitting as a Judge of the High Court) the Upper Tribunal's refusal  of
    permission to appeal was quashed.  On 13 May 2020, the  Upper  Tribunal
    (VC Ockelton) granted the appellant permission to appeal.

10. The appeal was initially listed before  me  on  23  July  2020  at  the
    Cardiff Civil Justice Centre for a remote hearing.  That  hearing  was,
    however, adjourned as the respondent did not  attend  the  hearing  via
    Skype.  I will return to this  adjournment  later  as  the  appellant's
    legal representatives, subsequent to that hearing being adjourned, made
    an application for  "wasted  costs"  under  rule  10  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

11. The appeal was again listed before  me  on  12  November  2020  at  the
    Cardiff Civil  Justice  Centre  for  a  remote  hearing  by  Skype  for
    Business.  Mr Blackwood, who represented the appellant, and Mr Howells,
    who represented the Secretary of State, attended the hearing  remotely.



The Judge's Decision

12. The evidence before the judge was that the appellant  suffered  from  a
    congenital form of TTP which was to be distinguished from an autoimmune
    form of TTP.  The judge summarised the evidence at paras 31-38  of  her
    determination as follows:

         "31. I have read carefully the written  and  oral  evidence  of  Dr
             Rayment and I appreciate her attending at the hearing.

         32.  The appellant has a medical condition, TTP.  He  is  receiving
             treatment in the UK on the National Health Service and is able
             to live a normal life apart from  the  requirement  to  ensure
             that he receives his medication at specific regular intervals.
              He is assisted in his day-to-day life by  his  former  wife's
             mother who cleans  and  cooks  for  him  and  helps  with  his
             injections.

         33.  The disease has two forms, autoimmune  and  congenital.   Both
             versions of the disease are rare in the UK.   There  are  only
             three cases in Wales - the appellant, his brother and a  third
             person.  The appellant's condition  is  the  congenital  type.
             His brother [ ] also suffers from the disease.

         34.  It was claimed that the appellant's siblings suffer  from  the
             disease and that two siblings have died, one in  2005  at  the
             age of 25 and a sister in July 2019.

         35.  Dr Rayment states that the appellant would  die  within  about
             four months if not receiving his  medication.   She  has  also
             found a medical/welfare charity which is  able  to  treat  the
             autoimmune variant of TTP.

         36.  Dr Rayment describes the treatment of congenital TTP in the UK
             as giving Factor VIII used for haemophilia  which  contains  a
             small amount of 13 enzyme which is sufficient  and  stops  the
             disease from manifesting.  The other  is  infusions  of  fresh
             frozen  plasma  donated  by  donors  which  requires  hospital
             attendance.  Factor VIII can be  given  in  the  home  by  the
             patient himself.

         37.  Dr Rayment was  asked  but  did  not  directly  reply  to  the
             question are there any other charitable/welfare  organisations
             providing treatment apart  from  the  one  identified  at  the
             hearing.

         38.  The respondent has demonstrated that  there  is  treatment  is
             [sic] available in Pakistan for the  congenital  TTP.   I  was
             referred to the  MedCOI  Report.   There  was  no  documentary
             evidence on cost or whether any medication is  available  free
             of charge.  It was suggested it is likely to be  expensive  in
             Pakistan.   Dr  Rayment  commented  that  the  cost   of   the
             appellant's treatment in the UK  is  �66,000.   There  was  no
             documentary evidence to support that figure".

13. The judge then went on to consider case law, including N v SSHD, D v UK
    (1997) 24 EHRR 423 and Paposhvili.  Then  at  paras  43-45,  the  judge
    reached her conclusions as follows:

         "43. I am bound to follow N and the  subsequent  authorities  which
             have endorsed N in the light of Paposhvili.   The  appellant's
             case is not a 'death bed' case.  Although two of his  siblings
             have died for an  unnamed  reason,  he  has  two  siblings  he
             believes  who  have  congenital  TTP  although  there  is   no
             diagnosis and  they  are  in  their  late  30s  and  late  40s
             respectively.  The appellant has not  shown  very  exceptional
             circumstances to bring him within Paposhvili.

         44.  Dr Rayment describes the claimant's treatment for TTP  on  the
             NHS as being Factor VIII  as  used  in  treating  haemophilia.
             Factor VIII contains a small amount of  Enzyme  13  which  the
             claimant requires to provide  the  disease  from  manifesting.
             That is the medication currently being provided by the NHS  to
             the appellant for congenital TTP.  The  claimant,  unlike  his
             siblings in  Pakistan  has  a  diagnosis.   He  has  lost  two
             siblings to an unnamed cause of death.  His older siblings are
             in their late 30s and late 40s  respectively.   The  appellant
             also knows what treatment he requires.  He has not established
             substantial grounds to believe that he cannot  receive  it  in
             Pakistan.

         45.  There was insufficient evidence before me to show to the civil
             standard of  proof  that  there  are  no  clinics  or  welfare
             foundations which treat  haemophilia  in  Pakistan  and  could
             provide Factor VIII.  Haemophilia is not a rare disease to the
             extent that congenital TTP is rare.  In any event  whilst  TTP
             may be rare in the UK, there was no evidence before me that it
             is equally as rare in Pakistan.  There is at least one welfare
             clinic in Pakistan providing treatment for autoimmune TTP  and
             to that extent to suggest that TTP is not so rare in  Pakistan
             as it is in the UK.

         46.  It is with regret that I am bound to reach this decision.  The
             appellant's  claim  on  Article  3  grounds   fails   and   is
             dismissed".

The Submissions

14. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Blackwood made a number of  submissions.
    I can summarise them as follows.

15. First, there were a number of policies which the Secretary of State did
    not bring to the attention of the judge and which were relevant to  her
    assessment of whether the appellant could succeed under Art 3 (and  Art
    8) of the ECHR.  He relied  upon:  "Considering  Human  Rights  Claims"
    (2009) at page 19; "Human Rights Claims on  Medical  Grounds"  (20  May
    2014) at pages 14, 18 and 20; "Leave Outside the Immigration Rules" (27
    February 2018) at pages 6-7; and "Country Policy and Information  Note,
    Pakistan: Medical and Healthcare Issues" (August 2018).   Mr  Blackwood
    submitted that the respondent's failure to draw these documents to  the
    judge's attention, led the judge into an error of law.  He relied  upon
    AA (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 12 at [13], [27]-[28] and [35];
    Mandalia v SSHD [2015] UKSC 59 at  [19]  and  [29]-[30];  and  UB  (Sri
    Lanka) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 85 at [20]-[22].

16. Secondly, Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge's  decision  was  based
    upon the House of Lords approach to Art 3 in medical cases set out in N
    v SSHD which had  now  been  overruled  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2020] UKSC  17.   He  submitted  that  the  evidence
    engaged Art 3 as, without treatment, the appellant faced a "significant
    reduction in his life expectancy" which the Supreme Court  acknowledged
    fell within Art 3.  It  was  then,  Mr  Blackwood  submitted,  for  the
    Secretary of State to show that  treatment  to  avoid  the  significant
    reduction in the appellant's health was both available and  accessible.



17. Thirdly, in regard to those issues, Mr  Blackwood  submitted  that  the
    judge had confused the availability of treatment  in  Pakistan  between
    the treatments for the congenital form  of  TTP  (which  the  appellant
    suffered from) and the autoimmune form of TTP (which the appellant  did
    not suffer from).  He submitted that the evidence had not properly been
    considered.  In particular, the judge relied upon the  MedCOI  response
    but that had failed  to  include  the  actual  response  received  from
    Pakistan on 15 September  2018  which  was  only  referred  to  in  the
    footnotes.  He also  relied  on  the  fact  that  there  was  evidence,
    obtained by those representing the appellant, from Dr Zia  in  Pakistan
    who stated that the treatment which  the  appellant  requires  was  not
    available in Pakistan (see page 30 of the appellant's bundle).

18. Further, Mr Blackwood submitted that the question of accessibility, and
    whether or not the treatment if available was only at  some  cost,  had
    not properly been considered by the judge.  Dr Rayment had only found a
    "medical/welfare charity" which provided treatment for  the  autoimmune
    form of TTP - which was  not  the  variant  from  which  the  appellant
    suffered.  The judge had also been wrong not to consider  Dr  Rayment's
    view, expressed in her oral and written evidence, that the cost of  the
    appellant's treatment in the UK was �66,000.

19. Mr Blackwood submitted that the judge's finding that the appellant  had
    not established a breach of Art 3 applying AM  (Zimbabwe)  was  legally
    flawed.

20. Finally, in relation  to  Art  8  Mr  Blackwood,  at  least  initially,
    submitted that the judge had been wrong not to  consider  Art  8  which
    could be engaged despite an adverse finding under Art 3 and  he  relied
    upon the decision in SL  (St  Lucia)  v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1894.
    Initially, at least, he submitted that the  judge  had  been  wrong  to
    consider that the appellant's (then)  Counsel  had  withdrawn  reliance
    upon Art 8.  He submitted that, in any event, it was a Robinson obvious
    point. Mr Blackwood acknowledged, however, that no submissions had been
    made by the appellant's (then) counsel in respect of Art 8 going beyond
    the appellant's health condition.

21. On behalf of the Secretary of State,  Mr  Howells  submitted  that  the
    relied upon cases concerned with an obligation to put  before  a  judge
    policy documents were distinguishable.   These  policy  documents  were
    concerned with the 'threshold' or  scope  of  Art  3.   They  were,  he
    submitted, concerned with an interpretation of Art 3 which was for  the
    Tribunal rather than the Secretary of  State.   He  accepted,  however,
    that the medical CPIN document was concerned with treatment options but
    did not deal with the  appellant's  particular  condition  and  so  was
    irrelevant.

22. Secondly, as regards  AM  (Zimbabwe),  Mr  Howells  accepted  that  the
    evidence was that the appellant would die within  four  months  without
    treatment.  He accepted that, following AM (Zimbabwe) that engaged  Art
    3 of the ECHR.  However, he submitted that the judge had found that the
    appellant would be able to obtain treatment and that, in the absence of
    evidence concerning the cost of any treatment in Pakistan, it was  open
    to the judge to find the treatment was both  available  and  accessible
    and that, therefore, no breach of  Art  3  had  been  established.   Mr
    Howells submitted that the judge was entitled to  find  that  treatment
    was available following the MedCOI response.  He accepted that  he  did
    not know why the material from Pakistan upon which  this  response  was
    based had not been served.  He pointed out, however,  that  no  request
    for that material had  previously  been  made  by  the  appellant.   He
    accepted that there might be an  apparent  conflict  in  the  evidence,
    between the MedCOI Report and Dr Zia, however the judge was entitled to
    rely upon the MedCOI response.

23. Finally, as regards Art 8, Mr Howells submitted that,  based  upon  his
    records of the hearing, the Presenting Officer had made submissions  on
    Art 8 and its application based upon SL  (St  Lucia).   However,  those
    submissions had preceded Counsel for the appellant's submissions and it
    did not  appear  that  Counsel  had  advanced  any  factor  beyond  the
    appellant's health condition to support a claim that there was a breach
    of Art 8 based upon the appellant's private life returning to Pakistan.

Discussion

24. The appellant's claim under Art 3 was founded on the  impact  upon  his
    health, due to his suffering from the congenital form  of  TTP,  if  he
    returned to Pakistan.  The medical evidence, which the judge  accepted,
    was that without treatment the appellant would die within four  months.



25. At the time of the judge's decision, the application of Art 3 in health
    cases was governed by the House of Lords' decision in N  v  SSHD.   The
    judge correctly identified (at paras 40-43), that the decision in  N  v
    SSHD restricted Art 3 claims based upon the impact upon an individual's
    health on return to their own country to so-called "death  bed"  cases.
    The fact  that  an  individual's  life  expectancy  would  be  reduced,
    significantly or otherwise, on return could not found a claim under Art
    3.  That was the decision of the House of Lords in  N  v  SSHD  as  the
    judge recognised in para 40 of her determination.

26. The judge cannot be faulted for applying the law as it was  thought  to
    be at the time of her decision.  She was bound by N v SSHD as the Court
    of Appeal recognised in AM (Zimbabwe) prior to that case being appealed
    to the Supreme Court (see [2018] EWCA Civ 64) and also in PF  (Nigeria)
    v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1139.

27. However, when AM  (Zimbabwe)  reached  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Court
    adopted a different approach to that in N v SSHD seeking to apply,  and
    explain, the Strasbourg Court's subsequent decision in Paposhvili.   As
    a declaration of the law, that interpretation, and application of Art 3
    in health cases, had retrospective effect, in the  sense  that  it  was
    always the law even if the law had previously  been  understood  to  be
    otherwise.  Therefore, if the judge applied Art 3 in a way contrary  to
    the Supreme Court's approach in AM (Zimbabwe), albeit through no  fault
    of her own, she would have misdirected herself and would, as a  result,
    have erred in law.  It is plain to me  that  the  judge  did  misdirect
    herself in law.

28.  In  AM  (Zimbabwe),  the  Supreme  Court  approved  the  approach   in
    Paposhvili.  The Supreme Court held ([27]-[31]) that, in health  cases,
    a breach of Art 3 could be established in one of two situations:

         where the evidence established that there were  reasonable  grounds
         for believing that there was a real risk that, in  the  absence  of
         appropriate treatment

         (1) an  individual  would  be  exposed  to  a  serious,  rapid  and
         irreversible  decline  in  his  or  health  resulting  in   intense
         suffering; or

         (2) an individual would suffer  a  significant  reduction  in  life
         expectancy.

29. Whether a reduction in life expectancy is "significant"  was  explained
    by the Supreme Court at [31] (per Lord Wilson) as follows:

         "It remains, however, to consider what the Grand Chamber  did  mean
         by its reference to a "significant" reduction in life expectancy in
         para 183 of its judgment in the Paposhvili case. Like the skin of a
         chameleon, the adjective takes a different colour so as to  suit  a
         different context. Here the general context is  inhuman  treatment;
         and  the  particular  context  is  that  the  alternative   to   "a
         significant reduction in life expectancy" is "a serious, rapid  and
         irreversible decline in ... health resulting in intense suffering".
         From these contexts  the  adjective  takes  its  colour.  The  word
         "significant"  often   means   something   less   than   the   word
         "substantial". In  context,  however,  it  must  in  my  view  mean
         substantial. Indeed, were a reduction in life expectancy to be less
         than substantial, it would not attain the minimum level of severity
         which article 3 requires. Surely the Court of Appeal was correct to
         suggest, albeit in words too extreme,  that  a  reduction  in  life
         expectancy to death in  the  near  future  is  more  likely  to  be
         significant than any other reduction. But even a reduction to death
         in the near future might be significant for one person but not  for
         another. Take a person aged 74, with an expectancy of  life  normal
         for that age. Were that person's expectancy be reduced to, say, two
         years, the reduction  might  well  -  in  this  context  -  not  be
         significant. But compare that person  with  one  aged  24  with  an
         expectancy of life normal for that age. Were his or her  expectancy
         to  be  reduced  to  two  years,  the  reduction  might   well   be
         significant."

30. Consequently,  a  "significant"  reduction  in  life  expectancy  is  a
    "substantial" reduction.  Whether a reduction  in  life  expectancy  is
    "significant" takes its colour from the context, in  particular  having
    regard to the measure of the reduction given the age of the individual.

31. The Supreme Court also made plain that in determining whether a  breach
    of Art 3 was established, it was  necessary  to  consider  whether  (1)
    treatment was available; and (2) if it was, whether it  was  accessible
    by the individual (see [23(b)]-[23(e)]).  The Supreme Court  identified
    that, once Art 3 was engaged based upon the appellant establishing  the
    implications to his health on return without treatment, it was for  the
    state, essentially to "dispel any doubts" concerning  the  availability
    and accessibility of treatment.  At [32]-[34], Lord Wilson said this:

         "32. ... The basic principle is that, if you allege a breach of
         your rights, it is for you to establish it. But "Convention
         proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous
         application of [that] principle ...": DH v Czech Republic (2008) 47
         EHRR 3, para 179. It is clear that, in application to claims under
         article 3 to resist return by reference to ill-health, the Grand
         Chamber has indeed modified that principle. The threshold, set out
         in para 23(a) above, is for the applicant to adduce evidence
         "capable of demonstrating that there are substantial grounds for
         believing" that article 3 would be violated. It may make formidable
         intellectual demands on decision-makers who conclude that the
         evidence does not establish "substantial grounds" to have to
         proceed to consider whether nevertheless it is "capable of
         demonstrating" them. But, irrespective of the perhaps unnecessary
         complexity of the test, let no one imagine that it represents an
         undemanding threshold for an applicant to cross. For the requisite
         capacity of the evidence adduced by the applicant is to demonstrate
         "substantial" grounds for believing that it is a "very exceptional"
         case because of a "real" risk of subjection to "inhuman" treatment.
         All three parties accept that Sales LJ was correct, in para 16, to
         describe the threshold as an obligation on an applicant to raise a
         "prima facie case" of potential infringement of article 3. This
         means a case which, if not challenged or countered, would establish
         the infringement: see para 112 of a useful analysis in the
         Determination of the President of the Upper Tribunal and two of its
         senior judges in AXB v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2019] UKUT 397 (IAC). Indeed, as the tribunal proceeded to explain
         in para 123, the arrangements in the UK are such that the decisions
         whether the applicant has adduced evidence to the requisite
         standard and, if so, whether it has been successfully countered
         fall to be taken initially by the Secretary of State and, in the
         event of an appeal, again by the First-tier Tribunal.

         33. In the event that  the  applicant  presents  evidence  to  the
         standard addressed above, the returning state can seek to challenge
         or counter it in the manner helpfully outlined in the  judgment  in
         the Paposhvili case at paras 187 to  191  and  summarised  at  para
         23(b) to  (e)  above.  The  premise  behind  the  guidance,  surely
         reasonable, is that, while  it  is  for  the  applicant  to  adduce
         evidence about his or  her  medical  condition,  current  treatment
         (including the likely suitability of any other treatment)  and  the
         effect on him or her of inability to access it, the returning state
         is better able to  collect  evidence  about  the  availability  and
         accessibility of suitable treatment in the  receiving  state.  What
         will most surprise the first-time reader  of  the  Grand  Chamber's
         judgment is the reference in para 187 to the  suggested  obligation
         on the returning  state  to  dispel  "any"  doubts  raised  by  the
         applicant's evidence. But, when the reader  reaches  para  191  and
         notes the reference, in precisely the  same  context,  to  "serious
         doubts", he will realise that "any" doubts in para  187  means  any
         serious doubts. For proof, or in this  case  disproof,  beyond  all
         doubt is a concept rightly unknown to the Convention."

32. In this case, the judge, in my view, fell into error for the  following
    reasons.

33. First, in the light of the Supreme Court's decision  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)
    the judge applied too high a threshold for  Art  3  to  be  engaged  on
    health grounds.  The Supreme Court 'departed from' (i.e. overruled) N v
    SSHD (see [34]).  The Court strongly indicated that N v SSHD (where the
    individual's life expectancy was less than 2 years  without  treatment)
    was now wrongly decided on its facts (see  [27]).   The  position,  not
    challenged before me, based upon the medical  evidence,  was  that  the
    appellant  would  die  within  four  months  if  he  did  not   receive
    medication.  That was certainly capable of amounting to  -  if  not  in
    fact being - a "significant  reduction  in  life  expectancy"  for  the
    appellant aged 35-years-old and which, following AM  (Zimbabwe),  would
    engage Art 3 of the ECHR.

34. Secondly, the judge's assessment of the availability and  accessibility
    of treatment for the appellant's congenital form of TTP is flawed.   It
    is clear from the medical evidence, and this was  not  disputed  before
    me, that the treatment for the autoimmune variant is different from the
    treatment for the congenital variant of TTP.  Dr Rayment's evidence was
    that she had only been able to discover treatment in Pakistan  for  the
    autoimmune variant of TTP.  There was, however,  evidence  led  by  the
    appellant that treatment for the congenital  variant  of  TTP  was  not
    available in Pakistan.  Consequently, in the email exchange between  Dr
    Zia and  those  representing  the  appellant  (at  pages  30-32),  when
    directly asked whether the appellant could obtain  access  to  lifelong
    replacement of ADAMTS13 enzyme either in the  form  of  regular  plasma
    infusion or Factor VIII concentrate, Dr Zia replied as follows:

         "We only done Plasmapheresis on TTP an Autoimmune Disorder  and  we
         do long sessions of Plasmapheresis on TTP Patients and During  long
         sessions we remove maximum plasma and replace it  with  FFP  (Fresh
         Frozen Plasma) ... No any other Clinical intervention is being done
         in Pakistan ... What you are suggesting that is an advanced therapy
         which is not available in Pakistan".

35. That evidence, although it took a couple of email exchanges to  obtain,
    is clear.

36. Against that, the respondent relies upon the MedCOI response (at  pages
    I1-I5 of the respondent's bundle).  It states at para 1.3.1

         "MedCOI  advise  that  Factor  VIII  plus  Von  Willebrand   Factor
         (combination - Dried Factor VIII Fraction, Type 8Y is  available)".



37. That appears to be a reference to the treatment by Factor VIII, Type 8Y
    which the appellant receives in the UK.

38. Mr Blackwood objected  that  the  original  evidence  upon  which  this
    paragraph is based, namely a response  received  from  Pakistan  on  15
    September 2018, has not  been  provided  to  the  appellant.   That  is
    undoubtedly the case but, as Mr Howells  submitted,  it  has  also  not
    previously been requested.  On the face of it, this  evidence  supports
    the  respondent's  position  and,  as  was  pointed  out  to  me,   the
    appellant's specific circumstances, and the treatment he requires,  are
    spelt out in the  document.   It  would,  in  my  judgment,  have  been
    desirable (subject to any issues  of  confidentiality)  if  the  actual
    response  from  Pakistan  had  been  disclosed.   It   may   well   be,
    particularly given  the  evidence  to  the  contrary  obtained  by  the
    appellant's  representatives,  that  the  Secretary  of  State   should
    disclose this material, if at all possible, in order to  discharge  her
    obligation under Art  3  as  envisaged  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe).  Given my view as to the disposal of this appeal,  I  would
    anticipate  that,  subject  to  any  issues  of  confidentiality,  that
    disclosure would be forthcoming.

39. In any event, before the judge there was conflicting evidence which, on
    the face of  it,  said  that  treatment  was  both  available  and  not
    available in Pakistan for the congenital variant of TTP with which  the
    appellant suffered.  The judge did not grapple with  that  conflict  in
    the evidence.  Instead, at para 38 she simply stated that:

         "The respondent has demonstrated that there is treatment  available
         in Pakistan for the congenital TTP, I was referred  to  the  MedCOI
         Report".

40. In failing to  resolve  this  (apparent)  difference  in  the  evidence
    concerning the availability of treatment in Pakistan, the  judge  erred
    in law.

41. Further, in dealing with the availability of treatment at  paras  44-45
    of her determination which I set out above, the judge appears  to  have
    placed an unwarranted burden of proof upon the appellant to  show  that
    "no  clinics  or  welfare  foundations"  provided  the  treatment   the
    appellant needed.  She appears to have inferred, that because treatment
    for the autoimmune TTP variant in Pakistan is available,  at  least  in
    one welfare clinic, then the congenital variant of TTP (with which  the
    appellant suffers) is not "so rare" in Pakistan  and  appears  to  have
    inferred that treatment might, therefore, be available for it.  None of
    that reasoning is, in my judgment,  sustainable  in  the  light  of  AM
    (Zimbabwe) and the obligation on the Secretary of State  to  assist  in
    resolving or dispelling any doubts about whether treatment is available
    (or indeed accessible) in the country of  return.   The  inference  the
    judge draws from the fact that treatment for the autoimmune form of TTP
    is available, does not seem to  me  to  be  a  rational  basis  for  an
    inference that treatment for the congenital form of  TTP  is  available
    given that the treatments are different.

42. Added to that, however, is the issue of  whether,  even  if  available,
    treatment would be accessible.   Dr  Rayment  gave  evidence  that  the
    appellant's treatment cost �66,000 in the UK.  Whilst  the  judge  took
    the view that there was no documentary evidence to support that figure,
    it was part of Dr Rayment's written evidence  and  her  oral  evidence.
    That there was no accounting evidence of the cost was not, in itself, a
    good reason for not accepting Dr Rayment's oral and written evidence of
    the costing of the treatment in the UK.  Of course, the issue concerned
    the  accessibility  of  the  treatment  in  Pakistan.   As  Mr  Howells
    submitted, there was  in  fact  no  evidence  of  the  actual  cost  of
    treatment in Pakistan.  The only evidence concerning the  places  where
    treatment was available was in paras 1.4.1  and  1.4.2  of  the  MedCOI
    Report.  Two of those facilities are described as a "private  facility"
    whilst one, in Rawalpindi is described as  a  "public  facility".   The
    document does not, however, indicate whether  any  treatment  would  be
    free of charge and,  if  not,  at  what  cost.   Indeed,  the  document
    contains a specific disclaimer that:

         "The  information  is  limited  to  the  availability  of   medical
         treatment,   usually   at   a   particular   hospital/clinic/health
         institute,  in  the  country  of  origin;  it  does   not   provide
         information on the accessibility of treatment". (my emphasis)

43. Of course, the appellant's case, based upon his evidence obtained  from
    Pakistan, was that treatment was not available.  The respondent's  case
    was that  it  was  available.   As  part  of  that  evidence,  and  the
    respondent's obligation recognised in AM (Zimbabwe), it  was  incumbent
    on the Secretary of State  also  to  provide  evidence  concerning  the
    accessibility, including the cost,  if  any,  of  treatment  which  she
    claimed was available contrary to the appellant's evidence.

44. Consequently, the judge erred in law in finding that no breach of Art 3
    had  been  established.   The  judge  misdirected  herself  as  to  the
    appropriate test to be applied under  Art  3  and  failed  properly  to
    consider  whether  treatment  would  be   "available"   and,   if   so,
    "accessible" on return to Pakistan.

45. In the light of this conclusion, the judge's decision  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 3 involved a material  error  of  law  and
    cannot stand.

46. I have reached this decision without needing to resolve Mr  Blackwood's
    submissions based upon the judge's failure  to  consider,  because  the
    respondent did not provide her with these documents, the policies  upon
    which Mr Blackwood placed reliance.  On this issue, however, I  do  not
    accept Mr Blackwood's submissions.

47. Neither AA(Afghanistan) nor Mandalia assists the appellant.

48. AA (Afghanistan)  concerned  an  appeal  when  the  grounds  of  appeal
    included as a ground of appeal that an immigration decision was "not in
    accordance with the law".  The  Court  of  Appeal  concluded  that  the
    respondent's decision was not "in  accordance  with  the  law"  when  a
    relevant policy, there the policy on unaccompanied minors, had not been
    properly taken into account by the respondent and the judge  had  erred
    in law by not so concluding (see [16]).  That ground of  appeal  is  no
    longer available under s.84 of the NIA  Act  2002  as  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.

49. The same is true in relation  to  Mandalia  where  the  challenge  was,
    ultimately, to the respondent's decision in a points-based system  case
    where it was alleged that, on the basis of Casework  Instructions,  the
    Secretary of State had a policy on "evidential flexibility"  which  she
    had not applied.  It was a case, therefore,  which  not  only  directly
    relied  upon  a  failure  to  consider  a  policy  but  also,  like  AA
    (Afghanistan), was at a time when one of the grounds of appeal was that
    an immigration decision was "not in accordance with the law"  which  it
    would have been if the respondent failed to  apply  a  relevant  policy
    (see R (Lumba v SSHD [2011] UKSC 12).

50. The final case relied upon, namely UB (Sri Lanka) involved a failure to
    disclose relevant  background  material,  based  in  the  Secretary  of
    State's guidance on the possible implications of membership of the TGTE
    (a proscribed organisation)  for  return  to  Sri  Lanka.   That  case,
    therefore,  goes  no  further  than  indicating  that  policy  guidance
    relevant to the substance of an individual's claim  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, should be disclosed by the Secretary of State  in  order
    to assist the First-tier Tribunal to make a decision on the  merits  of
    the individual's appeal.  It begs the question as to the  relevance  of
    any policy.

51. In this case, all but one of the documents relied upon by Mr  Blackwood
    and which I refer to above,  relate  to  how  the  Secretary  of  State
    applies Art 3 of the ECHR or, in one case,  reaches  decisions  outside
    the Rules under Art 8.  The  "Human  Rights  Claim  Guidance"  and  the
    "Human Rights Claim Medical Guidance" (set out at paras 13  and  14  of
    the Grounds), go no further than guidance to  caseworkers  on  how  the
    case law requires the respondent to approach Art 3  (and  Art  8).   In
    fact, as I pointed out to Mr  Blackwood  during  his  submissions,  the
    Guidance is based upon N v SSHD since it predates  AM  (Zimbabwe).   In
    its interpretation of Art 3, it is, therefore, based upon  an  approach
    which no longer represents the law.  It is difficult to  see  how  this
    could (now) be said to have assisted the judge  in  reaching  a  lawful
    decision under Art 3.  In any event, I accept  Mr  Howells'  submission
    that the proper scope of Art 3 (or indeed Art 8) is a question  of  law
    (and fact) for the judge who has properly  to  apply  those  provisions
    whatever is said, for the benefit of decision makers  within  the  Home
    Office, in guidance.  It cannot be argued that, to the extent that  the
    guidance lowered the threshold for Art 3  (which  of  course  it  could
    not), the appellant would be entitled to succeed under Art 3.

52. As regards the "Leave Outside the Immigration  Rules  Guidance"  (LOTR)
    (set out at para 15 of the Grounds), it states that:

         "Where the Immigration Rules are not met, and where  there  are  no
         exceptional circumstances that  warrant  a  grant  of  leave  under
         Article 8, Article 3 medical or discretionary policies,  there  may
         be other factors that  when  taken  into  account  along  with  the
         compelling compassionate grounds  raised  in  an  individual  case,
         warrant the grant of LOTR."

53. As I pointed out to Mr Blackwood during his  submissions,  the  passage
    upon which he placed reliance, is concerned with the situation where an
    individual cannot succeed under Arts 3 or 8 of the ECHR and a  decision
    maker is  considering  whether,  nevertheless,  to  grant  leave  on  a
    discretionary basis outside any claim based upon human rights.  I  fail
    to see how that could have been relevant to the judge's  assessment  of
    the appellant's Art 8 claim, let alone his Art 3 claim.

54. The one potential exception to what I have said, is the "Medical  CPIN"
    which is referred to in para  16  of  the  appellant's  Grounds.   That
    policy would, it appears, be relevant to the extent  that  it  provided
    information  about  what  treatment  was  available  or,  as   to   its
    accessibility, in Pakistan.  The appellant's grounds do not  spell  out
    how specifically it would be relevant in relation to the  treatment  of
    the appellant's TTP in Pakistan.  Mr Howells told me that  it  contains
    no  information  on  the   availability   of   treatment.    In   those
    circumstances, in itself, the fact that this document was not drawn  to
    the judge's attention does not, in my view, establish any error of  law
    in her reaching her conclusion.

55. However, as I have already determined, the judge did materially err  in
    law in dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art  3.   That  decision
    must be set aside and be re-made.  It was common  ground  between  both
    representatives that the appeal should be remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh decision, based upon all the evidence,  under  Art
    3.

56. It remains whether, when remitted, the judge should also consider Art 8
    of the ECHR.  Having heard argument from both representatives,  and  in
    the light  of  what  is  said  by  the  judge  and  in  the  Record  of
    Proceedings, it seems reasonably  plain  to  me  that  the  appellant's
    (then) Counsel did not rely upon Art 8 beyond a contention  that,  even
    if a breach of Art 3 was  not  established,  a  breach  of  Art  8  was
    established based upon the appellant's medical condition.

57. As I pointed out to Mr Blackwood during his submissions, the  appellant
    was subject to deportation and the respondent had decided that he was a
    "persistent offender" and one whose offences had caused "serious harm".
     Despite him not having been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of
    twelve months or more, the appellant was therefore a "foreign criminal"
    to  whom  s.117C  of  the  NIA  Act  2002  (as  amended)  applied.   No
    submissions had been made, and none were recorded, on  the  application
    of s.117C if reliance was being placed upon Art 8.  The appellant could
    only have succeeded  if  he  could  establish  either  Exception  1  or
    Exception 2 in s.117C(4) and (5) or that there  were  "very  compelling
    circumstances"  over  and  above  Exception  1  or  Exception  2   (see
    s.117C(6)).   That would be  very  surprising  if  reliance  was  being
    placed on Art 8 on a 'broader' basis that the health  implications  for
    the appellant.  Mr Blackwood acknowledged that potential inference.

58. I do not accept that the appellant's Counsel relied upon Art  8  beyond
    the appellant's medical condition.   I  am  not,  therefore,  persuaded
    that the judge materially erred in law in failing to consider Art 8  if
    her decision in respect of Art 3 had been sustainable.  Of course,  for
    the reasons I have given, it is not sustainable.  However, there is  no
    adverse decision under Art 8 and I see no reason why it should  not  be
    open to the appellant to rely upon Art 8, should he wish to,  when  the
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.



Decision and Disposal

59. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of  law.
    That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

60. It was common ground between the  representatives,  and  with  which  I
    agree, that the proper disposal of this appeal is to remit  it  to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  de  novo  rehearing  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's claim under Art 3 and, to the extent he wishes to rely upon
    it, Art 8 of the ECHR.  The appeal to be heard by a  judge  other  than
    Judge Richardson.

Costs

61. Prior  to  the  hearing,  on  27  August  2020  the  appellant's  legal
    representatives made an application for "wasted costs" under rule 10 of
    the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules.  The basis of this claim  was  that
    the respondent did not, through a representative, attend the hearing on
    23 July 2020 listed  for  a  remote  Skype  hearing.   The  appellant's
    counsel did attend and the hearing was adjourned in the absence of  the
    respondent.

62. In response, the Secretary of State filed submissions by email dated  2
    September 2020 seeking to resist a costs order. The respondent  pointed
    out that the "list split" for the 23rd July, issued by Field  House  on
    8th July, did not show the appeal as  listed.  She  accepted  that  the
    Hearing Notice "must have" been received but the case  must  have  been
    added to the list after the "list split" was  issued.   She  apologised
    for the oversight.

63. Mr Blackwood indicated that he maintained the application for costs and
    submitted that the  respondent's  explanation  that  the  "list  split"
    issued for the relevant date did not contain  the  appellant's  hearing
    had to be seen in the light  of  the  fact  that,  it  appeared  to  be
    accepted, that the respondent had received a  Notice  of  Hearing.   He
    invited me to find that the respondent had acted "unreasonably".

64. Whilst the appellant's application seeks a  "wasted  costs"  order,  in
    fact that cannot be the basis of the application.  It is clear  that  a
    "wasted costs"  order  under  s.29(4)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007, which by virtue of rule 10(3)(c) of the Procedure
    Rules could be made in these appeal proceedings, is one made against  a
    legal or other representative of a party (see s.29(4)(b)) on the  basis
    that there  has  been  "improper,  unreasonable  or  negligent  act  or
    omission on the part of  any  legal  or  other  representative  or  any
    employee of such a representative" (see s.29(5)).  That does not  apply
    where the respondent is "represented" by a  Presenting  Officer  in   a
    statutory appeal (see Awuah &  Ors  (Wasted  Costs  Orders  -  HOPOs  -
    Tribunal Powers) [2017] UKFTT 555 (IAC) (McCloskey J (UTIAC  President)
    and Judge M Clements (FtTIAC President)).

65. Rather, the application must be related to rule 12(3)(d)  which  states
    that the Upper Tribunal may make an order in respect of costs:

         "If the Upper Tribunal considers that a party or its representative
         has acted unreasonably in bringing, defending or conducting the
         proceedings".

66. In order to succeed the appellant must establish that the Secretary  of
    State acted "unreasonably" in the conduct of the proceedings by failing
    to attend the hearing on 23 July of this year.

67. In Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] Ch 205,  the  Court  of  Appeal  (Lord
    Bingham MR and Rose and  Waite  LJJ)  provided  what  is  the  accepted
    interpretation of  the  statutory  phrase  "improper,  unreasonable  or
    negligent" in the context of a "wasted costs order".  Lord  Bingham  MR
    said this (at p232):

         ""Improper, unreasonable or negligent"

         A  number  of  different  submissions  were  made  on  the  correct
         construction of these crucial words in the new section 51(7) of the
         Supreme  Court  Act  1981.  In  our  view  the  meaning  of   these
         expressions is not open to serious doubt.

             "Improper" means what it has been understood to mean  in  this
             context for at least half a century. The adjective covers, but
             is not confined to, conduct which would ordinarily be held  to
             justify disbarment, striking off, suspension from practice  or
             other serious professional penalty. It covers any  significant
             breach of a substantial duty imposed by  a  relevant  code  of
             professional conduct. But it is not in our judgment limited to
             that. Conduct which would be regarded as improper according to
             the consensus of professional (including judicial) opinion can
             be fairly stigmatised as such whether or not it  violates  the
             letter of a professional code.

             "Unreasonable" also means what it has been understood to  mean
             in this context for at least half a  century.  The  expression
             aptly describes conduct which is vexatious, designed to harass
             the other side rather than advance the resolution of the case,
             and it makes no difference that the conduct is the product  of
             excessive zeal and not improper motive. But conduct cannot  be
             described as unreasonable simply because it leads in the event
             to an unsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal
             representatives would have acted differently. The acid test is
             whether the conduct permits of a  reasonable  explanation.  If
             so, the course adopted may be regarded as  optimistic  and  as
             reflecting  on  a  practitioner's  judgment,  but  it  is  not
             unreasonable.

         The term "negligent" was the most controversial of  the  three.  It
         was argued that the 1990 Act, in this context as  in  others,  used
         "negligent" as a term of art involving the  well-known  ingredients
         of duty, breach, causation and damage.

         Therefore, it was said, conduct cannot  be  regarded  as  negligent
         unless  it   involves   an   actionable   breach   of   the   legal
         representative's duty to his own client, to whom alone  a  duty  is
         owed. We reject this approach:

             (1) As already noted, the predecessor of the present Order  62
             rule  11  made  reference  to  "reasonable  competence".  That
             expression does not invoke technical concepts of  the  law  of
             negligence. It seems to us inconceivable that by changing  the
             language Parliament intended to make it  harder,  rather  than
             easier, for courts to make orders.

             (2) Since the  applicant's  right  to  a  wasted  costs  order
             against a legal representative depends  on  showing  that  the
             latter is in breach of his duty to the court it makes no sense
             to superimpose a requirement under this head (but not  in  the
             case of impropriety or unreasonableness) that he  is  also  in
             breach of his duty to his client.

         We cannot regard this as, in practical terms, a  very  live  issue,
         since it requires some ingenuity to postulate a situation in  which
         a legal representative causes the other side to  incur  unnecessary
         costs without at the same time running up unnecessary costs for his
         own side and so  breaching  the  ordinary  duty  owed  by  a  legal
         representative to his client. But for whatever  importance  it  may
         have, we are clear that "negligent"  should  be  understood  in  an
         untechnical way to  denote  failure  to  act  with  the  competence
         reasonably to be expected of ordinary members of the profession.

         In adopting an untechnical approach to the meaning of negligence in
         this context, we would however wish firmly  to  discountenance  any
         suggestion that an applicant for a wasted costs  order  under  this
         head need prove anything less than he would have  to  prove  in  an
         action for negligence : "advice, acts or omissions in the course of
         their professional work which no member of the profession  who  was
         reasonably well- informed and competent would have given or done or
         omitted to do"; an error "such as no reasonably  well-informed  and
         competent member of that profession could have made"  (Saif  Ali  v
         Sydney Mitchell & Co, at pages 218 D, 220 D, per Lord Diplock).

         We  were  invited  to  give   the   three   adjectives   (improper,
         unreasonable and negligent) specific, self-contained  meanings,  so
         as to avoid overlap between the three. We do not  read  these  very
         familiar expressions in that way. Conduct which is unreasonable may
         also  be  improper,  and  conduct  which  is  negligent  will  very
         frequently be (if it is not by definition) unreasonable. We do  not
         think any sharp differentiation between these expressions is useful
         or necessary or intended." (my emphasis)

68. That approach has been approved by in the IAC Chambers leading cases of
    Cancino (costs - First-tier Tribunal -  new  powers)  [2015]  UKFTT  59
    (IAC) and Thapa & Ors (costs; general  principles;  s9  review)  [2018]
    UKUT 54 (IAC).

69. In Thapa, the UT noted that the guidance  in  Cancino  meant  that  the
    power  to  award  costs  under  rule  10  should  be   exercised   with
    "significant restraint" (at [28]).

70. To make an award of costs, the appellant  must  persuade  me  that  the
    conduct of the respondent was "unreasonable" as set out in Ridehalgh  v
    Horsefield; it caused the appellant to incur unnecessary costs; and  it
    is just to make a costs order (see Cancion at [18] and [19]).

71. It is, perhaps, noteworthy that the hearing on 23 July was within a few
    weeks of remote hearings beginning  in  the  UT  at  the  Cardiff  CJC.
    Previously, hearings on a particular day were conventionally all listed
    for 10am.  It was only as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  remote
    hearings that the UT began listing individual hearings on a  particular
    day in three specific slots in the morning and afternoon.  It is  clear
    from the documents attached to the respondent's costs submissions  that
    the "list split" for 23 July at the Cardiff CJC only contained  a  case
    to be heard in the morning, whilst the  appellant's  case  was,  as  it
    turns out, listed in the afternoon.  The respondent  relied  upon  that
    "list split" although recognising that the case must have  been  listed
    and a Notice of Hearing sent prior to that date.  It is said  that  the
    appellant's case must have been added  to  the  list  after  the  "list
    split" was issued.  That is, in my view, a reasonable  inference.   The
    appellant's representatives state that  they  received  the  Notice  of
    Hearing on 9 July - the day after the  "list  split"  was  issued.   It
    would appear that,  relying  upon  the  "list  split",  the  respondent
    overlooked any Notice of Hearing sent subsequent to  the  "list  split"
    which included notice of the appellant's appeal  being  listed  in  the
    afternoon of 23 July.  The respondent's submissions state that she  has
    no record of any amended "list split" subsequently being issued.

72. On the basis of the material before me, I am  persuaded  that,  in  the
    light of the "list split" which on the  evidence  was  the  only  "list
    split" issued by the UT, the  respondent  made  an  honest  mistake  in
    overlooking the later listing of the appeal and proceeding on the basis
    that no case was listed in the afternoon.  The respondent was  entitled
    reasonably to rely upon the "list split" issued by the UT.  It  was  an
    unfortunate oversight but one that has to be seen in the light  of  the
    (then) very recent emergence of remote hearings following the  national
    shutdown due  to  the  COVID-19  crisis.   Having  regard  to  all  the
    circumstances I have set  out  above,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  the
    respondent's conduct reaches the threshold justifying an order of costs
    under rule  10(2)(b)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  Rules.   For  these
    reasons, I decline to make an order of costs in favour of the appellant
    against the respondent under rule 10(3)(d).
