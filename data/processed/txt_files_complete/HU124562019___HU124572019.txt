                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

      1. On 11 November 2019  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Brookfield  ('the
         Judge') dismissed the appeals of  the  above  appellants  on  human
         rights grounds. Permission to appeal has been granted on a  renewed
         application by a judge of the Upper Tribunal the operative part  of
         the grant being in the following terms:

             "All grounds are arguable. In particular it is  arguable  that
             there was no evidential basis for  the  Tribunal's  conclusion
             that  the  Appellants  would  be  returning  to   Nigeria   in
             possession of a �2000 assistance grant, or that the  Appellant
             would be able to secure accommodation  in  Nigeria  using  the
             Internet; it  is  further  arguable  that  in  its  Article  8
             assessment the Tribunal failed to take material evidence about
             the lead Appellant's personal history into account."

Background

      2. The first appellant is a female national  of  Nigeria  born  on  10
         October 1991. The second appellant is  her  son,  also  a  Nigerian
         national, born on  8  November  2018  who  is  dependent  upon  his
         mother's claim/appeal.

      3. The first appellant claimed to have entered the United  Kingdom  on
         31 March 2007 although the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  noted  the
         respondent had no evidence of her legal entry  into  the  UK.   The
         first appellant applied for leave to remain on  the  basis  of  her
         human rights in August 2009 which was refused on 16 October 2009. A
         further application on human rights grounds made on 21  March  2011
         was refused in April 2011. An application made on 10 July  2017  on
         the basis of family and private life was rejected on 10 July  2017.
         An application on 14 March 2019 for  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK
         outside the Immigration Rules was refused on 5 July 2019  which  is
         the decision appealed before the First-tier Tribunal.

      4. Having  considered  the  available  evidence  the  Judge  sets  out
         findings of fact from [7] of the decision under challenge  (leading
         to the conclusion at [8(xxxiv)] that the respondent's  decision  is
         in accordance with the law and  does  not  violate  the  article  8
         rights of the appellants or their  family  members  in  the  UK  or
         violate section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act
         2009 in relation to the first appellant's son.

      5. A chronology is set out at  [2  -  6]  of  the  appellants  grounds
         seeking permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  in  the
         following terms:

             2.   The Principle appellant [A] is a citizen of  Nigeria  who
                  was born there on the 10 October 1991. She came to the  UK
                  to join her parents when she was aged  15  years  old  and
                  lived as part of the 'family unit until  2014',  when  she
                  was "severed" from  the  unit  by  reason  of  her  family
                  becoming destitute and the A as a result became  homeless.
                  By that time the A  had  developed  important  and  strong
                  family relations with her siblings  [I]  (dob  23.9.2006),
                  [P] (dob 1.11.2007), and [PR] (dob 6.7.2012).

             3.   Despite her forced physical separation from her family  A
                  maintained close ties with her parents and siblings.

             4.   On the 8.11.2018 the A gave birth to her son  the  second
                  appellant [A1].

             5.   On 24 July 2019 the A's mother and siblings were  granted
                  limited leave to remain under the  provisions  of  the  10
                  year parent route under Appendix FM. The A  could  not  be
                  included in that application because she was over the  age
                  of 18 at the time the application was made on  12  January
                  2019.

             6.   On 17 April 2019 an application to remain on human rights
                  grounds on behalf of both the appellant's was sought,  and
                  the important background information relating to  the  A's
                  immigration  history  was  set  out  and  in  addition  to
                  asserting the "very  significant"  difficulties  that  the
                  appellant would have in re-establishing her  private  life
                  [as a lone single mother] it  was  made  plain  that  with
                  regard to her family life claim to remain, that she relied
                  on the close/connections relationship  with  her  siblings
                  that her siblings best  interests  as  well  as  her  own,
                  should be  taken  into  account  and  there  was  specific
                  reference to the case of Beoku-Betts  (FC)  (Appellant)  v
                  SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 .

Grounds and submissions

      6. The appellant relied on two grounds of  challenge  to  the  Judge's
         decision.

      7. The first ground asserts the  Judge  failed  to  properly  consider
         section 55 best interests of the appellant's siblings. At the  date
         of the application [I] was 11 years of age, [P] was  10  years  old
         and [PR] was 6. The grounds assert it is significant  that  at  the
         date of the hearing all three were still minors  and  [I]  and  [P]
         have British nationality.

      8. It is asserted the Judge had evidence  from  the  siblings  in  the
         appellant's appeal bundle setting out the strength  of  family  and
         private life with the first appellant and that it was submitted  at
         the hearing that section 55 applied to all affected minors in  this
         case; yet the Judge failed to properly direct herself  in  law  and
         failed to consider section 55 best interests of  all  the  affected
         children which it is claimed amounts to an error of law.

      9. Ground 2 asserts the Judge has made an unsafe findings of fact. The
         appellant asserts the Judge's findings that each of the  appellants
         could apply for financial help of up to �2000 each which  could  be
         used to pay for accommodation whilst she was looking for employment
         or to enable her to set up her own business was  not  available  to
         the Judge as the appellant is not a 'voluntary returnee' and so  is
         not eligible. The appellant asserts the Judge took into  account  a
         matter that should not have been taken into  account.  The  grounds
         assert the Judge did not sign a declaration of voluntary return  as
         required under the Voluntary Return Scheme (VRS) and that there was
         insufficient evidence before the Judge  to  show  what  package  of
         support will be available to the appellants.

     10.  The  grounds  also  assert  that  although  the  appellants   were
         temporarily  homelessness  in  the  UK  they   were   still   being
         accommodated and financially supported  and  the  Judges  rationale
         that because they were homeless in the UK they can be  homeless  in
         Nigeria is said to be  impermissible  and  an  error  of  law.  The
         appellant also asserts the suggestion by the Judge that  she  could
         and should conduct Internet searches  for  jobs  and  accommodation
         misses the point that the appellant had stated  she  was  unskilled
         would have no means to pay for accommodation and support her infant
         child.

     11. It was submitted by Mr Brown, inter alia, The Judge failed to  deal
         with the cultural context of family life and the  fact  that  if  a
         person's moves severs the  family  life  which  previously  existed
         recognised by article 8 per se, that should be  factored  into  the
         equation. It is argued the Judge did not take into account the fact
         the first appellant was with her mother until she was  13  and  her
         grandmother one year after which he came to the United  Kingdom  to
         be reunited with her mother and father and siblings whom she stayed
         with until November 2014 when she had to leave.  It  was  submitted
         that following a chaotic period in the first appellant's  life  she
         was rehoused in Manchester and that the Judge erred in not  looking
         at family life in this  context  and  the  relationship  the  first
         appellant has with her three  siblings  two  of  whom  are  British
         citizens. It is argued that this was omitted from  the  section  55
         assessment.

     12. In relation to private life it is argued the Judge failed to assess
         the merits of this by reference to  the  historic  background,  the
         fact  the  appellant  has  no  family  in  Nigeria,  and  that  the
         submission regarding assistance from the VRS was not  available  to
         the Judge.

     13. Mr Brown also submitted the Judge was required to consider siblings
         the  siblings  best  interests  as  the  appellant  had   spent   a
         considerable time with them since arrival, yet in the Judge  failed
         to do so. It argued the relationship between the siblings  and  the
         first appellant was not properly  considered  and  that  the  first
         appellant controlled some of their development  by  indirect  means
         which should have been factored into the equation  in  addition  to
         the cultural issues.

     14. The grounds  further  assert  the  Judge's  finding  there  was  no
         evidence placed before the  Tribunal  to  suggest  the  appellant's
         father will be unable to contact his Nigerian siblings and  arrange
         for them to assist is said to be unsafe as there  was  no  evidence
         that the father would do such a thing. The appellant's evidence was
         that her father had lost contact with relatives in Nigeria.

     15. The ground asserts the Judge ignored the geographical proximity  of
         an opportunity to have physical contact with the relatives  in  the
         UK when finding there was no  significant  difference  between  the
         family life between the appellant and family in the UK  as  opposed
         to that if she was removed to Nigeria.

     16. The ground asserts the appellant's case is that as a single  mother
         she would, like other vulnerable women in Nigeria, be vulnerable to
         violence and have difficulties accessing  work  and  would  end  up
         destitute.  The  ground  asserts  the   Judge   ignored   important
         background  material  relating  to  women,  child   abuse,   sexual
         exploitation of children, gender-based violence  and  human  rights
         violations relating to the threat and scale of trafficking  in  the
         appellant's bundle leading to  the  assertion  the  Judge  had  not
         adequately  assessed  the  background  material  before  her   when
         assessing the level of  the  appellant's  vulnerability  on  return
         given her gender, age, lack of experience and being a single mother
         with an infant child to take care of.

     17. On behalf the respondent Mr McVeety submitted  that  the  appellant
         was over the age of 18 and that Judge had considered the historical
         context and found that following the  family  being  separated  and
         moving apart in 2014 there had  only  been  telephone  contact  and
         limited direct contact. It  is  argued  this  did  not  demonstrate
         before the Judge a close relationship and there was no evidence  of
         dependency to show the respondent's decision is disproportionate.

     18. Mr McVeety accepted the appellants financial reality and  that  she
         would be unable to fund the cost  of  frequent  trips  to  see  her
         family in the south, but it was not made out that other members  of
         the family could not have visited her more frequently.

     19. It was submitted the letter from the siblings says  they  love  the
         first appellant but little more and nothing relevant to the section
         55 point and nothing to warrant a finding in the appellant's favour
         on this issue.

     20. Mr McVeety accepted that the suggestion the family might have �4000
         was incorrect as the maximum sum is �2000.  It was  submitted  that
         this did not enhance the right the appellant's claimed  as  it  was
         open for her to return to Nigeria voluntarily when she  would  have
         been able to  make  an  application  for  such  funds.  Mr  McVeety
         submitted that it was  always  open  to  the  appellant  to  return
         voluntarily to Nigeria. It was also submitted  that  even  if  such
         funds are not available  the  appellant  had  previously  lived  in
         Nigeria and it was found family was available to assist out  as  it
         had in the past.

     21. In relation to article 8 ECHR, Mr McVeety submitted the  Judge  had
         recorded that the appellant was homeless in 2014 but had eventually
         been accommodated in the United Kingdom  and  was  therefore  aware
         that she was still being supported in respect of certain aspects of
         her life. It was disputed that the Judge was  saying  that  because
         this happened in the United Kingdom she shall benefit from the same
         in Nigeria.

     22. It was submitted there was no evidence to support a conclusion that
         there would not be at family help available to  the  appellants  in
         Nigeria. Her son is not a qualifying children pursuant to paragraph
         276 ADE.

     23. It was submitted adequate  reasons  were  given  and  it  was  also
         accepted that if the appellant had lived in the same house  as  the
         family members it may warrant a different conclusion, but this  was
         not the situation presented to the Judge on the facts.



Error of law

     24. I do not find it made out that the Judge did not properly take into
         account any aspect of the evidence. Even accepting that  the  Judge
         erred in  finding  the  appellant  will  be  in  receipt  of  �4000
         assistance grant under the terms of the VRS, as the first appellant
         had not agreed to return voluntarily, no  arguable  material  legal
         error is established.

     25. So far as the siblings are concerned, the evidence available to the
         Judge is found in the  respondent's  bundle  at  page  37  and  the
         appellant's bundle at page 6 in relation to [P] and at page  32  of
         the respondent's bundle in relation to [I].

     26. Within the papers are letters written by  both  [I]  and  [P].  The
         letter written by [I] is undated and reads:

             "To whom it may concern. Sister is my good friend she has been
             their for since I was young. She  was  always  their  for  me.
             She's my 2nd mom. Every time we were together we would  always
             have a laugh and have a great time. I love it when I am around
             her because I feel safe, comfortable, and watched  over.  Most
             of the time even when it's  not  a  special  time  or  special
             occasion, she loves to take us out  like  creams,  McDonald's,
             KFC or fancy restaurant. I am grateful that I have her  as  my
             sister. And don't think I could get a better sister than  her.
             Anytime  I  need  help  with  writing  something  or   reading
             something she would always help me. Any time my  parents  were
             busy and I needed help with my homework she would always  have
             time for me and she makes sure I get  it  right.  She  is  the
             best! I would really appreciate it if there's any way you  can
             help my sister [A] to obtain  her  freedom  in  this  country.
             Yours sincerely [IO]".

     27. Letter from [P] is dated 22 February 2019 and reads:

             "To whom it may concern,

             My sister is the best this neat writing I am  writing  now  is
             what she taught me. Since I was a young toddler she taught  me
             to do good things and when I was bored or not happy she  would
             cheer me up. I also feel safe and comfortable around her.  She
             always plays with me of course my parents would  do  this  for
             me. My sister was my second  mum  and  also  one  of  my  best
             friend. She is cool and popular.  I am now 11 years of age and
             I am a mini version of her. She loves fashion and I do too, of
             course I would get told at some time for doing the wrong thing
             but at the end of the day it's for my own future and  benefit.
             I love her so much she buys me everything. She such  a  lovely
             person. When my parents are busy on  holidays  she  will  look
             after me and be the one to take us out and watch over us.  She
             has time for me and likes me to achieve and for me to be  like
             her. She's a good person people know her as a good person ever
             since I was growing up she has looked after me and has been  a
             star people also love her because of her personality.  I  have
             now grown up and everyone compares me to her I love  her  lots
             and she always claps my hair. I don't  think  I  could  get  a
             better sister than her I am so grateful, I love her.

             I'll be very happy and grateful if you can do anything to help
             her obtain her stay in this country. May  God  bless  you  and
             your family.

             Yours sincerely

             [PO]

     28. A representatives letter of 17 April 2019 referred to the  presence
         of  siblings  in  the  United  Kingdom  and,  after  outlining  the
         appellant's immigration history, contains the following "in essence
         our clients application is based on 2 issues.  It is based  on  her
         inability to live in Nigeria as a lone  woman  with  a  very  young
         child, our assertion being that this is not in the  best  interests
         of the 2nd applicant. It is also based on the best interests of her
         siblings, 2 of whom are British." The letter  further  repeats  the
         appellant has a close connection with her siblings  and  refers  to
         the decision in Beoku-Betts which found that the article  8  rights
         of all family members affected by a decision have to be taken  into
         account and asserts that it is not in the  best  interests  of  the
         siblings that the appellant be removed from the United Kingdom.

     29. The first appellant's  claim  claims  regarding  her  siblings  was
         considered in the Reasons for  Refusal  letter  but  not  found  to
         warrant a grant of leave on this basis. The decision-maker writes:

             "Consideration  was  given  to  your  relationship  with  your
             siblings [I], [P] and [PR] who are British  citizens.  It  was
             presented to you are providing them with help  and  advice  on
             their issues. However, you do not have parental responsibility
             for them, since they reside in the UK with  your  (and  their)
             mother. It is therefore noted that if  you  were  to  have  to
             leave the UK, they could continue to reside here. The  refusal
             of your application does not separate any children from  their
             biological parents, and does not  obligate  your  siblings  to
             leave the UK.

             It  has  also   been   considered   whether   the   particular
             circumstances  constitute  exceptional  circumstances   which,
             consistent with the right to respect for  private  and  family
             life contained in Article 8 the European Convention  on  Human
             Rights, might warrant consideration by the Secretary of  State
             of a grant of leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  outside
             the requirements of the Immigration Rules. We have also  taken
             into account the need to safeguard and promote the welfare  of
             children in the United Kingdom in accordance with  our  duties
             under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
             Act 2009.

             It is generally  the  case  that  it  is  in  a  child's  best
             interests to remain with their parents. Unless special factors
             applied, it will generally be reasonable to expect a child  to
             leave the UK with their parents, particularly if  the  parents
             have no right to remain in the UK.

     30. In Afzal v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2012]  EWHC
         1487 (Admin) Mr Justice Wyn Williams said ordinarily, the child  or
         children whose welfare was to be considered under section 55  would
         have a family connection to the person who was the subject  of  the
         decision in question; in this  case  the  children  had  no  family
         relationship with the Claimant. It was to be noted,  however,  that
         the words of section 55 were extremely wide and required  the  SSHD
         to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare  of
         the children taught by the Claimant when making her decision  about
         whether he ought to be granted leave to remain. To  hold  otherwise
         would be to restrict the ambit of section 55 in a manner not easily
         consistent with the words of the section.

     31. As asserted by the appellant, the Judge was  required  to  consider
         the best interests of the appellant's  siblings  as  children  with
         whom  the  first  appellant  has  a  family  connection  and  whose
         relationship will be affected if the first appellant's removed.

     32. The failure of the Judge do so may amount to legal error but  I  do
         not find it established it is material to the decision  to  dismiss
         the  appeal  in  this  case  as  the  appellant  failed  to  adduce
         sufficient evidence to establish that the  best  interests  of  the
         siblings meant the effect of the  appellant's  removal  upon  those
         children would make the decision disproportionate  or  contrary  to
         section 55.  It was particularly not made out the  first  appellant
         could not maintain indirect contact with her siblings or  that  the
         siblings would lose the secure environment  they  have  with  their
         parents in the United Kingdom if the appellant were removed. It  is
         noted the letters from the first appellant's siblings and  her  own
         mother contain an address in Waltham Cross  whereas  the  appellant
         lives at an address in Salford near Manchester,  approximately  200
         miles away.

     33. The specific paragraphs of the  Judge's  findings  referred  to  in
         Ground 2 are (xi), (xii) and  (xv)  which  form  three  of  the  34
         subparagraphs of [8] of the decision under challenge.  In  those  3
         subparagraphs the Judge writes:

             (xi)     The appellants both  have  Nigerian  nationality  and
                   would be able to enjoy the benefits of their  nationality
                   in Nigeria. Although the first appellant advised she  has
                   no home to return to in Nigeria, I note she and  her  son
                   are both homeless in the UK. There was no evidence placed
                   before me to indicate the first appellant would be unable
                   to use the Internet in the  UK  to  search  for  suitable
                   accommodation for herself and her son in Nigeria prior to
                   her departure to Nigeria.

             ...

             (xii)    I note that the first appellant's mother came to  the
                   UK and left her in the  care  of  her  great-grandmother.
                   When her great-grandmother died, the first appellant went
                   to stay with her paternal uncle until her passage to  the
                   UK was arranged. I find this establishes that  the  first
                   appellant's family in Nigeria have  an  interest  in  her
                   welfare. The first appellant advises that though she does
                   have a number of family members living in Nigeria, she is
                   not in contact with them. She advises her  father  is  in
                   contact with his brother in the UK and with  his  brother
                   in the USA. With his siblings in Nigeria. I did not  find
                   it credible  that  the  appellant's  father  would  cease
                   contact with his Nigerian siblings  and  their  families.
                   There was no evidence placed before  me  to  suggest  the
                   appellant's  father,  would  be  unable  to  contact  his
                   Nigerian siblings and arrange  for  them  to  assist  the
                   first  appellant  to  find  suitable  accommodation   for
                   herself  and  her  son  in  Nigeria.  I  find  the  first
                   appellant will be able to  search  for  accommodation  in
                   Nigeria.

             ...

             (xv)     The appellants could apply to  the  Home  Office  for
                   financial help of up to �2000 each which could be used to
                   pay for  accommodation  whilst  the  first  appellant  is
                   looking for employment, or to enable her to  set  up  her
                   own business in Nigeria. I accept the first appellant  is
                   not highly educated, but note she has a qualification  in
                   childcare which suggests she may be  able  to  set  up  a
                   business in Nigeria as a childminder.  I  note  that  the
                   first appellant has lived in the UK since  2007  and  was
                   wholly supported by friends  and  family  until  she  was
                   provided with interim financial support and accommodation
                   in December 2018. This shows the first  appellant  has  a
                   significant degree of fortitude and is able to survive in
                   a country where even she has no official support  and  no
                   right to work. The first appellant's mother continues  to
                   provide her and her son with money and groceries and  her
                   mother advised that the appellant's friends in Manchester
                   also continued to support her. I find that her family and
                   friends will be able to transfer the support they provide
                   to her in the UK to Nigeria  until  the  first  appellant
                   obtains work or sets up a business in Nigeria.

     34. The appellant also asserts the Judge  failed  to  consider  country
         information relied upon, but it is clear from reading the  decision
         as a whole that the Judge did take this evidence into  account.  At
         subparagraphs (xvii) and (xviii) the Judge writes:

             (xvii)   The appellant's representative referred me to page 35
                   of the appellant's bundle which is the section  on  women
                   in the USSD report of March 2019. This makes reference to
                   rape, domestic violence and female genital mutilation. It
                   advises  the  victims  and  survivors  of  violence   are
                   entitled to comprehensive medical, psychological,  social
                   and legal assistance by accredited service providers  and
                   government agencies.  The  prison  sentence  for  persons
                   convicted of rape is up to 14 years, and  the  identities
                   of rape victims are protected. It was no evidence  before
                   me to suggest there is a reasonable degree of  likelihood
                   the first appellant will be subjected to rape or domestic
                   violence, FGM, or that the Nigerian authorities  will  be
                   unable or unwilling to protect her should she fall victim
                   to violence in Nigeria.

             (xviii)  I was directed to pages 57 - 59  of  the  appellant's
                   bundle which made reference to trafficking of  women  and
                   girls. There was no evidence placed before me to indicate
                   the first appellant, as a mother, would be  targeted  for
                   trafficking. I noted this appellant has not sought asylum
                   in the UK either because she  believes  she  would  be  a
                   victim of violence or rape, or  trafficking.  I  did  not
                   find the background evidence  cited  by  the  appellant's
                   representative established that there  was  a  reasonable
                   degree of likelihood this appellant would  face  domestic
                   violence, rape, female genital mutilation or be  at  risk
                   of being  targeted  for  trafficking  on  her  return  to
                   Nigeria. I note the first appellant has not considered it
                   necessary or appropriate to apply for asylum  in  the  UK
                   over the last 10 years, and that she has had considerable
                   interaction  with   the   respondent   in   relation   to
                   applications for leave to remain in the  UK.  I  consider
                   that if the first appellant considered herself to  be  at
                   risk if returned to Nigeria, she would have  applied  for
                   asylum.

     35. At paragraph (xx) the Judge finds it had not been established there
         are any exceptional circumstances  preventing  the  appellant  from
         being  returned  to  Nigeria.   It  was  not  found  she  met   the
         requirements of paragraph GEN.3 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
         Rules.

     36. In AI (Nigeria) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 707 the Tribunal found  that
         levels of discrimination against women in Nigeria could not on  the
         evidence before the Adjudicator amount to persecution.   The  Court
         of Appeal agreed that there was no evidence on which a finding of a
         well-founded   fear   of   persecution,   as   opposed   to    mere
         discrimination, could be made.

     37. In relation to domestic violence, in R (on  the  application  of  M
         Umar) v SSHD 2008 EWHC 2385 (Admin)  Patterson  QC  said  that  the
         objective evidence suggested that there might be some  codification
         and acceptance of violence by men to their wives in  Nigeria,  with
         consequent police inaction.  However, there was  no  evidence  that
         this extended to violence by the wider family.   Accordingly  there
         was a  sufficiency  of  protection  against  such  an  incident  in
         Nigeria.  The claim that the police would  not  act  had  not  been
         tested because the claimant had not reported the  violence.   Given
         the size of Nigeria, the fact  that  people  did  move  within  the
         country and the lack  of  evidence  that  the  appellant  would  be
         pursued, internal flight was an option for the appellant.

     38. The Judge finds the appellant will have  access  to  family  and  a
         support network in  Nigeria  and  the  claim  to  the  contrary  is
         disagreement with this position no more.

     39. The Judge was aware of the first appellants procedural history  and
         the reasons why she could no longer live with her  family  in  2014
         and how attempt by the first appellant  to  live  with  her  family
         before she was rehoused in  Manchester  proved  unsuccessful  as  a
         result of action being taken by the local authority as she was,  at
         that time, over the age of 18. There does not appear to  have  been
         any successful challenge to the decision of the local authority  on
         the basis their actions were a disproportionate  interference  with
         an article 8 right by  their  insistent  the  appellant  could  not
         remain with the family unit.

     40.  It  is  not  disputed  the  appellant  was  assisted  in   finding
         accommodation in Manchester where she lives  with  us  her  son.  I
         accept that family life exists between the first appellant and this
         child and that the best interests of the child are, as found by the
         Judge, to be brought up by its mother, the first appellant.

     41. The Judge did not find family life recognised by article 8  existed
         between the first appellant and her  siblings  for  which  adequate
         reasons are given. The letters from the siblings do not support  an
         ongoing relationship at the date of the hearing  before  the  Judge
         between the first appellant and the  siblings  or  even  the  first
         appellant and other family members in the United Kingdom sufficient
         to find family life recognised by article 8 exists.  The  necessary
         element of dependency, emotional, financial, or otherwise, was  not
         made out before the Judge.

     42. Even considering the cultural context of family life which, if  the
         first appellant remained in the family home,  would  have  possibly
         involved  having  a  more  direct  hands-on  involvement  with  her
         siblings, this was not the situation prevailing before the Judge.

     43. Whether family life exists is a question of fact. On the  basis  of
         the evidence before the Judge it was not made out that,  whilst  de
         facto family life exists,  the  nature  of  the  relationships  was
         sufficient to support a finding  that  family  life  recognised  by
         article 8 did. Accordingly, no material error arises in  the  Judge
         so finding.

     44. The finding in relation to availability of support  on  return  has
         not been shown to be infected by arguable legal error. Whilst it is
         accepted the first appellant  lived  with  her  grandmother  before
         coming to the UK and considering Mr Brown's submissions that events
         that occurred which led the appellant coming to the United  Kingdom
         does not suggest the appellant  had  the  type  of  family  support
         available then sufficient to look after her, the Judge was required
         to assess the situation  existed  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
         available at the  date  of  the  hearing.  The  Judge  specifically
         rejected the suggestion that the appellant would  not  have  family
         support for the reasons given and that has not been made out to  be
         a finding outside the range of those reasonably open to  the  Judge
         on the evidence.

     45. I do not accept Mr Brown's submission that there was just enough in
         the grounds to such say the Judge had erred in dealing with  family
         life, the siblings, and in finding that support will  be  available
         on return. The Judge considered the evidence adequately  and  makes
         finding  supported  by  adequate  reasons.   Whilst  the  appellant
         disagrees with the same has not been shown the Judge's decision  is
         infected by arguable  legal  error  material  to  the  decision  to
         dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, the decision must stand.

Decision

     46. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
         decision. The determination shall stand.

    Anonymity.

     47. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
         the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

         I make such order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
