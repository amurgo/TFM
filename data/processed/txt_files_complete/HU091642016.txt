Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of Lyes Mouffok, a citizen of Algeria  born  24  July
   1970, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 6 January  2017
   dismissing his appeal, itself brought against the Respondent's  decision
   of 22 February 2016 to refuse his application  made  on  long  residence
   grounds.


2. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent notes the Appellant's
   ongoing claim to have physically entered the UK in 1992 and not to  have
   left the country since then. On 9 January 2012 the  Appellant  submitted
   an application for leave to remain  on  Article  8  grounds,  which  was
   refused without the right of appeal on 24 January 2013. He applied again
   in October 2014 and the application was again  refused  on  17  December
   2014. On 6 January 2016 he made the application leading to  the  present
   proceedings, on the basis he had now lived in the UK for twenty years.


3. The Secretary of State refused the application on the basis that it  was
   not established that the Appellant had truly lived in the  UK  for  more
   than 20 years absent some documentary evidence for every  year.  He  did
   not appear to have any material links in the UK.


4. Before the First-tier Tribunal it was argued that the Appellant had  put
   forward sufficient evidence, taking a sensible  approach,  to  establish
   two decades of UK residence. He had originally worked with a  French  ID
   card in the name Charad Nouredine, at  Carrington  of  Peugeot  for  six
   years as a car cleaner, and with agencies such as Blue Arrow thereafter.
   From 2002 the Appellant had worked in his own name.


5. Supporting evidence was put forward from a number of sources,  including
   live witnesses L K, T Z and A R, and letters from others including  R  J
   and M D; a set of bank statements from 2005-2016,  and  pay  slips  from
   2004, including ones that tallied with entries in those bank  statements
   from the company Accident  Repair;  and  interview  records  and  minute
   sheets from the Home Office's first encounter with the Appellant in  May
   2011.


6.  One  strand  of  supporting  evidence  comprises  a  letter  from   the
   Appellant's MP whereby she wrote to the Chief Executive of HMRC  in  May
   2014 requesting  that  HMRC  produce  any  records  they  held  for  the
   Appellant. HMRC wrote to her on 15 July  2014  stating  that  they  held
   records for Lyes Mouffok from 1992/93 at John  Candler  Cars,  and  with
   other employers through to 1994/1995, 1997/1998 to 2000/2001, 2003/2004,
   2007/2008, 2010-2013. A further  letter  from  HMRC  recorded  that  the
   National Insurance number in the name of Nouredine had been created on 2
   July 1992; certain income support and jobseekers allowance  claims  were
   recorded as attached to that reference number for a few months in  1996,
   1999-2000, and during 2010, though clerical records for those claims had
   since been destroyed.


7. The First-tier Tribunal found that


   a. It was not credible that the Appellant would lose his identity
      documents given their importance to him;
   b. The national insurance number was simply issued to a person in a
      particular name and did not necessarily make good the Appellant's
      claim to provide evidence of his own working history: indeed he
      admitted that it had at one time been used by someone else;
   c. It was surprising that the individuals who supported his case had
      kept in touch with the Appellant over long periods, given he had
      first met them long ago and it was inherently unlikely that old
      workmates would stay in touch, rather one would normally socialise
      with one's present co-workers; and it was unlikely that those friends
      who claimed to have known him in London over many years would in
      truth have had the opportunity to maintain social relations given the
      cost and time taken to travel across the capital;
   d. Applying Tanveer Ahmed principles, the concerns as to the Appellant's
      evidence generally undermined such documentary evidence as he had
      provided, for example the pay slips.


8. Overall, concluded the First-tier Tribunal, it  was  probable  that  the
   Appellant had worked in the UK from 1992 to 1998 but that it was equally
   probable that he had gone abroad  subsequently,  before  his  return  in
   around 2005. So  he  might  well  have  lived  in  the  UK  for  a  very
   significant period, but not for long enough to make  good  a  claim  for
   settlement as  of  right  on  long  residence  grounds.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal accepted that the mere fact of unlawful working  or  use  of  a
   false identity should not be held against the  Appellant  as  inevitably
   defeating his claim, applying Aissaoui: however it considered  that  the
   individual  objections  to  his  credibility  that  it  had   identified
   prevented him from establishing the asserted length of residence.


9. Given those findings, his human rights claim also failed. There  was  no
   evidence establishing that the Appellant  would  face  very  significant
   obstacles to integration in Algeria, where he retained family  including
   his mother. As to his private and family life outside the Rules, he  had
   no family here and a parent alive in Algeria,  and  siblings  who  lived
   abroad, possibly in his home country. He did not have strong  ties  here
   given that he had not regularised his status, had depended  on  goodwill
   for his accommodation, and had essentially set out to achieve a  private
   life in London, a metropolis  where  life  would  always  inevitably  be
   beyond his means, given he could never  achieve  financial  independence
   here.


10. Grounds of appeal alleged, in summary, that the wrong approach had  been
   taken to the evidence of the witnesses, that  too  high  a  standard  of
   proof was expected when assessing the evidence generally bearing in mind
   the  Appellant's  lack  of  immigration  status  and   the   concomitant
   disadvantages that would inevitably ensue in corroborating his  account,
   and that  errors  had  been  made  in  assessing  particular  documents,
   particularly  the  pay  slips,  bank  statements   and   HMRC   records;
   furthermore the Appellant's original interview records and minute sheets
   had been  overlooked  entirely.  The  errors  regarding  his  length  of
   residence inevitably impacted on the  assessment  of  his  private  life
   claim.


11. A Rule 24 response from the Secretary of State contended  that  a  range
   of reasons had been given based on a variety of  factors.  Payslips  and
   the NI number alone could not make good the Appellant's claim.


12. Ms Solanki made submissions in line with  her  grounds.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal had erred in law in making findings that  were  too  strict  and
   demanded corroborative evidence at a level that was not realistic, rather
   than taking the evaluative approach  that  the  law  demanded.  Mr  Naith
   defended the decision  below  consistently  with  the  detailed  Rule  24
   response.


13. I should note that Mr Mouffok returned to the  hearing  room  after  the
   conclusion of proceedings to make an impassioned resolution for the  just
   resolution of his appeal, and Ms Solanki requested that I  entertain  his
   unusual plea as she was genuinely concerned as to his mental  health  and
   vulnerability. He explained to me the ongoing distress  he  felt  at  the
   time taken to resolve his case. I sought to explain to him  that  he  was
   being very ably represented by a law centre with expert counsel, each  of
   whom had done all they could to fight his corner.

Findings and reasons


14. The relevant Immigration Rules are those in Rule  276ADE.  I  cite  only
   the relevant passages given that no questions arise of suitability.

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life
         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant: ...
         (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment)"


15. Permission to appeal was granted on all  the  grounds  pleaded.  At  the
   outset, I note that this is a rather troubling appeal, because the First-
   tier Tribunal gave detailed reasons for its conclusions, and appeared  to
   have regard to much of the evidence that  was  before  it  in  so  doing.
   Nevertheless, having regard to the binding authorities, it  seems  to  me
   that there is cause for concern as to whether it  misdirected  itself  in
   the approach it took.


16. In Khan [2016] EWCA Civ 416 the Court  of  Appeal  stated  that  it  was
   wrong to attempt to restrict the forms of evidence that could  satisfy  a
   decision maker as to the length of a person's residence:  it  was  likely
   that  those  lacking  status  would  not  have   access   to   "official"
   documentation. It expressly accepted that non-official but  "independent"
   documents and letters and of letters from neighbours and friends  were  a
   relevant  source  of  corroborative  evidence.   That   decision   is   a
   manifestation  of  the  more  general  principle  of  constitutional  law
   identified in Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 �28:


      "A policy is precisely not a rule: it is required by law to be applied
      without rigidity, and to be used  and  adapted  in  the  interests  of
      fairness and good sense."


17. In ZH (Bangladesh) [2009] EWCA Civ 8 �16  the  Court  of  Appeal  warned
   that the admitted use of a false identity should not be  held  against  a
   migrant asserting long residence without taking  account  of  the  reason
   given for so doing: and in this regard, fear of detection as  an  illegal
   immigrant would need to be recognised as being less serious than  a  more
   sinister motive for using a false identity, such  as  to  commit  frauds.
   Aissaoui [2008] EWCA Civ 37 also  establishes  that  lengthy  periods  of
   illegal working need not defeat such a claim, even where a false identity
   has been used. Both these decisions are focussed more on  the  assessment
   of the good character of a long resident migrant than  they  are  on  the
   different question  of  the  establishment  of  the  credibility  of  the
   residence in question. Nevertheless, they are wholly consistent with  the
   subsequent decision of Khan in demonstrating the  need  for  a  realistic
   approach to be taken to the assessment of such cases.


18. The long residence and private life routes set out  in  Part  7  of  the
   Rules are to be contrasted with those outlined in Part 6A which addresses
   Points Based System applications: the latter make clear provision  for  a
   procedure under which only "specified documents" may be  put  forward  as
   satisfying their requirements. Accordingly, Part 7 applications  such  as
   that giving rise  to  the  instant  appeal  should  not  be  assessed  by
   unrealistically high expectations.


19. The  First-tier  Tribunal  criticised  the  witnesses  on  a  number  of
   occasions: for the "stream of consciousness" quality of  their  evidence,
   from not having "corroborated their meetings  from  diary  entries",  and
   observes that the Appellant had generally advanced "claims that have been
   made from non-official sources only" via "patchy" evidence. The Appellant
   is also criticised for not putting forward evidence from other  potential
   corroborative sources, such as landlords.


20. These  expectations  are,  to  my  mind,  quite  inconsistent  with  the
   enjoinder in Khan to take a pragmatic approach to the  evidence  that  is
   actually available, rather than criticising an Appellant for  failing  to
   put forward material from "official" sources. This in turn may well  have
   contributed to the more surprising conclusions reached below  as  to  the
   plausibility of certain relationships: it is difficult to be confident in
   the logic of reasoning predicated on the  difficulties  faced  by  people
   from different parts of London socialising with  one  another,  and  upon
   assumptions  that  a  migrant  would  maintain  relationships  only  with
   present, not past, co-workers. Both findings are unduly speculative.


21. Furthermore, there is a general self-direction is made at the outset  of
   the decision, that "I do not accept that he can have 'blank years' at any
   date in the last 20 years and yet succeed under the Rules." As the  Rules
   contain no such restriction,  it  can  only  arise  from  the  First-tier
   Tribunal's view of the underlying Guidance.  Yet the absolutist  approach
   stated as appropriate by the First-tier Tribunal runs flatly  counter  to
   the requirement for a flexible appreciation of policy which is a critical
   feature of the appellate function.


22. I accordingly conclude that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  and
   accordingly its decision is unsafe. As  the  length  of  the  Appellant's
   residence is the central issue in  the  appeal,  regarding  human  rights
   considerations both inside and outside the  Rules,  the  matter  must  be
   reheard afresh.


Note on future listing before First-tier Tribunal

    It is not appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to  make  directions  that
    seek to bind the First-tier Tribunal. However I would draw attention to
    the administration of the First-tier Tribunal the self-evident distress
    exhibited  at  the  hearing  before  me  by  the   Appellant.   Serious
    consideration should be given to the appeal being listed at  the  first
    available date.


  Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of
    law.
    The appeal is allowed to the extent it is remitted for  hearing  afresh
    before the First-tier Tribunal.
