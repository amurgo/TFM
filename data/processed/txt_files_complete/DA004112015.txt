               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:     Mr. S Staunton, HOPO

                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Latvia, born on 2 July 1971.  On 21
    September 2015 the respondent decided to make a deportation order
    against him by virtue of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. His
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clemes and dismissed.

2.   I find that the judge's determination of the appeal in the absence of
    the appellant at the hearing on 25 September 2015 was procedurally
    unfair.  It was patently obvious to me that the appellant barely spoke
    English.  He said he requested a Russian interpreter in his application
    for bail but none was provided at the bail hearing on 16 September
    2015.  Consequently, he would not have understood much of what was said
    at the bail hearing.  Furthermore, he did not receive the Notice of
    Hearing which had been sent to him at the detention centre on 11
    September 2015, prior to the bail hearing.  He was not served with a
    further Notice of Hearing at his bail address.

3.   For these reasons the judge's decision is set aside and the
    appellant's appeal has to be re-heard.

4.   The appeal is remitted to Hatton Cross for re-hearing by a First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than FtTJ Clemes.
