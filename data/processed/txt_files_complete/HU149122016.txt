Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms O Ukachi-Lois (Counsel) instructed by Charles
                    Allotey, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.



2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Raymond promulgated on 27  July  2017,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal.


Background


3. The Appellant was born on 27/03/199 and  is  a  national  of  Uganda.  On
09/05/2016 the Secretary of State refused the  Appellant's  application  for
leave to enter the UK (to join  his  mother)  under  paragraph  297  of  the
rules.



The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Raymond ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

5. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 31/10/2017 permission to appeal  was
granted in the following terms

      1.    The Appellant seeks permission to appeal, (in time),  against  a
      Decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Raymond) who, in a Decision
      and Reasons promulgated on 27 July 2017, dismissed his appeal  against
      the Entry Clearance Officer's decision to refuse his  application  for
      entry clearance under paragraph 297 of the immigration rules.


      2.    The grounds assert that the Judge crated  procedural  unfairness
      by focusing on matters which were not in dispute, and making  findings
      based on matters which were not put to the  appellant;  and  that  the
      Judge failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  findings  on  material
      matters.


      3.    There is arguably a  tension  between  [30]  and  [102]  of  the
      decision.  In YHY (China) AP Petition for JR [2014]  CSOH  11  it  was
      held that there was procedural unfairness amounting to an error of law
      where points were taken against the appellant that  were  not  in  the
      original decision and notice of the additional  points  had  not  been
      given to the appellant.  In AM (fair hearing) Sudan [2015] UKUT  00656
      (IAC) it was held that fairness may require a Tribunal  to  canvas  an
      issue  which  has  not  been  ventilated  by  the  parties  or   their
      representatives, in  fulfilment  of  each  party's  right  to  a  fair
      hearing.


      4.    The grounds of appeal are  arguable.  Permission  to  appeal  is
      granted.


The Hearing

6. (a) For the appellant, Ms Ukachi-Lois, moved the grounds of  appeal.  She
took me to [102] of the decision and told me that, there,  the  Judge  deals
with a matter which is not raised by the respondent and not the  subject  of
challenge. At [102] the Judge finds that the sponsor has lied about  a  rape
which resulted in the conception of the appellant. She told me that  is  not
a matter which was before the Judge; it was not part of the  subject  matter
of  the  hearing,  and  the  sponsor  had  not  been  questioned  about  the
circumstances of the appellant's conception. As a result (she told  me)  the
sponsor had been treated unfairly and the appellant had been denied  a  fair
hearing.

(b)  Ms  Ukachi-Lois  referred  me  to  a  separate  earlier   determination
reproduced from page 111 of the appellant's bundle, in which another  First-
tier Judge found

      The appellant is a product  of  rape.  Ms  Mutesi  was  raped  by  two
      individuals when she was 16 years old.  She  does  not  know  who  the
      appellant's father is. Ms Butt did not challenge Ms Mutesi's claim.

(c) Turning to the second ground of appeal, Ms Ukachi-Lois took me  to  [81]
of the decision,  where  the  Judge  quotes  from  an  Internet  website  to
calculate the annual average income in Uganda. She told me that  it  is  not
clear whether the currency quoted by the Judge is euros, but the  comparison
is given in pounds sterling. Ms Ukachi-Lois told me that the  Internet  site
appears to compare Ugandan dollars with US dollars. She  told  me  that  the
use of different currencies just creates confusion,  and  as  a  result  the
Judge has failed to give adequate reasons for a material finding.

(d) Ms Ukachi-Lois asked  me  to  find  that  the  decision  is  tainted  by
material errors of law and set it aside.

7. (a) For the respondent, Ms Isherwood told me that the decision  does  not
contain errors of law, material or otherwise. She told me that  the  limited
nature of the challenge results in the majority  of  the  detailed  findings
set out between [70] and [109] going without challenge.  She  told  me  that
what is contained at [81] cannot amount to a material error of law  because,
between [82] and [87] the Judge sets out a  detailed  consideration  of  the
financial evidence produced. She reminded me that the application  was  made
under  paragraph  297  of  the  immigration  rules  and  told  me  that  the
determinative  question  was  whether  or   not   the   sponsor   has   sole
responsibility for the appellant.

(b) Ms Isherwood told me that between [72] and [98] the Judge considers  the
evidence of the sponsor's financial position, the financial position of  her
sister in Uganda, & the arrangements for  the  appellant's  welfare,  before
reaching a conclusion a [99]. She said that it has never been the case  that
the sponsor has had sole responsibility for the appellant. She told me  that
the Judge then goes on to consider whether there are serious and  compelling
family or other considerations which would make  the  appellant's  exclusion
undesirable and finds that there are no such reasons.

(c) Ms Isherwood told me that the correct legal test has been applied,  that
the Judge has considered the  evidence  fully  before  reaching  conclusions
which were well within the range of reasonable conclusions available to  the
Judge. She urged me to dismiss the appeal and allow the decision to stand.


Analysis

8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that there  was  a  tension
between [30] &  [102]  of  the  decision.  At  [102]  the  Judge  needlessly
expresses doubt that the sponsor was raped when she was 16  years  old,  but
the Judge does not make a finding that the sponsor was not raped.  What  the
judge considers at [102] is whether or not the conception of  the  appellant
as a result of rape when  the  sponsor  was  16  years  old  can  constitute
serious and compelling family or other considerations which would  make  the
appellant's exclusion undesirable. At [30] of  the  decision  the  Judge  is
simply setting out the background and  rehearsing  the  evidence  which  was
before him. [30] does not contain a finding of fact.

9. The finding a [102] is simply that there are no  serious  and  compelling
family  or   other   considerations   making   the   appellant's   exclusion
undesirable. That finding is reached as a result of  the  findings  of  fact
between [72] and [101]. It is not a finding which is reached because  of  an
expression of doubt contained in a sub-clause within the first  sentence  of
[102].

10. At [1] of the decision that the  Judge  correctly  identifies  that  the
application was made under paragraph 297 of the immigration rules, and  that
the appellant's rights of appeal are limited to article 8  ECHR  grounds  of
appeal. Between [4] and [13]  of  the  decision  the  Judge  deals  with  an
earlier unsuccessful application and the uncertainty surrounding the  appeal
procedure following that application.

11. Between [14] and [31] the Judge deals with the application form and  the
financial  evidence.  Between  [32]  and  [45]  the  Judge  summarises   the
respondent's  reasons  for  refusal.  Between  [46]  and  [67]   the   Judge
summarises the evidence placed before the First-tier Tribunal.

12. The Judge's findings of fact start at [70]. At [99]  the  Judge  reaches
the conclusion that the sponsor has never had sole  responsibility  for  the
appellant. After finding that  there  are  neither  serious  and  compelling
family  or   other   considerations   making   the   appellant's   exclusion
undesirable, the Judge takes correct guidance in law when  he  considers  TD
(paragraph 297(i)(e) the sole responsibility) Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049.

13. At [109]  the  Judge  takes  the  comprehensive  findings  made  in  the
decision and uses those findings to answer the five  questions  set  out  in
Razgar. He finds that although the decision is an interference  with  family
life,  the  decision  is  not  a  disproportionate  interference  with   the
appellant's article 8 rights.

14. At [81] there is confusion about the currencies used  to  calculate  the
average annual income in Uganda, but the Judge makes a  clear  finding  that
the appellant's aunt (the sponsor's sister in Uganda) has enjoyed an  income
which is roughly 4 times the average income in Uganda. That is a  clear  and
unambiguous finding. The difference between in the symbols used  for  euros,
pounds and dollars does not undermine that finding.

15. The grounds of appeal challenge  three  paragraphs  in  the  decision  -
[30], [81], and [102]. The challenges are on the symbol used  for  Euro,  on
the mistaken belief that [30] is a finding of fact when it is  not,  and  on
19 unnecessary words in  [102]  ("if  this  indeed  occurred,  as  the  many
obscure  and  invasive  features  in  the  evidence  must  place   this   in
doubt....."). If [30], [81] and 19 words from [102]  are  removed  from  the
decision, the decision still makes sense.

16. There is no error of law in the decision, but even if  the  small  parts
of this decision challenged by the grounds of appeal amount to an  error  of
law, they cannot be a material error of law because if [30],  [81]  and  all
of [102] was removed from  the  decision  the  decision  would  still  makes
sense.

17.    In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)
the Tribunal held that the Upper Tribunal would not  normally  set  aside  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection  of
law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and the relevant  Country
Guidance has been taken into  account,  unless  the  conclusions  the  Judge
draws from the primary data were not reasonably open to him or her.

18. In this case, there  is  no  misdirection  in  law  &  the  fact-finding
exercise is beyond criticism.  The decision is not  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. The Judge's decision, when read as a whole, sets out  findings
that are sustainable and sufficiently detailed.



CONCLUSION

19. No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.



DECISION

20. The appeal  is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
stands.
