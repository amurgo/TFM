Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Gibbs promulgated on 2nd March 2017  in  which  she
    allowed the Appellant's appeal on  human  rights  grounds  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  entry  clearance  to
    the Appellant to the UK as a spouse of a British citizen.   Before  the
    Upper Tribunal the Secretary  of  State  has  been  represented  by  Mr
    Melvin, the Senior Home Office Presenting Officer and the claimant  has
    been represented by Ms Allen of Counsel.

 2. Within the Grounds of Appeal, there  are  effectively  two  Grounds  of
    Appeal. The first Ground of Appeal seeks to argue that  the  judge  has
    made findings that were inconsistent with the Court of Appeal  case  of
    Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    803 in which it was stated  that  her  ability  to  speak  English  and
    financial independence were at best neutral factors for the purposes of
    section 117B of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,
    although obviously they could be negative factors if the person was not
    financially dependent or could not speak English.

 3. However, when one looks at the judge's findings of facts in  the  first
    Ground of Appeal at paragraph 27, she states:

         "In assessing the proportionality of the decision I  have  applied,
         as required, s.117 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
         2002 (as amended).  Although the Appellant cannot gain  a  positive
         benefit  from  the  attributes  of  speaking  English   and   being
         financially independent, equally these factors do not weigh against
         her."

 4. Although it is sought to be argued within the Grounds of Appeal  by  Mr
    Melvin the fact that the judge has taken  those  as  positive  factors.
    However, looking at the clear wording of paragraph 27 of the  judgment,
    the judge has properly indicated that these are neutral factors and the
    judge states specifically the Appellant cannot gain a positive  benefit
    from speaking English  and  from  being  financially  independent,  but
    equally took account of the fact  that  those  factors  did  not  weigh
    against him in the  circumstances  of  this  case.   That  is  a  clear
    indication for judges did properly consider them to be neutral factors.
    There was therefore clearly no material error on the part of the  judge
    in that regard.

 5. In the second Ground of Appeal it is argued that the judge  has  failed
    to properly apply the ratio of the Supreme Court decision in  the  case
    of MM (Lebanon) & Others, R (on the  application  of)  v  Secretary  of
    State and Another [2017] UKSC 10. It is argued that  weight  should  be
    given to the Secretary of State's Policies and Rules  when  considering
    the case outside of them and a fair  balance  should  be  struck.   The
    meaning of "exceptional circumstances" was, it is submitted, made clear
    in that the Appellant needed to demonstrate if there are  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences as a result of refusal.  It is  asserted  that  that
    has been ignored by the Immigration Judge and a fair  balance  has  not
    been struck and the judge has not identified  any  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences as a result of the decision made by the Respondent.

 6. It is further argued by Mr Melvin on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
    that it is trite law that there needs to be exceptional  or  compelling
    circumstances for the case to be allowed  outside  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, the judge, it is argued has not set out  what  those  compelling
    circumstances or exceptional circumstances are.  Mr  Melvin  argued  it
    has not shown that a fair balance has been struck.

 7. Ms Allen on behalf of the Appellant argues that the judge has  properly
    considered the proportionality  issue  and  properly  carried  out  the
    proportionality exercise.  The judge identified the five stage test set
    out in the case of Razgar and at paragraph 24 the judge identified  the
    public interest considerations. It  is  argued  that  the  judge  noted
    specifically that it is an important factor that  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules were not met at paragraph 22 of the decision. She
    says that the judge has properly then gone on to consider  the  Supreme
    Court decision in the case of MM.  She argues in paragraph 25 that  the
    judge  had  found  there  was  no  public  interest  in  refusing   the
    application on Article 8  grounds  and  she  asked  me  to  uphold  the
    determination.  She refers me specifically to the paragraphs within  MM
    dealing with the factors that the  judges  would  be  looking  at  when
    considering proportionality.

 8. In that regard, the judge found on the  balance  of  probabilities  the
    Appellant and Mr Abegha were in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    at paragraph 18 and went on at paragraph 20 to find that as at the date
    of decision  the  Appellant  did  meet  the  language  requirements  of
    paragraph E-ECP.4.1 of Appendix FM, despite the decision  made  to  the
    contrary within the Grounds of Appeal.

 9. The judge at paragraph 19, when  considering  the  appeal  through  the
    prism of the Immigration Rules accepting that one payslip  was  missing
    and the contents of the employer's letter was not  in  accordance  with
    Appendix FM-SE, paragraph 2(b) and while the letter had been re-written
    that document postdated the decision and the payslip remained  missing.
    The judge went on to find at paragraph 19 that therefore, although  she
    was satisfied as at the date of hearing Mr Abegha earned �24,047.14  in
    the tax year ending 2016, and �23,615.23 in the tax  year  ending  2015
    she could not find that the Appellant met the requirements of  Appendix
    FM E-ECP.3.1 solely because of  a  failure  to  provide  the  documents
    specified in Appendix FM-SE.

10. The judge at paragraph 22 noted the fact that  the  Appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements  of  the  Rules  was  a  relevant  and  important
    consideration in his Article 8  consideration,  but  she  did  properly
    consider the five stage test set out  within  the  case  in  Razgar  at
    paragraph 22 of her decision.  She went on to  find  that  family  life
    existed for the purpose of Article 8 and would be  interfered  with  by
    the decision under review at paragraph  23  and  when  considering  the
    proportionality test at this stage of the Razgar properly took  account
    of the public interest  in  respect  of  immigration  control  and  the
    economic wellbeing of the country The judge has therefore clearly taken
    account of the public interest requirements in this case.

11. She went on at paragraph 25 to recognise the Appellant did not meet the
    requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,  because  of  the  failure  to
    provide the specified evidence rather than an  inability  to  meet  the
    substantive  requirements.   The  judge  went  on  to   find   in   the
    circumstances the weight to be attached to the Appellant's  failure  to
    meet the Immigration Rules is far  less  than  usual,  particularly  in
    light of the Supreme Court's recent decision of MM & Others v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10 in which she  said  the
    court identified at paragraph 99 that:

         "Operation of the same restrictive approach outside the rules is  a
         different matter, and in our view is much more difficult to justify
         under the HRA because it is  inconsistent  with  the  character  of
         evaluation with article  8  requires...  that  judgment  cannot  be
         properly constrained by a rigid restriction of the rules...".

     Judge Gibbs found that she was satisfied Mr Abegha's  income  surpassed
    the  income  requirement  albeit  there  were   deficiencies   in   the
    documentary evidence submitted to the ECO.  She went on to  find  there
    was no public interest in refusing the Appellant entry clearance to the
    UK  because  of  that  and  practically  satisfied  that  the  required
    financial support would be there.

12. She went on to find that there were no significant factors that weighed
    in the public interest in refusal and taking all matters  into  account
    the decision was disproportionate to  the  legitimate  public  interest
    sought to be achieved in maintaining immigration control and  therefore
    the decision breached the UK's obligations under Section 6 of the Human
    Rights Act 1998.

13. Both legal representatives referred me to what was said within the case
    of MM & Others at paragraph 61 of the Supreme Court judgment to be  the
    ultimate issue as to whether or not a  fair  balance  had  been  struck
    between individual and public interest taking account  of  the  various
    factors identified.  In that regard Ms Allen also then referred  me  to
    paragraph 76 of the judgment in which it was stated that:

         "Similar considerations would apply to  the  Rules  reflecting  the
         Secretary of State's assessment of levels  of  income  required  to
         avoid a burden on public  resources,  informed  as  it  is  by  the
         specialist expertise  of  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee.   By
         contrast, rules as to the quality of evidence necessary to  satisfy
         that test in a particular case are, as the committee  acknowledged,
         matters of practicality rather than principle; and as such  matters
         on which the Tribunal may more readily draw on its  own  experience
         and expertise."

14. The judge when quoting MM (Lebanon) also referred to  paragraph  99  of
    the judgment in which it was stated that:

         "The operation of the same restrictive approach outside  the  Rules
         is a different matter and in our view is  much  more  difficult  to
         justify under the Human Rights  Act.   This  is  not  because  less
         intrusive methods might be devised (as Blake  J  attempted  to  do:
         para 147), but because it is inconsistent  with  the  character  of
         evaluation which article 8 requires. As has been seen,  avoiding  a
         financial burden on the state can be relevant to the  fair  balance
         required by the article.  But  that  judgment  cannot  properly  be
         constrained by a rigid restriction in the rules. Certainly, nothing
         that is said in the instructions to case officers can  prevent  the
         tribunal on appeal from looking at the matter more  broadly.  These
         are not matters of  policy  on  which  special  weight  has  to  be
         accorded to the judgment  of  the  Secretary  of  State.  There  is
         nothing to prevent the tribunal, in the context of the HRA  appeal,
         from judging for itself the reliability of any alternative  sources
         of finance in the light of the evidence before it. In doing so,  it
         will  no  doubt  take  account  of  such  considerations  as  those
         discussed by Lord Brown and  Lord  Kerr  in  Mahad,  including  the
         difficulties of proof highlighted in the quotation from Mr  Justice
         Collins. That being the position before the tribunal, it would make
         little sense for decision-makers at the earlier stages to be forced
         to take a narrower approach which they might be unable to defend on
         appeal."

15. Although it is sought to be argued by Mr Melvin that there do  have  to
    be compelling circumstances or  exceptional  circumstances  leading  to
    undue harshness to the Appellant before the appeal can be argued  under
    Article 8 grounds, the submission he sought to make in  terms  of  that
    being an intermediate step before the Tribunal could go on to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Rules is an approach which  has  been  previously
    roundly rejected by the Court of Appeal. There is no intermediate  step
    necessary before the court goes on to consider the  Article  8.  It  is
    simply that there do have to be such circumstances  before  the  appeal
    can be allowed on article 8 grounds in circumstances  where  the  Rules
    are not met, but is not an intermediate test.

16. Given the changes to the immigration appeal rights brought about by the
    Immigration Act 2014, the appeal is argued on human rights grounds  and
    therefore she does require consideration of  the  five  stage  test  in
    Razgar. However, the Article 8 claim does have to be viewed through the
    lens or through the prism of the Immigration Rules.

17. It seems clear, having read the totality of the  judgment  that  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Gibbs has actually looked at it in terms of fact of
    his findings as at the date of the hearing, Mr Abegha earned �24,047.14
    in the tax year ending 2016 and �23,615.23 in the tax year ending 2015.
     The reason why the Rules were not met were solely because  of  failure
    to provide the documents specified in  Appendix  FM-SE  but  the  judge
    properly noted, following the case of MM & Others, paragraph  99,  that
    the restrictive approach  outside  the  Rules  is  more  difficult  two
    justify under the Human Rights Act because it is inconsistent with  the
    character of evaluation  of  the  Article  8  requirement  and  is  not
    properly constrained by a rigid restriction of the  Rules.   The  judge
    clearly was  looking  at  the  case,  the  purpose  of  the  Article  8
    consideration, as at the date of the hearing and as at  that  date  the
    judge was entitled to find that the income requirement was met  and  it
    was simply the fact that  the  requisite  documentation  had  not  been
    provided under the Rules. However, the Judge clearly did consider  that
    the evidence given in that regard was credible to her and found that Mr
    Abegha did earn the level of income stated. That is a factor which  the
    judge has actually considered  as  being  a  relevant  factor  for  the
    purposes of Article 8, and in my judgment is a sufficiently  compelling
    factor to have permitted her to allow the appeal on article 8  grounds.
    In that regard I do find that in  fact  the  judge  has  clearly  taken
    account of the public interest and taken account of the fact  that  the
    requirements of the Rules were  not  met,  but  was  entitled  to  take
    account of the evidence which she accepted regarding the income  earned
    having heard oral evidence on the issue, and found the  witness  to  be
    credible, as at the date of the appeal hearing.

18. I find that the judge has actually carried out the balanced approach as
    mandated by the Supreme Court and has taken account of all the relevant
    factors and has actually made a finding which was open to  her  on  the
    evidence.  I find that the Grounds of  Appeal  in  that  regard  simply
    amount to a disagreement with the findings made, but the findings  were
    open to the judge on the evidence before her.  I do not find  there  is
    any material error of law in that regard.

19. In respect of the two other submissions made by Mr Melvin, his argument
    that there was a factual  erroneous  finding  within  the  decision  at
    paragraph 28 of the judgment regarding whether or not the Appellant had
    previously been here for an  illegal  purpose  between  2005  and  2013
    before returning to Nigeria, was not  an  argument  raised  within  the
    Grounds of Appeal. Nor did Mr  Melvin  seek  specifically  to  make  an
    application to amend the Grounds of Appeal.  I do not consider that  is
    something which I should now properly consider as  no  application  was
    formally made to amend the Grounds of Appeal in that regard.

20. Further, in respect of Mr Melvin's submission that the judge  erred  in
    respect of consideration of the Article 8 claim as at the date  of  the
    hearing and  whether  or  not  an  entry  clearance  case  is  actually
    considered as at the date of the application, again that did  not  form
    part of the Grounds of Appeal and again no formal application was  made
    to amend the Grounds of Appeal in that regard and I have not considered
    that as a matter which was properly raised before the Tribunal.

21. However, on that issue, I did refer Mr  Melvin  to  the  re-wording  of
    Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  in
    which it is stated, "on appeal under Section 82(1) against a  decision,
    the Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks  relevant  to  the
    substance of the decision including a matter arising after the date  of
    the decision".   That  wording  under  Section  85(4)  substituted  the
    previous wording which only permitted  the  tribunal  to  consider  the
    circumstances appertaining as at the date of the decision and therefore
    makes it clear that the Tribunal may now consider matters of  relevance
    including matters arising after the date of the decision and  therefore
    the court under an Article 8 consideration is actually looking at it as
    at the date of the appeal hearing.

22. It has not been shown that the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Gibbs does contain a material error of law and I therefore maintain the
    decision.  I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibbs does not contain a  material
error of law and is maintained.

No anonymity direction is made.
