                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

Introduction

       1. In  this  decision  I  remake  the  decision  on  the  appellant's
          international  protection   appeal.    This   decision   must   be
          considered  alongside  Lane   J's   'error   of   law'   decision,
          promulgated on 13 December 2019.  In  that  decision  the  parties
          agreed that the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') erred in  law  in  its
          approach to whether the appellant could obtain a replacement  CSID
          and this aspect of the appeal  should  be  re-made  in  the  Upper
          Tribunal ('UT') at a 'resumed hearing'.

Procedural history

       2. At a telephone case management hearing ('TCMH')  on  22  May  2020
          the parties agreed that the  resumed  hearing  should  take  place
          remotely and there would be limited  cross-examination.   This  is
          because it was agreed that there were (then) only  two  issues  in
          dispute.


          1) Did the appellant dispose of his CSID en route to the UK or did
             he leave it with a family member in Iraq, who would be able  to
             send it to him?


          2) Even if it is  accepted  for  the  purposes  of  (1)  that  the
             appellant no longer has access to a  CSID  and  must  obtain  a
             replacement identity document, can he do so from the UK?   This
             must be considered in the light of the SSHD's acceptance in her
             position statement that as "the CSA office in Tuz  Khurmatu  is
             no longer issuing CSID cards, the appellant will be  unable  to
             obtain a replacement CSID card from the UK".


       3. In  advance  of  the  hearing,  the  SSHD  helpfully  updated  her
          position in writing. The SSHD now accepts that  in  the  light  of
          evidence post-dating  SMO,  KSP  &  IM  (Article  15(c);  identity
          documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC)  ('SMO'),  obtaining  a
          CSID from the Iraqi Embassy while in the UK is highly  unlikely  -
          see 2.6.15 to 2.6.16 of the CPIN  on  Iraq:  Internal  relocation,
          civil  documentation  and  returns  v.11  (June  2020).   Mr   Tan
          expressly conceded that in the light of this, the  case  turns  on
          issue (1) above only.

Hearing


       4. At the  beginning  of  the  hearing  both  parties  clarified  the
          limited  evidence  available  (a  witness   statement   from   the
          appellant dated 1 July 2020), in the light of  the  accepted  sole
          narrow issue in  dispute.   The  appellant  gave  evidence  via  a
          Kurdish Sorani interpreter.  I checked that  the  appellant  fully
          understood the process and the interpreter.  He  relied  upon  his
          witness statement explaining his journey out of Iraq  overland  to
          Turkey which was facilitated by an agent.  The appellant was  then
          cross-examined by Mr Tan.  I address this evidence in more  detail
          below.


       5. In closing submissions Mr Tan reminded me that it is important  to
          bear in mind the FTT's adverse findings of fact.   He  invited  me
          to find the appellant's evidence was inconsistent  in  significant
          respects: how and why he left Iraq; the disposal of his CSID  and;
          the nature and extent of family contact.

       6. Ms Evans reminded me that the appellant's claim that he  used  his
          CSID to leave Iraq had been broadly internally consistent and  was
          also entirely externally consistent with  the  country  background
          evidence.

       7. After hearing submissions from both representatives I reserved  my
          decision, which I now provide with reasons.

Assessment


       8. The respondent accepts that SMO together with the older  CG  cases
          support the proposition that the appellant faces serious  harm  in
          Iraq if he is unable to  obtain  his  original  CSID  from  family
          members in Iraq, and the appeal turns entirely on this is  a  very
          narrow issue.


       9. I bear in mind that the  FTT  rejected  much  of  the  appellant's
          account and found him not  to  be  credible.   The  FTT's  primary
          findings of fact are preserved.  In particular, the appellant:  is
          of Kurdish ethnicity and fled Iraq with an  agent  in  July  2018;
          lived in  Shoraiee  near  Tuz  Khurmatu,  where  he  worked  as  a
          shepherd; had access to a large  sum  of  money(ï¿½12,000),  through
          his brother-in-law to pay for his journey out  of  Iraq;  did  not
          provide a truthful account of the reasons why  he  fled  his  home
          area; remained in contact with family members in Iraq; was  not  a
          credible witness and left Iraq for economic  reasons;  arrived  in
          the UK on 29 August 2018, when he claimed asylum.   It  is  to  be
          noted that the FTT was prepared to accept the more  basic  aspects
          of the appellant's account,  including  his  claimed  nationality,
          ethnicity  and  home  area.   The  FTT  also  accepted  that   the
          appellant fled Iraq with the assistance of an  agent  having  paid
          him with funds given to him by  his  brother-in-law.   It  clearly
          goes against the appellant's  general  credibility  that  the  FTT
          rejected  the  core  of  his  asylum  claim.   However,   I   must
          nonetheless consider whether it  is  reasonably  likely  that,  as
          claimed, the  appellant  left  Iraq  with  his  CSID  but  it  was
          destroyed by the agent en route.

      10. I  accept  that  the  appellant's  evidence  before  me  contained
          inconsistencies on significant issues, as submitted by Mr Tan.   I
          accept his  evidence  regarding  contact  with  his  family  after
          arriving in the UK was confused and contradictory.  The  appellant
          also stated during his oral evidence that the agent took his  CSID
          away in Turkey,  when  his  recent  witness  statement  refers  to
          Greece  (albeit  couched  in  uncertain  terms).   The   appellant
          altered his position from stating that he left Iraq for the  first
          time in May 2018 because he was  in  fear  of  his  life  to  then
          stating that he wished to travel but had  to  return  because  his
          mother was ill.  These  reflect  adversely  upon  the  appellant's
          already damaged credibility.

      11. I also note that the appellant's account of his use  of  an  agent
          for his first departure from Iraq in May 2018  differed  from  his
          account for July 2018.  The appellant claimed to pay much less  in
          May 2018.  This seems plausible  because  the  appellant  did  not
          make it beyond Greece.  The agent did not take his  CSID  away  in
          May 2018 but it is again plausible that the agent  was  different,
          as was his modus operandi.


      12. Although the appellant's general credibility has been  damaged  in
          serious ways, there are significant  matters  in  support  of  his
          relatively straightforward claim that he left Iraq  in  July  2018
          with his CSID.  First, the appellant was candid about his CSID  in
          the asylum interview (which took place on 1 May 2019).  He  agreed
          that he had a CSID and could get a new one (Qs  16-19).   At  that
          time the appellant was not  disputing  his  ability  to  obtain  a
          replacement CSID and in the circumstances  there  was  no  obvious
          motivation or reason for him to lie at that time about taking  the
          CSID with him when he left or the agent disposing of it.

      13. Second, the appellant's claim to have taken his CSID when he  left
          Iraq is also consistent with the FTT's finding that there  was  no
          pressing need for  him  to  leave  (the  FTT  rejected  the  sheep
          dispute and the claim that his father and  brother  were  killed).
          In other words, the  appellant  had  time  to  get  his  documents
          together.

      14. Third and perhaps most significantly, it is well  known  that  for
          many  years  in  Iraq  one   requires   the   requisite   identity
          documentation to travel  without  hindrance  and  to  get  through
          checkpoints.  Mr Tan accepted this to be the case and there is  no
          need to refer to the ample country guidance on the issue.  I  note
          that the appellant claimed to have left his  home  area  with  the
          agent in a car (Q  143  and  159).   This  is  a  lengthy  driving
          distance that would  include  numerous  checkpoint  possibilities.
          The appellant claims he left his home  area  in  the  morning  and
          arrived late at night  -  the  journey  required  a  full  day  of
          driving.   Indeed,  in  his  witness   statement   the   appellant
          explained that he had to show his  CSID  at  two  checkpoints  and
          then when he crossed the border.  Mr Tan did not cross-examine  on
          any of this.

      15. I have considered all the evidence in  the  round,  including  the
          evidence available  to  the  FTT  and  the  findings  of  fact  in
          relation to this, the appellant's  recent  witness  statement  and
          oral evidence, together  with  the  country  background  evidence.
          Although much of the appellant's evidence has  been  found  to  be
          incredible and inconsistent, I am  prepared  to  accept  that  the
          appellant left Iraq in July 2018 with his CSID given  the  matters
          I have identified above.  The  appellant  has  not  been  truthful
          before me and the FTT in important respects.  However  I  bear  in
          mind that does not mean that he has lied about every single  issue
          and the utility of the 'Lucas' self-direction - see Uddin  v  SSHD
          [2020] EWCA Civ 338 (12 March 2020).

      16. I accept that it is reasonably  likely  that  the  appellant  left
          Iraq with his CSID.  As Ms Evans submitted even assuming that  the
          appellant is an economic migrant, he had to  leave  Iraq  by  some
          means and the most logical and plausible way for him to have  done
          that was by car.   The  country  guidance  is  clear  and  not  in
          dispute: in  order  to  travel  around  Iraq  one  needs  identity
          documents.  This appellant did not  have  a  passport  and  it  is
          reasonably likely  he  used  his  CSID.     Notwithstanding  other
          discrepancies, I accept that he complied with the  instruction  of
          the agent and no longer has the CSID.  It follows that he did  not
          leave the CSID with anyone in Iraq, and  his  family  cannot  send
          his CSID to him.

Conclusion

      17. Without the requisite CSID, the country  guidance  cases  make  it
          clear and Mr Tan accepted,  that  the  appellant  is  at  risk  of
          serious harm in breach of Article 3, ECHR.


      18. The appellant has not identified any Convention  Reason  for  this
          harm.  This case succeeds on the basis that the appellant will  be
          unable to reside in Iraq without coming to a real risk of  serious
          harm  for   reasons   relating   to   an   absence   of   identity
          documentation.  It follows that to return him to Iraq would  be  a
          breach of Article 3, ECHR and Article 15(b) of  Council  Directive
          2004/83/EC.

Notice of Decision

      19. I remake the decision  by  allowing  the  appeal  on  humanitarian
          protection and Article 3, ECHR grounds.
