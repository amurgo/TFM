                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kamal, of Immigration Solutions Limited

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Entry Clearance Officer Dhaka appeals, with permission,  against  a
    decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Majid  who   in   a
    determination promulgated on 23 July 2013 allowed the appeal of Md Amir
    Hossain against a decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Dhaka  to
    refuse him entry clearance to come to Britain as a family visitor.

2.   Although the Entry Clearance Officer  is  the  appellant  before  me  I
    will, for ease of reference refer to him as the respondent  as  he  was
    the respondent in the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly although Md  Amir
    Hossain is the respondent  before  me  I  will  refer  to  him  as  the
    appellant as he was the appellant before the First-tier Judge.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 31 December 1983.   He
    made an application to come to Britain as a family visitor to visit his
    uncle for a period of two months.  The application was refused  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer who noted that the appellant had stated that he
    had been self-employed at Amir Hossain Constructions since January 2010
    earning BDT35,000 per month which, on conversion amounted to  �273  and
    that the appellant had stated that he  spent  BDT25,000  per  month  on
    family members and living costs (�195).  That would leave  him  with  a
    disposable income of �78.  The Entry Clearance Officer noted  that  the
    appellant had not provided a trade licence, business  bank  statements,
    receipts, accounts or tax documents  despite  having  claimed  to  have
    established  his  business  since  January  2010  and  that,  moreover,
    although he had claimed additional income from land he had not provided
    documentation showing what income was received.

4.   He noted that the appellant had  provided  a  personal  bank  statement
    showing a closing balance of BDT275,420 (�2,151) but that the financial
    transactions in the account did not  reflect  his  stated  income  from
    employment - no funds, for example,  had  been  deposited  in  January,
    February or March.  Moreover the debits did not match  the  appellant's
    expenditure.  BDT153,000 (�1,195) had been deposited in May alone which
    had been 50 times the appellant's stated monthly disposable income.  It
    was claimed that he had not adequately explained the origin and history
    of the funds held in the account.  It was stated that this  cast  doubt
    on the appellant's claim that he had been established in  business  and
    was in receipt of the income stated.

5.   It was also said that he had not provided sufficient  evidence  of  his
    personal, social and financial  situation  in  Bangladesh  such  as  to
    indicate that he would have any incentive to leave Britain at  the  end
    of the short stay.  It was therefore not accepted that he  intended  to
    travel to Britain solely as a visitor and that he would  leave  Britain
    at the end of the visit.

6.   It was therefore decided that the appellant had not shown that  he  was
    a genuine visitor who would leave at the end of his visit.

7.   Issues of accommodation  and  maintenance  by  the  sponsor  were  also
    questioned.

8.   Judge Majid heard the appeal on 19 June 2013.  He heard  evidence  from
    the sponsor and  some  submissions  from  both  representatives  before
    noting that the sponsor had said that he would fund the appellant's air
    ticket.  In paragraph 16 he commented:-

         "Those who know about the sale of travel tickets know that  a  one-
         way ticket is very expensive to buy and commonsense dictates that a
         return ticket is purchased.  The ticket having been purchased,  the
         appellant's visit to this country becomes a minor issue."


    He then went on to say that it was clear from the sponsor's declaration
    that the appellant was not the kind of person who would break the  law.



9.   In paragraphs 18 onwards of the determination he appeared to deal  with
    the issue of the rights of the appellant under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.
    Having referred to the judgment of the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts  v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 he stated  that  it  was  important  to  take  into
    account the rights of others other than the appellant.

10.  In paragraphs 31 and 32 he stated:-

         "31. I am fully conscious of the 'legal requirements' stipulated by
             the Immigration Rules.  I am clearly persuaded that  it  is  a
             straightforward family visit, having no risk of the  appellant
             becoming a burden on public funds.  Of course, the sponsorship
             declaration gives clear evidence of that fact.


         32.  Accordingly in view  of  my  deliberations  in  the  preceding
             paragraphs and having taken into account all of the  oral  and
             documentary  evidence  as  well  as  the  submissions  at   my
             disposal, cognisant of the fact that the burden of proof is on
             the appellant and the standard of  proof  is  the  balance  of
             probabilities, I am persuaded that the  appellant  merits  the
             benefit of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended)  as  well
             as the provisions of the ECHR."

11.  He therefore stated that he allowed the appeal.

12.  The Entry Clearance Officer appealed, firstly stating  that  the  judge
    had erred in not adjourning the appeal but secondly stating that  there
    was no clear finding on the issue of maintenance.  The grounds referred
    to the fact that the judge, in paragraph 12  and  13  had  stated  that
    maintenance was the only issue raised by the Entry Clearance Manager.

13.  I indicated at the beginning of the hearing that  I  found  that  there
    were errors of law in the determination of the  Immigration  Judge  and
    that he had not properly considered the reasons for the refusal of  the
    application and had failed to give clear and reasoned findings for  his
    decision.

14.  Mr Kamal argued, however,  that  the  issue  of  accommodation  was  no
    longer in issue and that the judge had dealt properly with the issue of
    maintenance.  There were good reasons why the appellant would  come  to
    visit the large numbers of relatives which he had in Britain  and  that
    food  and  accommodation  would  be  provided.   He  referred  to   the
    appellant's bank statements which showed that he would easily  be  able
    to pay for the return ticket and relied on the evidence of the  sponsor
    that there was no hidden agenda and that the sponsor would ensure  that
    the appellant would return to Bangladesh.

15.  I found that there are material errors of law in the  determination  of
    the judge.  He simply does not engage with the issues in  the  refusal.
    He does not consider in any way the appellant's business  and  how  the
    appellant would have been able to amass the large sum  in  his  account
    from which he proposed to pay for the air fare.   He  does  not  engage
    with the issue of intention.  Moreover he was wrong to  find  that  the
    appellant's  appeal  could  succeed  on  human  rights  grounds.    The
    appellant is aged 29. It does not appear that he has  ever  lived  with
    the relatives whom he wishes to visit or has he  seen  them  in  recent
    years.  It cannot be said that the appellant is exercising family  life
    with them.  The judgment  of the Court of  Appeal  in  Kugathas  [2003]
    EWCA Civ 31 is clear: unless there are unusual circumstances it is most
    unlikely that family life can be shown between  adults.   Certainly  in
    this case no such circumstances exist.  I would add  that  the  judge's
    reference to the judgment of the  House  of  Lords  in  Beoku-Betts  is
    clearly distinguishable.  In that case a young man was to be  separated
    from the family with whom he had lived in Britain for many years  -  it
    was a removal case.  Those circumstances are completely different  from
    those of the appellant and the sponsor.

16.   Having  found  that  there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in   the
    determination it was agreed by both representatives that  it  would  be
    appropriate for me  to  hear  and  determine  the  appeal  rather  than
    remitting it to the First-tier Tribunal.

17.  The sponsor Mr Md  Lal  Miah  gave  evidence  relying  on  his  witness
    statement.  He said that he had last seen the appellant in 2010.   When
    asked about the large sums deposited  in  the  appellant's  account  he
    stated that the appellant ran a cash business and  that  he  would  put
    money in the account to buy the materials for the  business.   However,
    on a day-to-day basis he would be receiving money from clients which he
    would use to pay the labourers who worked for him.  He stated  that  he
    would help the appellant should he require further support while he was
    in Britain but that the appellant had  clearly  enough  money  for  his
    return ticket.  He would make  sure  that  the  appellant  returned  to
    Bangladesh by informing the police if he wished to overstay but in  any
    event he would make sure he went.  He said  that  the  appellant  would
    stay with him here.

18.  In reply to questions from Mr Deller he stated  that  his  home  had  a
    sitting room and two bedrooms.  He had three children aged 8, 5 and  1.
    The 8 year old had his own room and the other two children slept in the
    same bedroom as he and his wife.  The appellant would sleep on a bed in
    the reception room.

19.  He again emphasised that the appellant ran his business  on  the  basis
    of "cash money."  He could come to  Britain  to  see  England  and  his
    family.  He would only stay two to four weeks.

20.  Mr Deller put to him that the appellant had said  that  he  would  stay
    two months but the sponsor said that he would be  unable  to  stay  for
    that length of time here.

21.  In his submissions Mr Dellar adopted the  terms  of  the  refusal.   He
    accepted that the accommodation requirements were met but  with  regard
    to maintenance he referred to the lack of evidence of  the  appellant's
    own income and stated that that was relevant both with regard the issue
    of maintenance but also regard to the intemtion to return.   He  stated
    that there were clearly discrepancies about the length of the visit and
    doubts over when the appellant would leave.  He asked  me  to  make  an
    adverse inference from the evidence before me  and  to  find  that  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden of proof upon him.

22.  In reply Mr Kamal again emphasised that the  appellant  worked  on  the
    basis of a "cash business" and that he had good reasons for doing so  -
    he was paying the labourers he employed daily.  Moreover the  money  in
    his account showed his ability to pay for the air ticket.   Clearly  it
    was his intention to  return to his business.  Mr Kamal emphasised that
    the appellant's mother had obtained a visit  visa  in  2007  (when  the
    appellant had been refused) and that she had come to Britain  and  then
    returned.  He asked me to find  that  the  appellant  was  genuine  and
    credible when he stated that he intended to leave at  the  end  of  the
    visit and that therefore he met the requirements of the Rules.

Decision

23.  Quite correctly for the reasons which I have set  out  above  Mr  Kamal
    did not argue that the appellant's rights under Article 8 of  the  ECHR
    were infringed by the decision.

24.  The central issue in this appeal  is  that  of  the  intention  of  the
    appellant to return at  the  end  of  the  visit.   To  ascertain  that
    intention it is necessary to consider the life which this appellant was
    leading in Bangladesh.  He is not married nor does he have children  in
    Bangladesh.  What he claims is that since 2010 he has  been  running  a
    business there - it is a business in which some labourers are employed.
     The Entry Clearance Officer in the refusal pointed out that there  was
    scant evidence of the business.  Some documentary evidence by  the  way
    of licences was later produced  but  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
    pointed out such documents can easily be obtained in Bangladesh.  It is
    more important  to  consider  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  bank
    accounts particularly in the light of his claimed income in Bangladesh.



25.  The bank  accounts  do  not  show  that  the  appellant  is  running  a
    profitable business in  Bangladesh.   There  is  nothing  to  show  his
    regular monthly income.  Even if it were the case that a certain amount
    of the money which he received was used  for  cash  payments  to  daily
    labourers there should surely still be the profit element that would go
    into his own account and I would expect  that  to  lead  to  increasing
    amounts saved over a period of time.  There is nothing to indicate that
    that had happened: rather there is the large sum of money - no evidence
    is given as to exactly where that money  came  from  -  placed  in  the
    appellant's account.  The appellant had the  opportunity  of  producing
    evidence to explain how  that  sum  arrived  and  indeed  to  show  the
    accounts of the business or even tax returns that would show  that  the
    business was functioning and it was in profit such  that  he  would  be
    able to not only support himself in Bangladesh but would also  be  able
    to build up the funds that would fund his holiday - given the level  of
    his income it would surely have taken him  some  considerable  time  to
    build up enough for the air fare let alone the sum of over �2,000 which
    suddenly arrived in his account - but that evidence was not produced.

26.  These factors were such as to  lead  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    question the status of the appellant's business and hence the issue  of
    whether or  not  he  had  a  business  to  which  he  would  return  in
    Bangladesh.

27.  Taking these factors into account I find that  the  appellant  has  not
    discharged the burden of proof - the balance of probabilities  -  which
    rests on him.

29.  I accept that the accommodation requirements of the Rules would be  met
    and moreover that it is likely that the sponsor would  have  sufficient
    funds to support the appellant during a short visit.  However,  I  find
    that the appellant  has  not  shown  that  he   intends  to  return  to
    Bangladesh after a short visit and  for  that  reason  I  dismiss  this
    appeal.

Decision

This visit appeal is dismissed.
