For the Appellant:     Mr Holt of Counsel instructed by Braitch RB
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in  2001.   He  appeals
    with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    French) to dismiss his human rights appeal.

    Background and Matters in Issue Before the First-tier Tribunal

 2. In June 2018, when he was still a child,  the  Appellant  sought  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom in order to settle here with his  elder
    brother M.  M came to this country in 2009 and after  being  recognised
    as a refugee is now a British citizen. It is averred that both of their
    parents are dead.  The Appellant made his application  under  paragraph
    297 of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Respondent refused the application  on  the  21st  September  2018.
    Although it was eventually accepted (upon production of  DNA  evidence)
    that the Sponsor and Appellant are brothers, it was not  accepted  that
    the boys' parents were deceased, or that there were "serious family  or
    other  considerations   making   the   exclusion   of   the   Appellant
    undesirable".   As can be seen from the rule, both of these points were
    concerned with the Appellant's ability to meet one of  the  alternative
    provisions in sub-paragraph (i):

         "297.    The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

         (i)  is seeking leave to enter  to  accompany  or  join  a  parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

             (a)  both parents  are  present  and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom; or

             (b)  both parents are being admitted on the same occasion  for
             settlement; or

             (c)  one parent is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom
             and the other is being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement; or

             (d)  one parent is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom
             or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and  the
             other parent is dead; or

             (e)  one parent is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom
             or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and  has
             had sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f)  one parent or a relative is present and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and

         (ii) is under the age of 18; and

         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
         not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit;
         and

         (iv) can, and will,  be  accommodated  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse
         to public funds in  accommodation  which  the  parent,  parents  or
         relative the child is seeking to join, own or  occupy  exclusively;
         and

         (v)  can,  and  will,  be  maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents, or relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse
         to public funds; and

         (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
         capacity; and

         (vii)    does not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds  for
         refusal."

 4. It should be noted that the ECO's concern about the Appellant's parents
    only arose in the alternative. Although the whereabouts  and  wellbeing
    of his parents was relevant to the question raised by 297(i)(f),  these
    matters could not be determinative: the Appellant did not need to be an
    orphan to qualify.

 5. There is no longer any general right of appeal  against  a  refusal  to
    grant entry clearance under the rules. There was  however  a  right  of
    appeal available to the Appellant on human  rights  grounds.  It  being
    accepted that an application under 297 amounted to an  assertion  of  a
    right to family life under Article 8, it was on  this  basis  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal accepted the Appellant's appeal as  valid.   So  it
    was that when the appeal came before the First-tier  Tribunal  it  made
    the following observation:

         "I understood that the appeal needed to be considered in the  light
         of the Immigration Rules. Even though the Rules cannot be a  Ground
         of Appeal in itself, whether the appellant met  the  provisions  of
         the Immigration Rules is a relevant factor in deciding whether  the
         decision was proportionate"

 6. The Respondent accepted this proposition: although the  appeal  was  on
    'human rights' grounds in fact the Appellant's ability  to  demonstrate
    that he met the  requirement  of  the  Rules  was  very  likely  to  be
    determinative. Although there may be cases where a  historical  refusal
    under the Rules was found to be wrong, but a human rights appeal should
    nevertheless be dismissed[1], this was not one  of  them.   A  positive
    finding in respect of paragraph 297 would  amount  to  a  finding  that
    there was family life and that the refusal of entry clearance  betrayed
    a disproportionate lack of respect  for  that  Article  8  right.   Put
    another way, compliance with the rule would mean that there was nothing
    on the Secretary of State's side of the scales to show that the refusal
    of entry clearance could be justified: see TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.

 7. The Appellant's ability to meet the requirement at 297(i)(f)  was  then
    the primary matter in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.

    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The Tribunal directed itself to the legal framework, as set  out  above
    [at �2]. It recorded the evidence of the Sponsor [at �3], some of which
    it found to be "vague".  It noted the Respondent's concern  that  there
    was no documentary proof that the boys' parents were deceased [at  �4],
    and that there was no apparent reason why the sponsor could not  return
    to Afghanistan to be with his brother [�5].   It  then  considered  the
    best interests of the child [�6] and noted that continuity of residence
    is an important factor in the wellbeing of children.  The Appellant had
    lived his entire life until this point in Afghanistan, and was familiar
    with the customs and language of the country [�6]. He could not however
    speak English.  The Sponsor and Appellant had  in  fact  only  spent  2
    months together in the past ten years.  Accordingly  the  Tribunal  was
    not satisfied that any  emotional  or  financial  dependency  had  been
    established [�7]. Finally the Tribunal had regard to the weight  to  be
    attached to the maintenance of immigration control before finding  that
    there were no compelling reasons to allow the appeal.

    Error of Law

 9. Although the grounds are lengthy and detailed there  are,  in  essence,
    two central grounds  of  appeal.  The  first  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has failed to direct itself to the central  matter  in  issue:
    whether the Appellant meets the requirements  of  paragraph  297(i)(f).
    The second is that in its evaluation of the Appellant's case the First-
    tier Tribunal failed to take  material  evidence  into  account  whilst
    giving weight to immaterial factors.

10.  I find the first ground to  be  made  out.  That  paragraph  297(i)(f)
    underpinned the legal structure to be followed in this  appeal  is  not
    apparent  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision.  Having  initially
    directed  itself  to  the  correct  test  it  then  veers  off  into  a
    generalised assessment of Article 8 having regard to  matters  such  as
    whether  the  Appellant  can  speak  English  and  the  length  of  the
    separation  of  the  brothers,  the  public  interest  in   maintaining
    immigration control and the degree of  financial  dependency.   All  of
    these matters may have been relevant, but it is hard to see  where  the
    Tribunal addressed the question posed in the rule:  are  there  serious
    and compelling family or other considerations which make  exclusion  of
    the child undesirable?

11. The second ground is also made out. As already mentioned, the  Tribunal
    appears to give weight to matters which are of no consequence  at  all:
    there was  for  instance  no  requirement  under  the  rule  that  this
    Appellant demonstrate that he can speak English. The  Tribunal  further
    appears to diminish the significance of a street  robbery  suffered  by
    the Appellant on the grounds that it was not a  "political  act":  what
    the relevance of that might be is  left  unexplained.   Conversely  the
    Appellant is able to point  to  various  pieces  of  material  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal that are not addressed in its  decision,
    such as the Sponsor's testimony about how and why he  and  his  brother
    became separated, the documentary evidence of financial support and the
    photographs corroborating the claim that the  Appellant  has  been  the
    victim of crime in Kabul.    More significantly the decision completely
    ignores previous judicial consideration of the  circumstances  of  this
    family, namely the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Pooler)
    in respect of  the  Sponsor's  asylum  claim.  This  decision  contains
    findings plainly relevant to the disposal of this appeal including:

      a) That the boys' parents were killed in 2005 whilst on their  way  to
         visit a hospital in Kabul;

      b) That the boys were thereafter placed in  the  care  of  a  paternal
         uncle living in Ghazni;

      c) That this uncle was a Taliban sympathiser;

      d) That both boys were ill-treated by this man, being regularly beaten
         and in the case of the Sponsor, attacked with a knife;

      e) That the Sponsor (the elder of the two) was coerced by  this  uncle
         into committing crimes such as setting fire to the local school and
         planting landmines;

      f) That accordingly a real risk of harm arose in Ghazni,  where  there
         was not a sufficiency of protection;

      g) That the escape of both children  was  facilitated  by  a  maternal
         uncle then living in Iran but they were separated en route;

      h) That the Sponsor was only 16 years old  when  he  arrived  in  this
         country; and

      i) That it would be  unreasonable  and  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
         sponsor to internally relocate to Kabul  because  at  the  material
         time he was a child with no support in the city.

12. The Judge in this case was bound by the Devaseelan principles  to  take
    the findings of Judge Pooler as his starting  point.  The  omission  to
    consider them is clearly significant,  given  their  relevance  to  the
    question of whether there are today "serious  and  compelling"  reasons
    why this young man, who has only just turned 18,  should  be  extracted
    from Kabul and permitted to settle here with his brother.

13. For those reasons I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

    The Re-Made Decision

14. In remaking the decision I have had regard to the following material:

      a) The Appellant's bundle dated 18th April 2019 (containing inter alia
         witness statements from the Sponsor and from an additional  witness
         Mr Mohammadi)

      b)  Appellant's  supplementary  bundle  dated   26th   February   2020
         (containing inter alia an  undated  statement  from  the  Appellant
         drafted with the assistance of a Dari-English translation bureau in
         Kabul)

      c) The Entry Clearance Officer's  bundle  containing  inter  alia  the
         application form and refusal letter.

15. The only ground of appeal is human  rights.  The  Appellant  relies  on
    Article 8 ECHR and asserts that the decision to  refuse  to  grant  him
    entry clearance is not a proportionate response to the need to maintain
    immigration control. Before I turn to consider the matters in issue,  I
    record the agreement between the parties, and my acceptance, that there
    is a family life between the sole surviving  members  of  this  family,
    namely the Appellant and his Sponsor. As the evidence I set  out  below
    demonstrates, there is here both  emotional  and  financial  dependency
    such that there is a 'family life' between  these  two.  I  am  further
    satisfied that the decision to refuse entry  clearance  demonstrates  a
    lack of respect for that family life such that Article  8  is  engaged.
    The only question is whether that lack of respect is on the facts,  and
    having regard to the need  for  immigration  control,  justified.   The
    burden of proof in relation to this matter rests on the Entry Clearance
    Officer.  The Appellant submits that this burden cannot  reasonably  be
    discharged, because the Appellant can demonstrate that at all  material
    times he met the requirements of the Rules, specifically paragraph  297
    thereof.

16. The test at 297(i)(f) is a high one, containing three  separate  limbs.
    The first is that there is a relative present and settled in the United
    Kingdom: the Respondent accepts that this part  of  the  test  is  met,
    since the Sponsor M was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2015  and
    is now a  British  citizen.  Similarly  no  issue  is  taken  with  the
    Appellant's ability to meet the third limb of the test, that  "suitable
    arrangements have been made for his  care".  The  matter  in  issue  is
    confined to the second limb: that there  are  "serious  and  compelling
    family or other considerations which make the exclusion  of  the  child
    undesirable".

17.  In  Mundeba  (s.55  and  para  297(i)(f))  [2013]  UKUT  00088(IAC)  a
    Presidential panel of the Upper Tribunal (Mr Justice  Blake  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Dawson) considered what factors  might  be  relevant  in
    consideration of the rule. The headnote reads:

          i) The exercise of the duty by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
             assess an  application  under  the  Immigration  Rules  as  to
             whether there are family or other  considerations  making  the
             child's   exclusion   undesirable   inevitably   involves   an
             assessment of what the  child's  welfare  and  best  interests
             require.

         ii) Where an immigration decision engages Article  8  rights,  due
             regard must be had to the UN Convention on the Rights  of  the
             Child. An entry clearance decision  for  the  admission  of  a
             child  under  18  is  "an  action  concerning   children   ...
             undertaken  by  ...  administrative  authorities"  and  so  by
             Article 3 "the best interests of the child shall be a  primary
             consideration".

        iii) Although the statutory duty under s.55  UK  Borders  Act  2009
             only applies to children  within  the  UK,  the  broader  duty
             doubtless explains why the Secretary of  State's  IDI  invites
             Entry Clearance Officers to consider  the  statutory  guidance
             issued under s.55.

         iv)  Family considerations require an  evaluation  of  the  child's
             welfare including  emotional  needs.   'Other  considerations'
             come in to play where there are other  aspects  of  a  child's
             life that are serious and  compelling  for  example  where  an
             applicant is living in an  unacceptable  social  and  economic
             environment.  The focus needs to be on  the  circumstances  of
             the child in the light of his or her age,  social  backgrounds
             and developmental history  and  will  involve  inquiry  as  to
             whether:-

             a.   there is evidence of neglect or abuse;

             b.   there are unmet needs that should be catered for;

             c.   there are stable arrangements for  the  child's  physical
             care;

             The  assessment  involves  consideration  as  to  whether  the
             combination of  circumstances  are  sufficiently  serious  and
             compelling to require admission.

18. In the body of the decision Blake J emphasises the high threshold  that
    the language implies:

         34.  In our view, 'serious' means that there needs to be more  than
         the  parties  simply  desiring  a  state  of  affairs  to   obtain.
         'Compelling' in the context of paragraph 297(i)(f)  indicates  that
         considerations that are persuasive  and  powerful.  'Serious'  read
         with 'compelling'  together  indicate  that  the  family  or  other
         considerations render the exclusion of the child  from  the  United
         Kingdom undesirable. The analysis is one of degree and  kind.  Such
         an interpretation sets a high threshold that excludes cases  where,
         without more, it is simply the  wish  of  parties  to  be  together
         however natural that ambition that may be.

19. I have heard live evidence from two witnesses,  the  sponsor  M  and  a
    further witness, family friend Mr Mohammadi.  I have also had regard to
    the decision of Judge Pooler and the written evidence before  me.  Like
    Judge Pooler I found M to be a straightforward  and  credible  witness.
    Nothing about his evidence struck me as evasive or  vague.  Having  had
    the opportunity to cross examine him Mr McVeety accepted that he was  a
    credible witness, and in particular he expressly accepted  M's  account
    of the family history and how he and his brother came to  be  separated
    and eventually reunited. Mr Mohammadi  gave  similarly  straightforward
    and credible evidence, all of which was consistent  with  the  evidence
    that he had given before, and with the rest of the Appellant's case.  I
    find as follows.

20. The brothers were born to a Hazara family in a village in  Ghazni.  The
    Sponsor M was born in June 1993 and so was eight  years  old  when  the
    Appellant was born in September 2001.   They lived together with  their
    parents and a younger brother until,  in  the  summer  of  2005,  their
    parents and little brother  were  killed  on  their  way  to  attend  a
    hospital in Kabul. The brothers were taken to live with their  paternal
    uncle Murad in another village in Ghazni.   They were not treated  well
    by this uncle.  He was a cruel man who sympathised with the Taliban. He
    owned a gun shop and the  Sponsor  was  expected  to  help  out  there,
    cleaning the stock,  making  tea  etc.    Murad  started  to  take  the
    Sponsor, then aged 12/13 along with him to meetings with  Talibs.  They
    started asking him to undertake tasks  for  them  and  this  eventually
    escalated to requiring him to launch terrorist  attacks:  he  was  once
    told to lob a grenade at a local school and  on  another  occasion  was
    given petrol and told to burn  the  building  down.   Luckily  for  the
    Sponsor, Murad's activities became known to another maternal uncle, who
    lived in Iran. This uncle contacted him and told him that he was making
    arrangements to get the boys away from Murad, and out of Afghanistan.

21. Their escape from Ghazni was orchestrated in the early Spring of  2009,
    when the Sponsor M was approximately 15 and  the  Appellant  8.    They
    describe the situation as chaotic. Many civilians were trying  to  flee
    Ghazni at that time, which was a centre of the Taliban insurgency.  The
    Appellant describes being separated from M in a busy bazaar where there
    were many people trying to get transport out of the area. He  was  lost
    and alone and it was there that he was taken in by a man whom  he  knew
    as 'Haaji'.   The  Sponsor  meanwhile,  unable  to  find  his  brother,
    continued on his journey out of Afghanistan  and  across  Asia  towards
    Europe, under the control of agents paid for by his uncle in Iran.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom in June 2009 and claimed asylum.  He  was
    recognised as a refugee following  the  decision  of  Judge  Pooler  in
    December 2009.

22. The Appellant was taken by Hajji back to a farm  in  a  remote  village
    called Jaghoori in Ghazni. The witness Mr Mohammadi explained that this
    was a village where there was not a central point (as you might  expect
    to find in the United Kingdom context). The buildings and  houses  were
    quite far apart, scattered over the mountainside,  but  there  was  one
    central  mosque  and  they  all  fell  under  the  same  administrative
    district.   The Appellant states that at the beginning Hajji  was  "OK"
    with him. H was kind and genuinely helped the Appellant, who  described
    feeling safe with him. As he  got  older,  however,  Hajji's  behaviour
    towards him changed. He became more aggressive  and  started  expecting
    the Appellant to do a  lot  of  work  around  the  farm.  He  beat  the
    Appellant and on many days he went without food as punishment for  some
    transgression. The Appellant says that in  retrospect  he  thinks  that
    Hajji was "mental" - he was also very cruel to his wife and would  beat
    her for "silly reasons".  The Appellant did not receive any  help  from
    anyone else. The farm was far from other houses and you would  have  to
    walk a long way to get to another dwelling. Hajji  tried  to  keep  the
    Appellant away from other people.

23. During the Muharram festival in September 2016 the Appellant was in the
    mosque in the village when a "miracle" happened. He was approached by a
    man named Mr Mohammadi who told him  that  he  had  been  sent  by  his
    brother in the United Kingdom to find him. Mr Mohammadi bought him  new
    clothes and shoes and fed him. When he returned to the farm  Hajji  was
    angry when he saw the new items and took them from  the  Appellant.  He
    beat him when he explained that they had been a gift from a man at  the
    mosque. Before me Mr Mohammadi described the encounter from  his  point
    of view. He had been in the area visiting his family and had, upon  M's
    request, been making enquiries about the Appellant.  Initially  he  got
    nowhere as the people he asked did not know  who  this  boy  might  be.
    Because it was Muharram, however, the mosque was very busy for ten days
    straight. Towards the end of the  festival  someone  came  to  him  and
    pointed out the Appellant - he told him "that is the boy you have  been
    looking for".  Mr Mohammadi  describes  the  Appellant  at  this  first
    meeting:

         "if I was to say I my words he was in a bad way. He was not dressed
         very well, he wasn't very clean, he did not seem that he had bathed
         or showered for some time. He seemed  very  fragile  and  down;  he
         looked like a child that had no one to look after him"

24. Mr Mohammadi said that the Appellant was very shocked when he explained
    to him that his brother was in the United Kingdom and was  looking  for
    him.  He gave the Appellant the Sponsor's number in the United Kingdom,
    and managed to find out Hajji's number to give to the Sponsor.

25. From there the Sponsor, having spoken by telephone  to  the  Appellant,
    arranged for another family friend, a Mr Mohammad Jan Samim, to collect
    him from Hajji's farm. Mr Samim took him, at M's request, to  a  Hazara
    area in West Kabul where M had made arrangements for the  Appellant  to
    be accommodated in a dormitory, which M described in his evidence as  a
    "hostel for boys like him".  I was shown photographs of this hostel. He
    has a room, which is apparently shared with another boy.  It  is  clean
    and apart from some mould on the ceiling appears to be in a good  state
    of repair. There is a cabinet and a prayer area.   The  boys  sleep  on
    very thin mattresses which are  laid  out  on  the  floor,  covered  in
    typical thick polyester blankets. There are shared bathroom facilities,
    and there is a supervisor on site who  cooks  communal  meals  for  the
    residents. The food bill is included in the rent, which M pays for.

26. In his statement the Appellant describes his mental state:

         "I had many times fallen ill whilst out herding  in  the  mountains
         because no food I was very weak, whatever food they gave me  I  ate
         usually less food than them. Because Hajji hit me many times in the
         head I sometimes have had mental problems nightmares  of  the  past
         and no one to support me. I just sit on  my  bed  and  cry  feeling
         hopeless of everything. I have my brother now in the  UK  which  is
         the best thing that has ever happened to me. It was  my  best  time
         when  he  came  to  visit  me,  he  supports  me  financially   but
         emotionally I feel I got no one here I cant  trust  anyone  I  have
         lost trust in so many people. I chat  to  my  brother  on  a  daily
         basis. He is trying his best to help me get over there with him  to
         be safe....

         I missed and miss my parents every day  I  see  everyone  living  a
         normal happy life with their family and friends but I cant do  that
         because I have no family or friends here accept  (sic)  the  people
         who live at the dormitory as me which I have limited connection, my
         brother is worried I will get robbed again of my  money  or  mobile
         phone that's what happened to me previously when some found  out  I
         had my brother overseas they tried to be funny with me  asking  and
         using my phone credit for their own calls.

         Last year I was assaulted in the street and  some  gangs  tried  to
         steal my money and phone and beat me up badly...."

27. M explained in his evidence that he has sent his brother  a  laptop,  a
    mobile and English language books. He encourages him  to  stay  in  the
    dormitory because he is worried about his safety.  There  have  been  a
    number of bomb blasts in the area that he lives in and on one  occasion
    a stray bullet hit the  dormitory  when  fighting  broke  out  in  that
    neighbourhood. Also because he has a brother abroad M worries that  the
    Appellant is vulnerable to crime.  The  bundle  contains  a  number  of
    photographs, said to have been taken by the Appellant on his mobile and
    sent to M. These include two of what appears to be a large  bomb  site,
    and one of an internal wall with a shrapnel mark on it.    I  was  also
    provided with photographs of the Appellant after  he  was  mugged.  His
    face appears bruised and there is what looks like blood on his  jumper.
    The bundle also contains evidence of money transfer receipts going back
    to 2016 showing that the Sponsor sends to Afghanistan varying  amounts.
    He explained in evidence that he tries to send  between  �50  and  �100
    every month, and then occasionally  sends  a  much  larger  amount  for
    payment of rent - for instance on one occasion  he  sent  �500  and  on
    another �1500.

28. Having considered all of that evidence  I  am  in  no  doubt  that  the
    Appellant has discharged the burden in respect of the remaining limb of
    297(i)(f).   Mr McVeety is right when he says  that  the  Appellant  is
    probably in a far more advantageous position than other Hazara  orphans
    living on their own in Kabul.   He  has  a  roof  over  his  head,  the
    relative security that  this  brings,  and  his  brother's  remittances
    ensure that he is being fed, and able to pay for medical treatment when
    it is required.   If  these  practical  considerations  were  the  only
    matters pertinent to the rule, the  appeal  would  therefore  fail.  As
    Mundeba makes clear, however, the rule requires a  holistic  evaluation
    of the applicant's circumstances.  Those  include  the  family  history
    thus far, and a focus on what needs are being unmet. As it  clear  from
    the foregoing, it is the Appellant's emotional need for a family  which
    is presently left unfulfilled. This is a child orphaned at the  age  of
    5. He then spent four years under the control of a violent and  abusive
    uncle, followed by approximately seven years, between the ages of 9 and
    15, in what was effectively a forced labour situation.  His  expression
    of joy at being reunited with his brother, the sole surviving member of
    his family, is therefore unsurprising.  Whilst  he  enjoys  friendships
    with other boys in the hostel, these friendships are poor  compensation
    for the lack of any family support at all as he embarks  on  adulthood.
    I accept without hesitation that he is in Kabul lonely, and  frightened
    about what the future holds.   These  are  matters  to  which,  in  the
    context of the rule, I have attached considerable weight.

29. I add to this the concerns about security which feature so  heavily  in
    the evidence of both Appellant and Sponsor.    I  accept  M's  evidence
    that he actively discourages his brother from venturing out  into  West
    Kabul. That  advice  appears  to  be  very  sensible.  The  Appellant's
    description of terrorist attacks, and violent crime,  in  the  city  is
    supported by the country background evidence. The US Overseas  Security
    Advisory Council advised in March 2019 that "there is a serious risk of
    crime in Kabul" and that the "security situation remains  volatile  and
    unpredictable".  The  report  details  several  large-scale   insurgent
    attacks, such as those described by the Appellant, and  concludes  that
    "politically motivated terrorism is a major concern". More  recently  a
    Radio Free Europe report dated 11th February  2020  details  a  suicide
    bomb that exploded near the Kabul Military Academy, not  far  from  the
    Appellant's dormitory.  I have attached considerable  weight  to  these
    matters. I note, and accept, Mr Holt's point that M was  successful  in
    gaining refugee status in part because Judge Pooler  accepted  that  it
    would be unduly harsh for a teenage boy to be expected to live alone in
    Kabul. That is precisely the situation in which the Appellant now finds
    himself.

30. Having had regard to all of the evidence, and for those reasons,  I  am
    satisfied  that  there  are  serious  and   compelling   considerations
    rendering the exclusion of the Appellant undesirable.

31. Returning to the rule I note that  before  me  Mr  McVeety  raised  two
    matters which did not feature in the Entry Clearance Officer's original
    refusal. The first is that the Appellant is now over the age of 18, and
    so as of today's date can no longer meet the requirement at 297(ii). In
    fairness Mr  McVeety  accepted  that  this  was  a  factor  of  minimal
    significance in this human  rights  appeal,  given  that  there  is  no
    'bright line' between minority and majority and  that  the  Appellant's
    circumstances have changed not a jot between September  last,  when  he
    turned 18, and today. The second matter concerns the Appellant's living
    arrangements. Sub-paragraph 297(iii) requires that  the  applicant  "is
    not leading an independent life,  is  unmarried  and  is  not  a  civil
    partner, and has not formed an independent family  unit".   Mr  McVeety
    questioned whether, in his present circumstances, the  Appellant  could
    be said to be living independently. Mr Holt in response referred me  to
    the authority of NM ("leading an  independent  life")  Zimbabwe  [2007]
    UKAIT 00051 in which the Upper Tribunal held that the  phrase  much  be
    interpreted inclusively. The words "leading an independent  life"  must
    be read in the context of the  rest  of  the  clause  which  refers  to
    marriage. For this reason the matter of choice becomes relevant  -  has
    this child chosen to set up a household separate from his  parents,  or
    in this case, his brother? The Tribunal further had regard to the  fact
    that the purpose of the rule is to facilitate family unity and held:

         "Where a child (who may be over 18) is  seeking  limited  leave  to
         remain as the child of a parent with limited  leave,  in  order  to
         establish that he is not "leading an independent life" he must  not
         have formed through choice a separate (and  therefore  independent)
         social unit from his parents' family unit  whether  alone  or  with
         others".

    Applying this guidance to the facts of the present case I am  satisfied
    that the Appellant has not chosen to set up  an  independent  life  for
    himself. Life in the dormitory, arranged and paid for by M, is in  fact
    akin  to  the  Appellant  being  at  boarding  school,  living  in   an
    institution arranged by his relative where he is  provided  for  by  an
    adult paid to  look  after  him.   I  am  satisfied  that  all  of  the
    requirements of the rule were met at the date of  application,  and  at
    the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision. Apart from the fact
    that the Appellant has, during the  appeals  process,  'aged  out',  he
    continues to meet the requirements of that rule today.

32. The parties before me accepted that success under  the  rule  would  in
    effect be determinative. For the sake of completeness  I  must  however
    have regard to those factors set out at Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The Act mandates that the maintenance
    of immigration control is in the public interest.  In  this  context  I
    note my own finding that the Appellant has succeeded  in  demonstrating
    that he qualified for leave to enter under the Rule. It is  further  in
    the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic
    well-being of the United Kingdom, that  the  Appellant  is  financially
    independent, because such persons are less of a  burden  on  taxpayers,
    and are better able to integrate  into  society.   I  accept  that  the
    Appellant is not technically  "independent" but also mark the  accepted
    fact that he is to be adequately maintained  and  accommodated  by  his
    Sponsor, and as such may be considered to  be  financially  independent
    for the purpose of the Act: Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 58.  The only factor which  weighs  against  the
    Appellant is his inability to speak English to any measurable degree of
    competence. I note that it is in the public interest that as  a  person
    seeking to settle in the United Kingdom this is a matter that  must  be
    weighed against him.

33. I remind myself that the focus of this appeal is the  United  Kingdom's
    obligation under Article 8. The focus of the rule  is  family  reunion.
    Both purposes are clearly served by permitting the Appellant  to  enter
    the country and live once again with his brother.  I find the  decision
    to refuse entry clearance is in all the circumstances  disproportionate
    and unlawful within the terms of s6 of the Human Rights Acts 1998.

    Anonymity Order

34. This appeal, at its inception, related to a minor.  Having  had  regard
    to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and
    the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions and Directions

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for material error
    of law.

36. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds.

37. There is an order for anonymity.
