                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. This is  the  remaking  of  the  decision  in  the  Appellant's  appeal
    following my error of law decision, promulgated on 20  March  2019,  in
    which I concluded that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  proceeded  on  a
    factually mistaken basis when dismissing the appeal at first  instance.
    In summary, the judge had, through no fault of his own, been unaware of
    the fact that the Applicant's son's father had been granted  indefinite
    leave to remain, with the effect that the son could be registered as  a
    British citizen.

 2. An application  for  registration  had  been  made  after  the  judge's
    decision and before the error of law hearing. I  issued  directions  to
    the Appellant, requiring additional information about the  progress  of
    the son's application. Under cover of letter dated 13 August 2019,  the
    Appellant provided relevant evidence to show that her son had  in  fact
    been registered as a British citizen on 28 June 2019. As a consequence,
    I issued further directions in the following terms:

          1) Given the registration of the Appellant's  son  as  a  British
             citizen, the Respondent shall confirm in writing her  position
             in this appeal;


          2) The written position statement shall be filed with  the  Upper
             Tribunal and served on the Appellant no  later  than  21  days
             from the date this Directions Notice is sent out;


          3) If the Respondent's position  has  the  effect  that  an  oral
             hearing of this appeal is no longer necessary, this is  to  be
             clearly stated in the written position statement.


 3. Unfortunately, and without explanation, the Respondent  has  failed  to
    comply with these directions. I make it clear that this failure  is  in
    no way the fault of Ms Everett.

The hearing

 4. At the outset, Ms Everett apologised on behalf of  the  Respondent  for
    the non-compliance with my previous directions. She accepted  the  fact
    of  the  Appellant's  son's  registration  as  a  British  citizen  and
    confirmed that this event did not constitute a  "new  matter"  for  the
    purposes of section 85 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002, as amended.

 5. Ms Everett then confirmed that she was  not  opposing  the  Appellant's
    appeal, and in light of the son's registration as  a  British  citizen,
    the Appellant was entitled to succeed on the basis of  section  117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act because it would not,  in  all  the  circumstances,  be
    reasonable to expect her son to leave the United Kingdom.

The remake decision

 6. In the circumstances, I shall state my decision briefly.

 7. It is common ground that the Appellant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with her son. It is now also agreed that the  son
    is a British citizen.

 8. In this particular case, the Respondent has taken the position that  it
    would not be reasonable for the Appellant's son  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom. That is a considered view, and there is no  sound  basis  upon
    which to go behind it.

 9. As a consequence, all the constituent elements of section  117B(6)  are
    satisfied. It follows that the Appellant  is  entitled  to  succeed  on
    Article 8 grounds.

Costs

10. At the hearing, Ms Mardner indicated that  those  instructing  her  may
    wish to make an application for the costs of the hearing. She confirmed
    that if such an application were made, it would be on the basis of  the
    Respondent's failure to comply with  my  previous  directions  and  the
    unnecessary costs incurred by attending the hearing.

11. I gave the following oral directions at the hearing:

          1) Any application by the Appellant for costs was to be  made  no
             later than 4pm on 21 October 2019;


          2) The Respondent was to respond to any application no later than
             4pm on 4 November 2019.


Anonymity

12. I continue the anonymity direction that I made in respect of the  error
    of law decision. This direction is  in  place  so  as  to  protect  the
    identity of the Appellant's son.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  to  make  a
reduced fee  award  of  ï¿½100.00.  I  have  reduced  the  award  because  the
Appellant has succeeded in her appeal on the basis that  did  not  apply  at
the time human rights claim was made to the Respondent.

For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Oliver (the judge), promulgated on 7  January  2019,  by
    which he dismissed her appeal against the Respondent's refusal  of  her
    human rights claim.

 2. The Appellant's case was based primarily on her son's situation in this
    country.  Her son, a Ghanaian national like herself, had been  born  in
    March 2013.

The judge's decision

 3. On the basis of the evidence before him, the judge concluded  that  the
    son had no independent right to remain in this country.  The judge also
    concluded that the son's father apparently had no status here,  or,  at
    is highest, had only limited leave to remain. The father was not, as at
    the date of the hearing, playing an active role in the child's life.

 4. Applying the Article 8-related Rules  and  then  the  wider  Article  8
    approach, the judge concluded  that  the  Appellant's  son  was  not  a
    qualifying child for the purposes of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Immigration Rules or section 117B(6) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002. Having considered the child's best interests,  the
    judge found that both the Appellant and her son could leave the  United
    Kingdom and that there would be no breach of Article 8.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5.  The  grounds  of  appeal  assert  that  the  judge  laboured  under  a
    misapprehension as to the true factual position of  the  son's  father.
    It was said that he had in fact been granted indefinite leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2018.

 6. The grounds  assert  that  documentary  evidence  confirming  this  was
    attached however it became clear at the hearing  before  me  that  this
    does not seem to have been the case.

 7. In any event permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pickup on 21 January 2019.

The hearing before me

 8. At the hearing before me, Mr Gibson-Lee provided myself and Mr  Bramble
    with a letter from the London Borough of Redbridge, dated  18  February
    2019, apparently confirming the grant of indefinite leave to remain  to
    the child's  father  on  the  date  set  out  previously.   Mr  Bramble
    helpfully went away and checked the Respondent's own database  and  was
    able to confirm that this information was indeed correct.

 9. There is no evidence to  suggest  that  either  the  Appellant  or  her
    representatives knew of the grant to the father.

10. In light of the foregoing there was an error by the judge as to what is
    now accepted as being an uncontroversial matter of  fact,  namely  that
    the child's father had, from March 2018, indefinite leave to remain  in
    this country.  The core issue arising is whether this error of fact was
    material to the outcome of the Appellant's appeal.

Decision on error of law

11. Having heard from both representatives, I am satisfied that  the  error
    of fact amounts to a material error of law.

12. It is by no means certain that the outcome would  have  been  different
    had the judge been aware of the true factual situation relating to  the
    child's father.  However, that is not the test to  be  applied.  In  my
    view there is a sufficiently realistic prospect that the outcome  could
    have been different.  This is so for the following reasons.

13. I am unclear as to why the information about the child's father had not
    been provided by the Respondent prior to the hearing, or indeed at  the
    hearing, although I am in no way suggesting any deliberate  withholding
    of information.  However, it is a fact that this  information  had  not
    been disclosed.

14. If the judge had been aware of this, it is quite possible that he would
    either have adjourned the  hearing  on  application  by  the  Appellant
    (which, as Mr Gibson-Lee informed me having sought instructions,  would
    have been made at the time) or of his  own  volition  in  order  for  a
    possible application for registration as a British citizen to have been
    made on the child's behalf, or at least to have taken this  possibility
    into account as part and parcel of his Article 8 assessment,  which  of
    course included the best interests of the child.

15. Assuming that the matter would have proceeded without an adjournment, I
    am satisfied that the fact this child would have  had  the  ability  to
    make an application for registration (which of itself would have had an
    important impact on his status in this country) constituted a  relevant
    consideration that the  judge  would  have  been  bound  to  take  into
    account.  That does not mean that it would  have  in  any  way  been  a
    decisive factor, but in my view, it cannot properly be said  that  this
    simply  could  not  have  materially  affected  the  outcome   of   the
    Appellant's appeal.

16. In these circumstances there is a material error and I set the  judge's
    decision aside.

Disposal

17. In terms of disposal, given the narrow issue on which  I  have  decided
    the error of law point, this case can be retained in the Upper Tribunal
    and a remaking decision made in due course at a resumed hearing  before
    me.  I appreciate that some time will be needed for relisting in  light
    of the fact that an application for registration as a  British  citizen
    has been made on 26 February 2019 and received by  the  Respondent  two
    days later.

18. I will issue directions in order to progress matters.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of  law
and I set it aside.

I adjourn this appeal for a resumed hearing before me in due course.



Directions to the parties

   1. This appeal will be listed for a case management hearing before me  in
      3 months' time;



   2. The Appellant's representatives are under  an  ongoing  obligation  to
      keep the Upper Tribunal and Respondent informed of any changes to  the
      Appellant's circumstances (including those of her son) which may  have
      a material bearing on this appeal.
