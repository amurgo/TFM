Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Khan (counsel) instructed by A_R Law Chamber
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2.    This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge G Wilson promulgated on 7 August 2018,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal.


Background


3.    The Appellant was  born  on  19  March  1977  and  is  a  national  of
Pakistan. The appellant entered the UK on 8 September  2005  as  a  student.
The respondent granted leave to remain in the UK a number  of  times.  On  2
July 2013 the respondent granted the appellant further leave to remain as  a
tier 1 (general) migrant until 2 July 2016. On 1  July  2016  the  appellant
applied for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 10  years  continuous
lawful residence. The respondent refused  that  application  on  24  January
2018.

The Judge's Decision

4.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge G Wilson ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision. Grounds of appeal were  lodged  and  on  4  September
2018 Judge Simpson gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    "Permission to appeal is granted for the following reasons:


         (i)      it appeared that at his appeal hearing the  appellant  was
         legally represented, however he now acts in  person  when  applying
         for permission to appeal. Accordingly the totality of the  decision
         was read with care to ensure no Robinson order of arguable error or
         errors of law were disclosed;


         (ii)     there appeared when assessing matters  with  reference  to
         the Immigration Rules (the Rules), and paragraph 276B(ii) &  (iii),
         10 years continuous lawful  residence  in  the  UK,  and  paragraph
         322(5), that consideration of a matter of an order of serious  note
         for  an  appellant  charges  by  the  respondent   concerning   his
         undesirable conduct there appeared  inter  alia  arguably  lack  of
         regard that HMRC or any other agency had taken action  against  the
         appellant concerning conduct in respect of his tax affairs of which
         the respondent had relied, and further arguably  an  inadequacy  of
         reasoning  concerning  that  factor  having  not  weighed  in   the
         appellant's favour;


         (iii)    all grounds are arguable."

The Hearing

5.(a) For the appellant, Mr Khan moved the grounds of  appeal.  He  took  me
straight to [34] of the decision, where the  Judge  says  that  he  attaches
little weight to a letter from the  appellant's  accountant  (reproduced  at
page 12 the appellant's bundle). The Judge attaches little  weight  to  that
letter because no witness came to speak to the letter.  Mr  Khan  said  that
the Judge was wrong to attach little weight to the accountant's letter,  and
that if oral evidence was required from  the  accountant  the  Judge  should
have considered adjourning the hearing to enable the author  of  the  letter
to give evidence.

(b)   Still focusing on [34] of the decision,  Mr  Khan  told  me  that  the
Judge's findings

    (i)    that it is implausible that errors in filing tax  returns  could
    be made in two non-consecutive tax years and


    (ii)   that the appellant's continued use of an incompetent  accountant
    was implausible

are unsafe. He told me that no expert evidence was led and  referred  me  to
the terms of the accountant's letter.  He  told  me  that  the  accountant's
letter is "the keystone to" the entire appeal.

(c)   Mr Khan then moved to  [35]  of  the  decision.  There  the  Judge  is
critical of the appellant's  evidence.  He  told  me  that  English  is  the
appellant's second language and that the appellant was nervous  when  giving
evidence. He told me that the Judge failed to take account of these  factors
when assessing the appellant's credibility.

(d)   Mr Khan then turned to the Judge's article 8 private life  assessment.
He told me that at [38], when the Judge considers paragraph 276 ADE  of  the
rules, the Judge failed to take account of the appellant's residence in  the
UK since 2005. He  told  me  that  the  Judge's  proportionality  assessment
(carried out from [40] onwards) is inadequate. He told  me  that  the  Judge
should have acknowledged that  HMRC  have  not  sought  prosecution  of  the
appellant but have entered into an arrangement for  payment  of  outstanding
tax.

(e)   Mr Khan urged me to set the decision aside.

6.(a) For the respondent, Ms Pal told me that the decision does not  contain
an error of law, material or otherwise. She  took  me  through  the  Judge's
findings of fact between [32] and [37] of the decision.  She  told  me  that
the Judge made carefully reasoned findings of fact drawn from  the  evidence
and that each of the findings of fact were reasonably  open  to  the  Judge.
She told me that the grounds of appeal amount to mere disagreement with  the
facts as the Judge them to be.

(b)   Ms Pal reminded me that the appellant was legally  represented  before
the First-tier Tribunal, and said it is for the  appellant's  solicitors  to
decide which witnesses to  lead.  It  was  the  appellant's  solicitors  who
decided not to lead the appellant's accountant in evidence. Ms Pal  reminded
me that the appellant's solicitors did not seek an adjournment  &  that  the
appellant's solicitor  did  not  suggest  that  the  appellant  requires  an
interpreter or that the appellant was too nervous to give evidence.

(c)   Ms Pal told  me  that  the  Judge  considered  all  relevant  factors,
including the length of time  the  appellant  has  been  UK,  and  that  the
Judge's consideration of article 8 ECHR grounds of appeal was flawless.  She
urged me to dismiss the appeal and allow the decision to stand.




Analysis

7.     The  respondent's  decision  relies  on  paragraph  322(5)   of   the
immigration rules. Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is one  of  the
"general grounds for refusal". It states that  applications  for leave  to
remain should normally be refused  where  it  would  be  undesirable  for  a
person to remain  in  the  UK  in  light  of  their  conduct,  character  or
associations. The respondent's position is  that  the  appellant  failed  to
declare his self-employed income in the tax years from  2011  to  2013.  The
appellant's position is that there is an innocent explanation  and  that  he
has now put his tax affairs in order.

8.    At [14] the Judge quotes  directly  from  the  letter  which  Mr  Khan
describes as the keystone to the  appellant's  appeal.  At  [33]  the  Judge
considers the difference between the figures the appellant included  in  his
tax returns and the figures that he relied on in his applications for  leave
to remain. The Judge carries out a careful analysis  of  the  difference  in
the figures for the various tax  years  and  explains  why  he  rejects  the
appellant's explanation. In the final sentence of  [33]  the  Judge  focuses
his findings, explaining  that  the  appellant  was  earning  in  excess  of
ï¿½50,000 in years where he paid little or no tax.

9.    At [34] the Judge analyses the letter from the appellant's  accountant
and explains why he attaches little weight to that letter. The  question  of
weight to be attributed to any piece of  evidence  is  a  question  for  the
Judge. In Green (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC)  the  Tribunal
said that "Giving weight to a factor one way or another  is  for  the  fact-
finding Tribunal and the assignment of weight will rarely give  rise  to  an
error of law". The Judge sets out  adequate  reasons  for  attaching  little
weight to the accountant's letter. The  appellant  was  legally  represented
before the First-tier Tribunal. It was  for  the  appellant  and  his  legal
advisers to decide what evidence is necessary and which  witnesses  will  be
called. Neither the appellant nor his solicitor sought an  adjournment.  The
Judge cannot be faulted  for  making  his  findings  on  the  basis  of  the
evidence placed before him.

10.   At [35] the Judge finds that the appellant is neither a  credible  nor
a reliable witness. The  Judge  gives  adequate  reasons  for  his  finding.
Assessing credibility is part of the task entrusted to the Judge.  There  is
nothing wrong with the Judge's credibility findings at  [35].  At  [37]  the
Judge  draws  his  findings  together  and  concludes  that  the  respondent
correctly relies on paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules. There is,  of
course, no appeal under the Immigration Rules. The only competent ground  of
appeal open to the appellant is on article 8 ECHR grounds.

11.   At [38] the Judge considers paragraph 276ADE  of  the  rules.  In  the
second sentence of [35] the Judge records that the  appellant  has  been  in
the UK since 2005. There is no merit in Mr Khan's submission that the  Judge
did not take account of the length of the appellant's residence  in  the  UK
when  considering  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  rules.  The  length  of   the
appellant's residence in the UK can be found throughout the decision and  is
repeated at the very beginning of the  Judge's  consideration  of  paragraph
276 ADE.

12.   In SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 it was held that the  concept  of
integration into a country was a broad one.  It  was  not  confined  to  the
mere ability to find a job or  sustain  life  whilst  living  in  the  other
country.  It would usually be sufficient for a court or tribunal  to  direct
itself  in  the  terms  Parliament  had  chosen  to  use.    The   idea   of
"integration" called for a broad  evaluative  judgment  to  be  made  as  to
whether  the  individual  would  be  enough  of  an  insider  in  terms   of
understanding how life in the society in that other country was  carried  on
and a capacity to participate in it, so as to have a reasonable  opportunity
to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day  basis  in  that
society and to build  up  within  a  reasonable  time  a  variety  of  human
relationships to give substance  to  the  individual's  private  and  family
life.

13.    In  Treebhawon  and  Others  (NIAA  2002  Part   5A   -   compelling
circumstances test) [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC) it was held  that  mere  hardship,
mere difficulty, mere hurdles, mere upheaval and mere  inconvenience,  even
where multiplied, are unlikely to satisfy the  test  of  "very  significant
obstacles" in paragraph 276 ADE of the Immigration  Rules.   In  Parveen  v
SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 932 Underhill LJ commented on that observation "I have
to say that I do not find that a very useful gloss  on  the  words  of  the
rule. It is fair enough  to  observe  that  the  words  "very  significant"
connote an  "elevated"  threshold,  and  I  have  no  difficulty  with  the
observation that the test  will  not  be  met  by  "mere  inconvenience  or
upheaval". But I am not sure that saying that "mere" hardship or difficulty
or hurdles, even if multiplied, will not "generally" suffice adds  anything
of substance. The task of the Secretary of State, or the Tribunal,  in  any
given case is simply to assess the  obstacles  to  integration  relied  on,
whether characterised as hardship or difficulty or anything  else,  and  to
decide whether they regard them as "very significant"".

14.   At [38] the Judge finds that the appellant has been in  the  UK  since
2005 but spent 28 years in his home country. That is a  clear  finding  that
the appellant has spent the majority of his life in Pakistan. The  remainder
of the Judge's findings at [38] could only lead the Judge to the  conclusion
he reaches in the final sentence of [38] - that  there  are  no  significant
obstacles to reintegration in Pakistan.

15.   The Judges assessment of article 8 outside the  immigration  rules  is
carried out between [40] and [46]. As the  appellant  is  a  single,  adult,
male with no dependents it is surprising that the Judge found  that  article
8 family life is engaged but having found that both family and private  life
exist for the  appellant  in  the  UK  the  Judge  carries  out  a  complete
proportionality assessment between [43] and [46] of the decision.

16.   In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside)  [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)
the Tribunal held that (i) Although there is a legal duty to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

17.   A fair reading of the decision demonstrates  that  the  Judge  applied
the correct test in law. The Judge carried out a holistic assessment of  all
of the evidence. There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's  fact-finding
exercise. In reality the appellant's appeal amounts to little  more  than  a
disagreement with the way the Judge has applied the facts as he  found  them
to be. The appellant might not like the conclusion that  the  Judge  arrived
at, but that conclusion  is  the  result  of  the  correctly  applied  legal
equation. The correct test in law has been applied. The  decision  does  not
contain a material error of law.

18.   The decision does not contain a material error  of  law.  The  Judge's
decision stands.

DECISION

19.   The appeal is dismissed. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
promulgated on 7 August 2018, stands.
