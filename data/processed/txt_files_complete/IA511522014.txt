                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge S P J Buchanan of the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 6th July 2015.

 2. The Appellant is a male citizen of Bangladesh born 30th  January  1989.
    He initially entered the United Kingdom on 6th January 2010 with  leave
    as a Tier 4 Student.  His leave was subsequently  extended  until  31st
    March 2014.

 3. Prior to the expiry of his leave  the  Appellant  applied  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student and his application was refused  on
    15th December 2014 under paragraph 245ZX(d) as the  Appellant  had  not
    been awarded the 10 points claimed for  maintenance.   The  reason  for
    refusal was that the bank  statement  submitted  by  the  Appellant  in
    support of his application, could not be verified  as  genuine  by  the
    Respondent.  No further reasoning for refusal was given.

 4. The appeal was decided on the papers at the request of  the  Appellant.
    The Respondent did not request an oral hearing.

 5. The findings of the FtT are contained in paragraph 6  of  the  decision
    which for ease of reference I set out below;
         "6.  In light of the contents of the  Appellant's  letter  received
             12th March 2015, the Appellant does not persuade me that as at
             the date of the hearing he satisfies the Immigration Rules  as
             regards maintenance or that the appeal ought  to  be  allowed.
             In my judgment, there are no grounds for concluding  that  the
             Respondent ought to award  points  for  maintenance  when  the
             Appellant states clearly and candidly that  the  bank  account
             relied upon in his application, and in the  appeal,  has  been
             closed, and that he has no money left in the account."

 6. The FtT therefore dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    He was not legally represented and prepared the  grounds  himself.   In
    summary he stated that he  had  provided  proof  that  the  funds  were
    available for 30 days prior  to  the  date  of  his  application.   The
    Appellant believed that the Immigration Rules stated that funds  should
    be available for 30 days prior to the application.   Therefore  because
    the required funds were available, the Appellant  considered  that  his
    appeal should have been allowed.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable.

 9. Following the grant of permission to appeal  the  Respondent  lodged  a
    response dated 13th October 2015 pursuant to Rule 24  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, contending that the FtT directed
    itself appropriately, and the FtT was entitled  to  take  into  account
    that the Appellant claimed to have "closed" the disputed account.

10. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. The Appellant was represented by Mr Kalam.  He submitted that  the  FtT
    had erred by considering the date of  hearing  as  being  the  relevant
    date, rather than the date of application.  Mr Kalam submitted that the
    burden of proof was on the Secretary of State to prove that a  document
    was not genuine.

12. Mrs Sreeraman relied upon the Rule 24 response and pointed out that the
    application had not been refused on the basis that  the  Appellant  had
    used deception, but the Respondent's case was that the bank  statements
    could not be relied upon as they could not be verified.

13. Mrs Sreeraman accepted that the FtT erred  in  paragraph  6  by  making
    reference to the date of hearing but submitted  that  this  was  not  a
    material  error.   Mrs  Sreeraman  referred  to  Appendix  C  paragraph
    1A(c)(i) and (ii) and contended that the Appellant needed to prove that
    the funds would be available for his use in studying and living in  the
    UK, and that the funds would remain available unless used  to  pay  for
    course fees and living costs.  Because the Appellant had stated in  his
    letter which was received on 12th March 2015, that he  had  closed  his
    bank account on 27th April 2014 because he needed  the  money  for  his
    maintenance in the UK, it was submitted that the  Appellant  could  not
    satisfy the Immigration Rules in relation  to  maintenance.   Therefore
    although the judge had erred, it was not a material error as the appeal
    could not have succeeded.

14. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

15. I find that the FtT materially erred in law for the following reasons.

16. The Respondent's decision simply stated that it had not  been  possible
    to verify the Appellant's bank statements, and gave no reason as to why
    verification had not been possible.

17. I find that the Respondent did not allege deception, and therefore  the
    burden of proof is on the Appellant, on a balance of probabilities,  to
    show that the documents he submitted could be relied upon.

18. The Appellant submitted an undated letter which was  received  on  12th
    March 2015 and which is referred to in paragraph 3 of the FtT decision.
     This is a letter that confirms that he closed his bank account on 27th
    April 2014.  The Appellant attached to his letter, a  letter  from  his
    bank dated 28th December 2014, confirming that the funds were available
    between 26th January 2014 and 26th April 2014.   The  purpose  of  this
    letter was to show that the earlier  bank  documents  could  be  relied
    upon.

19. The FtT stated in paragraph 4 that the relevant date for  "testing  the
    position is as at date of hearing."  This is incorrect.  This error was
    repeated in paragraph 6.  Appendix C paragraph  1A(a)  states  that  an
    applicant must have  the  funds  specified  in  the  relevant  part  of
    Appendix C at the date of application.

20. Sub-section (c) confirms that in the case of a Tier 4 Migrant the funds
    must be held for a consecutive 28 day period of time,  and  sub-section
    (h) confirms that the end of the 28 day period will  be  taken  as  the
    date of the closing balance on the specified  document  submitted,  and
    must be no earlier than 31 days before the date of application.

21. The FtT failed to assess whether the Appellant had the requisite  funds
    in his account at the date of application, and whether those funds  had
    been held for a consecutive 28 day  period,  and  whether  the  correct
    specified documents had been submitted.  The FtT, in my view, was wrong
    in law in paragraph 6 to state that the Appellant  had  not  discharged
    the burden of proof as at the date of hearing.

22. I do not accept the argument  made  by  Mrs  Sreeraman  that  paragraph
    1A(c)(i) and (ii) of Appendix C means that  the  error  is  immaterial.
    Those provisions specify that the funds should remain available  unless
    used to pay for course fees and  living  costs.   The  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies details confirms that the Appellant had paid his
    course fees for the first year in the sum of ï¿½2,500.   There  where  no
    other fees to be paid.  He was entitled to use the funds that had  been
    in his account for his maintenance.

23. For the above  reasons,  the  FtT  erred  in  law  by  considering  the
    circumstances at the date of  hearing,  rather  than  at  the  date  of
    application.  The decision is therefore  set  aside  with  no  findings
    preserved.

24. The decision needs to be re-made.  Having considered paragraph 7 of the
    Senior President's Practice Statements dated 25th September 2012, it is
    my view that the appeal should be remitted  to  the  FtT  to  be  heard
    afresh because of the nature and extent of  the  judicial  fact-finding
    which is necessary.

25. The Appellant initially requested that his appeal  before  the  FtT  be
    decided on the papers.  He has paid the appropriate fee for his  appeal
    to be decided on the papers, and therefore this appeal will once  again
    be decided by the FtT on the papers,  unless  the  Appellant  makes  an
    application  to  the  FtT  to  have  an  oral  hearing,  and  pays  the
    appropriate fee.

26. The appeal will be remitted to the Taylor House Hearing  Centre  to  be
    considered by an FtT judge other than Judge Buchanan.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that  it
is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

An anonymity order was made in the First-tier Tribunal.  It  was  not  clear
to me why such an order had been made.  Mr Kalam confirmed  that  there  was
no application for anonymity, and the  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity
order.
