For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  India  born  on  20th  July  1983.   He
    appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lucas  dated
    13th January 2016  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision of 16th June 2015 curtailing his leave under paragraph
    320(7B) and 321A(1).

2.   The judge found that paragraph 320(7B) was not applicable in this  case
    because there was no suggestion or assertion  that  the  Appellant  had
    used deception in relation to his spouse visa. The appeal was  only  in
    relation to a  significant  change  of  circumstances  under  paragraph
    321A(1).  The issue to be decided by the judge was whether his  English
    language certificate [TOEIC] was a false document.

3.   The Appellant arrived in the UK on 16th  February  2008  on  a  working
    holiday maker visa.  He then  obtained  a  Tier  4  Student  visa  from
    November 2009 to July 2012.  This was extended until 29th  March  2014.
    He was granted leave to remain as a spouse from 29th April  2014  until
    29th October 2016.  His leave was  curtailed  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant had applied for leave to remain as a student  relying  on  an
    invalid certificate in relation to an English language test  undertaken
    at the New College London on 20th February 2013.  The Appellant's leave
    was curtailed upon arrival in the UK on 21st December 2014.

4    The Appellant was  interviewed  on  arrival  and  stated  that  he  had
    attempted to obtain English language certificates  on  three  different
    occasions, twice with Pearson and once with TOEIC.  He had  passed  the
    Pearson tests, but stated that his scores were not high enough for Home
    Office requirements.  He stated that he had then passed his TOEIC  exam
    which he submitted to the Home Office. He was unable to state  when  he
    sat the test and stated that it was early last year.  He  had  paid  an
    agent in Harrow ï¿½180 and said that he sat the test himself. With regard
    to the Pearson tests the Appellant stated his speaking and writing were
    not up to the standard.  He also  added  that,  in  comparison  to  the
    Pearson test, the TOEIC standard was very low and he had  heard  people
    were paying for the test, although this was just a rumour.

5.   The Appellant appealed against the decision to dismiss  his  appeal  on
    the basis that the judge had applied the wrong burden and  standard  of
    proof and  that  he  had  failed  to  properly  assess  Article  8  and
    proportionality in accordance with the case of Chikwamba v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40. The Appellant's wife  was
    unable to return to India to join him and the judge failed to  properly
    conduct a balancing exercise.

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    on the ground that in the light of the case of SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT
    229 (IAC), and the fact that the judge had placed  the  burden  on  the
    Appellant to prove dishonesty, it was arguable that the judge had erred
    in law.

7.   In relation to Article 8 it was unclear  whether  permission  had  been
    granted, the judge stated: "In Chikwamba the appellant's partner  could
    not return to his country of origin because he was a refugee. The judge
    in  the  present  case  decided  that  there  was  no  reason  why  the
    [Appellant's] partner could not go to India and if she chose not to  do
    so, there was nothing to prevent the Appellant from  returning  to  his
    home country and making an  application  for  entry  clearance."  Since
    permission was not specifically refused in relation  to  Article  8,  I
    shall proceed on the basis that permission was granted on all  grounds.



8.   In the Rule 24 response,  the  Respondent  submitted  that  whilst  the
    judge may have  erred  for  not  placing  the  initial  burden  on  the
    Appellant, in the circumstances of this appeal, it was  submitted  that
    such an error was not material. In SM and Qadir the Tribunal found that
    the  Respondent's  generic  evidence,  combined   with   her   evidence
    particular  to  these  two  appellants,  sufficed  to   discharge   the
    evidential burden of proving that their  TOEIC  certificates  had  been
    procured by dishonesty. The  judge  relied  on  the  same  evidence  in
    relation to the Appellant's appeal and also: the Appellant's  responses
    in interview; a report from Operation Facade dated 5th  May  2015;  and
    the Appellant's oral evidence. Accordingly, it was submitted  that  the
    judge's finding, that there was sufficient evidence to  show  that  the
    [TOIEC] certificate supplied by the Appellant was bogus and false,  was
    one which was open to the judge on the evidence.

9.   In relation to Article  8,  the  Respondent  stated:  "the  grounds  of
    appeal do not cite why expecting an Appellant who has been found to  be
    deceptive  to  return  to  their  home  country  to  make  the  correct
    application for entry clearance be disproportionate, but rather  simply
    cite case law".


Submissions

10.  Mr Malik relied on his skeleton argument and submitted that  the  judge
    had misstated the burden of proof at paragraph 36. In cases  where  the
    Respondent was alleging the Appellant had produced  a  false  document,
    the burden was in  fact  on  the  Respondent  and  not  the  Appellant.
    Further, the Respondent's evidence of  deception  was  insufficient  to
    satisfy the legal burden and the judge had erred in law in placing  too
    much weight on the Respondent's generic evidence. The judge had  failed
    to take into account the Appellant's eight years' residence in  the  UK
    and his ability to give evidence in English. The report of  Dr  French,
    relied on by the Respondent in the Rule 24 response, was  not  in  fact
    before the judge and was therefore irrelevant.

11.  Mr Malik submitted that the judge's approach to Article 8  was  not  in
    accordance with Chikwamba. The Appellant's wife had given evidence that
    she was not fairly treated in India even if she went for a short period
    of time.

12.  Ms Fijiwala submitted that there was no  material  error  of  law.  She
    relied on paragraph 68 of SM and Qadir which states  "As  our  analysis
    and conclusions in the immediately preceding section made clear we have
    substantial  reservations  about  the  strength  and  quality  of   the
    Secretary of State's evidence, its shortcomings are  manifest.  On  the
    other hand, while bearing  in  mind  the  context  is  one  of  alleged
    deception, we must be mindful of  the  comparatively  modest  threshold
    which an evidential  burden  entails.  This  calls  for  an  evaluative
    assessment on the part of the Tribunal.  By an admittedly narrow margin
    we are satisfied that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  discharged  this
    burden. "

13.  The effect of this is that there is a burden, again an evidential  one,
    on the Appellant  of  raising  an  innocent  explanation.  Ms  Fijiwala
    submitted that the Respondent's evidence had discharged the  evidential
    burden and therefore the burden was on  the  Appellant  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation.  She relied on paragraphs 22 to 26  of  Secretary
    of State v Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 61.  The Court of Appeal had  agreed
    with the Upper Tribunal that the Respondent's evidence  was  sufficient
    and therefore the burden shifted to the  Appellant.  Accordingly,  even
    though the judge had initially  stated  that  the  burden  was  on  the
    Appellant, he had in fact applied the correct approach when it came  to
    his assessment of the evidence.

14.  The judge had set out the Appellant's evidence at paragraphs 31  to  38
    and, although he did not  expressly  state,  it  is  clear  from  those
    paragraphs that he found  that  the  Appellant's  explanation  was  not
    credible given that he could not explain when or where he took the test
    and was only able to describe the room that he was in. The  Appellant's
    explanation was insufficient to discharge the evidential burden and the
    judge was entitled to dismiss the  application  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and find that the  Appellant  had  obtained  the  certificate  by
    deception. The judge took into account that the  Appellant  had  passed
    two English tests in coming to this conclusion. The Appellant's ability
    to speak English was insufficient in the Pearson  tests  and  therefore
    was not relevant to the issue of deception.

15.  The judge had regard to Article 8 and conducted the balancing  exercise
    appropriately.    The   judge   found   that   the   interference   was
    proportionate.  The judge's finding that his wife  could  relocate  was
    open to him on the evidence, but in the  alternative  the  judge  found
    that the Appellant's wife, a British  citizen,  was  not  compelled  to
    leave and therefore that it  would  not  be  disproportionate  for  the
    Appellant to return to India and  re-apply  for  entry  clearance  from
    there. In this particular case the public interest weighed  heavily  in
    favour of removal given the Appellant's deception and  his  failure  to
    meet the Immigration Rules. The  Chikwamba  principle  did  not  apply.
    There were no children and the Appellant could not satisfy  the  Rules.
    Accordingly his removal was proportionate.

16.  In response, Mr Malik submitted that the judge had failed  to  consider
    that the Appellant had passed two English tests and had a good  command
    of English.  It was also irrelevant that the Appellant  had  not  taken
    action against the college. The Appellant's  wife  had  given  evidence
    that she financially supported her parents which the  judge  failed  to
    take into account in applying the Chikwamba principle.


Discussion and Conclusions

17.  I am not persuaded by Mr Malik's first ground that  the  judge  applied
    the wrong burden and standard of proof.  Although the judge stated,  at
    paragraph 36, that the burden of proof was on the  Appellant,  when  he
    considered the issue of deception he approached it on  the  basis  that
    the initial  burden  was  on  the  Respondent.  His  treatment  of  the
    Appellant's evidence is consistent with the approach in  SM  and  Qadir
    and in Shehzad.

18.  The judge considered the evidence produced by the  Respondent  and  was
    entitled to find that the evidential burden was discharged and that  it
    was for the Appellant to offer an explanation. Although not  stated  in
    those terms, it is clear from the judge's decision that he  finds  that
    there is sufficient evidence before him to show that the Appellant  did
    not sit his  English  language  test  and  therefore  it  was  for  the
    Appellant to show otherwise.  The  judge  took  into  account  all  the
    evidence: the Appellant's explanation in his  interview;  his  lack  of
    knowledge of the TOEIC test; and his failure to take any action against
    the college. He found it significant that the Appellant  did  not  know
    the name of the college or the date on  which  he  sat  the  test.  The
    judge's reasons and explanation for why he disbelieved the  Appellant's
    explanation was open to the judge on the evidence and these reasons are
    clearly set out.  There was no error of law in the judge's approach  to
    the assessment of the evidence in relation  to  whether  the  Appellant
    produced a false TOEIC English language certificate.

19.  The Appellant's knowledge of English  was  irrelevant  to  whether  the
    test  certificate  was  false.  It  is  clear  from   the   Appellant's
    explanation in his interview that his standard of English at  the  time
    he sat the Pearson tests was below that required.   The  fact  that  he
    answered questions in English at the appeal hearing was not relevant to
    whether he used deception in an  earlier  English  language  test.  The
    judge in any event took into account the two previous English languages
    tests with Pearson and was well aware that the Appellant spoke  English
    at the hearing. The judge clearly took these matters into  account  and
    no error of law arises in relation to that ground.

20.  The factual errors pointed out by Mr Malik were  not  relevant  to  the
    decision, these were merely typographical errors.  It is clear from the
    judge's findings at 36 onwards that there was no  misstatement  of  the
    facts such as to amount to an error of law.

21.  In relation to Article 8, the judge found that, although the  Appellant
    had established family and private life, the curtailment of  leave  was
    proportionate. The judge was entitled to take into account his  finding
    that the Appellant used deception in a previous application and such  a
    factor was in favour of the public interest.  The judge also considered
    the position of the Appellant's wife. She claimed that she  was  stared
    at and did not feel safe on her previous visit to India. The judge made
    sustainable findings that there were no significant difficulties to her
    returning to India with the Appellant.

22.  In the alternative, the judge found that  the  Appellant  could  return
    and obtain entry clearance. This was not a  case  where  the  Appellant
    satisfied all the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  save  for  a
    technical issue. The Appellant had used deception and could not satisfy
    the Immigration Rules. There was no reason why he could not  return  to
    India in order to re-apply to join his  wife.   There  was  nothing  in
    relation to his family or  private  life  which  would  render  such  a
    decision disproportionate.

23.  Accordingly, I find that there was no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision of 13th January 2016 and his findings were open to him on  the
    evidence before him. I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
