                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION and REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read as incorporating my decision on  error
    of law, dated 27 April and issued on 12 May  2020,  setting  aside  the
    decision of FtT Judge Gillespie, promulgated on 6 December  2019.   The
    FtT's decision stands only as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 2. The period set for further submissions on procedure has expired.

 3. In a submission dated and received on 26 May 2020, the appellant  again
    seeks a remit to the FtT.

 4. There is nothing on the file from the SSHD.

 5. As submitted for the appellant, the nature of this case is such that it
    is appropriate under section 12 of the 2007  Act,  and  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 6. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Gillespie.

 7. Submissions to the FtT should take account of TF &  MA  [2019]  SC  81,
    [2018] CSIH 58; PS (Christianity - risk)  Iran  CG  [2020]  UKUT  00046
    (IAC); and MH (review; slip rule; church witnesses)  Iran  [2020]  UKUT
    00125 (IAC).

 8. No anonymity order has been requested or made.

 9. The date of this determination is to be taken as the date  when  it  is
    sent to parties.
