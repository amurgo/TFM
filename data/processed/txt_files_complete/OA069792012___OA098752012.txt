For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. An anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal  and  there  has
    been no application before me by either party or by any third party  to
    discharge that order.  The anonymity  order  is  therefore  maintained.
    Such order is to remain in place unless or until this Tribunal, or  any
    other appropriate Court, directs otherwise. As such, no report of these
    proceedings shall directly, or  indirectly,  identify  the  appellants.
    Failure to comply with this order could amount to a contempt of  court.



 2. The appellants are both citizens of Jamaica.  The first appellant, born
    26 March 1981, is father to the second appellant, born  in  2007.   The
    first appellant applied for entry clearance to  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the husband of  a  person  present  and  settled  here,  KT,
    pursuant to  paragraph  281  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  second
    appellant applies pursuant to paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules as
    the child of a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom
    (although the ECO  wrongly  dealt  with  the  application  pursuant  to
    paragraph 301  of  the  Rules).   Both  applications  were  refused  in
    decisions made by an Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  1  March  2012.  In
    reality the second appellant's application  is  entirely  reliant  upon
    that of the first appellant.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the first  appellant's  application
    on both maintenance and accommodation grounds, pursuant  to  paragraphs
    281(iv) and (v) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    heard  the  appellants'  appeals  and  dismissed  them  in  a  combined
    determination promulgated on 31 July 2013.  It  settled  the  issue  of
    accommodation in the appellants' favour, concluding as it did  so  that
    the appellants would be  accommodated  in  a  residence  owned  by  the
    sponsor's sister.   As  to  the  issue  of  maintenance,  the  tribunal
    observed that the documentation before it lacked coherence and  clarity
    and that having considered it, along with the evidence of  the  sponsor
    and the sponsor's sister, it had not been demonstrated to  the  balance
    of probabilities that the sponsor's income  surpassed  the  appropriate
    threshold.  The tribunal also gave consideration to Article 8 ECHR  and
    concluded that any interference with the appellants' family life caused
    by the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer would  be  proportionate
    to the legitimate aim pursued.

Error of Law

 4. The appellants were granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    by way of a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Warren L. Grant dated
    9 September 2013, in the following terms:

         "1.  The appellants seek permission to appeal, in time,  against  a
             decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated  on  31  July
             2013 whereby he dismissed the appellants' appeals against  the
             decision of the Entry Clearance Officer - Kingston  to  refuse
             their applications for leave to  enter  the  UK  as  dependent
             spouse and child respectively of a person present and  settled
             in the United Kingdom.

         2.   The grounds of application assert that the First-tier Tribunal
             Judge misdirected himself when considering the adequacy of the
             funds available for the maintenance of the appellants  at  the
             date of the decision and as such disclosed an  arguable  error
             of law.  His consideration of Article 8 issues seems  confused
             and he does appear to have applied a  test  of  exceptionality
             when assessing proportionality.  All grounds are arguable."

 5. Thus the appeal came before me.

 6. At a hearing on 18 October 2013 Mr  Nath  agreed  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination contained an error of law in relation  to  its
    consideration of  the  maintenance  requirement  of  the  Rules.   More
    particularly, it was accepted that the First-tier Tribunal  had  failed
    to  make  material  findings  on  relevant  matters,   i.e.   (i)   the
    availability of third party support, (ii) the income of  the  appellant
    from student grants/loans.

 7. For these reasons it was agreed that the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal should be set aside  and  that  the  decision  under  the
    appeal should be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

 8. Unfortunately, as a consequence of the  chaotic  manner  in  which  the
    appellants  presented  the  documentary  evidence  to  the   First-tier
    Tribunal, which included over 200 pages of documentation which had  not
    been indexed or paginated, it proved impossible to proceed  immediately
    to remake the decision. In all the circumstances, with the agreement of
    the parties, I concluded that it was appropriate to adjourn the hearing
    of the appeal to a later date.

Remaking of Decision

 9. When the matter came back before me on 6 December 2013  the  appellants
    provided properly indexed and paginated bundles of evidence;  including
    evidence  that  had  been  before  the  First-tier   Tribunal   and   a
    supplementary bundle of evidence, which was admitted with  the  consent
    of Mr Nath.  Ms Heller had also provided a helpful skeleton argument.

10. The only issue left before the Upper Tribunal is that  of  maintenance,
    the ECO not having challenged the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    made in relation to the issue of accommodation. At the  outset  of  the
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal Mr Nath helpfully accepted  a  number
    of the matters set out by Ms Heller in her skeleton argument:

      a) The income support level for a couple and a  child  of  the  second
         appellant's age totalled �804.60 per month as of the  date  of  the
         Entry Clearance Officer's decision;

      b) The rent paid by the sponsor for her University  accommodation  was
         �673.97 per month;

      c) The sponsor had loan commitments of �194.88 per month;

      d) There were no costs for the appellant and sponsor  associated  with
         living  in  the  sponsor's  sister's  accommodation;  including  no
         requirement for them to pay rent  or  to  assist  with  payment  of
         council tax. This situation would not change after the  appellants'
         arrival in the United Kingdom;

      e) The sum  of  the  hypothetical  income  support  figure,  plus  the
         University rent and  the  sponsor's  loan  commitments  amounts  to
         �1,673.45 per month.

11. After hearing evidence  from  the  sponsor  Mr  Nath  also  agreed  the
    following matters:

      a) The sponsor  earned  �917.66  per  month  from  employment  at  the
         relevant time;

      b) She received a student  support  loan  equivalent  to  �291.42  per
         month, a grant  equivalent  to  �444.08  per  month  and  bursaries
         equivalent to �290.01 per month.

12. Although Mr Nath agreed  the  matters  identified  above,  he  did  not
    concede that the appellants met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules; asserting that  there  were  two  costs  not  reflected  in  the
    figures, which also required consideration. I shall take these in turn.



13. The first additional relevant cost identified by Mr Nath as not  having
    yet been taken into account is the cost of the sponsor's travel to  and
    from University; it being the case that the appellants and sponsor will
    live together with the sponsor's sister after  the  appellants  arrival
    here. At the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision the sponsor
    was living in University accommodation; however, it was  the  sponsor's
    intention, as  of  that  date,  to  live  with  her  sister  after  the
    appellants' arrival here.

14. The  sponsor  gave  evidence  that  she  was  required  to  attend  the
    University three days per week. Mr Nath did not seek to challenge  this
    evidence. Mr Nath identified the daily cost of travel by  reference  to
    figures in the sponsor's bank statements relating  to  dates  when  the
    sponsor had previously undertaken the journey to  and  from  University
    from her sister's house. The travel cost on these occasions was  �34.65
    per day. If one uses the figure of �34.65 as the daily travel rate, the
    cost of the sponsor's travel, if she were to  attend  University  three
    days per week, would be �450.45 per month.

15. It is important to recognise, however, that in  this  scenario,  as  Mr
    Nath accepted, the sponsor would not have to pay her University  rental
    costs of �673.97 per month because she would be permanently living with
    her sister and travelling to  the  University  as  and  when  required.
    Rather than adding to the sponsor's costs, travelling from her sister's
    accommodation to University, as opposed to renting accommodation at the
    University, reduces the sponsor's monthly expenditure by �223.52.

16. The second potential additional items of expenditure relied upon by  Mr
    Nath are the incidental costs associated with  the  sponsor's  studies,
    other than travel costs and those costs already taken into  account  in
    Ms Heller's calculations. The example identified by  Mr  Nath  was  the
    costs of books and materials. The sponsor gave  oral  evidence  to  the
    effect that she has no such incidental costs. As  to  the  purchase  of
    books and other materials, the sponsor stated that all  of  her  course
    materials are provided free via an online University portal, which  can
    be accessed from any  computer.  This  seems  to  me  to  be  perfectly
    plausible and credible evidence, particularly when  considered  in  the
    light of the sponsor's evidence in the round.

17. Given the matters accepted by Mr Nath,  and  my  findings  on  the  two
    potential  items  of  expenditure  upon  which  there  was  no  express
    agreement, it  is  plain  that  the  appellants  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the two relevant Immigration  Rules  by  a  substantial
    margin.   The  sponsor's  relevant  costs  for  the  purposes  of   the
    calculation of the maintenance requirement of the Immigration Rules are
    �1449.93 per month and her income, �1943.17 per month. She  would  also
    meet the maintenance requirement of the  Rules  even  if  she  were  to
    remain living in rented University accommodation.

18. Both of the appellants' appeals therefore fall to  be  allowed  on  the
    basis that the decisions made by the Entry Clearance  Officer  refusing
    entry clearance were not in accordance with the Immigration Rules.  The
    first appellant meets the requirements of paragraph 281  of  the  Rules
    and the second appellant the requirements of paragraph 297.

Decision

For the reasons given above the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is
set aside.

Upon remaking the decision, the appeals of both appellants  are  allowed  on
the basis that the decisions of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  were  not  in
accordance with the Immigration Rules.

Fee Award

Having allowed the appeals of both appellants, I make fees awards  in  their
favour. The respondent is to pay to the appellants  the  total  sum  of  the
fees occasioned by  them  when  lodging  their  appeals  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal.
