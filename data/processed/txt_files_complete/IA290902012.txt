For the Appellant:     Mr Karnik, Counsel instructed by Mellor & Jackson
Sols
For the Respondent:    Ms Johnstone,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He has  permission  to
       appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Levin
       to dismiss his appeal against directions for  his  removal  from
       the United Kingdom pursuant to section 10 of the Immigration and
       Asylum Act 1999. That decision to remove the Appellant  followed
       rejection of his application for indefinite leave to remain.






    2. The Appellant came to the UK on the 21st June 2006 in possession
       of a grant of entry clearance as a work permit  holder.  He  was
       granted leave to enter until the 25th July  2011.  On  the  21st
       July 2011 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on the basis
       that he had accumulated five years lawful residence in the UK as
       a work permit holder.

    3. The application was refused on  the  27th  September  2012.  The
       Respondent asserted that on the 27th June 2007 the UKBA received
       notification of the premature end of the Appellant's  employment
       from his employer and as  a  result  his  leave  to  remain  was
       curtailed with no right of appeal on the  23rd  July  2007.   He
       therefore had accumulated only 13 months  of  lawful  residence.
       The Appellant has resumed employment but this had ceased on  the
       3rd August 2011. He could not therefore claim to be paid "at  or
       above the appropriate rate for the job as stated in the Codes of
       Practice in Appendix J". The application was  therefore  refused
       with reference to paragraph 135 of the Immigration  Rules.   The
       Respondent then considered whether the Appellant had established
       any right to remain in the UK as a  result  of  his  private  or
       family life and concluded, with reference to paragraph 276ADE of
       the Rules, that he had not.

    4. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal came before Judge Levin in
       April 2013. In respect of the matter of curtailment Judge  Levin
       accepted that any decision to that effect had never been  served
       on the Appellant and so was not  lawful.   He  did  not  however
       accept that the  Appellant  had  been  continually  employed  as
       claimed. He found the Appellant to  be  evasive,  an  additional
       witness called on his behalf to be inconsistent and found in the
       documentary  evidence  before  him  a   discrepancy   which   he
       considered to be of great significance:

         "In support of his claim to have been  working  for  the  Al  Nawaz
         Restaurant for five years the Appellant relied  heavily  upon  P60s
         for the tax years 2006-2007, 2007-2008,  2008-2009,  2009-2010  and
         for the tax year ending 5th April 2011, and all of which record the
         Appellant was working for Elite Chain Limited trading as  Al  Nawaz
         Restaurant.  However  upon  each  of  those  five  form  P60s   the
         Appellant's  national  insurance  number  is  recorded   as   being
         SC899485B which is inconsistent with his national insurance  number
         SG899485B as recorded  in  the  two  witness  statements  of  Wendy
         Gilbart, and also upon the Appellant's wage  slips  from  Islamabad
         Restaurant Limited where his  national  insurance  number  is  also
         recorded as being SG899485B.  In such circumstances I find that the
         P60s are not reliable and I place no weight upon them as  proof  of
         the Appellant's employment..."

    5.  Judge  Levin  went  on  to  find,  at  paragraph  39   of   the
       determination, that the Appellant had used deception  in  making
       his claim to have been continuously employed  for  a  period  of
       five years.

    6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Kebede on the grounds  that  the  matter  of  the
       different NI numbers had never been put to the Appellant. At the
       first hearing of this matter in September 2013 Mr Harrison,  who
       appeared for the  Respondent,   accepted  that  to  be  so,  and
       conceded that this was prima facie an error of law.  It  was  of
       some  significance  because  the  P60s  were  otherwise   strong
       evidence that the Appellant had been employed as  claimed,  that
       could potentially outweigh the letters from Ms  Gilbart  of  the
       HMRC as well as the poor  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  his
       witness.  There may be an explanation  for  why  there  are  two
       different numbers, and this would go to the finding of deception
       as well as the question of whether the  Appellant  had  in  fact
       worked for the same employer all along.

    7. Mr Harrison was correct to concede that it is generally an error
       of law to introduce a point against a party without  that  party
       having any notice of it,  and  thus  denying  him  a  chance  to
       respond to that forensic challenge. In this case Judge Levin was
       the first  person  to  notice  the  discrepant  numbers.  Having
       declined to place any weight on the P60s for that  reason  alone
       he went on to find that the Appellant had sought to  deceive  by
       submitting his application in the way that  he  did.  Mr  Karnik
       submitted that this was  a  further  error.  He  submitted  that
       having gone on a frolic of its own the First-tier Tribunal  then
       compounded the  error  by  making  a  finding  of  deception  on
       insufficient  evidence  and  without  having   regard   to   the
       appropriate burden and standard of proof.  Mr Harrison agreed.

    8. Having heard those submissions I indicated that I remained to be
       satisfied that any error on the part of the First-tier  Tribunal
       was such that the decision should be set  aside.   Reluctant  to
       interfere with this carefully written and  reasoned  decision  I
       indicated that it would  only  be  set  aside  if  it  could  be
       established that some material  unfairness  had  arisen.    What
       could the Appellant, or Mr Holt who represented him  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal, have successfully done to  respond  to  the
       point about the different numbers? Mr Karnik submitted  that  Mr
       Holt could have done nothing else but apply for an  adjournment.
       The point had never been taken by the Respondent and  since  no-
       one else had noticed the discrepancy it was not  something  that
       the Appellant's representatives had  addressed.  Mr  Holt  would
       have asked for an adjournment to clarify  the  matter  with  the
       HMRC.  Mr Harrison agreed that in  the  circumstances,  such  an
       adjournment should have been granted.   Although it may not make
       a difference  to  the  overall  decision  in  the  end,  it  was
       pertinent to the finding of deception, which  would  have  long-
       term  consequences  for  the  Appellant.  Having   heard   these
       submissions I agreed to adjourn the 'error of law' hearing part-
       heard to enable those instructing Mr Karnik to make the relevant
       enquiries.   I did so, directing the Appellant's representatives
       to make such enquiries as necessary to clarify why the Appellant
       appears to have two NI numbers.

    9. It unfortunately took until the 17th March 2014 for  the  matter
       to be relisted before me, ready to proceed.     The  Appellant's
       representatives had by that date received a letter from the HMRC
       dated 21st November 2013 which confirmed that the Appellant's NI
       number is SG899485B and not SC899485B. Whilst the  HMRC  do  not
       comment on why that latter number might  have  appeared  on  the
       P60s, the letter does state that  they  are  unable  to  provide
       copies of his P60s since these  are  issued  by  employers.  The
       letter confirms that the  Appellant  has  been  paying  national
       insurance contributions  under the number SG899485B.  A  further
       letter dated 10th December 2013 reproduces HMRC records to  show
       that in 2010, 2011 and 2012 the Appellant was employed by 'Elite
       Chain Ltd' and  in  2012  and  2013  by  Elite  Chain,  Rusholme
       Restaurant and MCC Restaurant Ltd.

   10. I have looked again at the P60s in light of these  letters  from
       HMRC confirming that the  Appellant  has  been  paying  national
       insurance contributions and tax for four  years,  between  April
       2009 and April 2013. I note that the HMRC record of how much the
       Appellant earned in those years, and the amount of tax he  paid,
       does correspond to the amounts shown on the P60s.  For  instance
       in the year ending 5th April 2011 both HMRC records and the  P60
       produced at hearing show that the Appellant earned  �11,440  and
       paid tax of �992. Both identify his tax code  as  647L.    Given
       HMRC's indication that the P60s are prepared by the  employer  -
       and in this case the employer's accountant  -  it  seems  likely
       that the letter 'C' has wrongly been entered by that  accountant
       in place of the 'G' which  the  number  should  have  contained.
       Given the confirmation from HMRC that tax and NI  were  in  fact
       being paid I find it unlikely that there was in  this  case  any
       deliberate deception or forgery in  respect  of  the  P60s.    I
       further find it unlikely that Judge Levin would have found  this
       to be the case had he had sight of the information from HMRC.  I
       am therefore satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
       taking this point against the Appellant in this way. Had he been
       given the  opportunity  to  address  the  issue  he  could  have
       produced the HMRC evidence that I  now  have  before  me,  which
       shows that he was in fact employed and that he  was  paying  tax
       and national insurance contributions.   I  set  the  finding  of
       deception aside.

   11. There remains the substantive issue raised in  the  Respondent's
       refusal  letter,  whether  the  Appellant  had  in   fact   been
       continually in the same lawful employment for a period  of  five
       years between August 2006 and  August  2011.   As  Ms  Johnstone
       points out, the determination gives detailed reasons as  to  why
       it was not accepted that  the  Appellant  had  been  continually
       employed by the employer identified  on  his  work  permit,  'Al
       Nawaz Restaurant'.    The  grounds  of  appeal  challenge  those
       findings on the grounds that the Judge was wrong to have  placed
       no weight on the P60s all of which showed the Appellant to  have
       been employed by  "Elite  Chain  Limited  trading  as  Al  Nawaz
       Restaurant".   I have already found that the First-tier Tribunal
       erred in attaching no weight to those P60s on the  grounds  that
       the numbers were different  from  the  HMRC  records;  that  was
       because the Appellant had not been given a chance to  rebut  the
       suggestion that the P60s were  unreliable  or  forged.   However
       that fact does not resolve the matter in the Appellant's favour.
       That is because there were a number  of  other  issues  emerging
       from the evidence  which  made  it  less  than  clear  that  the
       Appellant had in fact been working for  the  same  employer  all
       along:

   a) The P60s produced for 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 do show  employment
      by Elite Chain trading as Al Nawaz but since HMRC hold no  record
      of tax being paid in those years  (contrary  to  the  information
      provided on those P60s) there  is  limited  weight  that  can  be
      attached to these documents. They may have been generated by  the
      Appellant's employer but since there was in fact no tax  actually
      paid in those years this gives rise to doubt that  the  Appellant
      was actually employed as claimed;

   b) In his oral evidence the Appellant had said that he had initially
      worked at Al Nawaz but then this operation  had  ceased  and  his
      employer had transferred him to the restaurant Bollywood  Masala.
      Asked how long he had actually been at Al Nawaz the Appellant was
      evasive and then said that he "could not remember" when he  moved
      restaurants. Judge Levin found that  this  failure   "to  give  a
      straight answer to this simple question" damaged his credibility;

   c) A witness called Mr Dongal had given evidence before Judge Levin.
      He claimed to have been the manager of Al  Nawaz.   His  evidence
      was that Al Nawaz had been the trading name of a  company  called
      Elite Chain Ltd which also owned Bollywood Masala. When the lease
      on Al Nawaz ceased they  closed  it  down  and  moved  the  whole
      operation, including the Appellant, to  Bollywood  Masala.  Judge
      Levin found this evidence to be contradicted by  the  Appellant's
      own contract of employment, which identified his employer as  'Al
      Nawaz trading as Sabina Enterprises' with  no  mention  of  Elite
      Chain Ltd;

   d) A further discrepancy arose from Mr Dongal's evidence in that  he
      also said that Bollywood Masala was  owned  first  by  a  company
      called Islamabad Restaurant Limited and then by  one  called  MCC
      Limited.   Judge Levin found that if  true,  this  dispelled  the
      argument that  the  Appellant  had  been  employed  by  the  same
      employer, since these were clearly different legal entities  from
      Elite Chain;

   e) Judge Levin rejected Mr Dongal's claim to have been  the  manager
      of Al Nawaz at all, since he could not say  when  it  had  closed
      down.

   12. The grounds of appeal  do  not  address  any  of  these  points;
       paragraph 7 erroneously suggests that  the  matter  of  the  two
       national insurance numbers was the sole reason for  the  Judge's
       adverse findings in this matter. That is clearly  not  so.  Even
       absent the finding of deception that I have set aside, the First-
       tier Tribunal gave cogent reasons  why  the  Appellant  had  not
       discharged the burden of proof. The  First-tier  Tribunal  found
       the evidence to fall short of establishing  that  the  Appellant
       had been employed  between  2006  and  2011  by  Al  Nawaz,  the
       employer named on his work permit. It has not  been  established
       that there was any error of law in these findings.


Decisions

   13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  only  in
       respect of the finding of deception.  The remaining findings are
       upheld.

   14. I  re-make  the  decision  on  deception  by  finding  that  the
       Respondent has not shown to  the  requisite  standard  that  the
       Appellant had any intention to deceive.
