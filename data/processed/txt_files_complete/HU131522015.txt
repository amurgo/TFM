                                                                  Respondent


Representative:
For the Appellant:     Ms D Friel, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bradshaw, promulgated on 19 January 2017, dismissing her appeal against
    refusal of leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The main point of the grounds of appeal to the UT  is  that  the  Judge
    erred in his consideration of whether it was reasonable to  expect  the
    appellant's three British children to leave the UK / EU.

 3. Permission was granted on the view that the grounds were  arguable,  in
    light of SF and others (Guidance, post 2014 Act) UKUT 00120 (IAC).

 4. SF and others was reported after the decision of the FtT, but it  turns
    on a guidance document which was in  force  at  the  time  of  the  FtT
    hearing.  Neither party drew it to the FtT's attention.

 5. The policy does not require a grant of leave in  the  circumstances  of
    this case, but it does require the case to be looked at on a  different
    basis.  Judge Bradshaw thought  the  decision  of  the  respondent  was
    proportionate because  it  left  open  the  reasonable  option  of  the
    appellant, her husband and their three children moving to  Pakistan  to
    carry on family life there (ï¿½78).  However, the  policy  concedes  that
    the effect of EU law is that such a case  must  be  approached  on  the
    assumption that it would be unreasonable  to  expect  the  children  to
    leave with their mother.

 6. It had to be  decided  whether  it  was  proportionate  to  expect  the
    appellant  to  leave,  due  to   her   adverse   immigration   history,
    notwithstanding that it would be unreasonable to  expect  the  children
    also to do so, because  they  could  remain  with  their  father.   The
    possibility of separation had to be justified.

 7. In the FtT, the evidence and submissions did not focus on  the  correct
    issue.

 8. That was through no fault on the part of Judge Bradshaw.    Judges  are
    expected to know and apply the law,  even  where  the  assistance  they
    should have from parties is lacking.   They  are  not  deemed  to  know
    policies of the SSHD which,  like  this  one,  are  separate  from  the
    immigration rules.

 9. Representatives, on both sides, were under a duty to bring  the  policy
    to the  Judge's  attention.   Failure  to  do  so  has  resulted  in  a
    procedural mishap.  The effect is so fundamental that the decision  has
    to be set aside.

10. Although neither party has yet applied to bring further  evidence,  the
    need to look at the case in a new  light  is  such  that  the  remaking
    should give them both the chance to do so.

11. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

12. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

13. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Bradshaw.

14. The FtT made an anonymity  direction.   Anonymity  has  been  preserved
    herein.
