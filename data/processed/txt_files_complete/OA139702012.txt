                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the  appellant  against  a  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision made on 28  June  2012  refusing  his  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse under the provisions of paras 320(7A) and 281  of
    HC 395.  Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on
    16 July 2013.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 10  August  1967.   On  9
    May 2012 he applied for entry clearance as a spouse to join his wife in
    the UK.  His application was refused under para 320(7A)  on  the  basis
    that he had made false representations  and  failed  to  declare  facts
    material to his application by stating at 1.3 of the  Visa  Application
    Form ("VAF") that he had never been known  by  any  other  names.   The
    respondent noted that the appellant had been issued with  a  six  month
    visit visa in April 2007 and had arrived in the UK on 27 May 2007.   On
    his own admission he stayed in the UK for four years, four months  then
    leaving using an emergency travel document issued by the Nigerian  High
    Commission.  On returning to Nigeria he had married his sponsor  on  28
    September 2011.  The respondent took  the  view  that  there  was  very
    little evidence of the relationship prior to the marriage  and  he  was
    not satisfied that the marriage was subsisting or that they intended to
    live together permanently as husband and wife.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  appellant's  wife,
    the sponsor, gave oral evidence and further  documentary  evidence  was
    produced by both the  appellant  and  the  respondent.   That  evidence
    included a charge sheet for offences committed by the appellant  on  22
    December 2010 of using a motor vehicle without  third  party  insurance
    and driving a vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence.  His
    name on the charge sheet is recorded as Isiah  Oludotuh  and  the  same
    name is on the  Notice  of  Fine  and  Collection  Order  from  Enfield
    Magistrates' Court dated 11  January  2011  following  the  appellant's
    appearance at court.

4.   It was argued on the appellant's behalf that he had not been  dishonest
    and that the failure to record his name accurately on  these  documents
    arose simply from a mistake by the police or the court in recording his
    name.

5.   The judge noted  that  on  the  VAF  in  answer  to  1.3  "other  names
    (including any other names you are known by and/or any other names that
    you have been known by)", the appellant placed a dash.  It  was  common
    ground that he had declared at 6.1 that he had travelled to the  UK  on
    27 May 2007 for a visit and overstayed for four years and  four  months
    and at 6.9 "whether he had any criminal convictions in any country", he
    had declared that on 22 December 2010,  for  an  offence  described  as
    driving offence, he was fined ï¿½350 and this had been paid.

6.   Having reviewed the evidence, the  judge  summarised  his  findings  as
    follows:

         "73. The Tribunal is therefore  satisfied  that,  through  evidence
             provided by the appellant's side, the respondent has to a high
             degree of probability proven that in the United  Kingdom  when
             encountering the UK police, and when surrendering his bail  to
             the appropriate Magistrates' Court  on  11  January  2011  the
             appellant was content to adopt  as  his  name  Isiah  Oludotuh
             instead of his name Oluseun Oludotun Isiah.


         74.  It has been said  that  the  appellant  had  nothing  to  hide
             because when obtaining his emergency travel document  he  used
             his correct date of birth and full names.  This he would  have
             to do because the State of Nigeria would likely  have  records
             of his being initially issued with a passport with  that  date
             of birth and with those names.


         75.  The Tribunal is satisfied that by inserting a dash  in  answer
             to section 1.3 of the Visa Application Form and  in  supplying
             details of his conviction later in the form the appellant  has
             sought to play the situation to his  advantage  thus  enabling
             him to plead, as he has subsequently done,  that  he  has  not
             been known to the police  or  to  the  courts  in  the  United
             Kingdom by a false name through any act or omission of his own
             but rather because of an error on the part of the police.


         76.  That argument does not hold water because of what the Tribunal
             is satisfied to a high degree of probability would have  taken
             place at the Magistrates' Court on the morning of  11  January
             two years ago.


         77.  Therefore the Tribunal finds that the respondent has  achieved
             the appropriate standard of proof  upon  this  issue  and  the
             appeal is dismissed under  para  320(7A)  of  the  Immigration
             Rules."


7.   When dealing with article 8 the judge made it clear that he found  that
    the appellant had been acting dishonestly.  The judge said:

         "98. The Tribunal is satisfied that not only was  the  appellant  a
             considerable overstayer at that time  but  that  when  he  was
             encountered by the police he sought to ensure  that  he  would
             not be  identified  as  an  overstayer  and  referred  to  the
             immigration authorities by either permitting the police to mis-
             record his name or by supplying an incorrect name to them from
             the outset.


         99.  To compound matters, and this is the most serious action taken
             by the appellant in the Tribunal's view,  when  attending  the
             appropriate Magistrates' Court on 11 January 2011 he  did  not
             seek to  inform  the  court  that  his  name  was  incorrectly
             recorded on the charge sheet.  In doing  so  the  Tribunal  is
             satisfied that he was acting wholly inappropriately.   He  had
             the duty of utmost good faith to the court when answering  the
             charge to inform the court of his  full  name.   Additionally,
             and although at the time he may not have had a driving licence
             for this was one of the charges  he  faced,  the  fine  notice
             reveals that one of the offences was  an  endorsable  offence.
             He therefore ought to have supplied the court of his full name
             and of the correct spelling of this so that  the  court  could
             notify the Driver  and  Vehicle  Licensing  Centre,  DVLC,  in
             Swansea of this so that if  at  any  time  in  the  future  he
             applied for a  licence  the  endorsement  could  take  effect.
             Furthermore, as the fine notice itself shows, he ought to have
             advised the court that  his  name  was  incorrectly  recorded.
             These are very serious matters against  the  appellant.   They
             add to the weight of the  respondent's  position  and  greatly
             diminish the appellant's position."


8.   The judge went on to consider in the alternative whether the  appellant
    had shown that he could meet the requirements of para 281 and  for  the
    reasons summarised in [79]-[81] he was satisfied that he  could.   When
    carrying out the balancing exercise required by article  8,  the  judge
    was  satisfied  that  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  was   neither
    disproportionate nor was it unreasonable for his wife  either  to  join
    him in Nigeria until a fresh application could be made or  for  her  to
    remain in the UK while he submitted such an application.

The Grounds and Submissions

9.   In the grounds it is argued that the judge erred in law  by  concluding
    that para 320(7A) applied to family applications for settlement,  erred
    by classifying what the appellant  had  done  as  falling  within  para
    320(7A), had been wrong to find that the appellant had used a different
    identity whilst in the UK, had erred in finding that the allegation was
    proved to a high standard, reached a finding of fact not properly  open
    to him and had failed to carry out the balancing exercise under article
    8 correctly.

10.  At the hearing before us Dr Corban crystallised  the  submissions  into
    an argument firstly that when carrying out the balancing exercise under
    article 8 the judge had failed to take into account the nature  of  the
    statement made when looked at in the  context  of  the  evidence  as  a
    whole, having accepted that the appellant and  sponsor's  marriage  was
    genuine and subsisting.  The appellant had disclosed in his application
    that he had overstayed and that he had  been  convicted  of  a  driving
    offence.  This was  not  a  case  where  he  had  adopted  a  different
    identity.  Secondly, he argued that there was no adequate basis for the
    judge's findings.  There had been no attempt to mislead so far  as  his
    address or date of  birth  was  concerned  and  the  finding  that  the
    appellant had deliberately given the wrong name simply flew in the face
    of the evidence.  He submitted that there was no evidence to support  a
    finding of dishonesty.  It was unreasonable to expect the appellant  to
    make a fresh application in these circumstances.

11.  Ms Kiss submitted that the judge  had  prepared  a  carefully  reasoned
    determination.  The submissions made on the appellant's behalf had been
    rejected including the assertion that it was the police who had made  a
    mistake about the appellant's name.  The judge made  specific  findings
    to the contrary.  These were properly open to him for  the  reasons  he
    gave.  When considering article 8 the  judge  considered  all  relevant
    matters and reached a conclusion properly open to him.  He was entitled
    to take into account his finding that the appellant had used  deception
    when stopped by the police for the specific purpose of trying to ensure
    that he was not identified as an overstayer  and  had  noted  that  the
    appellant's wife, whilst a long-established resident  in  the  UK,  was
    originally from Nigeria and had returned there to marry  the  appellant
    and spend time with him [102].

Discussion

12.  The issue for us is to consider whether the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    erred in law in such a way that requires his decision to be set  aside.
    Dr Corban  did  not  pursue  the  argument  in  the  grounds  that  the
    provisions of para 320(7A) did not apply  to  family  applications  for
    settlement.  There is no substance in this  ground.   His  argument  in
    respect of the decision was that there  was  no  adequate  evidence  to
    support the judge's findings  that  the  appellant  had  made  a  false
    representation in support of his application.  It is correct  that  the
    appellant disclosed that he had overstayed following his previous visit
    and that he had been convicted of driving offences.  However he  put  a
    dash at 1.3 when asked to disclose whether he had any  other  names  he
    was known by or had been known by.   It  is  clear  that  when  he  was
    stopped for a driving offence  in  December  2010  his  name  had  been
    recorded as Isiah Oludotuh both on the charge sheet and on  the  notice
    of fine issued by the Magistrates' Court.

13.  The appellant's full name is Oluseun Oludotun Isiah.  The  misrecording
    of his name was to give a family name as a given name and to  use  only
    one of his given names and then with a different spelling.  It was  for
    the judge to decide as a question of fact whether  this  was  simply  a
    mistake or whether a different name was given deliberately.  The  judge
    considered this issue with care and we are satisfied that he reached  a
    finding of fact properly open to him on the evidence.  It was  open  to
    him to make the point that the  appellant  would  have  been  asked  to
    confirm his identity  at  the  Magistrates'  Court  and  he  must  have
    accepted the name as on  the  charge  sheet:  see  [68].   Dr  Corban's
    submissions to us,  whilst  attractively  put,  were  in  substance  an
    attempt to re-argue issues of  fact  where  the  judge's  decision  was
    properly open to him for the reasons he gave.

14.  It was also argued that in the light of the judge's findings  that  the
    marriage was genuine that the judge had  erred  in  his  assessment  of
    proportionality under article 8.  The judge did take into account as  a
    factor in the appellant's favour that he and his wife were married  and
    that they intended to live permanently with each  other.   However,  he
    was entitled to balance that with the fact not only that the  appellant
    had been a long-term overstayer but when encountered by the police  had
    sought to  ensure  that  he  would  not  be  so  identified  by  either
    permitting the  police  to  misrecord  his  name  or  by  supplying  an
    incorrect name to them from the outset.  The judge also referred to and
    was entitled to take into account that the appellant must  have  misled
    the Magistrates.  The  judge  took  into  account  the  impact  of  his
    decision on the  appellant's  wife  but  was  entitled  to  note  that,
    although she was  a  long-established  resident  in  the  UK,  she  had
    returned to Nigeria for the marriage and to see the appellant.  We  are
    satisfied that the judge's assessment of proportionality  was  properly
    open to him for the reasons he gave.  In summary, we are not  satisfied
    that the judge erred in law.



Decision

15.  The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and its decision stands.
