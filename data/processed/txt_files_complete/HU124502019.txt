                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 29  November  2019  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge G D Davidson which  refused  the  appellant's
    Article 8 ECHR appeal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan and  was  born  on  2  December
    1982.

 3. The appellant came to the UK as  a  student  on  31  January  2010.  He
    obtained further leave until 26 June 2016. He applied for  leave  as  a
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur on 27 May 2016. That application was refused on  13
    September  2017.  An  administrative  review  dated  24  October   2017
    maintained  that  refusal.  A  judicial  review  of  the  refusal   and
    administrative review decision was unsuccessful.

 4. On 9 November 2017 the appellant made a Tier 1 Entrepreneur application
    which was varied to a human rights application on 10 January 2019. That
    application was refused on 8 July 2019, that refusal leading  to  these
    proceedings.

 5. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal  on  19  November  2019.
    Prior to the hearing an application for an adjournment was made  on  11
    November  2019  on  the  basis  of  the  appellant's  ill-health.   The
    adjournment request was refused. It was renewed on 15 November 2019 but
    again refused. A further adjournment request made on 18  November  2019
    was also refused. On the day of the hearing, neither the appellant  nor
    his legal advisers attended; see paragraphs 4 to 8 of the decision.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal considered whether to proceed in  paragraphs  9
    to 12 of the decision. He referred to the case of Nwaigwe (adjournment:
    fairness) [2014] UKUT 000418 (IAC). The judge set out the head note  of
    the case which states:

         "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
         decision could, in  principle,  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to  apply  the
         correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  affected
         party of his right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal
         is challenged on fairness grounds, it  is  important  to  recognise
         that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  whether  the  FtT
         acted reasonably.  Rather, the  test  to  be  applied  is  that  of
         fairness:  was there any deprivation of the affected party's  right
         to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284."


 7. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that there was  insufficient  medical
    evidence to warrant an adjournment; see paragraph  12.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal proceeded to dismiss the appeal.

 8. The appellant appealed and was granted permission to  appeal  by  Upper
    Tribunal Grubb on 30 June 2020. With the renewed grounds of appeal  the
    appellant provided evidence that he had texted his legal advisers on 18
    November 2019 stating that he was in  Rotherham  General  Hospital.  He
    provided a letter from Rotherham General Hospital stating that  he  was
    in A & E on 18 November 2019 and 19 November 2019 and was  experiencing
    chest  pain  and  that  he  was  x-rayed.  The  appellant  provided   a
    prescription issued by Rotherham General Hospital on 19 November  2019.
    The Tribunal already had documents from Sky Solicitors enclosing  a  GP
    letter dated 7 November 2019 stating the appellant had  been  diagnosed
    with depression and exhibited suicidal ideation and had been advised to
    seek counselling and prescribed anti-depressants and that as  a  result
    they had not been able to take instructions from the appellant for  the
    hearing.

 9. Before me, the respondent conceded that, albeit the First-tier Tribunal
    judge may have taken a reasonable approach to what was before her,  the
    additional medical evidence provided with the  grounds  of  appeal  was
    sufficient to show that there was  a  deprivation  of  the  appellant's
    right to a fair hearing;  Nwaigwe  applied.  The  respondent  therefore
    conceded that procedural error was shown and that the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal should be set aside to be re-made.

10. The Tribunal found the respondent's approach to be a rational  one  and
    therefore sets aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    procedural error. The parties and the Tribunal were in  agreement  that
    the correct disposal where no valid hearing  had  taken  place  was  to
    remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made de novo.

Notice of Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside to be remade.

12. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  re-made  de
    novo.
