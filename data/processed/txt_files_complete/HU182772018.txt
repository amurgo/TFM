For the Appellant:     Mr M Rana of Counsel, instructed by Malik Legal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Davies promulgated on 7 December 2018, in which the
    Appellant's appeal against the decision  to  refuse  his  human  rights
    claim in the context of deportation dated 29 March 2018 was  dismissed.



 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan who entered the United  Kingdom
    in 2007 as the spouse of a person present and  settled  here.   He  was
    given leave to remain as such on two occasions and subsequently granted
    indefinite leave to remain on the same basis on 24 February  2011.   On
    18 March 2016, the Appellant was convicted of causing  grievous  bodily
    harm and sentenced to 6ï¿½ years' imprisonment.  The  Appellant  made  no
    specific submissions to the Respondent in response to the  notification
    of intention to deport him, but did  tell  a  prison  officer  that  he
    wanted to stay with  his  British  wife  and  children  in  the  United
    Kingdom, the children being aged four and seven.

 3. The Respondent refused the application the basis that the Appellant had
    given no evidence or  details  in  relation  to  his  family  life,  in
    particular, he had not specified the date of birth of his children  and
    there was no evidence of their nationality or to establish any  genuine
    and subsisting family relationships.  On the basis of  the  information
    that was available, the Respondent found that it would  not  be  unduly
    harsh on the Appellant's family to remain in the United Kingdom without
    him or to relocate with him  to  Pakistan  if  he  was  deported.   The
    relationship between the Appellant and his wife was accepted  based  on
    his previous immigration history and grants of leave to remain on  this
    basis,  but  it  was  noted  that  there  was  no  evidence  that   the
    relationship  was  subsisting.   The   private   life   exceptions   to
    deportation had  not  been  met  and  there  were  no  very  compelling
    circumstances.

 4. Judge Davies dismissed the  appeal  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  7
    December 2018, having conducted an assessment only under Article  8  of
    the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  and  finding   that   the
    Appellant's removal would not amount to a disproportionate interference
    with the right  to  respect  for  his  private  and  family  life.   In
    particular, the Appellant's claimed relationships  with  his  wife  and
    children were not accepted and  there  was  a  finding  of  a  lack  of
    credible evidence in support of his claim.

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals on ten grounds, for which permission was  granted
    generally, albeit with comments as to the lack of merit in  ground  one
    in particular.  The grounds are as follows.  First, that the failure of
    the First-tier Tribunal to grant an  adjournment  of  the  hearing  was
    unfair and amounted to an error of law.  The second to fifth grounds of
    appeal are concerned with the finding that there  was  no  family  life
    between the appellant and his wife and children; which is challenged on
    the basis that the First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to consider the
    evidence before it of phone contact and visits to the  appellant  while
    he was in prison, a failure to give adequate reasons  for  the  finding
    that there was no relationship and overall an error of law  that  there
    was no family life, particularly given that there was evidence  of  the
    Appellant's biological minor children.  The sixth ground of  appeal  is
    that the First-tier Tribunal failed to consider  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's wife that  she  had  been  struggling  to  care  for  their
    children while the Appellant was in  prison.   The  seventh  ground  of
    appeal is that the First-tier Tribunal misunderstood the oral  evidence
    given about the  Appellant's  criminal  offence,  the  misunderstanding
    being referred to was that the Appellant thought that  the  victim  was
    having an affair with his wife, which is not a  misunderstanding  which
    goes to the issue of remorse.  The eighth ground of appeal is that  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to give adequate reasons for dismissing  the
    appeal.  The ninth ground of appeal is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to apply the relevant provisions in paragraph 398 and  following
    of the Immigration Rules and the provisions in sections 117A  to  D  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The final ground  of
    appeal is that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  consider  the  best
    interests of the children  pursuant  to  section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

 6. At the oral hearing, Mr Rana relied on the grounds of appeal set out in
    writing, expanding upon those and the materiality or otherwise  of  the
    errors identified.  I had  indicated  at  the  oral  hearing  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal in this case was particularly  poor
    and that the focus should be on  whether  the  errors  identified  were
    material.

 7. As to the  first  ground  of  challenge,  Mr  Rana  accepted  that  the
    Appellant's request for  an  adjournment  of  the  hearing  made  on  8
    November 2018 was  refused  twice  on  the  papers  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and had not been renewed orally  before  Judge  Davies,  which
    caused him some difficulty with reliance on this ground.   However,  he
    suggested that in any event the Judge should have considered of his own
    motion whether an adjournment was required and granted one, even though
    not requested by either party.  This should have been on the  basis  of
    the paucity of evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and despite  the
    Appellant's solicitors expressly confirming to the First-tier  Tribunal
    the day before the hearing that they were ready  to  proceed.   It  was
    submitted that this point becomes important given the consideration  of
    materiality in light of the  limited  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 8. It is not necessary to rehearse the further  submissions  made  on  the
    remaining nine grounds of appeal, all of which have  significant  merit
    in identifying failings and errors of law in the First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.  As to whether any or all of these errors  are  material,  Mr
    Rana submitted that they  were  because  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    failed at the required starting point to consider the appeals on  human
    rights grounds in the finding that there was  no  family  life  and  in
    failing to make any assessment of the best interests of the children.

 9. In light of the applicable test in an appeal of this  sort,  where  the
    Appellant has been sentenced to a term of  imprisonment  of  more  than
    four years, that he would need to show very compelling circumstances to
    outweigh the significant public interest in his deportation pursuant to
    paragraph 398(c) of the Immigration Rules and/or section 117C(6) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, I asked Mr Rana  on  what
    factual basis the Appellant's appeal could have  been  allowed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He submitted that there was evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal of an adverse impact on the  appellant's  wife  and
    children  during  his  incarceration  which  could  be  sufficient   to
    establish very compelling circumstances.  It was  accepted  that  there
    was only  very  limited  documentary  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and no  note  had  been  provided  of  any  oral  evidence  to
    supplement the same.  At its highest, the only evidence that  could  be
    identified as  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this  regard  was
    contained in one sentence of the Appellant's wife's  written  statement
    which said, "I believe my children need a father and I  have  struggled
    enough in his absence and I want him to  share  the  responsibility  of
    parenthood.".

10. On behalf of the  Respondent,  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  there  was
    absolutely no merit  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  in  relation  to  an
    adjournment  and  as  to  the  other  grounds  of  appeal,  the  errors
    identified were not material.  It was accepted that the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal was not a good one, however it did to deal with the
    issues under Article 8 on the basis of the evidence before it.

11. In relation to whether there were  any  very  compelling  circumstances
    identified by the Appellant before  the  First-tier  tribunal,  it  was
    submitted that there were none.  This is a  high  threshold  which  the
    Appellant could not possibly meet on the evidence which was  incredibly
    limited.  The Appellant had not sought to obtain any statement from his
    representative at the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  as  to  the  oral
    evidence or anything further submitted as to whether  there  were  very
    compelling circumstances to outweigh the public interest in deportation
    and no application had been made under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to rely on any  further  evidence
    support of the Appellant's claim.

Findings and reasons

 1. As I indicated at the oral hearing and was accepted  by  both  parties,
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in this appeal was particularly
    poor and with the exception of the ground of appeal in relation  to  an
    adjournment which I deal with below, all of the grounds of appeal  have
    significant merit and identify errors of  law  in  the  decision.   The
    First-tier Tribunal failed to have any regard to or apply the  relevant
    provisions in the Immigration Rules for deportation nor the  compulsory
    factors for a Tribunal to take into account set out in  section  117A-D
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   There  are  no
    proper findings of fact in relation to the  Appellant's  family,  there
    was a failure to properly take into account even the  limited  evidence
    that was before the Tribunal in this regard and no assessment was  made
    of the best interests of the children.  This is a  case  in  which  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is so poor  and  contains  so  many
    errors of law, it would normally be necessary for it to  be  set  aside
    and the decision remade.  However, I decline to do so on the particular
    facts of this appeal because given  the  extreme  paucity  of  evidence
    relied  upon  by  the  Appellant,  none  of  the  errors,  even   taken
    cumulatively, are in fact material to the outcome of the appeal  as  on
    no legitimate view could the Appellant have succeeded on  human  rights
    grounds to resist his deportation from the United Kingdom.

 2.  As  set  out  above,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  398(c)  of  the
    Immigration Rules and section 117C(6) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, for a person who has been sentenced to a period of
    imprisonment of at least  four  years,  the  public  interest  requires
    deportation unless there are very compelling  circumstances,  over  and
    above  the  two  express  exceptions  to  deportation.   Even  if   the
    Appellant's claim was taken at its absolute  highest,  there  being  an
    accepted  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  his  wife   and
    children, all of whom are British Citizens and on the basis that it was
    in the best interests of the children to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    with the Appellant, there is nothing in the evidence  to  suggest  even
    that the unduly harsh test would be met in this case,  let  alone  that
    there are anything  which  could  legitimately  be  described  as  very
    compelling circumstances.

 3. The evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  consisted  of  two  short
    written statements from the Appellant and his wife,  neither  exceeding
    two pages and neither containing  any  specific  details  as  to  their
    relationship or in relation  to  the  children;  copies  of  the  birth
    certificates for the Appellant's children and  the  identity  pages  of
    their passports.  The record of proceedings shows  that  there  was  no
    detailed oral evidence given by either the Appellant  or  his  wife  in
    relation to the children either, nor as to the impact of deportation on
    any members of the family.  The evidence from a single sentence in  the
    Appellant's wife's statement that she struggled while the Appellant was
    in prison contains no detail whatsoever can not establish any basis  on
    which the Appellant's claim could even arguably meet the high threshold
    and there was simply nothing else in  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, nor has any  further  evidence  been  filed  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal under rule 15(2A) or otherwise.

 4. In these circumstances, on no legitimate basis  could  the  Appellant's
    appeal have been allowed as the evidence fell so far short of the  high
    threshold applicable to him  to  resist  deportation  on  human  rights
    grounds.  For these reasons, although the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is woefully inadequate and contains numerous  errors  of  law,
    none of them are material to the outcome of the appeal.

 5. Finally, there is no error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's  failure
    to adjourn the appeal proceedings before it.  Although  an  application
    had been made for an adjournment on 8 November 2018, it was refused  on
    the papers on two separate occasions  and  not  renewed  orally  before
    Judge Davies.  The  Appellant's  legal  representatives  had  expressly
    confirmed to the Tribunal the day before the  hearing  that  they  were
    ready to proceed.  At the oral hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    there was absolutely nothing before  the  Judge  to  suggest  that  the
    hearing could not fairly proceed nor any basis  upon  which  he  should
    have considered whether to adjourn the hearing of his own motion.  Even
    if an application for an adjournment had been renewed on the day of the
    oral hearing in the terms that it was made on the papers, I  would  not
    have found that it would be an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal
    to have refused it, given the lack of any  substantive  details  as  to
    what further evidence was being sought, from whom and when it would  be
    available.

 6. For all of these reasons, there are no material errors of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal stands.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
