                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  FtT Judge McGavin dismissed her
    appeal by a decision promulgated on 4 September 2018.  The FtT and  the
    UT refused permission to appeal.

 2. The appellant petitioned the Court of Session for reduction of the UT's
    refusal of permission.

 3. On 15 October 2019, the Vice President of the UT granted permission, in
    light of the parties' joint minute and of the Court's interlocutor.

 4. The joint minute agrees that the UT erred in law by proceeding  on  the
    basis that the FtT deal fully and adequately  with  an  expert  report,
    where at least some aspects of that report were not affected by earlier
    adverse findings on credibility, and had not been addressed by the FtT.

 5. Mr Winter and Mr Clark agreed  that  further  procedure  should  be  as
    follows.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  The nature of the case is such  that  it
    is appropriate under section 12 of the 2007  Act,  and  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.   The
    member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case  are  not  to  include
    Judge McGavin.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
