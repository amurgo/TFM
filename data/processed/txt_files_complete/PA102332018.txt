                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION made)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Fitzsimonds, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker, Home Office presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By my decision promulgated on 15 March 2019 I set aside the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I now remake that decision.

 2. The argument advanced by Ms Fitzsimmons is that there is a real risk
    that the appellant's removal from the UK would breach the UK's
    obligations under either the Refugee Convention or the Qualification
    Directive because of the risk he would face on return to Kabul as a
    Hazara with mental health problems.

 3. Ms Fitzsimmons relied on a substantial body of recent objective
    evidence concerning the circumstances faced by civilians in general,
    and Hazaras in particular, in Afghanistan.  This included, amongst
    other things, reports from a country expert Tim Foxley dated 17
    September 2018 and 8 April 2019, a UNHCR report on Afghanistan dated 30
    August 2018, a Country Policy Information Note concerning Hazaras in
    Afghanistan dated August 2018, a UNAMA annual report on Afghanistan
    dated February 2019 and an EASO country guidance on Afghanistan dated
    June 2018.  She also relied on a medico-legal report prepared by Dr
    Burman-Roy dated 10 April 2019 which described the appellant as
    suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

 4. It is not necessary for me to consider the evidence adduced by the
    appellant because Mr Walker, after hearing Ms Fitzsimonds make her
    submissions, accepted that there was sufficient evidence to show that
    the appellant, because of his particular circumstances, would be at
    risk of serious harm in Afghanistan.  Given this concession by Mr
    Walker - and that the submissions of Ms Fitzsimonds were not opposed
    -the appellant's protection claim is allowed.

 5. I have made an anonymity order in this matter.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This direction
applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
