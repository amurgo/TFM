Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Hashmi, Mamoon Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, an Indian national, entered the United  Kingdom  legally
    in September 2007 with leave to remain  as  a  student.  His  leave  to
    remain was then  extended  on  a  number  of  occasions,  in  different
    capacities. On 16 June 2016 he made in time, an application for a grant
    of indefinite leave to remain on the grounds  of  his  long  residency.
    This was refused on 31 October 2017 with reference to paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules. In short, the Respondent was  satisfied  that
    the Appellant had declared significantly different earnings figures  in
    the course of previous applications for leave to remain, to those which
    had been declared to HMRC from time to time for the same  periods  when
    declaring his income for taxation purposes.
 2. The Appellant's Article 8 appeal against that decision was heard on  21
    March 2018, and it was dismissed by First Tier Tribunal  Judge  Gumsley
    in a decision promulgated on 28 March 2018.
 3. It was not in dispute before  Judge  Gumsley  that  the  Appellant  had
    declared to both the Respondent and to HMRC  that  he  had  enjoyed  an
    income in both the tax years 2010/11, and 2012/3, as both an  employee,
    and as a self employed person. Nor  was  it  in  dispute  that  he  had
    declared to the Respondent and to HMRC substantially different  figures
    by way of taxable income for the same tax year; thus a  discrepancy  of
    �37,704.92 for the tax year 2010/11, and a  discrepancy  of  �32,501.43
    for the tax year 2012/3.
 4. Judge Gumsley concluded that the Respondent had  established  that  the
    Appellant had deliberately acted dishonestly, and gave reasons for that
    conclusion. Thus, although  the  Appellant  had  established  that  his
    "private life" in the  UK  was  sufficient  to  engage  Article  8,  he
    concluded that this private life had been established at  a  time  when
    his presence in the UK was lawful but precarious; Rhuppiah [2018]  UKSC
    58. He concluded that there was an  enhanced  public  interest  in  the
    Appellant's removal as a result of his dishonesty, and the decision  to
    refuse  his  application  for  indefinite  leave  to   remain   was   a
    proportionate response by the Respondent. The Appellant could return to
    live in safety in India, where his wife and his  immediate  family  had
    always lived, and build  on  his  relationships  with  them.  With  the
    benefit of the education and work experience he had gained in the UK he
    could anticipate good prospects for his future employment, and  earning
    capacity in India.
 5. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by decision of  24  July
    2018 of First tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bird  because  it  was  considered
    arguable that since HMRC had imposed no penalty upon the Appellant  the
    Judge's decision was not open to him, and/or was inadequately reasoned.
 6. No Rule 24  Notice  has  been  lodged  in  response  to  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal. Neither party has applied pursuant to Rule 15(2A)
    for permission to rely upon further  evidence.  Thus  the  matter  came
    before me.


The hearing
 7. Ms Hashmi provided a skeleton argument to support  the  grounds,  which
    made no reference to the decision of Spencer  J  in  R  (Khan)  v  SSHD
    (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384, promulgated
    on 3 May 2018.  When  I  drew  that  decision  to  her  attention,  and
    volunteered to stand the appeal down the list in order to give her time
    to read it, she declined the offer on the basis that she had  read  it,
    and did not need a further opportunity to do so.


The Appellant's challenge
 8. Ms Hashmi, who appeared below, and who drafted the grounds, took  three
    points in the grounds;
First, that although no such application was made by her on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, it was incumbent upon the Judge to adjourn the  hearing  and
    to require the Respondent to provide further documents in  evidence  to
    disprove the Appellant's evidence [#5].
Second, that the Respondent failed to discharge the  burden  of  proof  that
    lay upon him to prove the Appellant's dishonesty, and indeed the  Judge
    had effectively reversed the burden of  proof  so  as  to  require  the
    Appellant to prove his innocence [#5].
Third, that there was no evidence before the Judge that would permit him  to
    find that the Appellant's explanation of innocence was untrue [#4].
 9. Although the grounds did not  take  the  point,  Ms  Hashmi's  skeleton
    argument argued that the Judge  had  failed  to  heed,  and  apply  the
    content of the relevant IDIs (published January 2018) insofar  as  they
    gave guidance upon the application of paragraph 322(5).  That  guidance
    noted expressly however that conviction of a criminal offence  was  not
    necessary for the application of paragraph 322(5), and advised that the
    key consideration for the decision maker was whether reliable  evidence
    existed to support  the  conclusion  that  the  individual's  behaviour
    called into question their character and conduct to the extent that  it
    was undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK. This element of  the
    skeleton argument was not pursued in  oral  submissions,  was  not  the
    subject of a grant of permission, and in any event in my judgement  had
    no merit in the light of Khan.
10. Ms Hashmi's closing oral argument was to accept that the Appellant  had
    been negligent in his handling of his  personal  tax  affairs,  but  to
    argue that there was no documentary evidence that pointed directly  and
    conclusively to deliberate dishonesty on his part. In  common  parlance
    there was no "smoking  gun".  Thus  she  argued  in  reliance  upon  AA
    (Nigeria) [2009] EWCA Civ 773 that  mere  negligence,  or  an  innocent
    mistake, was not to be equated with dishonesty, and asserted  that  the
    Judge had done precisely that. However when pressed she was  unable  to
    identify to me any passage within the Judge's decision  that  supported
    that contention. Again this was an argument without merit.


Decision
11. There is no merit in the first complaint advanced in the  grounds,  and
    indeed Ms Hashmi did not seek to advance it before me. I  need  say  no
    more about it. In my judgement the other  complaints  can  properly  be
    taken together.
12. The Appellant is neither na�ve, nor uneducated. As an engineer  it  can
    properly be inferred that he is more than averagely numerate. He  would
    of course know in broad terms what he earned gross as a  self  employed
    man from month to month, and from year to year. Indeed  it  was  always
    his obligation to keep proper records of his income and expenditure  in
    the course of that  self-employment,  and  thus  maintain  and  prepare
    accounts which would accurately  disclose  the  profits  of  that  self
    employment. Equally he would receive from  his  employer  payslips  and
    P60s, that would record accurately both what he earned gross,  and  net
    of tax deductions, as an employed man from month to month, and from tax
    year to tax year, and thus he would always know what  his  income  from
    employment was.
13. As I understand it, there was no dispute about any of that  before  the
    Judge, and no suggestion by the Appellant that either the  payslips  or
    P60s that he had received from time  to  time  in  the  course  of  his
    employment were inaccurate in their recording of  his  earnings  as  an
    employed man, and the deductions that had been made from  them  by  his
    employer.
14. It was also not in dispute that the Appellant had declared to both  the
    Respondent and to HMRC that he had enjoyed an income in  both  the  tax
    years 2010/11, and 2012/3, as both an employee, and, as a self employed
    person. (The claim that was made in the Appellant's  witness  statement
    [ApB p13 #3] was inconsistent with the concession made on his behalf by
    Ms Hashmi before Judge Gumsley that he had declared to  the  Respondent
    and to HMRC substantially different figures by way  of  taxable  income
    for the same tax year. The Judge was entitled to accept the  concession
    and discount the inconsistent claim.)
15. Thus there was a discrepancy of �37,704.92 for the  tax  year  2010/11,
    and a discrepancy of �32,501.43 for the tax year  2012/3,  between  the
    incomes declared to the Respondent and to HMRC. On any view these  were
    significant sums, and the inference drawn by the  Respondent  was  (and
    remains) that they were either the result of  a  dishonest  attempt  to
    reduce a tax liability, or, a dishonest attempt to inflate  income  for
    immigration purposes, but in either event they were the  product  of  a
    deliberate deception by the Appellant rather than  carelessness  or  an
    innocent mistake.
16. As I understood Ms Hashmi  to  ultimately  accept,  the  scale  of  the
    discrepancy between the  financial  information  provided  to  the  two
    different bodies  for  the  two  different  purposes  was  such  as  to
    discharge  the  evidential  burden  that  initially  rested  upon   the
    Respondent to demonstrate a prima facie case of dishonesty.  That  must
    be right; the scale of  the  discrepancy  was  such  as  to  shift  the
    evidential burden to the Appellant to provide  an  apparently  credible
    innocent explanation for what had occurred.  If he were able to do  so,
    that would  in  turn  give  rise  to  an  evidential  burden  upon  the
    Respondent to establish that the explanation proffered was untrue. That
    was certainly the President's analysis of how the evidential burden  of
    proof could shift between the parties  during  an  appeal  Muhandiramge
    (section S-LTR.1.17) [2015] UKUT 675.
17. There is of course only one standard of  proof  applicable:  the  civil
    standard of the balance of probabilities. It is quite  clear  from  his
    decision that the Judge applied  throughout  the  correct  standard  of
    proof, and indeed Ms Hashmi accepted before me that this was the  case.
    In the course of argument she abandoned any suggestion to the contrary,
    and suggested that the real substance  of  her  complaint  lay  in  the
    argument that the  Judge  had  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the Appellant's evidence. That is not  an  argument  that  is
    readily distilled from her grounds, and for the reasons set out below I
    am satisfied that it has no merit.
18. What then was the innocent explanation proffered by the  Appellant  for
    the discrepancies in the income figures given to the Respondent and  to
    HMRC? The Appellant blamed the discrepancies between the  figures  that
    were given to the Respondent and to HMRC for his taxable income in each
    of the tax years of 2010/2011 and 2012/13 upon the two different  firms
    of accountants that he had used to prepare those tax returns.  He  said
    the figures given to the Respondent were accurate. He said that he  had
    used different firms for each of  the  two  tax  years  that  were  the
    subject of the Respondent's concerns, and denied that he had ever  seen
    the tax returns submitted on his behalf for those tax years,  and  thus
    had been denied the opportunity to identify the mistakes the two  firms
    had made. The Appellant asserted that he had made a formal complaint to
    the Professional Conduct Department of the ICAEW against them  both  on
    10 June 2016 [ApB p40], although he produced no acknowledgement by  the
    ICAEW of such a complaint, and accepted in oral evidence  that  he  had
    never received any response to it, or request for  further  information
    to support that complaint. The Appellant also accepted in evidence that
    he had obtained no admission of fault from either firm of  accountants.
    He offered no correspondence between himself and his  accountants  that
    would shed light upon the advice that he received, or the  instructions
    that he gave, at the time. He relied instead upon  the  assertion  that
    HMRC had raised no penalty against him  for  his  under-declaration  of
    tax.
19. There were therefore  a  number  of  elements  to  the  explanation  of
    innocence that he advanced, as follows;
      i) The Appellant knew nothing of taxation and could not be expected to
         have the knowledge of an accountant
     ii) The Appellant had never received any direct communication from HMRC
         - every communication had been between HMRC and the accountants  he
         had retained from time to time
    iii) The Appellant had never seen or approved the  calculations  of  his
         profit from self employment  relied  upon  as  the  basis  for  the
         taxable profit from that business for disclosure to HMRC
     iv) The Appellant had been in India when tax returns had been submitted
         on his behalf for the two tax years in issue
      v) The Appellant had never seen or approved the tax returns  submitted
         to HMRC on his behalf by his accountants from time to time
     vi) The Appellant never had any reason to question the amounts  he  was
         advised that he was required to pay to HMRC by way of tax upon  his
         earnings from self employment
    vii) The two different firms of accountants retained by the Appellant to
         deal with his tax affairs in the two tax years in  issue  had  each
         been negligent, and  had  as  a  result  each  significantly  under
         calculated his income for tax purposes
   viii) The Appellant had made a formal complaint in relation to each  firm
         of accountants with  the  ICAEW,  although  had  never  received  a
         decision upon that complaint
     ix) HMRC had not levied any penalty  against  him,  and  had  therefore
         accepted that there had been an  innocent  mistake  rather  than  a
         deliberate attempt to reduce tax
20. The Judge engaged with each of those  limbs,  and  made  the  following
    findings;
      i) The Appellant was not an accountant but equally his denial  of  any
         knowledge of taxation was implausible. He was an engineer  who  had
         studied a business management module [18].  It  was  not  plausible
         that he would have failed to question why he was being asked to pay
         so little by way of tax,  given  the  income  that  he  claimed  to
         believe he was generating through self employment  in  addition  to
         his earnings from employment [20].
     ii) The Appellant did receive  direct  communication  from  HMRC;  self
         assessment documents in evidence were addressed to his  home  [19].
         Thus communication  had  not  solely  been  between  HMRC  and  the
         accountants he had retained from time to time, as  he  had  claimed
         [19].
    iii) There was no obvious reason why the Appellant would not  have  seen
         and approved the calculations of his profit  from  self  employment
         relied upon as the basis for the taxable profit from that  business
         for  disclosure  to  HMRC.  It  was  unlikely  that  none  of   his
         accountants would have required him to do so, when they could  have
         been sent to him electronically where-ever he was at the time [19 &
         21].
     iv) On the dates the Appellant had given in oral evidence for  when  he
         had been in India, he had been in the UK when tax returns had  been
         submitted on his behalf for the tax  years  2010/11,  2011/12,  and
         2012/13 [21].
      v) The Appellant had failed to  provide  any  reliable  evidence  from
         either firm of accountants to show the  nature  of  the  advice  he
         received from them or the nature of the  instructions  he  gave  to
         them [22]
     vi) The Appellant did have  reason  to  question  the  amounts  he  was
         required to pay to HMRC  by  way  of  tax  because  he  would  have
         realised that they were too low in the light  of  his  earnings  by
         some margin [20]
    vii) It was not  plausible  that  two  different  firms  of  accountants
         retained by the Appellant to deal with his tax affairs in  the  two
         tax years in issue had each been  negligent,  and  had  each  as  a
         result significantly under calculated his income for  tax  purposes
         [25]. He had a clear incentive to either under-declare  his  income
         for tax  purposes,  or  over-declare  his  income  for  immigration
         purposes [26].
   viii) Although the Appellant had produced in evidence a document that  he
         claimed was a copy of a formal complaint he had made  to  ICAEW  in
         relation to each firm of accountants on 10 June 2016, he had not in
         fact made such a complaint [24]
     ix) HMRC had not levied any penalty against him [17].
21. There was no evidence material to the issue of the Appellant's  honesty
    that Ms Hashmi was able to identify to me as  having  been  overlooked.
    The complaint that the Judge  had  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    failure of HMRC to impose a penalty upon him is simply wrong: that  was
    a factor that was specifically considered as being in his favour  [17].
    The failure of HMRC to levy such a penalty did not  however  mean  that
    either the Respondent or the Tribunal were obliged to accept  that  the
    Appellant had been honest  in  his  dealings  with  HMRC,  rather  than
    dishonest. It was only one of a  number  of  factors  that  had  to  be
    considered.
22. It is clear that the Judge's findings were open to him on the  evidence
    before him, and thus the challenge set out in the fourth  paragraph  of
    the grounds that there was no evidence  before  the  Judge  that  would
    permit him to find that the Appellant's explanation  of  innocence  was
    untrue falls away.
23. Equally those  adverse  findings  were  each  adequately  reasoned;  MD
    (Turkey) [2017] EWCA Civ 1958. Notwithstanding the assertion  that  the
    Judge failed to give cogent reasons, the reality is that he gave  ample
    reasons.
24. The Appellant had claimed in evidence  that  he  was  never  given  the
    opportunity to sign off his tax returns as accurate, or to sign off his
    accounts as accurate, or to sign off the tax calculations  prepared  by
    his accountants as accurate. The  Judge  concluded  that  this  central
    plank of his case was untrue. He noted that the Appellant had failed to
    corroborate this element of his claim with any evidence from either  of
    the firms of accountants who acted on his behalf at the material times.
    Although postal, courier, email,  and  fax  communication,  was  always
    available between the UK and India, the explanation for  his  inability
    to approve these documents  was  based  upon  the  Appellant's  claimed
    presence in India at the material dates for the submission of his  self
    assessment forms. It was said in consequence  that  he  was  unable  to
    communicate with his accountants  as  a  result  of  that  geographical
    separation. The Appellant had also said that he was unable  to  provide
    corroboration of the dates when he was in India, because he  could  not
    produce his passport, since it had been retained by the Respondent when
    he made his most recent application for leave to  remain.  Whether  his
    passport was retained, or not, rather missed the point. First, in  oral
    evidence he gave dates for his  travel  to  India,  which  if  accurate
    showed that he was in the UK at the relevant dates for  the  submission
    of his tax returns. Second, there were other ways the  Appellant  could
    have corroborated his claim to have been in India, using the records of
    the purchase of the air tickets he used to travel to  and  fro.  Third,
    whether or not he was able to establish that he was  in  India  at  any
    material date, was not the key issue. The key issue was whether he  had
    approved the submissions that had been made to HMRC in  his  name.  His
    tax records, and the files maintained by his  former  accountants  were
    always available to him, but as Ms Hashmi accepted before me,  he  made
    no attempt to corroborate his evidence to the  Judge  by  reference  to
    them.
25. The Judge also noted that for the Appellant's explanation  to  be  true
    would have required him to have been the victim of incompetence by  two
    different firms of accountants in relation to two different tax  years.
    Each of them would have been required to have made  very  large  errors
    that had resulted in a significant  under-declaration  of  income,  and
    thus a substantially reduced  liability  to  tax.  The  Judge  did  not
    consider this plausible.
26. As set out in Khan it is appropriate to draw an inference of dishonesty
    if a  claimant  fails  to  provide  a  plausible  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy between the disclosures made to the Respondent and to HMRC.
    Whether the Judge's  decision  should  be  analysed  as  in  reality  a
    conclusion that the Appellant had failed to  discharge  the  evidential
    burden upon him of raising a plausible innocent explanation, or, as  he
    stated was his conclusion,  that  the  Respondent  had  discharged  the
    evidential burden of showing that the proffered explanation was  untrue
    [28] is in my judgement ultimately immaterial. It is quite  clear  that
    the Judge's adverse findings of primary fact were well open to  him  on
    the evidence, and that they were properly reasoned. He did  then  stand
    back to look at the evidence in the round, and it was well open to  him
    to conclude that on the evidence before  him  the  Appellant  had  been
    deliberately dishonest, not once, but twice.  It  is  in  my  judgement
    quite clear that the Judge's express conclusion was that the Respondent
    had discharged the burden of proof of establishing that the Appellant's
    behaviour was deliberately dishonest [28].
27. Thus the Judge did follow the correct structure, and  properly  applied
    Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan [1995] UKPC 4, to distinguish between  mere
    carelessness and dishonesty. Indeed, although the Judge made no express
    reference to the approach in Ivey v Genting Casino Ltd [2017] UKSC  67,
    it is plain that his approach was to seek to focus not upon whether the
    Appellant's claimed beliefs were reasonably held, but whether they were
    genuinely held, before looking at the position objectively in order  to
    determine whether there  was  dishonesty.  The  overall  conclusion  of
    deliberate dishonesty was well open to him on the evidence before  him,
    and it was more than adequately reasoned.
28. In the circumstances, and as set out above, I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Judge did not err in law  when  he  dismissed  the  Article  8  appeal,
    notwithstanding the terms in which permission to appeal was granted. In
    my judgement the grounds fail to disclose any material error of law  in
    the approach taken by the Judge to the public  interest  that  requires
    his decision to be set aside and remade.


DECISION
The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  28
March 2018 contained no material error of law in  the  decision  to  dismiss
the Appellant's human rights appeal which requires that decision to  be  set
aside and remade, and it is accordingly confirmed.


Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008
Unless and until the Tribunal directs otherwise  the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity throughout these  proceedings.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
shall directly or indirectly identify him. This direction  applies  both  to
the Appellant and to the Respondent. Failure to comply with  this  direction
could lead to proceedings being brought for contempt of court.
