Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Moksud, First Global Immigration
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey, born on 24th  June  1986  and  he
    appeals against a decision of the respondent on 30th May 2014 to refuse
    him admission to the United Kingdom as a family member  of  Miss  Hilal
    Bekircan, a Dutch national.  The decision was made under Regulation  11
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Emerton heard the  appeal  on  16th  February
    2015 and dismissed the appeal on 24th February 2015.  The  Home  Office
    had refused the application  because  it  was  not  accepted  that  the
    sponsor and Dutch national was exercising treaty rights in the UK.

 3. An application for permission to appeal by the appellant  was  made  as
    the judge had, it was claimed, not considered whether  the  appellant's
    sponsor was a qualified person under Regulation 6  as  a  jobseeker,  a
    worker, a self-employed person, a self-sufficient person or a  student.
    It was pointed out in the application for  permission  to  appeal  that
    working in the UK was only one method of exercising  treaty  rights  in
    the UK.

 4. A second point was that the judge had stated in paragraph 22  that  the
    appellant's marriage was subsisting but he then erred in law by stating
    in paragraph 31 of that determination that "in the light of my  finding
    of fact there can be no family life  in  the  UK  as  at  the  date  of
    decision between the appellant and his spouse".

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge P J M Hollingworth.

 6. At the hearing before me Mr Moksud pointed out the oral evidence  taken
    by the judge at paragraphs 16 and 17 in which the wife claimed she  was
    working in the UK.  Regulation 3 of the  EEA  Regulations  should  have
    been enjoined.

         "3.-(1)  This regulation applies for  the  purpose  of  calculating
                  periods of continuous  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  under regulation 5(1) and regulation 15.

             (2) Continuity of residence is not affected by -

                  (a)  periods of absence from the United Kingdom  which  do
                      not exceed six months in total in any year;

                  (b)   periods  of  absence  from  the  United  Kingdom  on
                      military service; or

                  (c)  any one absence from the United Kingdom not exceeding
                      twelve  months  for  an  important  reason  such   as
                      pregnancy and childbirth, serious illness,  study  or
                      vocational training or an overseas posting.

             (3) But continuity of residence  is  broken  if  a  person  is
                  removed from the United Kingdom under regulation 19(3)."

    She  had  not  been  absent  from  the  UK  in  accordance  with  these
    Regulations.

 7. He also submitted there was a contradiction in relation to family life.



 8. Mr Richards argued that the  judge  had  come  to  an  entirely  proper
    conclusion on the facts.

 9. In conclusion the judge set out the oral evidence at paragraphs 16  and
    17.  He noted in the oral evidence from the  husband  that  he  claimed
    that his wife was working in Bristol and "he could submit her  payslips
    but he had not brought them to court"  [16]  and  in  relation  to  the
    wife's evidence the judge recorded

         "Ms Hilal Bekircan adopted her short witness statement.  It may  be
         summarised as follows: the marriage was still valid and  she  lived
         with him and worked, but frequently visited Holland.  She had  been
         in Holland on 30 May 2014.  In cross-examination she asserted  that
         she lived most of the time in Bristol and worked  at  the  Sunshine
         Cafï¿½.  She had worked there Monday-Friday last week.  Mr  Das-Gupta
         confirmed the question and she repeated the same information.   She
         had no evidence of working there  other  than  the  letter  in  the
         bundle,  but  her  husband  had  provided  all  documents  to   his
         Solicitors.  She was studying at the  University  of  Groningen  in
         Holland, for a Masters in Pharmacy.  She had  started  in  November
         2013 and it was a three-year course, finishing  in  November  2016.
         [She handed up a copy  of  a  letter  from  the  University,  which
         confirmed that she was currently enrolled on  a  full-time  Masters
         course].  She confirmed that the course was full-time, and that  it
         usually took three years (the period of time she was taking).   She
         did not attend most of her classes, but they  were  recorded.   She
         only attended examinations.  She was not obliged by the  University
         to  attend  classes,  and  they  were   aware   of   her   domestic
         arrangements.  She had to go there for obligatory classes  such  as
         lab work.  She lived with  her  husband  in  the  UK,  but  visited
         Holland for study or to see family.  She described how she met  her
         husband and their marriage.  They were presently staying  with  the
         appellant's aunt in Peckham,  having  stayed  in  a  hotel  for  St
         Valentine's day.  Her husband was confused  over  her  not  working
         last week.  He would have meant the previous week."

10. Also submitted in evidence, by the respondent, was that there had  been
    a previous refusal for the appellant on the basis of a  false  document
    which had undermined the appellant's credibility.  In essence the judge
    did not accept,  having  considered  all  of  the  evidence,  that  the
    appellant's sponsor was indeed exercising treaty rights  as  the  judge
    stated at paragraph 22

         "... the fact that Ms Bekircan was prepared  to  give  evidence  in
         support of her husband tends to suggest  that  the  marriage  is  a
         genuine one - it does not follow, however, that she would therefore
         be a credible witness in terms of where she  lives  and  where  she
         works".

11. The judge enlisted support for this finding at paragraph  23  from  the
    transcripts  of  the  interview  which  were  found  to  be  accurately
    summarised.  The judge did not accept the explanation of the  appellant
    that the interpreter was at  fault  when  he  was  interviewed  by  the
    immigration authorities and volunteered various information such as

         "... if my wife returns to the UK what will happen.   She  has  not
         been here for eight months" and "I will ask her to come and live in
         the UK".

12. The judge's view of and conclusions on the  evidence  however  did  not
    rest with these observations alone.  The judge found the set of answers
    to the Immigration Officers were inconsistent and despite the fact that
    the appellant knew the  grounds  of  refusal,  the  evidence  that  was
    provided was "extremely limited".   In  essence  the  judge  found  and
    clearly set out that there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  prove  the
    appellant's case.

13. In particular at paragraph 25 the judge found that

         "The fact of his wife living and  working  in  the  UK  is  largely
         contained in bald and generalised assertions short on detail.   The
         basic underlying fact, that I am asked to accept, is that  although
         the appellant's wife is studying full-time  at  the  University  of
         Groningen in Holland, on a Pharmacy course which includes lab-work,
         she actually does not attend classes, and does nearly all her  work
         whilst living and working with her husband in the UK.   That  is  a
         rather unexpected assertion, and one which  needs  clear  evidence.
         There is, in fact, nothing from the friend said to  provide  course
         work, and nothing from the University confirming that this  is  the
         arrangement - the only document is a  letter  confirming  that  the
         course is full-time.  She has not, for example, provided copies  of
         travel tickets showing only short visits to the  Netherlands.   She
         has failed to provide anything to support her account.  Although it
         is theoretically possible, I do not find it very  likely  that  the
         appellant's wife would be studying  full-time  in  Holland,  whilst
         living in the UK."

14. In conjunction  with  that  finding  the  judge  also  found  that  the
    appellant and his sponsor were inconsistent in their evidence about her
    working in Bristol.  The judge found

         "I consider that it is of considerable relevance that the appellant
         was absolutely clear in his oral evidence that  his  wife  had  not
         worked during the last week.  She was equally clear  that  she  had
         worked last Monday-Friday.  This significant  discrepancy  strongly
         suggests that no reliance should be placed upon the  assertions  as
         to her employment in Bristol, and indeed her residence in  the  UK.
         I  have  looked  for  any  independent   corroboration.    If   the
         appellant's wife was genuinely living and working in Bristol,  this
         should not be difficult to prove: documents such as  (for  example)
         bank statements or utility bills (or mobile  phone  bills)  in  her
         name should be easy to procure.  If she has  been  working  then  I
         would expect to see payslips and tax documentation, and  perhaps  a
         contract of employment.   However,  very  little  indeed  has  been
         provided."

15. At paragraph 27 the judge placed no reliability on the letter from  the
    Director of Tepe London Ltd as it contained no statement of  truth  and
    the rent documents dated 1st May 2011, 1st May 2012 and  1st  May  2013
    only showed that the appellant wished to have his wife's name down as a
    tenant.  Further there was no rent book which post-dated 2013.

16. In particular the judge drew

         "... adverse inferences from the failure to provide  anything  more
         cogent especially as the appellant has asserted that there  are  in
         fact payslips for his wife but he has just neglected to bring  them
         (although he in fact provided some  of  his  own  payslips  in  the
         bundle)".

17. Indeed the judge made a finding at paragraph 28 of his decision,  which
    undermines any reliance placed by the appellant on Regulation 3 of  the
    EEA Regulations, that his wife has "since at least November  2013  been
    living in the Netherlands".  As the hearing took place on 16th February
    2015 this is well over a year prior to the hearing and  even  pre-dates
    the application of June 2014 and decision of 13th June 2014.

18. Bearing in mind the findings  of  the  judge  which  are  thorough  and
    complete, I am not persuaded that there is an error of law in  relation
    to the appellant's wife exercising treaty rights.

19. I turn to the second submission in relation to Article 8.   It  may  be
    the case that the judge found there was a subsisting marriage,  but  as
    stated at paragraph 31 the judge found  that  the  appellant  "has  not
    shown how his case is even remotely arguable as  he  does  not  qualify
    under the EEA Regulations".  The point is that the judge found that the
    wife had not been living and  working  in  the  UK  and  therefore  the
    appellant cannot claim Convention protection of family life in the  UK.
    The judge addressed the issue of private life but found  there  was  no
    effective argument by the appellant  as to proportionality.  The  judge
    found  nothing  that  had  not  already  been  considered   under   the
    Immigration Rules.  Indeed  it  would  be  the  responsibility  of  the
    appellant to make a formal application under the Immigration Rules.

20. I therefore find there is no error of law and the decision shall stand.



No anonymity direction is made.
