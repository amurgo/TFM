                            DECISION AND REASONS


 History of Appeal


   1. The Respondent, who was born on 10th October 1990, is  a  national  of
      Kosovo. He was granted entry clearance in July 1999 to join his father
      in the United Kingdom after the family had experienced persecution  in
      Kosovo.  His father's application for asylum was subsequently  refused
      after a long delay and after the situation in Kosovo had  changed  and
      the Appellant was a party to an appeal which was allowed on Article  8
      grounds on 1st June 2006. He was granted indefinite leave to remain in
      the United Kingdom on 13th September 2010.


   2. By that time he had already met and started a  relationship  with  his
      present fianc�e in 2008. He had also been  sentenced  to  a  community
      order and a 12 month conditional discharge for taking a motor  vehicle
      without consent, driving without insurance or a licence and theft  and
      handling.

   3. On 17th February 2011 he committed an offence of violent disorder  for
      which he was subsequently sentenced to 18 months imprisonment  on  6th
      January 2013.  On 25th April 2012 he had  also  been  sentenced  to  8
      months in prison for three counts of supplying a Class B  drug,  which
      offences were committed in December 2011.

   4. On 9th September 2013 the Secretary  of  State  decided  that  Section
      32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied and made a deportation  order
      against the Respondent.  The Respondent  appealed  on  13th  September
      2013 and his appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cameron
      in a decision promulgated on 7th October 2014.

   5. The Secretary of State appealed on 15th October 2014 on the basis that
      the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  failed  to  apply  sub-paragraph
      399(b)(iii) of the Immigration Rules. She  also  asserted  that  there
      were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to   the   Respondent's   fianc�e
      relocating to Kosovo. In addition,  she  said  that  the  Respondent's
      circumstances were not exceptional, any  separation  would  have  been
      caused by his own actions and his case was not sufficiently strong  to
      outweigh the public interest in his deportation.  She  also  submitted
      that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred in his assessment of what
      amounted to very significant obstacles to  integration.  In  addition,
      she asserted that he had failed to give adequate consideration to  the
      public interest in the Respondent's deportation, given the severity of
      his offence and had not properly balanced it  in  the  proportionality
      assessment.

   6.  On  27th  October  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Levin   refused
      permission to appeal on the basis that neither  the  grounds  nor  the
      determination disclosed any arguable errors of law.

   7. The Respondent renewed her application and on 19th February 2015 Upper
      Tribunal Judge Macleman granted permission to appeal on the basis that
      in substance the grounds "qualified for debate on whether  the  First-
      tier Judge's conclusions on the exceptions available to the  Appellant
      under the Rules and statute were adequately supported by the  evidence
      and the reasoning".

 Error of Law Hearing

   8. The Secretary of State accepted that the Respondent was in  a  genuine
      and subsisting relationship with his fianc�e and that she is a British
      citizen. But  at  the  hearing  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
      submitted that the Judge had not applied  the  correct  test  when  he
      considered the effect on the Appellant's fianc�e  if  he  were  to  be
      deported to Kosovo.


   9. In particular, the Home Office Presenting  Officer  pointed  out  that
      when considering sub-paragraph 399(b)(ii) of the Immigration Rules  at
      paragraph  106  of  his  determination  and  reasons,  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had referred to  whether  it  was  reasonable  for  the
      Appellant's fianc�e to  return  to  Kosovo.  He  had  then  considered
      whether it would be unjustifiably harsh for her to return in paragraph
      114 before articulating the correct test of whether it would be unduly
      harsh for her to return in paragraph 124.  Having considered the  Home
      Office Presenting Officer's submissions, we are not satisfied that  in
      itself this amounted to a material error of law as  in  paragraph  124
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge did say that he was also "satisfied  for
      the reasons already outlined above that it would be  unduly  harsh  to
      expect the Appellant's fianc�e to return to  Kosovo  to  maintain  her
      relationship with him there". Therefore,  it  is  plain  that  he  had
      considered all the evidence before applying the correct legal test.


  10. Ms Brocklesby-Weller also sought to rely on extracts from  Immigration
      Directorate Instructions Chapter 13: Criminality Guidance in Article 8
      ECHR Cases in order to argue that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
      not adopted the correct definition of 'unduly harsh'.  However,  these
      IDIs were  not  put  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  and  no
      reference was made to them in submissions. It was not an error of  law
      for the judge to have no regard to something upon  which  no  reliance
      was placed by a party's legal representative  at  the  hearing  before
      him.


  11. But it is clear from the determination and reasons that  at  no  point
      did the First-tier Tribunal Judge consider whether, for  the  purposes
      of sub-paragraph  399(b)(iii),  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
      Respondent's fianc�e  to remain in the  United  Kingdom  without  him.
      The  requirements  in  sub-paragraphs   399(b)(ii)   and   (iii)   are
      disjunctive and both had to be satisfied  for  the  exception  to  the
      presumption to deportation to apply when an appellant is in a  genuine
      and subsisting relationship with a British citizen. In our  view  this
      did amount to an error of law but, for the reasons given below, we  do
      not find that it was  a  material  error  of  law,  as  the  Appellant
      benefitted from another exception to the general rule relating to  the
      public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  foreign   criminals.   The
      consequence is that the outcome of  the  appeal  would  have  been  no
      different had the legal error we have identified not been made.


  12. The Respondent also sought to rely on the case of AD Lee  v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ  348  but  that  case
      considered the effect on a child of the  removal  of  a  father  as  a
      consequence of a deportation order. It did not consider the  situation
      when an offender had himself been present in the United Kingdom from a
      very early age.
 .
  13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  also  found  that  the  Appellant  fell
      within the exception contained in paragraph 399A  of  the  Immigration
      Rules and Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
      2002. It was not disputed that he had been granted entry clearance  to
      the United Kingdom at the age of 8 and that he was now 33  years  old.
      The Respondent did not assert that his presence here had been unlawful
      during that time.  In 2006, Designated Immigration Judge  Coleman  had
      found that the Appellant was already "westernised"  and  settled  into
      his local school  and  neighbourhood  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Cameron also accepted that the Appellant was socially  and  culturally
      integrated into the  United  Kingdom.  The  key  remaining  issue  was
      whether there were very significant obstacles to his re-integration in
      Kosovo.


  14. Ms Broclesby-Weller submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
      misapplied the test as to what amounted to very significant  obstacles
      and had merely relied on the length of the  Appellant's  residence  in
      the United Kingdom.


  15. We do not accept that submission. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  gave
      detailed consideration  to  the  serious  nature  of  the  Appellant's
      offences in paragraphs 108  and  118  of  his  decision  and  reasons.
      Between paragraphs 108 and 127 he  also  balanced  all  the  necessary
      factors relating to the Appellant's return to Kosovo when  considering
      whether there were very significant obstacles to his return there.


  16. At paragraph 66 of his decision and reasons, the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge confirmed that in accordance with Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT  00702
      he had  taken  as  his  starting  point  the  findings  of  Designated
      Immigration Judge Coleman, who found that between 2002  and  2006  the
      Appellant was seriously ill with PTSD and that  when  he  entered  the
      United  Kingdom  the  Appellant's  father  had   been   in   need   of
      international protection.  At paragraph 68 of his decision and reasons
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge also noted that when the  Appellant  was
      in prison in 2013 he was receiving medication for  his  mental  health
      problems. He also noted  that  Designated  Immigration  Judge  Coleman
      found that the Appellant would  not  be  able  to  obtain  appropriate
      treatment in Kosovo and the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  also  adopted
      this finding. The respondent offered nothing to justify any  departure
      from those findings of fact, which the judge correctly accepted as  an
      authoritative assessment of the circumstances  as  they  were  at  the
      earlier hearing. Put another way, the judge has correctly applied  the
      Devaseelan principle and his approach cannot be faulted.  Further,  it
      can  be  noted  that  the  judge  himself,  at  paragraph  68  of  the
      determination, recorded the fact  that  the  Respondent  had  said  in
      evidence that he no longer took medication and so  it  is  plain  that
      regard was had to that change in the circumstances.


  17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also referred to  Masih  (deportation  -
      public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT  00046  (IAC)
      and the Upper Tribunal's finding that "for a settled migrant  who  has
      lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her childhood and youth
      in [this] country,  very  serious  reasons  are  required  to  justify
      expulsion". In addition,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  explicitly
      referred to the role of deterrence in paragraph 99 of his decision and
      reasons,  so  that  it  is  plain  that  his  approach  was   correct,
      identifying factors that spoke both for and  against  deportation  and
      seeking to strike a balance between the competing interests in play. .




  18. This may not have been the only outcome possible on the evidence.  But
      this was a fact based assessment for the judge  to  make  and,  having
      heard oral evidence, he was best placed to do so. It is  not  possible
      to say that it was not reasonably open to him to reach the  conclusion
      he did and his reasons for  doing  so,  considered  as  a  whole,  are
      legally sufficient.


  19. For all of these reasons we are  satisfied  that  the  judge  made  no
      material error of law so  that  there  is  no  basis  upon  which  his
      decision can be disturbed.



          Conclusions:

      1. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no material error of law

      2. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cameron is to stand.


     3. The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
