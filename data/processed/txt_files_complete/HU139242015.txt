Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is a statutory appeal pursuant to permission to appeal granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Coker.   Her  reasons  for  giving  permission  to
    appeal were that it was arguable  that  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("the judge") gave inadequate reasons  for  admitting  witness
    statements and/or failed to identify  the  weight  that  those  witness
    statements should be given.  She went on to say that if an error of law
    was found the result might have been  the  same  due  to  the  apparent
    evidence of fraud.

2.   On this appeal the appellant was represented by  Mr  Iqbal  of  Counsel
    and the Secretary of State by  Mr  Jarvis,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer.  We are very grateful to both  representatives  for  the  help
    which they gave us and the very clear and frank way in which  they  did
    their best to assist us in relation to the facts of the hearing.

The Facts

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 12  April  1988.
    He entered the United Kingdom as a student on 26 March  2005.   He  was
    given successive leave as a student until 20  December  2010.   He  was
    then given leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 20 August 2012.
     He applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
    in 2011.  That application was based on  earnings  from  employment  by
    Awdry Enterprises ("AE").  That application  was  refused  on  29  July
    2013.  The Secretary of State reconsidered that decision.  She  refused
    it again with a right of appeal.  The appellant's appeal was allowed in
    a determination promulgated on 5 March 2014 ("Determination  1").   The
    Secretary of State did not ask  for  permission  to  appeal  from  that
    decision.  That determination was made on paper.  Neither the appellant
    nor the Secretary of State appeared at the hearing.

4.   The evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  consisted  of  a  witness
    statement from the appellant dated 25 November 2013,  payslips,  a  P45
    and two letters  from  HMRC  purporting  to  set  out  the  appellant's
    earnings in one tax year.

5.   The evidence  from  the  Home  Office  consisted  of  a  brief  witness
    statement from Catherine McGovern dated 11 December  2012.   This  said
    that she worked for HMRC and that UKBA had asked  her  to  "verify  the
    following businesses have provided any evidence  of  genuine  trading".
    She listed several  businesses  including  AE.   She  asserted  without
    further elaboration that "from records available to me... none  of  the
    above companies have demonstrated that they  had  participated  in  any
    legitimate trade".  The First-tier Tribunal  recorded  the  appellant's
    evidence in his witness statement that he worked as an  office  manager
    and that he was paid in cash.  The First-tier Tribunal  considered  the
    Secretary of State's evidence at paragraph 18.  The First-tier Tribunal
    noted the absence of any detail and that the witness statement did  not
    say what records had been consulted or over what  period.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal said  it  would  expect  to  see  a  more  particularised
    investigation in order to  be  persuaded  of  an  allegation  that  the
    appellant had relied  on  false  documents.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    referred to two letters from HMRC provided by the appellant  confirming
    that according to their records he had earned �42,000 in the  tax  year
    ended 5 April 2011 and that the employer was T  Awdry,  plus  payslips,
    the P60 and the P45.  The Secretary of State had not "demonstrated that
    the appellant relied on false documents.  The witness statement  relied
    on is insufficiently detailed and the appellant has provided persuasive
    evidence in rebuttal" (see paragraph 19 of Determination 1).



6.   In paragraph 20 the FtT said:

         "I  am  satisfied  that  the  letters  from  HMRC  and  the   other
         documentation  listed  above  in   relation   to   his   employment
         demonstrate his  claimed  earnings  of  �42,000.   I  am  therefore
         satisfied that he should have been awarded 25 points  for  previous
         earnings and he meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules."


7.   On 28 May 2016 the appellant applied for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    ("ILR") based on ten years' residence pursuant to paragraph 276B of the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) ("the Rules").  We consider  that
    the provisions under which such leave is available are the Secretary of
    State's recognition of the private life rights which may be built up by
    a migrant after ten years' lawful  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    That is reflected in the Home Office's guidance  on  rights  of  appeal
    promulgated  after  the  enactment  of  the   Immigration   Act   2014.
    Applications under paragraphs 276B and 276ADE  are  said  to  be  human
    rights applications with a right of appeal.  This is also  referred  to
    in paragraph 19 of the determination  which  is  the  subject  of  this
    appeal ("Determination 2").

8.   The Secretary of State refused that application in a decision  dated  9
    December 2016.  The Secretary of State said that the appellant  had  in
    his 2011 application relied on earnings  from  AE.   The  Secretary  of
    State said that:

         "Subsequent to  your  original  refusal  and  appeal  following  an
         investigation by the Home Office, it was determined  that  evidence
         supplied by you in support of your application was  unreliable  and
         that a substantial number of other individuals had  been  complicit
         in  the  same  fraud.   The  investigation   concluded   with   the
         facilitators being jailed  for  three  years  and  eighteen  months
         respectively and also  ten  beneficiaries  being  jailed  for  nine
         months each."


9.   The letter went on to say  that  that  investigation  had  uncovered  a
    fraud involving Matloob and Shaharyar.  They were  convicted  in  March
    2014 of providing false documents to facilitate applications for  leave
    to remain.  The letter went  on  "further  to  this  HMRC  verification
    checks and witness statements confirm that [AE]  has  not  demonstrated
    that it has participated in any legitimate  trade".   That  application
    was refused  under  paragraph  322(2)  of  the  Rules.   The  appellant
    appealed against that decision.  A right of  appeal  was  available  on
    human rights only. Before we turn to the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal we should say a little bit about what happened in  the  run-up
    to the appeal.

10.  It appears that the appellant had appealed  against  a  decision  under
    the EEA Regulations 2006 and that he had an appeal on  foot  against  a
    decision made under those Regulations.  It further appears,  we  having
    asked Mr Jarvis about this,  that the bundle for the appeal  which  led
    to the second determination was not, so far  as  he  could  tell,  from
    checking the Home Office  file,  and  the  CID  notes,  served  on  the
    appellant's solicitors at any stage before the hearing of  the  appeal.
    We also asked Mr Jarvis whether there was any trace on the file  or  on
    the CID notes of any letters sent by the Home Office to the appellant's
    representatives on  17  December  2015  enclosing  any  documents  with
    respect to the appeal against the refusal of IRLR.   He  told  us  that
    there was no evidence of any such letter having been recorded either on
    the Home Office file or on CID notes.

11.  Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington in the  course  of  her  review  of  the
    Tribunal file found a document on that file  dated  17  December  2015.
    This is a document on template ICD.2730 and it was sent by the  Appeals
    Directorate of the  Home  Office  at  Lunar  House  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in-house  Support  Centre  in  Leicester.   No  IAC  reference
    appears in the heading of the letter but the letter refers in its title
    to this appellant and to his date  of  birth.   It  then  refers  to  a
    decision made on 9 December 2015 which is  the  date  of  the  decision
    refusing ILR.  Against the heading 'date of appeal lodged' it says 'NOT
    APPLICABLE'.  It then says 'POU Stoke'.  The date of hearing is said to
    be '15.6.2016'.  There are six boxes then on the template referring  to
    different types of decision and the ILR box, box 3, has a cross by  it.
    Under the sideline comments there is this text:

         "Please note applicant refused with a ROA,  however  not  issued  a
         IDC5005 as already has an outstanding  appeal  against  revocation.
         Application should be raised at appeal hearing  due  15/66/16  Ref.
         EEA/00647/2015."


    The letter is signed by Felix Akiode in APC Team A.  Mr Jarvis told  us
    that APC stands for 'Appeals Processing Centre'.


12.  Having discussed this document with the parties we are  satisfied  that
    the purpose of this document was  to  inform  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Support Centre, in relation to an ongoing appeal (that  is  the  appeal
    that the appellant already had against the EEA decision) of  a  further
    decision which had been made in his case by the Home Office so that, at
    the hearing of the EEA appeal it  was  not  forgotten  that  a  further
    decision had been made, and in order to alert the support centre to the
    possibility that a further appeal might be generated by  the  decision,
    which should be joined with the existing appeal.  In the Tribunal  file
    this document is attached by a  rubber  band  to  two  further  witness
    statements from Ms  McGovern  but  we  are  not  satisfied  that  those
    documents were attached to this document dated 17 November 2015 when it
    was sent to the First-tier Tribunal by the Home Office,  for  no  other
    reason than that under the heading 'Encs' at the bottom of the template
    there is no reference to any documents.  In any event this document was
    not sent to the  appellant's  solicitors  so  it  could  not  form  any
    evidence of service on those solicitors of any documents at all.


The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

13.  In a determination promulgated on 30 March 2017 which we have  referred
    to already as Determination 2,  the  judge  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision of 19  December  2015.
    The issues on the appeal, according to Mr Iqbal's submissions, included
    whether it was unfair to allow the Secretary of State to  rely  on  two
    witness statements from Catherine McGovern dated 18 July  2013  and  16
    July 2014 as evidence and, if not, what weight they  should  be  given,
    whether the dispute in the second appeal was the same as the dispute in
    the first appeal and, if so, whether the witness statements were  fresh
    evidence  which  warranted  a  departure  from  the  decision  made  in
    Determination 1.  Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rimington  has  consulted  the
    notes of the proceedings on the Tribunal file.

14.  While Mr Iqbal when asked very  frankly  conceded  that  he  could  not
    remember whether or not he  had  applied  for  an  adjournment  of  the
    hearing, it is clear from notes of the proceedings that  he  did  apply
    for an adjournment and that that application was  refused  at  11:40am.
    He was then given some time to prepare a skeleton  argument.   The  EEA
    appeal, in which  the  appellant  was  not  represented  by  those  who
    instructed Mr Iqbal, was heard by the same judge in  the  afternoon  of
    the same day.  What prompted the application for an adjournment  by  Mr
    Iqbal was the two further witness statements from Ms McGovern to  which
    we have referred.   These  explained,  in  short,  that  the  companies
    referred to in the first short witness statement of  11  December  2012
    were part of a large fraud.  The companies were said to have  submitted
    documents  to  HMRC  which  purported  to  show  that   they   employed
    predominantly, or wholly, Pakistani nationals, and paid them  salaries,
    but the companies had never in fact paid the tax that was due on  those
    salaries and the companies were impossible to contact when  HMRC  tried
    to contact them.  They  were  said  to  have  made  returns  after  the
    statutory filing dates and not to have paid any of  the  penalties  due
    for those late returns.  Most of the letters sent to them by HMRC  were
    returned to HMRC by the post office.  The companies did  not  reply  to
    any of the letters.  The  companies  did  not  follow  PAYE  procedures
    correctly.  Ms McGovern concluded from this pattern of  behaviour  that
    the businesses were not, and had not been trading, and  that  they  had
    not made any payments of salary  to  employees.   The  purpose  of  the
    records was to make it  seem  as  though  the  applicant's  income  was
    actually higher than it really was.  The  second  of  the  two  witness
    statements explains that once information has been filed online  by  an
    employer it automatically "populates" an individual's tax record.  That
    person can then ask HMRC about the  information  which  HMRC  holds  on
    them.  HMRC responds on a standard form which will be filled in on  the
    basis of the information submitted by the employer.  At that stage  the
    "employer's" information has not in any way been tested by HMRC.

15.   The  appellant  did  not  give   evidence   at   the   second   appeal
    (Determination 2,  paragraph  11),  and  the  adjournment  having  been
    refused by the judge, the hearing consisted of submissions  only.   The
    judge explained that the appellant's representative, Mr Iqbal, did  not
    have the Secretary of State's bundle of documents.  The judge  recorded
    that Mr Iqbal objected to the Secretary of State's attempt to  rely  on
    Ms McGovern's two later statements.  The judge said that Ms Alfred, the
    Home Office Presenting Officer "was able to satisfy me that these [that
    is  the  witness  statements]  had  been  served  on  the   appellant's
    solicitors  with  a   covering   letter   dated   17   December   2015"
    (Determination 2, paragraph 9).  The judge summarised the Secretary  of
    State's submissions.  The HMRC letters which the  appellant  relied  on
    were based on fraudulent returns submitted by AE  which  had  not  been
    verified by HMRC when they wrote the letters to the appellant on  which
    the appellant relied.  It was incumbent on the appellant to prove  that
    the salary had been paid into his account.  The judge recorded that  Mr
    Iqbal relied on the decision of this Tribunal in Mubu [2012] UKUT 00398
    (IAC):

         "The guidelines [in Devaseelan] are always to  be  applied  to  the
         determination of a factual issue, the determination  of  which  has
         already been the subject of judicial  determination  in  an  appeal
         against  an  earlier  immigration  decision  involving   the   same
         parties."


16.  Mr Iqbal submitted that the Secretary of State had  not  explained  why
    the two later statements were not before the First-tier Tribunal  which
    made Determination 1.  If the statements were admitted  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had to decide what weight to give them and  should  give  them
    none.  Ms Alfred  accepted  that  the  two  later  statements  were  in
    existence at the time of the first hearing but that they had  not  been
    in the possession of the Home Office until  after  that  hearing.   She
    relied on to the  decision  letter  which  says,  "subsequent  to  your
    original refusal and appeal...".  She also submitted that she  was  not
    seeking to re-determine  the  application  decided  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in March 2014 but was  seeking  to  ensure  that  the  present
    application was not decided on incomplete evidence as had been the case
    in March 2014.

17.  At paragraph 21 the judge summarised the approach in Devaseelan  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702.  He also referred  to  Djebbar  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  804  at
    paragraphs 30, 31 and 40 and to DB [2003] UKIAT00053.  He said that the
    Devaseelan guidelines had been approved in Dhebbar and  that  they  had
    been applied to all categories of appeal in DB.   He  recited  the  law
    about the burden of proof in paragraph 23.  In  paragraph  25  he  said
    that it was clear that the Secretary of State has the burden of proving
    the precedent fact relied on for the purposes of paragraph 320  of  the
    Rules, that is that a fourth representation has been made and that  the
    standard of proof is to the higher balance of probabilities.

18.  At paragraph 26 he said that the issue was  whether  the  Secretary  of
    State should be allowed to rely on Ms McGovern's two  later  statements
    "bearing  in  mind  that  the  Immigration  Judge  in  March  2014  had
    considered and effectively rejected Ms McGovern's original statement of
    December 2012".  He said there is  no  principle  of  res  judicata  in
    immigration appeals, that an unappealed decision of an  adjudicator  is
    binding on the parties but "different considerations apply where  there
    is fresh evidence that was not available at the date of  the  hearing".
    That, he said, raised the question of what  is  meant  by  "available".
    From AS and AA (effect of previous linked determination) Somalia [2006]
    UKAIT 00052, he derived the proposition that if there  is  good  reason
    for departing from it, a previous determination  does  not  settle  the
    issues between the parties on a subsequent  appeal.   The  judge  found
    from the decision letter that the two later witness statements were not
    available to the Home Office on 3 March 2014.  He found that there  was
    a further investigation by the Home Office  after  the  convictions  at
    Snaresbrook on 4 March 2014.  There was good reason to depart from  the
    previous decision as the previous vague evidence  from  HMRC  had  been
    replaced with evidence that was  particularised  and  compelling.   The
    judge found that the Secretary of State  had  established  a  precedent
    fact for the purposes of paragraph 322 "namely evidence indicating that
    the appellant was not actually employed by AE".  The  burden  of  proof
    switched to the appellant but there was nothing  other  than  his  bare
    assertion and the letters from HMRC to show that he had  been  employed
    by AE.  The judge accepted Ms McGovern's  evidence  about  the  letters
    from HMRC.  The appellant could have produced evidence that the  salary
    he claimed was actually paid to him.  No such  evidence  was  produced.
    The judge was not satisfied that the appellant  was  employed  and  was
    satisfied that the documents were false.  The appellant had  also  used
    deception in a previous application when he applied for ILR.  All those
    finding the judge said supported the Secretary of State's decision.

19.  The judge then considered Article 8 apart from paragraph  276B.   There
    is no appeal against that part of the determination.

Discussion

20.  We asked the parties to address us on the question of  fairness  first.
    It was in the  course  of  that  that  the  parties  and  the  Tribunal
    discussed the document dated 17 December  2015.   Having  reviewed  the
    document dated 17 December 2015  and  having  carefully  considered  Mr
    Jarvis's very frank information about  his  researches  into  the  Home
    Office file and the CID notes, we do not understand how the  judge  was
    persuaded that the  Secretary  of  State  had  served  the  appellant's
    representatives with Ms McGovern's two later witness statements  on  17
    December 2015.  Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rimington  has  noted  from  the
    Record of Proceedings that what appears to have happened  is  that  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer must have made a telephone call, because
    she is reported as saying  something  "on  the  advice  of  the  Senior
    Presenting Officer", but there is nothing on the Home Office  file,  as
    Mr Jarvis has told us, which supports the suggestion that any documents
    were served on 17 December 2015.  In any event it is wholly  improbable
    that the Secretary of  State  could  have  served  any  documents  with
    respect to the appeal against the refusal of ILR on  17  December  2015
    because 17 December 2015 was the date when the  appellant's  notice  of
    appeal against the refusal of ILR was stamped as having  been  received
    by the First-tier Tribunal.  Unless the Secretary of  State  is  to  be
    attributed with supernatural powers,  we  do  not  see  how  she  could
    possibly have lodged a bundle of documents relevant to that appeal with
    the First-tier Tribunal at the very date when that  appeal  was  lodged
    with the First-tier Tribunal.  We simply do not consider  it  plausible
    that the Secretary of State would have served those witness  statements
    out of the blue on the appellant's  solicitors  coincidentally  on  the
    date when the appeal was lodged.  If they were not served then, then it
    is probable that the appellant's solicitors did not get them until  the
    day of the hearing.  The fact that  the  Home  Office  bundle  was  not
    served until the day of the hearing is supported both  by  Mr  Jarvis's
    researches and indeed by material in Determination 2.

21.  Unsurprisingly, in  that  situation,  Mr  Iqbal  was  taken  wholly  by
    surprise that the two  further  witness  statements  put  a  completely
    different complexion on the case.  It  is  clear  from  the  Record  of
    Proceedings that Mr Iqbal did what  was  sensible  in  that  situation,
    which was to apply for an adjournment.  We are all the  more  persuaded
    that Mr Iqbal was right to  apply  for  an  adjournment,  and  that  an
    adjournment should have been granted, by the fact  that  the  judge  in
    Determination 2 relied when deciding the merits of the appeal,  on  the
    fact that the appellant had not produced any evidence to show that  the
    salary claimed was actually paid to him.  There was no reason  for  the
    appellant in advance of the appeal to think that he needed  to  produce
    any further evidence  than  the  evidence  he  had  already  relied  on
    because, in the absence of the two further statements by  Ms  McGovern,
    for all the appellant  knew,  the  Secretary  of  State  was  advancing
    exactly the same case  on  the  second  appeal  as  she  had  advanced,
    unsuccessfully, on the first appeal.  We consider that without the  two
    later statements the Secretary of State's case was no stronger than  it
    had been at the first hearing, and that the appellant's solicitors were
    entitled to consider that they did not  need  to  provide  any  further
    evidence  themselves,  or,  indeed,  to  call  the  appellant  to  give
    evidence.  The two later witness statements filled the  gap  which  had
    been identified by the First-tier  Tribunal  in  Determination  1.   We
    consider that it was unfair for the judge to proceed with the appeal in
    circumstances where that important information had only been disclosed,
    as we find, to the appellant and his representatives on the very day of
    the hearing.  That is particularly  the  case,  since  the  two  latest
    witness statements are on their face so cogent, and, in the absence  of
    rebutting evidence so apparently decisive of the issues on the  appeal.
    For all we know the appellant may well have had documentary evidence to
    show that the salary he claimed had actually been paid to him or  other
    documents evidencing payment of a significant  salary.   Crucially,  in
    our judgment, he might also have been advised to give  evidence  rather
    than simply relying on his written witness statement.  Mr Jarvis having
    considered the material that Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington  discovered
    from the file including the document of 17 December 2015 and the Record
    of Proceedings very fairly conceded that there was a real problem  with
    the fairness of proceeding with the appeal in those circumstances.   We
    agree.  That, in our judgment, means that we should allow this  appeal,
    as we consider that the appellant was deprived of his right to  have  a
    fairly-conducted appeal  in  front  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   We
    therefore remit this case to the First-tier Tribunal for the First-tier
    Tribunal to re-hear it.

22.  It is for the First-tier Tribunal to decide whether it is satisfied  by
    the general assertions in the decision letter about the timing  of  the
    investigation by the Secretary of State, and, by inference, the date on
    which  the  two  further  witness  statements  of  Ms  McGovern  became
    available to the Secretary of State.  We suggest that the Secretary  of
    State may consider it prudent on the remitted  appeal  to  provide  the
    First-tier Tribunal with a more detailed and circumstantial explanation
    of when the  second  two  witness  statements  of  Ms  McGovern  became
    available to the Secretary of State and why it was, despite their  much
    earlier dates, that the Secretary of State did not rely on them in  the
    first appeal in March 2014.  We consider that it will then be  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal to decide whether in the  circumstances  it  admits
    the second two witness statements and, if  so,  what  weight  it  gives
    them.  The First-tier Tribunal will no  doubt  take  into  account  the
    public interest in ensuring that ILR is not granted to a person who has
    submitted false documents to the Secretary of State.  It  will  be  for
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  decide  how  to  apply  the   Devaseelan
    guidelines and the subsequent case law, what weight to give that public
    interest consideration and what weight to give the other factors in the
    case when it has the parties' further submissions and evidence  on  the
    remitted appeal.

Notice of Decision

23.      For those reasons we allow this appeal and we remit the  appeal  to
    the First-tier  Tribunal  to  determine  it  in  accordance  with  this
    judgment.

No anonymity direction is made.
