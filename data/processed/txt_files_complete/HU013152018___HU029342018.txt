For the Appellant:     Ms M Cleghorn, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first and  second  Appellants  are  citizens  of  Iran.  The  first
    Appellant is the mother of the second. They entered the United  Kingdom
    as visitors in November 2007. It appears  they  left  the  country  but
    returned as student dependents on 21 August 2008. They  then  left  and
    returned on 3 October 2009 with the first Appellant this time  being  a
    student herself. Her leave to remain  was  subsequently  extended.  She
    made an application in  February  2015  for  asylum  (with  the  second
    Appellant as her dependent) but this was rejected.  She  became  appeal
    rights exhausted in March 2017. Both Appellants made  applications  for
    leave to remain on 10 April 2017. Their applications were  refused  and
    they appealed and following a hearing, and in a decision promulgated on
    21 March 2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Moran  dismissed  their
    appeals on human rights grounds. The Judge concluded at paragraph 27 of
    his  decision  that  there  are  "strong  reasons  for   refusing   the
    application notwithstanding the period  in  excess  of  7  years.  This
    arises from the actions of SZ from 2014  onward"  as  detailed  in  his
    decision.

 2. The Appellants sought permission to appeal. This was granted by  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Chapman in a decision dated 18 October  2018.  Her
    reasons were: -

         "1.  The Appellants, who are mother and son and nationals of  Iran,
         born on 1.4.79 and 30.7.03, seek permission  to  appeal,  in  time,
         against a decision of First tier Tribunal Judge  Moran  who,  in  a
         decision and reasons promulgated on 21 March  2018,  dismissed  his
         appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated 7  December  2017
         refusing to grant them leave to remain on the basis of their  human
         rights.

         2.   The grounds in support of  the  application  assert  that  the
         Judge erred materially in law: (i) in his assessment  of  the  best
         interests of the second Appellant and the reasonableness  test  and
         (ii)  in  referring  to  the  Home   Office   guidance   as   being
         determinative  of  his  assessment,  rather  than  make   his   own
         assessment and (iii) in  erroneously  applying  MA  ('Pakistan)  in
         treating Section 117B(6) as an exclusionary clause.

         3.   Whilst the Judge at [16] does refer to the correct test as set
         out in the Home  Office  policy  guidance  and  MA  (Pakistan)  the
         grounds of appeal, which overlap, raise arguable errors of  law  in
         the decision of the First tier Tribunal  Judge,  in  particular  at
         [24] in finding that in the first Appellant's  conduct  amounts  to
         powerful public interest considerations amounting to strong reasons
         that justify return of the Appellants to Iran, in light of MT &  ET
         [2018] UKUT 88 (IAC) at [34].

         4.   Permission to appeal is accordingly granted."

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. At the outset both representatives  invited  me  to  find  within  this
    decision a material error of law for the reasons set out in the grounds
    and identified in the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal.  Particularly
    following JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT
    00072  IAC)  and  the  guidance  there  that  section  117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  requires  a  court  or
    tribunal to hypothesise that the child  in  question  would  leave  the
    United Kingdom, even if this is not likely to  be  the  case,  and  ask
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to do so.

 5. Further evidence is now required in this  appeal  so  that  it  can  be
    reconsidered. The Appellant was not present  at  today's  hearing.  The
    decision cannot stand and accordingly remittal is appropriate.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision is  set  aside.  The  appeal  is
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  dealt  with  afresh  pursuant  to
Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  and
Practice Direction 7(b) before any Judge aside from Judge Moran.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Signed                                                    Date 6 April 2019
