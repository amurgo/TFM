For the Appellant:     Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Gaisford, instructed by Wilsons Solicitors LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This appeal is brought by the Secretary of State against  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Callow) who allowed the appeal of the
    respondent against the Secretary of State's  decision  on  18  November
    2014 to make a deportation order.   Hereafter  I  shall  refer  to  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent, as she was before the judge,  and
    to Mr Tchokouadi as the appellant, as he was before the judge.

2.   The appellant has been in the United  Kingdom  since  he  was  aged  5,
    arriving in April 2000.  He is an extended  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national, and as a consequence has a permanent right  of  residence  in
    the United Kingdom, having lived here for over five years.   The  legal
    test, as noted by the judge, was that his deportation had to  be  shown
    to be justified on serious grounds of public  policy  or  security  and
    that was common ground.  The judge concluded, at paragraph  32  of  his
    decision, that the appellant's personal conduct  did  not  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental  interests  of  society,  in  accordance  with   Regulation
    21(5)(c) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006.



3.   The respondent sought and was  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis that the judge's reasoning was either lacking or inadequate.   It
    was argued that the judge's finding that  the  appellant  had  reformed
    except for his personal consumption of cannabis was  wholly  inadequate
    given the noting at paragraph 20 of the assessment by  the  appellant's
    offender manager that he posed a medium risk of offending and  harm  to
    the public and that if he were to revert to using drugs  when  released
    the risk would increase.  It was argued that it could not be said  that
    the appellant had reformed or matured if he was continuing to use drugs
    even if it was only for personal use.  This showed a blatant  disregard
    for the law.  Though the appellant had taken  courses  to  address  his
    drug use whilst in prison he had  gone  on  to  use  drugs  once  more.
    Reference was made to the fact that in May 2016 the appellant was found
    to have drug paraphernalia at his house which  he  had  not  adequately
    explained.  It  was  argued  that  this  cast  serious  doubts  on  his
    intention to reform and his maturity and that he continued  to  pose  a
    risk of re-offending.  Reference was also made to the appellant and his
    family seeking to deceive  the  Tribunal  and  immigration  authorities
    regarding their  mother's  whereabouts,  there  was  criticism  of  the
    judge's finding that there was a real prospect of the appellant ceasing
    to commit crime as being wholly inadequate and  not  supported  by  the
    evidence given that he had continued to commit offences and  use  drugs
    even after his release and that the finding that he was integrated into
    life in the United Kingdom was wholly  inadequate  given  that  he  had
    accumulated thirteen convictions for twenty  offences  between  28  May
    2010 and 26 February 2016 as well as a number  of  other  incidents  in
    which no further action was taken.  It was also argued that though  the
    family claimed not to have ties to Cameroon, given their past  attempts
    to deceive regarding their mother they might not be  credible  in  that
    respect, that even if the appellant  had  no  family  in  Cameroon  his
    mother's status in the United Kingdom was precarious and there  was  no
    guarantee that she would be permitted to remain here.

4.   Permission having been granted on all grounds, the appellant put  in  a
    Rule 24 response.  In that it was argued that the judge's decision  was
    in fact fully reasoned, that the judge had found the recent  conviction
    for burglary was serious but not of exceptional  gravity  or  one  that
    would cause genuine revulsion, that the judge was entitled to  conclude
    that the appellant had reformed his character, based on  evidence  from
    independent professionals, that the offender  manager's  assessment  to
    which the respondent referred was based on an incorrect premise in that
    the appellant was no longer a member of the gang referred to,  and  the
    offender manager had not concluded  contrary  to  what  the  respondent
    asserted that if the appellant were  to  revert  to  using  drugs  when
    released risk would increase.  All that had been said was that the risk
    of re-offending was likely to increase if he returned to being  a  gang
    member and if he was treated unfairly and wanted  revenge.   The  judge
    had found that the appellant was not a gang member.  A report had  said
    that the risk of re-offending  would  be  reduced  through  employment,
    stable accommodation and non-association with  gang  members  and  that
    these were all in place.  The OASys Report in the  respondent's  bundle
    which concluded that the appellant was at medium risk  of  re-offending
    based on predictions of him re-offending within two  years  had  to  be
    seen in the context of over two years having passed at the time of  the
    hearing by which time the  appellant  had  not  committed  any  further
    serious offences other than those connected to  cannabis  for  personal
    use.  It was also pointed out that  there  was  significant  up-to-date
    evidence postdating the OASys Report from among others the  appellant's
    probation officer and  other  independent  professionals.   Several  of
    those were aware of  the  most  recent  conviction  for  possession  of
    cannabis.   The  appellant  had  addressed  the  issue  of   the   drug
    paraphernalia and Mitch Walsh from the Leaving Care Team at the  London
    Borough of Camden had explained that he had provided the appellant with
    a substantial amount of the money which had been found  at  his  house.
    The case had not been proceeded with due to insufficient  evidence  and
    there was no further action.  The judge's decision had not  been  based
    only on the evidence of the appellant  and  his  family  but  also  the
    evidence of the independent professionals.  Reliance was placed on  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Straszewski [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1245.
    The issue of integration was relevant  only  to  proportionality  which
    only came into play if the appellant's personal conduct had been  found
    to represent a sufficient level of threat, which it had not.  There was
    evidence of a lack of family ties in Cameroon not only  just  from  the
    appellant and his direct family but also his girlfriend/fiancï¿½e who was
    found to be a credible witness and also from two of the  professionals.
    Again, though that was not a relevant consideration on the key point to
    the judge, as the Presenting Officer at the hearing had  accepted,  was
    concerned with the issue of serious risk under Regulation 21(5).

5.   At the hearing both representatives relied on and  helpfully  developed
    the points made respectively in the grounds and in the response.

6.   The judge properly bore in  mind  the  guidance  in  Straszewski  which
    emphasises that the origin  and  purpose  of  the  EEA  Regulations  is
    fundamentally different from those of section 32 of the UK Borders  Act
    2007 another point being  made  that  EEA  nationals  are  entitled  to
    exercise treaty rights and that the right of free movement is  regarded
    as a fundamental aspect of the Union, and  exceptions  to  that  right,
    based on public policy, are construed restrictively.  Regulation  21(5)
    provides that a decision to remove an EEA  national  with  a  permanent
    right of residence must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of
    the person concerned and matters that do not  directly  relate  to  the
    particular case or which relate to considerations of general prevention
    do not justify a removal decision.

7.   The judge was clearly aware of not only the offences committed  by  the
    appellant, which were summarised at paragraph 4 of  the  decision,  but
    also the incidents concerning the appellant which  did  not  result  in
    further action being taken against him.  The most  significant  offence
    was the burglary for  which  he  was  sentenced  to  29  months  on  23
    September 2013.  The judge also noted the appellant's efforts to try to
    stop smoking  cannabis  and  his  convictions  in  September  2015  and
    February 2016  in  that  regard.   He  noted  that  the  appellant  had
    employment and was in a long-term relationship.

8.   There was evidence  from  Adrian  McBride  of  the  National  Probation
    Service who had been the appellant's  offending  manager  from  October
    2015 who  said  that  the  appellant  had  broadly  complied  with  the
    requirements of his licence  and  had  displayed  a  positive  attitude
    towards supervision  by  maintaining  regular  contact,  attending  all
    appointments as instructed and engaging fully in sessions.  He assessed
    him as being at a low risk of re-offending.  There  was  also  evidence
    from Bruce Ume who had been the appellant's personal advisor at  Camden
    Social Services from August 2012 who said he believed the appellant had
    shown genuine remorse for  his  actions.   He  was  not  aware  of  any
    evidence to suggest that the appellant had been a member of a gang  and
    checks made with the Camden serious youth  crime  coordinator  revealed
    that there was no intelligence to suggest that he was  a  gang  member.
    Mitch Walsh of Camden Family Services and Social Work had  worked  with
    the appellant since 5 January 2016 after Bruce Ume left  Camden  Social
    Services.  He had  been  impressed  by  the  appellant's  presentation,
    punctuality and a desire to settle his  accommodation  needs.   He  had
    shown that he was able to manage  all  aspects  of  independent  living
    since release from prison and his progress was such that  it  had  been
    deemed  appropriate  for  him   to   be   nominated   for   independent
    accommodation.  He had taken responsibility for  his  criminal  conduct
    which he regretted.   Mr  Walsh  was  aware  of  the  two  arrests  for
    possession of small quantities of cannabis.  As a consequence  of  that
    the appellant had agreed to be referred to  Camden's  Substance  Misuse
    Service.  Of the money recently received by the police, more than  half
    was charitable funding for an educational course and the rest  was  the
    appellant's  savings.   Mr  Walsh  had  checked   with   the   violence
    coordinator to confirm that there were  no  records  of  the  appellant
    being a member of a gang.  Key worker Mr Stephen Young, who attended to
    the appellant when he lived at St Mungo's described  the  appellant  as
    being willing to accept guidance and take responsibility  for  informed
    decisions.

9.   Taking this and other  evidence  into  account,  the  judge  noted  the
    relevant legal tests in particular at paragraph  25  of  his  decision,
    noting guidance  in  authorities  such  as  Bah  and  Farquharson.   He
    considered that there was no evidence, despite the  assertion  made  in
    the respondent's refusal, that the appellant was a  member  of  the  QC
    gang.  There was no reason to doubt the evidence of the  Camden  social
    workers that they had no knowledge of  the  appellant's  membership  of
    such a gang.  None of the further incidents beyond the convictions  set
    out at paragraph 5 of the judge's decision were of a serious nature but
    amounted to petty criminal activity of no  real  consequence  save  for
    continuing drug offences.

10.  The judge went on to consider the  guidance  in  Straszewski  and  also
    Essa.  The judge described the recent convictions for burglary as being
    undoubtedly serious.  He considered that in the broad  context  it  was
    not however of exceptional gravity  or  an  offence  that  would  cause
    genuine revulsion among members of the public.  It  was  accepted  that
    the appellant had learnt his lesson and it was unlikely that  he  would
    re-offend.  The  judge  considered  him  as  having  reformed.   It  is
    relevant to bear in mind the point made in the Rule  24  response  that
    though the appellant had been assessed in 2013 by the offender  manager
    as posing a medium risk of re-offending that it is clear on the judge's
    finding that the appellant was not a member of  the  QC  gang  and  the
    offender manager did not conclude that if the appellant were to  revert
    to using drugs when released risk would  increase  as  alleged  by  the
    respondent.  The point that  risk  of  re-offending  would  be  reduced
    through employment, stable accommodation and non-association with  gang
    members was of clear materiality and those matters are as the  Rule  24
    response noted, in place.  As regards the OASys Report, the predictions
    were for re-offending at a medium risk within two years but no  further
    serious offences had been committed, and in particular it  is  relevant
    to note and take into account the judge's bearing in mind of  the  more
    recent evidence from the four professionals who had been involved  with
    the appellant since then.

11.  The conclusion is not one that every judge would have come to.   It  is
    however necessary for an error of law in the judge's decision  to  have
    been identified for that decision to be disturbed.  The judge  set  out
    the legal tests with great care and also the evidence before  him.   It
    is not suggested that he applied the wrong test  but  rather  that  his
    application of the correct test was in error.  In the  end  I  consider
    that no more than disagreement has been shown.  The judge evaluated the
    evidence with care and in detail and came  to  conclusions  which  were
    open to him on a proper evaluation of  that  evidence.   Accordingly  I
    consider that it has not been shown that he  erred  in  law  and  as  a
    consequence the judge's decision  in  this  case  allowing  the  appeal
    stands.

12.  No anonymity direction is made.
