Trust
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

The Iranian state is suspicious of  those  Iranian  citizens  who  are  also
Arabs and regards London as  a  centre  of  separatist  activity.  Being  an
Iranian Arab returned from the United Kingdom enhances  other  risk  factors
but an Iranian Arab does not risk persecution or other ill treatment  solely
by reason of ethnicity.





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

The appellant was born on 26 September 1976, and is  an  ethnic  Arab,  from
the                   Ahwaz area of the south-western province of  Khuzestan
in Iran.  He is an Iranian citizen.


He appeals the Secretary of State's decision of 26  August  2004  to  remove
him as an illegal entrant after the refusal of his  claim  for  asylum.   He
claims to be a refugee within the meaning of regulation 2 of the Refugee  or
Person in  Need  of  International  Protection  (Qualification)  Regulations
2006.

We are aware of a decision of  the  Tribunal  prepared  in  draft  [and  now
reported as BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)  Iran  CG  [2011]
UKUT 36 (IAC)]. We have, of course, decided the appeal solely on  the  basis
of the evidence before us but we note that the conclusions of  the  division
of the Tribunal that heard that appeal  are  very  much  in  line  with  our
conclusions.

The appeal has a regrettably protracted history.  It  was  dismissed  by  an
Adjudicator  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  13  January  2005;   but
reconsideration was ordered and, on 16 February 2007, the Tribunal found  an
error of law in that determination.  The appeal was reheard by  a  panel  of
two Senior Immigration Judges  and  a  lay  member  on  14  July  2008  but,
regrettably, that panel too erred in law and its decision was set  aside  by
an order of the Deputy President of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal,  Mr
C M G Ockelton, on 30 December 2009.

The appeal came before us for a further rehearing pursuant to directions  of
Stadlen J given on 28 April 2010.   Those  included  a  direction  that  the
Secretary of State produces "an updated refusal letter", which  she  did  on
16 June 2010 and has been considered in this appeal.

At the hearing before us, the appellant gave oral evidence.  In addition  we
had the benefit of a witness statement from Mr Ali Moramazy, an Ahwazi  Arab
who is now a British citizen and involved in the political activities of  an
organisation known as the Ahwazi Arab People's Democratic Popular Front,  to
which we shall return.  We also had written medical evidence  from  Dr  Alec
Frank, an Associate Physician with the Medical Foundation for  the  Care  of
Victims of Torture (who examined the appellant  for  signs  of  torture  and
maltreatment) and Dr J Austin (the appellant's general practitioner).

The appellant also relied upon two country experts.  First, there  were  two
written reports dated 7 December 2004 and 28 January 2007 from Prof  E  G  H
Joffe who is well-known  to  the  Tribunal.   He  is  currently  a  visiting
Professor at King's College, London and a Visiting Research  Fellow  at  the
Centre for International Studies at  Cambridge  University.   Second,  there
was Ms Anna Enayat who has been a Senior Associate  Member  of  St  Antony's
College, Oxford (attached to the college's Middle East Centre)  since  1983.
Ms Enayat prepared reports dated 3 May 2007, 30 June 2008 and 14 July  2010,
and further helpfully gave oral evidence.

There was additionally a bundle of some 700 pages  of  documents,  which  we
have considered.

At the hearing, the appellant was represented by Ms Sonali Naik of  Counsel;
and the Secretary of  State  by  Mr  T  Melvin,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer.  We would like to thank them at the outset  for  their  submissions
and general assistance.

The Appellant's Case

The appellant claimed asylum on 27 April  2004,  and  attended  a  screening
interview    on 27 July 2004.  His version of events given  then  has  been,
with some consistency, repeated in his statements for  this  appeal  and  in
his oral evidence before  us.   For  reasons  to  which  we  will  come,  we
consider that much of it is not now controversial.

The appellant was born in Bandar Imam in Khuzestan.  His father  and  mother
have lived in Kuwait since 1992.  Until the  Iran-Iraq  War,  the  appellant
lived a relatively peaceful life: but, during  the  war,  the  Ahwazi  Arabs
were regarded by the Iraqnian authorities, rightly  or  wrongly,  as  having
sympathies with Iraq which at times occupied much of the  area,  and  things
became more difficult when the Iranian  authorities  resumed  full  control.
Land owned by his father in Khuzestan was seized  by  the  Iraqi  Government
and used to build a training centre in 1998.

The appellant, in evidence confirmed by Ms Enayat, said that  there  were  a
number of loose organisations in south-west Iran  that  supported  either  a
separatist state or at  least  greater  autonomy  within  Iraq  and  greater
rights for Ahwazi Arabs, one  being  the  Ahwazi  Arab  People's  Democratic
Popular Front, known in Iran as Khalagh  Arab  ("the  DPF").   However,  the
appellant said that it was very difficult to engage  in  political  activity
in Iran, especially for a young person, and it was known to be fraught  with
risks.  To join an organisation such as the DPF would be seen, he  said,  as
a "massive, extreme thing to do".

However, at the end of June 2004, he  became  involved  with  the  DPF.   He
never joined the organisation whilst he was in Iran, but  he  was  asked  to
"help out" and agreed to distribute leaflets written in  Arabic  encouraging
Arabs to assert themselves: they comprised  anti-government  slogans  urging
people to "wake up".  He said he also  graffitied  anti-government  messages
on walls.  He distributing leaflets for about 10 days: he said that  it  was
some sort of "test", before he could become a member of the organisation.

On the night of 6 July 2004, whilst he was distributing leaflets  and  books
in Ahvaz which was about 100km from his home, he was  suddenly  arrested  in
the Kianabad district by the Basiji or  Revolutionary  Guard,  part  of  the
Iranian security services.  He was held for three days, during which he  was
blindfolded all the time, except he was  allowed  to  remove  the  blindfold
once a day to use the toilet.  He was fed once a day  on  lentils  and  rice
and given water at the same time.   He  knows  that  he  slept  on  a  hard,
concrete floor.  He thought that he would die because of the  intense  heat.
He was attacked, beaten and interrogated.  There were  marks  all  over  his
body, some lasting until the time he made  his  statement.   Dr  Frank,  who
examined the appellant after  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom,  found
physical signs of scars and marks on the appellant's face  and  scalp  which
supported that account.

On the third day of his detention, whilst still handcuffed and  blindfolded,
he was put in a car and driven for half an hour.   He was  then  transferred
into another car, which he realised was his brother's car; and  his  brother
was telling him to take off the blindfold.   His brother was  aware  of  his
leafleting activities, but he did not approve of them.  He  was  angry  that
the appellant had been seized because of them, but,  as  his  brother,  felt
bound to help him.  The appellant saw no inconsistency in his brother  being
angry and in his brother driving him across the Turkish border.  He said  it
was the nature of Iranian society that his brother  would  do  anything  for
him.  That was also the evidence of Ms Enayat.   The  appellant  said  that,
although bribery is common  in  Iran,  if  bribery  comes  to  the  specific
attention of the authorities both the person bribed  and  the  person  doing
the bribing would be in serious trouble.

 When the appellant took off his blindfold, it  was  night-time,  and  dark.
His brother told him that he had paid the authorities money  to  secure  his
release - in his oral evidence to us he said he thought the amount paid  was
"a good sum" which he believed to be ï¿½10,000 or $10,000.  His  brother  told
him that he did not think it was safe for the appellant to remain  in  Iran.
He took him to Tabriz, via the  holy  city  of  Ghom  and  Tehran.   He  was
introduced to an agent, who arranged for him go  to  Turkey  by  donkey  and
thence to the United Kingdom by lorry.

That was, more or less, the evidence that the appellant relied upon when  he
claimed asylum in April 2004.  In the refusal letter of 24 August 2004,  the
Secretary of State accepted that the  appellant  had  been  arrested  as  he
claimed, but said that, in her view, the appellant was  of  no  interest  to
the authorities; otherwise he would not have been released.    She  did  not
accept that Arabs from Khuzestan might routinely risk persecution,  and  she
refused the application.

On appeal, even though he dismissed the  appeal,  the  Adjudicator  accepted
parts of the appellant's evidence, and these findings were preserved by  the
later Tribunal panel.  As the Tribunal said (at paragraph 3):

  "The Adjudicator found the appellant to be  a  credible  witness  in  his
  claim to have been associated with the Ahwazian Arab  Political  Movement
  and that he delivered leaflets within an  Arab  area  and  was  arrested,
  detained and ill-treated because of this and released  after  three  days
  upon payment by his brother of a bribe.  The point was accepted that  the
  appellant suffered persecution in that regard at the hands  of  officials
  of the State of Iran."


We see no good reason to go behind  those  essential  findings,  and  indeed
every reason why we should follow  them.   The  evidence  of  the  appellant
before us on those matters  was  compelling.   The  appellant's  version  of
events until he claimed asylum was not seriously challenged  by  Mr  Melvin,
and we accept that version as we have set it out above.
The appellant relies upon two  further  matters,  namely  events  that  have
taken place in Iran since his departure and, second, events that have  taken
place in the United Kingdom, both of which, he contends, have increased  the
risk that he faces on any return to Iran.

In addition to a worsening of general conditions for  Arabs  in  Iran  (with
which we deal below: see paragraph 32 onwards)  the  appellant  relies  upon
evidence as to what has recently happened  to  his  brother  and  father  in
Iran.

Through his contacts  with  the  Democratic  Popular  Front  in  the  United
Kingdom, the appellant said that, in February  or  March  2005,  he  learned
that his brother had been arrested and detained by the  Iranian  authorities
because of his role in helping the appellant escape from detention in  Iran.
 He said that no one then knew where his brother was  being  held;  but,  in
May 2008, the appellant's mother had telephoned him  to  say  that  she  had
been told by a lawyer that his  brother  was  being  held  in  detention  in
Ahwaz. The appellant's lawyer asked him to ask his mother for that  lawyer's
details, so that contact could be made with him, but his  mother  telephoned
him again to say that that solicitor could not  help.   The  appellant  said
that he believed his mother's solicitor was frightened.

In the meantime, in 2005, the appellant was told by his DPF  contacts,  that
his father, who had been living in Kuwait, returned to Iran to  see  whether
he could do anything to secure the release of the appellant's brother:  but,
as a result, his father was detained and tortured, and he died as  a  result
of the treatment he had suffered.  He  was  52  years  old.   The  appellant
produced a copy of what purports  to  be  his  father's  death  certificate,
which shows that  he  died  on  29  December  2004  as  a  result  of  brain
haemorrhage.

In support, the appellant relied upon the  statement  of  Mr  Moramazy.   He
confirmed that the appellant contacted the DPF in London in September  2004,
had become a member, and had attended several meetings  since  (see  below).
He said that, in September 2005, they obtained information from DPF  members
in Ahwaz that the appellant's brother had been arrested  and  detained,  and
that his father had been arrested on  return  from  Kuwait  and  died  after
being tortured in detention.  He said that he thought  the  appellant  would
be executed in the event of his return.

As well as these events in Iran, the appellant relied upon  evidence  as  to
his own activities whilst he has been in the United Kingdom.

The appellant said that he had made telephone contact with the  DPF  in  the
United Kingdom, in 2004, and had become  a  member.   No  one  attended  the
hearing to support his claim to be a member of the DPF, although he had  the
statement of Mr Moramazy to which we have referred.  The DFP  here  is,  the
appellant said, a small and relatively loose  organisation.   There  are  no
membership cards and, although there was a subscription, that was only  paid
by those who could afford it.  He has attended seven meetings since  January
2005, all in members' homes in London except one, which  was  held  at  what
the appellant described as "a fellow activist in  [the  DPF]"  in  Brighton,
where the appellant was living.  The meetings were attended by between  four
and ten people.  The smallest meeting was attended  by  the  leader  of  the
group, who was named in the evidence, and two  others.   Generally,  at  the
meetings they discussed what was happening in  the  Ahwazi  area,  including
the fate of Ahwazis in Syria and Iran who were waiting to be  executed.   In
addition to the meetings, they had contact in  private  chat  rooms  on  the
internet, in which up to ten people took part.

Additionally, he had attended four political demonstrations  with  the  DPF.
The first was in May  2005,  when  they  demonstrated  outside  the  Iranian
Embassy in London to protest against the killing of  Arab  demonstrators  in
Ahwaz that had happened in the previous month.  The next was on  18  October
2006, again outside the Iranian Embassy,  to  protest  against  the  Iranian
government's decision to hang nineteen ethnic Arabs from  the  Ahwaz  region
following allegedly  unfair  trials.   On  29  March  2007,  he  attended  a
demonstration outside the Arab League offices in London in  support  of  the
Ahwazis  being  detained  in  Syria.   He  said  the  demonstration  was   a
collective demonstration by  a  number  of  Ahwazi  parties.   He  said  the
maximum number of people at the demonstration was twenty, and he produced  a
number of photos of him at that demonstration, wearing a fluorescent  jacket
and standing in a prominent position, some of which had been posted  on  the
Al-Ahwaz website.  Finally, in April 2007, he attempted  to  attend  another
demonstration in front of the Iranian Embassy in connection with  the  Ahwaz
uprising, but they were not allowed to demonstrate outside the  embassy  and
the event was cancelled.

The appellant said that, in addition to meetings and demonstrations, he  was
active in talking to other young Ahwazis and trying to draw  them  into  the
organisation and he  collected  donations,  although  these  were  small  in
amount.  He said he had taken part in numerous social  events  of  the  DPF,
including celebrations of Eid at the end of Ramadan every year.

In addition to the evidence of the appellant and Mr Moramazy,  we  also  had
before us a letter from the Ahwazian Arab People's Democratic Popular  Front
dated 21 October 2004 identifying  the  appellant  as  a  supporter  of  the
organisation who has been participating in  its  activities  in  the  United
Kingdom, and describing him as a political activist  in  "our  homeland  Al-
Ahwaz and he flee to seek refuge abroad as a persecuted Arab".   The  letter
of 30 January 2007 describes the appellant as a member of the  organisation,
and "an Arab political activist  who  has  been  supporting  [the  DPF]  and
sharing the organisation's political and social  activities".   That  letter
suggests that he would be in trouble in the event of his return.

The appellant confirmed that he had no specific  evidence,  such  as  arrest
warrants, showing that the Iranian authorities had  a  lasting  interest  in
him.

Ms Naik for the appellant did not submit that Ahwazi Arabs were  per  se  at
risk on return to Iran.  However, she contended that, on the  basis  of  the
evidence we have summarised above, the appellant would be at  real  risk  on
return.  To enable us to consider that submission in its proper context,  we
need to have in mind the background evidence in relation to  conditions  for
Ahwazi Arabs in Iran.  It is to that we now turn.

Risk Factors on Return to Iran

SB (risk on return - illegal exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053  identified  a
number of risk factors for those who, like the  appellant,  return  to  Iran
having left that country illegally.  Those are the starting  point  in  this
case.  The risk factors were as follows:

  "(i)       Events  in  Iran  following  the  12  June  2009  presidential
  elections have led to a  government  crackdown  on  persons  seen  to  be
  opposed to the present government and the Iranian  judiciary  has  become
  even less independent.  Persons who are likely to  be  perceived  by  the
  authorities in Iran as being actively associated  with  protests  against
  the June 12 election results may face a real risk of persecution or  ill-
  treatment, although much will depend on the particular circumstances.


  (ii)      Iranians facing enforced return do not in general face  a  real
  risk of persecution or ill-treatment.  That remains the case even if they
  exited Iran illegally.  Having exited Iran illegally is not a significant
  risk factor, although if  it  is  the  case  that  a  person  would  face
  difficulties with the authorities for other reasons, such a history could
  be a factor adding to the level of difficulties he or she  is  likely  to
  face.


  (iii)     Being a person who has left Iran when facing court  proceedings
  (other than ordinary civil proceedings) is a risk factor,  although  much
  will depend on the  particular  facts  relating  to  the  nature  of  the
  offence(s) involved and other circumstances.  The more the  offences  for
  which a person faces trial are likely to  be  viewed  as  political,  the
  greater the level of risk  likely  to  arise  as  a  result.   Given  the
  emphasis placed both by the expert report of Dr Kakkhi and the April 2009
  Danish fact-finding report's  sources  on  the  degree  of  risk  varying
  according to the nature of  the  court  proceedings,  being  involved  in
  ongoing  court  proceedings  is  not  in  itself  something   that   will
  automatically result in  ill-treatment;  rather  it  is  properly  to  be
  considered as a risk factor to be taken into account along with others.


  (iv)      Being a person involved in court proceedings in  Iran  who  has
  engaged in conduct likely to be seen as insulting either to the judiciary
  or the justice system or the government or to Islam  constitutes  another
  risk factor indicating an increased level of risk of persecution or  ill-
  treatment on return.


  (v) Being accused of anti-Islamic conduct  likewise  also  constitutes  a
  significant risk factor..."

Conditions for Ahwazi Arabs in Iran

By way of background, after the First World War, when the British  had  much
influence in the area, there was a  considerable  movement  for  the  Ahwazi
Arabs to be granted self-determination.  However,  following  the  discovery
of oil in the region, the Iranian authorities were determined to thwart  any
separatist movement. About 80% of Iran's oil now  comes  from  that  region.
Some politically active Ahwazi  Arabs  now  refer  to  the  Iranians  as  an
occupying force.  We  found  the  passage  headed  "Key  Points"  in  Jane's
Intelligence Review for January 2008 to be  particularly  illuminating.   It
says:

  "As Iran plans for possible military conflict with the US, it is  anxious
  to prevent militant ethnic groups from rebelling in the event the central
  government is weakened.
  The south-western province of Khuzestan is a  centre  for  Iran's  energy
  industry in terms of recoverable deposits and infrastructure. Tehran also
  views it as a gateway to Iraqi markets.


  Local economic conditions in Khuzestan remained stagnant.  Popular  anger
  could foster militancy among  the  ethnic  Arabs  of  the  province,  and
  jeopardise Iran's lifeline."


Ms Enayat described a recent programme  of  "Persianisation"  of  Khuzestan,
i.e. encouragement from the Iranian Government  to  Arabs  in  Khuzestan  to
emigrate, and to Persians to move into the region.   The  publication  of  a
letter, allegedly written by the  Vice  President  of  Iran,  sparked  major
unrest in the region, and a substantial number of deaths and arrests.  As  a
result, in  June  2006,  the  Khuzestan  Revolutionary  Court  announced  35
Ahwazis  had  been  sentenced  to  death.   There  are  reports   that   the
interrogation of these men "fell  short  of  international  standards".   Ms
Enayat said that the situation in Khuzestan remained tense, describing  "the
acute political crisis that followed" the elections: and, as  recognised  in
SB, following the June 2009 elections, there has been a crackdown  on  those
seen to oppose the government.  It  seems  clear  from  this  evidence  that
those who oppose the Iranian authorities in a high profile  way  may  be  at
very grave risk.

In respect of the risk on return  to  those  who  are  low  level  political
activists, Dr Joffe,  in  his  supplementary  report  of  28  January  2007,
commented that the

  "low level discontent and resentment  that  has  characterised  attitudes
  amongst the Ahwazi Arabs has  become  far  more  acute  and  the  Iranian
  authorities have become far less tolerant of it."


Ms Enayat gave evidence that, on return, she considered  that  it  would  be
"virtually impossible" for citizens who  left  Iran  without  proper  papers
(passport and exit visas), through unauthorised  border  posts,  to  conceal
that fact, whether  they  apply  for  redocumentation  or  obtain  temporary
documentation in the course of removal procedures.  She  said  she  did  not
think that the  appellant  could  conceal  either  that  he  had  left  Iran
illegally, or that he had sought asylum in the United Kingdom.

She also cited a report from the Wall Street Journal (3  December  2009)  as
to how the faces of people arriving at Imam  Khomeini  Airport  are  checked
against photographs taken at demonstrations.  She said that the  airport  at
Tehran did have a computerised record system that  would  check  for  people
with "outstanding business  with  the  Iranian  authorities",  but  she  was
unable to explain how the database supporting the computer was compiled.

She said that there would  be  "a  substantial  risk"  that  anyone  with  a
persistent connection with an Arab Iranian political  party  in  the  United
Kingdom, for example because of participation  in  demonstrations  or  other
forms of activity, would be known to  the  authorities  in  Iran,  and  they
would be, at the very least, detained and interrogated on return.  The  fact
that  the  appellant  came  from   London   would   cause   him   particular
difficulties.  The Iranian authorities cultivated the belief that there  was
a London connection with terrorist activity in Khuzestan, and they  continue
to accuse the West in general  and  the  United  Kingdom  in  particular  of
playing an active part in stirring up demonstrations.

She drew our attention to a Human Rights Watch study (Iran: End  Persecution
of Peaceful Activists 9  June  2010).   This  recorded  a  common  practice,
typically used against student demonstrators, of  people  being  taken  away
for limited detention lasting a  few  days,  during  which  time  they  were
severely beaten.  Such periods of detention may not lead to  prison  records
or court documents because they  were  conducted  by  agencies  outside  the
prison service, but records would be kept by  the  security  services.   She
relied particularly on various Human Rights Watch Reports to  conclude  that
although a public record may not have been kept of a period of detention  by
the security forces, the security  forces  would  have  their  own  records.
Release by bribery did not mean that a record  would  not  have  been  kept.
She said that travel within Iran made little difference to the  availability
of the records.  The country operated a gozinesh system which  makes  access
to education, employment, military  and  governmental  services  conditional
upon a rigorous ideological screening to assure a devotion  to  the  state's
official ideology of Islam.  Accordingly, there was  a  government  file  on
most people in Iran, whether or not they were  politically  active,  and  it
followed them about. Most contacts with authority, such as  applying  for  a
trading licence, prompted examination of the record.

Ms Enayat said that there were currently between 2m and 8m  Arabs  in  Iran,
it being impossible to give a better estimate than that.  She made it  clear
that she did not consider Ahwazi Arabs to be at risk in, or  on  return  to,
Iran,  per  se.   Whether  an  Ahwazi  Arab  was  at  risk  on  return   was
multifactoral.

With rather disarming frankness she said that assessing  the  risk  for  the
appellant was based on fairly speculative evidence.  She could  only  "build
up a picture".  As we have indicated, she  did  not  believe  the  appellant
would be at risk just for being an Ahwazi Arab, although  she  thought  that
Ahwazi Arabs were in a more precarious position than other Iranians.   Their
Arab ethnicity made the  authorities  inclined  to  target  them.   However,
everything  depended  on  their  degree  of  perceived  political  activity,
immigration history and reasons for  leaving  Iran  and  the  likelihood  of
being involved politically in Iran.  Links with  a  separatist  organisation
would  enhance  the  interest  if  it  was  discovered,  the  aspiration  to
independence being troubling to the Iranian government.  She  believed  that
attending a simple demonstration was capable  of  enhancing  risk  in  Iran.
She believed the appellant would  be  at  risk  if  he  were  identified  as
someone who  had  previously  been  detained  by  the  security  forces  for
leafleting, and the risk was greater if he were known to  have  demonstrated
or otherwise been politically active in the United  Kingdom.   The  fact  he
had been in the United Kingdom for six years would lead to a  greater  level
of  enquiry,  and  an  enhanced  risk.   She   considered   that,   in   the
circumstances, the appellant would be at substantial risk of being  detained
immediately on return.

She considered that even low level activists were likely to be detained  and
subject to ill-treatment, although Ms Enayat said there is a  court  at  the
airport and the appellant  could  be  prosecuted  there.   If  a  low  level
activist were pursued through the  justice  system,  he  would  not  in  her
opinion be likely to face the death penalty, but he could  expect  sentences
of up to 5 years' imprisonment.

She was asked if it was likely  that  a  person,  such  as  the  appellant's
brother, would be detained without charge  for  five  years  or  more.   She
frankly said she found that a difficult  question:  but  she  would  not  be
surprised by a relative being detained for a relatively  short  period,  say
12 to 24 hours.

The Parties' Submissions

We have already referred to the first refusal  letter  of  25  August  2004,
which is very brief.  In the further refusal letter of  16  June  2010,  the
Secretary of State  noted  that  the  appellant  now  relied  on  additional
evidence that his brother was detained as a result of the  appellant's  exit
from Iran, and that the appellant was at further risk  now  because  he  had
been supporting the DPF  in  the  United  Kingdom,  as  we  have  described.
However, the Secretary of State did not believe that a  person  sufficiently
well-connected  to  procure  the  appellant's  release  from  custody  would
himself be detained, and certainly not for a time in excess  of  six  years,
for no better reason than being the brother of the person who  was  arrested
and released for distributing leaflets.   It  was  further  maintained  that
even if the core claims were true, that would not  create  difficulties  for
the appellant in the event of his return, because they would  not  be  known
by the authorities in  Iran.   She  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant's
political activities in the United Kingdom were of a  "scale  and  type"  to
attract the attention of the authorities.

Mr Melvin's submissions were based upon those reasons.   He  submitted  that
the appellant is  not  a  credible  political  activist,  and,  despite  his
previous arrest for leafleting, he would not  be  of  any  interest  to  the
Iranian authorities on return.  The  activities  of  the  DPF  he  described
lacked any organisation and, Mr Melvin submitted, credibility.  The  Iranian
authorities would not, he submitted, be aware of the appellant's  low  level
political activities in the United Kingdom, even if we were to  accept  that
he had indulged in such activities.

Ms Naik submitted that we should find  that  the  Iranian  authorities  have
detained both the appellant's brother and father, and would be aware of  his
political activities (as he described them) in the  United  Kingdom.   Given
that he illegally exited Iran and has been in the  United  Kingdom  for  six
years (during which time he has claimed asylum), he will  be  of  particular
interest to the Iranian authorities, who will be aware of those  facts:  and
it is likely that there will be a security services record of his  detention
for leafleting in 2004.  In all the circumstances,  she  submitted  that  we
should find that the appellant has proved his case, and we should allow  the
appeal.

Burden and Standard of Proof

We remind ourselves that before us it is, of course, for  the  appellant  to
prove that there is a real risk of his being persecuted or treated in a  way
incompatible with his  rights  under  the  Qualification  Directive  or  the
European Convention on Human Rights in the event of his return to Iran,  but
that the evidence required to overcome  that  hurdle  is  modest.   He  will
succeed in his appeal if he  shows  there  is  a  real  risk  of  his  being
persecuted in the event of  his  return.   All  of  the  findings  below  or
suggested above are made following a consideration  of  the  evidence  as  a
whole.

Findings

Although Ms Enayat has not  visited  Iran  since  1979,  her  opinions  were
supported by extensive, frequent  and  recent  examination  of  reports  and
information emanating from Iran.  She is in frequent  contact  with  Iranian
nationals, and others who live in Iran.  Her  evidence  was  not  shaken  in
cross-examination.  In relation to the general situation in Iran,  including
the general situation for Ahwazi Arabs in Iran,  we  consider  her  evidence
well-informed, and we accept her evidence about things  that  have  happened
in Iran. We find her predictions about future risks to be  illuminating  and
informed but we have to assess risk by applying the legal criteria  set  out
in the Refugee Convention and the Refugee Qualification Directive,  and  the
ECHR. A person whom she considers to be at  risk  will  not  necessarily  be
entitled to international protection.  Although Prof  Joffe's  evidence  was
shorter and more general than Ms Enayat's, we also  consider  that  evidence
well-informed and useful.  We do not accept that an Iranian  from  the  Arab
areas would risk persecution for that reason  alone  in  the  event  of  his
return.  Although there is considerable evidence in the background  material
to show that the authorities Iran lose no opportunity to  show  their  power
in the Arab areas, it is going too far to say that every Iranian Arab  risks
persecution.  That was not the appellant's case,  nor  would  it  have  been
supported by either  Ms  Enayat  or  the  other  evidence  before  us.   The
authorities  are  suspicious  of  Iranian  Arabs.   Such  people  might   be
interrogated more  vigorously  or  generally  attract  more  attention  than
Iranian who are not Arabs - and in that  sense  being  an  Ahwazi  Arab  may
enhance the risks on return - but a person who was  not  otherwise  at  risk
would not be at risk just because of his Arab ethnicity.

Low level support in the United  Kingdom  for  separatist  activities  is  a
feature that increases the risk of persecution.  Even if a  person  was  not
particularly sincere or particularly well-informed,  links  with  separatist
groups could easily provoke ill-treatment of the kind  that  this  appellant
received before he left Iran.

In  relation  to  the   appellant   specifically,   certain   findings   are
straightforward.  It has already been established by the Immigration  Judge,
and we confirm, that the appellant was  detained  by  the  Iranian  security
forces for three days in 2004 as a result of  leafleting  in  the  cause  of
Arab separatism.  He was ill-treated during  that  period  detention,  being
blindfolded and beaten - and he was released on payment of a  bribe  by  his
brother.

We also accept that the appellant was smuggled over the border  into  Turkey
with the support of his brother, shortly after his release.  Although it  is
a criminal offence to assist anyone to leave Iran irregularly,  it  is  also
clear that many  people  do  depart  from  Iran  through  the  border  where
security is lax.  We accept the evidence that, although his brother did  not
approve of his political activities and was angry when he was  arrested  for
them, there would be a strong cultural pressure on the  appellant's  brother
to support him: and it does not surprise us  in  the  least  that  both  the
appellant and his brother would want the appellant to leave  Iran  after  he
had been so ill used.

We also find it at least reasonably likely that some record would have  been
kept of the appellant's detention.  The Secretary  of  State  suggests  that
the appellant was treated irregularly and, in  effect,  was  the  victim  of
unofficial summary punishment which the authorities would have no reason  to
record.  This, we find, misunderstands the nature of the Basiji.   The  fact
that they operate outside the ordinary legal system is no reason at  all  to
think that they would be coy about recording their activities and  concerns.
 That was the firm evidence of Ms Enayat, which we accept.  We note as  well
that there would be no reason to bring  the  appellant  before  a  court  or
justify his detention because the security forces are not restrained by  the
rule of law.  Even by Iranian standards, the appellant had not  committed  a
grave offence.   He  was  relatively  young,  and  apparently  inexperienced
politically.  We consider it is  quite  possible,  indeed  likely,  that  in
those circumstances that the  Basiji  would  want  to  interrogate  him  and
frightened him: but they had  no  obvious  reason  to  want  to  detain  him
indefinitely.  They could achieve those  ends  by  releasing  him  into  the
community, where he could report his bad experiences  and  so  possibly  cow
others.    Additionally they could benefit themselves  by  taking  a  bribe.
The records could show correctly  that  the  appellant  had  been  released.
They would not, of course, be bound to record that a  bribe  was  paid  too.
It is not easy for a person used to the liberal ways of Western  democracies
to appreciate how readily and comprehensively some regimes keep  records  on
their citizens. We have no reason whatsoever to doubt Ms  Enayat's  evidence
about the gozinesh system, or to doubt that arrest and short-term  detention
for leafleting is exactly the kind of  information  that  will  be  recorded
there.

Neither do we have any difficulty in  accepting  that  it  is  the  kind  of
information that  would  come  to  light  in  the  event  of,  and  on,  the
appellant's return to Iran.  The appellant left Iran  irregularly.   He  has
been in the United Kingdom for six years.  We  accept  the  evidence  of  Ms
Enayat that those two matters would enhance the appellant's risk on  return.
 Even the most benign questions concerning his  identity  and  circumstances
of leaving Iran would be at least reasonably likely to  highlight  the  fact
that he had left  irregularly.   Ms  Enayat  considered  that  it  would  be
virtually impossible for that not to come out: we accept that.  It is but  a
short step from there to find it reasonably likely that the appellant  would
be interrogated, and would have to admit that he  left  without  permission.
Again, it is at least reasonably likely that, armed with  such  information,
the Iranians authorities would look up the appellant's  records,  and  would
find that he had been detained because he had been leafleting in the  course
of Arab separatism.

It does not follow that he would necessarily  be  persecuted.   However,  he
would be linked in the minds of the authorities  with  the  Arab  separatist
cause.  We accept the evidence that the  authorities  in  Iran  believe  the
Arab separatist cause to be particularly well organised  in  London  and  we
accept the evidence  that  there  is  heightened  suspicion  towards  anyone
coming from London because of the activities in opposition  to  the  present
regime that were said to be encouraged by the United Kingdom at the time  of
the election.  These are all factors which heightened risk on  return  to  a
regime that, on the evidence before us,  does  oppress  political  opponents
and does abuse human rights.
There are some matters contended by Ms Naik that we do not  accept.   We  do
not accept that the  appellant  faces  a  real  risk  of  unlawfully  severe
punishment for the offence of leaving Iran without permission: nor  that  he
would face a real risk of persecution or  ill-treatment  merely  because  he
exited Iran illegally.  We confirm SB in that regard.  The  risk  that  this
appellant faces is not unjust punishment or  ill-treatment  because  of  his
illegal exit from Iran, but ill-treatment because of his political beliefs.

We are also not persuaded that the appellant's  brother  has  been  detained
for a period of six years.  We have not found  anything  in  the  background
material to suggest that such  prolonged  detention  simply  for  being  the
brother of a suspect happens with sufficient frequency  to  present  a  real
risk in this case.  Indeed, we have not seen  any  evidence  that  detention
for six years in remotely similar circumstances has ever occurred.  We  also
agree with  Mr  Melvin  that  it  is  in  inherently  incongruous  that  the
appellant should be released into the custody  of  his  brother,  albeit  on
payment of a bribe, and for his brother to be  almost  immediately  detained
in an effort to secure the appellant's return.   We  think  it  more  likely
that the appellant was released because the authorities had  done  all  they
wished to do with him at that time, except obtain a bribe for  his  release,
which they did.

Although the  evidence  before  us  is  not  optimal,  we  accept  that  the
appellant's father has died.  It is not unbelievable that a 52-year-old  man
should die of a brain  haemorrhage,  and,  although  we  do  not  have  full
confidence in the death certificate produced, we  have  no  good  reason  to
disregard it.  But, in any event, we are not persuaded that the  appellant's
father died as a result of ill-treatment.  At the risk of being  repetitive,
we do not  consider  it  likely  that  the  authorities  would  release  the
appellant in the circumstances that they did, and then  to  ruin  two  lives
trying to find him again.  In reaching this conclusion, we have  had  regard
to the written evidence of Mr Moramazy: but he did not attend before us  and
was not cross-examined, and  he  did  not  claim  to  be  giving  first-hand
evidence but was merely passing on what he had been told.  We  do  not  give
his evidence any great weight.

Neither do  we  give  any  weight  to  Mr  Moramazy's  suggestion  that  the
appellant risked execution in the event of his return.  We  have  not  found
any background  evidence  suggesting  that  modest  support  for  separatist
activities in the United Kingdom is reasonably likely to lead  to  execution
in Iran.  We acknowledge evidence of  Arab  separatists  being  killed,  but
there is no  reason  to  think  the  appellant  would  be  linked  with  any
particular kind of serious separatist activity or somehow assumed  to  be  a
high level activist.  Ms Enayat did not consider low level  activists  faced
execution.  We are not persuaded that the  appellant  would  face  risk  the
worst kind of persecution: but we do accept that he risks  detention  and  a
violent  interrogation,  which  would  be  sufficient  to  entitle  him   to
international protection.

We do not accept that he is part of any  structure  or  organised  political
group in the United Kingdom.  Indeed, he did  not  himself  describe  it  in
that way, but said that he was involved in a loose  grouping  of  people  of
like mind, which we accept.
We are satisfied that the appellant does engage on an internet blog of  some
kind: but we are not persuaded  that  there  is  a  real  risk  of  the  web
activities of the appellant  in  the  United  Kingdom  having  come  to  the
attention of  the  authorities  in  Iran.   We  are  quite  unaware  of  any
electronic mechanism by which the group could have been monitored,  and  the
identity of its members revealed.  It is possible that the  group  has  been
infiltrated by security agents, but there was no good reason to  think  that
this is so.  Evidence of extensive activity by the Iranian  security  forces
in Germany does not  mean  that  they  are  equally  active  in  the  United
Kingdom.  It was the appellant's evidence that  the  participants  exercised
discretion in the way they identified themselves.  It is not clear  how  the
identity of the particular contributor would come to the attention of  other
contributors even if it  were  being  sought.  The  appellant  said  the  he
belonged to a "private chat  room".  We  are  not  aware  of  any  means  of
discovering such a chat room  through  internet  searches  and  it  was  not
suggested to us that it could be discovered in  such  a  way,  or  that  its
contributors could be identified.

The appellant's conduct at diverse demonstrations  is  a  different  matter.
It is quite clear that he has taken part in demonstrations, and that  on  at
least one occasion he was conspicuously dressed in a fluorescent jacket  and
in a prominent position.  In an  age  when  a  significant  portion  of  the
population permanently carries with it a camera as an accessory to a  mobile
phone, we consider it likely that a regime as nervous as that  which  is  in
power in Iran would routinely photograph those who demonstrated against  it.
 It is less easy to see how such people would be identified.   The  evidence
is of people who may know being asked to look at large numbers of still  and
moving pictures and asked to identify someone.  We are  confident  that  the
more  frequently  a  person  draws  attention  to  himself,  and  the   more
effectively he draws attention to himself, the more likely it would be  that
someone might identify him.  If, as seems to be the  case,  the  authorities
rely on people who, for whatever reason, are  willing  to  name  names  when
shown a photograph, it is possible that a person who took a very minor  part
in only one demonstration could be named.  We  think  it  reasonably  likely
that this appellant would have done enough for his name to have come to  the
attention of the Iranian authorities, and for it to have been passed  on  to
the relevant authorities where an entry would have been made  on  his  file.
It makes little difference to this case as we are  satisfied  the  appellant
does face a real risk of being identified because of  his  past  activities,
but it illustrates the kind of judgment that might have to be  made  in  the
case of a person who claims to be noticed as a result of  demonstrating  but
has no past history.

Nothing before us persuades us that the risk factors for those returning  to
Iran having exited illegally identified in SB require amendment.

Conclusion on the Appellant's Asylum Claim

We consider that the appellant is a refugee, and clearly  so.   Particularly
in view of his Arab ethnicity, his  past  arrest  and  detention  for  anti-
government  leafleting  (which  will  have  been  recorded  by  the  Iranian
security services) and his lengthy stay in the United Kingdom,  we  consider
that, on return, the appellant faces a real risk of persecution  because  of
his political opinion.
In the  circumstances,  it  is  not  necessary  to  engage  with  Ms  Naik's
submissions as to how the appellant would manifest his  political  views  in
the event of his return, although his  clear  evidence  was  that  he  would
continue his anti-government political activities if he were to return.   We
are satisfied that he would be at risk on arrival in Iran.

For those reasons, we allow the appellant's appeal on the asylum claim.

The Appellant's Human Rights Claim

Ms Naik did not stress the appellant's claim on human rights  grounds  as  a
separate claim, no doubt on the basis that such a claim  would  not  succeed
if the appellant's claim to asylum failed.  However, for  the  reasons  that
we find the appellant to be refugee, we also find that, on return  to  Iran,
he would face a real risk of ill-treatment sufficiently severe to make  that
return contrary to his rights under article 3 of the European Convention  on
Human Rights, and we consequently also allow  his  appeal  on  human  rights
grounds.
