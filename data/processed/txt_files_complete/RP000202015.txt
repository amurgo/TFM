Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Markus of Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Yaqub Sadeq Ahmed, was born on 3 December 1988 and is  a
    citizen of Somalia.  He appealed against a decision of  the  respondent
    dated 17 February 2015  to  deport  him  to  Somalia.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Colyer) in  a  decision  promulgated  on  1  July  2016
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. I state at the outset that  Judge  Colyer  has  produced  an  extremely
    detailed decision running to some 47 pages.  Although I have found that
    the judge has erred in law, I acknowledge that a  great  deal  of  hard
    work has gone into the preparation of his decision.

 3. The author of the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Mr Markus of
    Counsel made detailed oral submissions to the Upper  Tribunal.   I  was
    also assisted by Mr Bates, who appeared for the Secretary of State.  In
    short I find that I agree with most of the grounds of appeal although I
    shall endeavour to be as succinct as  practicable  in  identifying  the
    errors of law.

 4. As the judge recalled at [29] the appellant was born in Medina which is
    part of Mogadishu.  He claims to be a member of the Reer Hamar clan and
    his sub-sub-clan is  Bandhabow.   He  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    October  2003.   On  19  November  2003,  the  appellant  was   granted
    indefinite leave to remain as  a  refugee.   On  27  August  2008,  the
    appellant was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for the rape  of  a
    female aged 16 years or over and conspiracy to rape a  female  aged  16
    years of over.  The appellant was  notified  on  12  May  2010  of  his
    liability to deportation and, by a letter dated 12 June  2012,  of  the
    intention of the Secretary of State to revoke his indefinite  leave  to
    remain (see Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002). Following representations from the appellant's  solicitors,  the
    appellant was notified again of his liability to deportation on 23 June
    2014 and, on 30 September 2014, the UNHCR was notified of the intention
    of the Secretary of State to terminate the appellant's refugee  status.
    The UNCHR wrote in response to the Secretary of  State  on  24  October
    2014.  The  appellant  had  been  sentenced  to  21  days  in  a  young
    offender's institution in September 2007 for an assault on a  constable
    and had also been fined ï¿½100  for  being  drunk  and  disorderly.   The
    appellant was sentenced for those offences on 4  September  2007.   The
    letter containing the  Secretary  of  States  reasons  for  making  the
    decision to deport the appellant and its response  to  the  appellant's
    solicitor's representations is dated 22 April 2015 (I  shall  hereafter
    refer to it as the Decision Letter).

 5. I shall deal with the grounds of appeal in  the  order  in  which  they
    appear in  the  notice  seeking  permission  and  in  which  Mr  Markus
    addressed the grounds in his oral  submission.   First,  the  appellant
    asserts that the judge conducted the  hearing  unfairly  and  that  the
    reasoning of the judge's decision is confused and unclear.  At  [31]  -
    [33] the judge refers to a letter from  Paragon  Law  (the  appellant's
    representatives) which is dated 20 August 2012.  He recorded that  this
    letter indicated that the appellant had left Somalia in  1992  and  had
    lived in Ethiopia before arriving in the United Kingdom in  2003.   The
    judge noted that the appellant himself had not indicated  that  he  had
    lived in Ethiopia.  The judge regarded this apparent  contradiction  as
    damaging of the appellant's credibility although he does not  state  in
    terms why he considered that to be the case.  The  difficulty  is  that
    the judge did not raise this apparent inconsistency during evidence  at
    the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  I accept Mr Markus' submission
    that the apparent inconsistency appears only in  the  letter  from  the
    appellant's solicitors; it does not  appear  at  all  in  the  evidence
    obtained directly from  the  appellant  himself,  for  example  in  the
    witness  statement  or  Asylum   Interview   Record.    Likewise,   the
    inconsistency has not been relied upon by the Secretary of State in the
    Decision Letter.  It would have been a simple matter for the  judge  to
    have put the apparent inconsistency to the appellant at the hearing and
    I accept  Mr  Markus'  submission  that  the  source  of  the  apparent
    inconsistency (i.e. not the appellant, but his solicitors) may possibly
    have explained the inaccuracy contained in the letter.   I  acknowledge
    also that the truthfulness of the appellant's initial account of how he
    became a refugee (that is, how he came to leave Somalia  in  2003)  had
    been accepted by the  respondent  and  that  refugee  status  had  been
    granted to the appellant on  that  basis.   Furthermore,  the  apparent
    inconsistency appears to have carried a great deal  of  weight  in  the
    judge's assessment of the appellant's credibility.  At [141 - 142]  the
    judge states that he "did not find  the  appellant  to  be  a  credible
    witness and I have significant doubts about the truthfulness of many of
    the details of the appellant's  accounts."   Other  than  the  apparent
    inconsistency to which I have referred above, it is not  at  all  clear
    what those "accounts" may be or, indeed, what are  the  "many  details"
    regarding which the judge had "significant doubts."  Later in the  same
    paragraph,  the  judge  refers  to  "a  number  of  accounts  that  are
    contradictory or lacking in credibility and the significant absence  of
    details or  candidness."   Leaving  aside  the  apparent  inconsistency
    regarding Ethiopia, it is entirely unclear as to where in  his  account
    the appellant has omitted details or has given evidence which were  not
    candid.  At [142] the  judge  also  states  that,  on  account  of  the
    appellant's criminal record, the  appellant's  credibility  is  further
    diminished.  The appellant's offence, although  extremely  serious,  is
    not one involving dishonesty or deception.  It was not  clear  why  the
    offending of which the appellant  has  been  convicted  could,  without
    further explanation, diminish his  credibility  as  a  witness  in  his
    asylum appeal.

 6. The Upper Tribunal should certainly  hesitate  before  finding  that  a
    judge's assessment of credibility at fault in the grounds of inadequate
    reasoning.  In this appeal, however, the judge appears to have  reached
    a view of the appellant's credibility which, whilst robustly stated, is
    problematic for the reasons I have outlined.

 7. Ground (iv) which concerns the judge's analysis of the cessation of the
    appellant's refugee status at [133 - 136].  The  judge  has  failed  to
    state clearly that the burden of proof as regards cessation  rested  on
    the Secretary of State.  The  judge's  failure  to  refer  to  relevant
    jurisprudence (eg. Abdulla [2011] QB 46) is not in itself an  error  of
    law but relevant legal principles do not appear to have been engaged in
    the analysis.  The judge makes no reference to the  UNHCR  Handbook  on
    Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee  Status  or  the  UNHCR
    Guidelines on International Protection Number 3: Cessation  of  Refugee
    Status under Article 1C(5) and (6).   It  is  not  clear  that  he  has
    considered whether or not the circumstances which existed at  the  time
    of the grant of refugee status to the appellant still  existed  in  any
    part of Somalia; Mr Markus acknowledged that the country guidance  case
    of MOJ (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) deals,  as
    the title of the case suggests, with Mogadishu only.   Mr  Markus,  who
    also appeared before the First-tier Tribunal, pointed out that evidence
    had been adduced to the First-tier Tribunal to show  that  clan-related
    violence  did  exist  elsewhere  in  Somalia  outside  Mogadishu.   The
    relevance of that evidence in the application of the  UNHCR  Guidelines
    as  regards  cessation  has  not  been  considered  by  the  judge.   I
    acknowledge Mr Bates' submission that, in reality, this  appellant  who
    comes from Mogadishu is unlikely to wish to live elsewhere in  Somalia.
    However, I agree with Mr Markus that the judge's analysis is ultimately
    undermined by his failure to engage with relevant legal issues which  I
    am satisfied were raised at the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

 8. Further inconsistencies of reasoning appear in relation to the  judge's
    findings regarding the presence of family members and  friends  of  the
    appellant in Somalia.  At [112], the judge found that he was "not in  a
    position to find whether the appellant does or does  not  have  family,
    friends or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu."  There was  no
    suggestion that the appellant had family members  living  elsewhere  in
    Somalia.  However, at [117]  the  judge  refers  to  the  existence  of
    "potential financial and other support that [the appellant] may be able
    to arrange through his family and friends in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    Somalia." [My emphasis].  Again, at [131] the judge  stated  that  "the
    appellant's family are from Somalia and there may be family and friends
    to whom the appellant may have access on his return to his  country  of
    origin."   These  statements  are  not  consistent  with  the   judge's
    statement at [112] that he was "not in a position" to make any findings
    as to whether the appellant has relatives in Somalia.   The  suggestion
    at [131] that there "may be" family and friends in  Somalia  who  might
    assist the appellant is, as Mr  Markus  submitted,  a  poor  basis  for
    concluding that the appellant  would  not  face  living  conditions  in
    Somalia capable of posing a real risk to his welfare.

 9. Mr Bates acknowledged that the judge had made an error at  [124]  where
    he deals with the UK Home Office  Border  Agency  Operational  Guidance
    Note; Somalia (October 2012)  which  refers  to  "the  facilitation  of
    return  and  possible  assistance  that  would  be  available  to   the
    appellant."  The parts of the Guidance which the judge then quotes [5.5
    - 5.9] do not apply to deportees to Somalia from the United Kingdom.  I
    note also that the  respondent  did  not  rely  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the availability of this scheme to  assist  the  appellant.
    It is not clear to what extent the (wrongly cited)  Guidance  Note  may
    have figured in the judge's reasoning given that he was mistaken as  to
    its relevance.

10. For the reasons which I have identified above, I find that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal has erred in law such that the decision falls to  be  set
    aside.  I have highlighted those grounds of appeal which I consider  to
    be particularly pertinent in leading me to set aside the decision but I
    find that there was fault also in the grounds of appeal to which I have
    not  made  detailed  reference.   Those  grounds  include  the  judge's
    assessment of the appellant's risk of reoffending.  At [54], the  judge
    found that it was "quite apparent that the appellant remains at risk of
    further offending".  Notwithstanding his acceptance at  [51]  that  the
    findings of the Parole Board which included a  finding  that  the  risk
    posed by the appellant was "manageable ... [he]  has  accommodation  in
    approved premises."  I agree also with Mr Markus that  the  appellant's
    rather rosy prospects of obtaining employment in Mogadishu described by
    the judge are not borne out by the  statistics  put  before  him  which
    indicated that unemployment amongst young adults was as  high  as  67%.
    Finally, the judge incorrectly referred to the case of Maslov v Austria
    (APP 1638/03) ECTHR as a case only relevant to a "national from an  EEA
    country" at [156].  As the grounds point out Maslov was not exclusively
    concerned with those facing expulsion under Directive 2004/38.

11. I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  heard
    representations from both representatives as  regards  disposal  and  I
    find that, as none of the findings of fact  shall  stand,  it  will  be
    necessary for there to be a complete and  fresh  fact-finding  exercise
    before the  decision  may  be  remade.   That  is  an  exercise  better
    undertaken in the First-tier Tribunal.  In closing, I  would  urge  the
    next Tribunal to consider this consider carefully the grounds of appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal in order to avoid falling into  the  difficulties
    which have vitiated Judge Colyer's decision.

Notice of Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 1 July  2016  is
    set aside.  None of the findings of fact shall stand.   The  appeal  is
    remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (not  judge  Colyer)  for  that
    Tribunal to remake the decision.

13. No anonymity direction is made.
