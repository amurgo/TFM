                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant (hereafter the ECO) appeals against the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Shamash) allowing  the  respondent's  appeal
    against a decision taken on 2 July 2014 to refuse entry clearance as  a
    family visitor.



Introduction

 3. The respondent is a citizen of Pakistan born in 1964.  She  applied  to
    visit her adult son ("the sponsor") who was a Tier 1 migrant with leave
    to remain in the UK until June 2015. He applied for indefinite leave to
    remain in April 2015. He had a wife and new born daughter  in  the  UK.
    The respondent stated in her visa application form that  she  had  five
    sons and two daughters from her first husband who  died  in  2003.  She
    married her second husband in 2006 and was supported by him. She had  a
    total monthly income of about �415-�435.

 4. The ECO accepted the respondent's identity and nationality and that the
    sponsor could support her in the UK but concluded that there was a lack
    of documentation regarding the respondent's circumstances  in  Pakistan
    and there was little to encourage her to leave upon completion  of  her
    visit. The application was refused and the appeal was  reviewed  by  an
    entry clearance manager who noted that the respondent was widowed,  not
    in employment and had  no  demonstrable  form  of  income,  savings  or
    property. There were no details  of  why  Article  8  rights  had  been
    breached by the decision.

The Appeal

 5. The respondent appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  sponsor
    attended an oral hearing at Taylor House on 20 April 2015.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal  found  that  the  respondent  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") and that the  basis
    of the refusal was unfounded. The only appeal was under Article 8.  The
    judge found that there was family life  between  the  sponsor  and  the
    respondent. In those circumstances it was for the ECO to  justify  that
    the interference in family life was proportionate.  This  was  a  short
    visit and the respondent had ample  ties  in  Pakistan.  She  had  five
    children and three grandchildren in Pakistan. This was a short visit to
    see a grandchild. It could not be argued that the sponsor  could  visit
    Pakistan because  his  passport  was  with  the  Home  Office.  It  was
    important for family members to be able to visit  their  children  when
    they choose to settle away from home so that family ties and a sense of
    family could be maintained.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  in
    finding that there was family  life  between  the  respondent  and  the
    sponsor in the absence of additional dependency beyond normal emotional
    ties. The judge also failed to consider Adjei (visit visas - Article 8)
    [2015] UKUT 0262 (IAC). Meeting the requirements of the  Rules  is  not
    enough. The sponsor was not present and  settled  in  the  UK  and  his
    application for indefinite leave to remain was not made until  4  April
    2015.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin
    on 10 August 2015. It was arguable  that  the  judge  had  allowed  the
    appeal under Article 8 using it as a general dispensing  power  due  to
    restricted appeal rights. Permission was granted on all grounds.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 9. Mr Wilding submitted that the judge had failed to give any reasons  for
    the finding that Article 8 family life existed between the sponsor  and
    the respondent  and  the  proportionality  assessment  was  inadequate.
    Paragraph 27 of the decision inaccurately summarises Mostafa (Article 8
    in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 {IAC) because it is not correct  to
    say that the ECO must  justify  any  interference  in  family  life  as
    proportionate. The judge did not  engage  with  why  the  decision  was
    disproportionate. The sponsor's passport was not with the  Home  Office
    as at the date of decision. There are at least three material errors of
    law and the decision is manifestly wrong.

10. Mr Hussain submitted that the passport has been with  the  Home  Office
    for at least 7 months. The sponsor's father died at 47 and  the  mother
    wants to see the sponsor and the grandchildren. The  sponsor  is  still
    waiting for his passport and cannot go to Pakistan to visit his mother.
    The respondent is lonely, there is contact and money is being sent.  Mr
    Hussain invited me to take judicial notice of  relevant  case  law  and
    uphold the decision of the First tier Tribunal.

11. I have considered Mostafa and Adjei. The first question to be addressed
    in an appeal against refusal to grant  entry  clearance  as  a  visitor
    where only human rights grounds are available is whether Article  8  of
    ECHR is engaged at all. If it is not, which will  not  infrequently  be
    the case; the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment
    of the decision of the ECO under the Rules and should  not  do  so.  If
    Article 8 is engaged then the Tribunal may need to look at  the  extent
    to which the claimant is said to have failed to meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules because that  may  inform  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise that most follow. As compliance with paragraph 41 of the Rules
    is not a ground of appeal to be decided by the Tribunal,  any  findings
    concerning that will carry little  weight,  especially  if  based  upon
    arguments advanced only by the appellant. If the appellant were to make
    fresh application for entry clearance then the ECO will,  if  requested
    to do so, have regard to the assessment carried out by  the  judge  but
    will not be bound by those findings to  treat  the  appellant  who,  at
    least at the date of  the  appeal  hearing,  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 of the Rules.

12. Mostafa  is  not  authority  for  the  proposition  that,  despite  the
    legitimate legislative intention to remove a right  of  appeal  against
    adverse entry clearance applications in visit cases on the grounds that
    the ECO was wrong to find the claimant did not meet the requirements of
    the Rules, the Tribunal can  nonetheless  continue  to  determine  such
    issues. The point being made in Mostafa at paragraph 24 is simply  that
    where it is established that Article 8 is  in  fact  engaged,  it  will
    still be necessary to assess whether the claimant meets  the  substance
    of the Rules. Put another way, a person who satisfies the Tribunal that
    he does meet the requirements of paragraph 41 of  the  Rules  does  not
    succeed on that account. He  still  has  to  demonstrate  that  refusal
    represents an unlawful infringement of rights protected by  Article  8.
    For a person who does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph  41  to
    succeed in an appeal there would  have  to  be  cogent  and  compelling
    reasons demanding that he should succeed.

13. The Upper Tribunal in Mostafa made it clear that it was dealing with  a
    very narrow range of claimants. In practical terms, that is  likely  to
    be limited to cases where the relationship is that of husband and  wife
    or other close life partners or a parent and minor child and even  then
    it will not necessarily be extended to cases where,  for  example,  the
    proposed visit is based on a whim or will not add significantly to  the
    time that the people involved spend together. It is a question of  fact
    in each case whether relationships  between  adult  relatives  disclose
    sufficiently strong ties such as to fall within the scope of Article 8.
    There can be family life between adults  but  the  issue  will  be  how
    dependent the older relative is upon the younger ones and whether  this
    dependency represents more than normal emotional ties. From Ghising and
    others [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC), adults will  need  to  be  valuing  and
    depending on each other for mutual support and affection.

14. The judge cannot be criticised for failing to  consider  Adjei  because
    that decision was not promulgated until 6 May 2015. However, the  judge
    has given no reasons for the finding at paragraph  27  that  there  was
    family life between the sponsor and the respondent. That is a  material
    error of law. The judge also  took  into  account  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor's passport was with the Home Office as at the date of  hearing.
    That is a further material error of law because the judge  should  have
    considered the fact as they were at the  date  of  decision,  when  the
    sponsor  had  his  passport  and  could  travel  freely  to  visit  the
    respondent. The judge further erred in law by stating at  paragraph  27
    that wherever an appellant meets the requirements of the Rules then  it
    is for the ECO to justify that the interference is proportionate.

15. I have proceeded to remake the decision. In this case, the sponsor  had
    been living in the UK for 10 years and the respondent has never visited
    the UK. There is no finding that the respondent is dependent  upon  the
    sponsor and she has many children in Pakistan. There is no evidence  of
    anything more than usual emotional ties between  the  sponsor  and  the
    respondent. They have clearly not lived together for  many  years.  The
    sponsor is a wholly independent and mature adult with  his  own  family
    unit. Considering the authorities cited  above,  there  is  nothing  to
    justify a finding that the sponsor and  respondent  enjoy  family  life
    together.  The  respondent  has  no  private  life  in  the   UK.   The
    respondent's appeal therefore fails at the first hurdle  identified  in
    Adjei.

16. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the  respondent's
    appeal under Article 8 involved the making of an error of law  and  its
    decision cannot stand. I substitute a fresh  decision  to  dismiss  the
    respondent's appeal against refusal to grant her entry clearance  as  a
    visitor.

17. There is nothing before me to suggest that the findings of the judge in
    relation to the Rules were incorrect as at the date of hearing and  the
    ECO should give appropriate weight to those findings in  the  event  of
    any future application. The respondent is well established in  Pakistan
    with her second husband and  extensive  family  network.  There  is  no
    evidence of any intention to settle in the UK.

Decision

18. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by dismissing the respondent's appeal  against  the
    decision of the ECO.

Signed                          Date   30 October 2015
