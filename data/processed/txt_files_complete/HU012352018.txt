                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 7 July 2007.  His mother is
a British citizen.

On 17 December 2016 the appellant travelled to the UK from Pakistan, where
he had been living with his mother, and entered the UK as a visitor with a
visa valid until 27 November 2018.

On 28 April 2017 the appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK on the
basis of his family life with his mother.

On 11 December 2017 the respondent refused the application.  The Reasons
for Refusal Letter states that the appellant was unable to satisfy any of
the routes to leave to remain under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
and that there were not exceptional circumstances to justify allowing his
application under Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.

The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was
heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Powell.  In a decision
promulgated on 27 March 2018 Judge Powell dismissed the appeal under
Article 8 of the ECHR.  The appellant is now appealing against that
decision.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

Judge Powell considered the appellant's appeal outwith the Immigration
Rules.  He found that even though it would be in the appellant's best
interests to remain in the UK with his mother, who was his primary carer
and had had the main responsibility for his care and upbringing, it would
not be disproportionate to require him to leave the UK.  The judge
commented that the appellant might fall within Paragraph 297 of the
Immigration Rules and in accordance with that paragraph of the Rules could
apply to join his mother in the UK from Pakistan.

The judge attached considerable weight to the public interest in the
operation of "fair but firm immigration control".  He found that the
appellant's mother had brought the appellant to the UK on the pretence of
being a visitor but with the intention of deliberately avoiding immigration
control by remaining in the UK.  The judge concluded that the appellant's
return to Pakistan "is proportionate and necessary and therefore justified
by Article 8.2".

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

The grounds of appeal submit that the decision contains a fundamental
misdirection of law as the judge failed to consider Paragraph 298 of the
Immigration Rules, which sets out the requirements to be met by a person
seeking Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK as the child of a British
citizen.  The grounds acknowledge that the judge was not assisted by both
the respondent and appellant failing to raise this issue.

It is contended in the grounds of appeal, and was argued by Mr Nasim, that
the appellant satisfies the requirements in Paragraph 298 and consequently
the appeal should have been allowed on the basis that removal would be
disproportionate.

The grounds cite TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v The Secretary of State for
the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 where it is stated

"Where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not by reference to an
Article 8 informed requirement, then this will be positively determinative
of that person's Article 8 appeal, provided their case engages Article
8(1), for the very reason that it would then be disproportionate for that
person to be removed".

The grounds also cite SZ (Applicable immigration rules) Bangladesh [2007]
UKAIT 00037 to support the contention that it is permissible to raise
Paragraph 298 at this stage, even though it was not raised either in the
appellant's application or in the First-tier Tribunal.

At paragraph 16 of SZ it is stated:

"However, there will occasionally be situations where the basis of the
application, or the scope of the decision, or the grounds themselves, do
require the Tribunal to consider more than the self-evidently applicable
Rule.  Where there is an obvious link or connection between another Rule
and the primary way in which the application or grounds are put it may be
the obligation of the Tribunal to consider and apply another Rule subject
always to the requirements of fairness.  In particular, if there is reason
to suppose that the appellant may want to challenge the decision on grounds
other than those set out in the notice of appeal, there may in certain
circumstances be an obligation to consider whether the grounds of appeal
should be amended."

To support his submission that the factual circumstances are such that
Paragraph 298 is satisfied Mr Nasim relied on the findings of the judge
that the appellant's mother is his primary carer and that her income,
combined with the financial support provided to her by her father, is
sufficient to meet the appellant's financial needs.

Ms Isherwood argued that it was now too late to raise Paragraph 298 of the
Immigration Rules for the first time.  She maintained that the appellant
had not even applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain and therefore could not
now seek to have his case determined under Paragraph 298. She also argued
that the findings of fact made by the judge did not support a conclusion
that the requirements of Paragraph 298 were satisfied.

Error of Law

This was a human rights appeal under Section 82(1)(b) of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  The issue for the First-
tier Tribunal to determine, therefore, was not whether the appellant was
entitled to a grant of leave under Paragraph 298 of the Immigration Rules,
but whether requiring his removal from the UK would be contrary to Article
8 ECHR.

This does not mean, however, that the Immigration Rules were not relevant.
On the contrary, as the Upper Tribunal in Charles (human rights appeal:
scope) [2018] UKUT 00089 made clear, if the appellant was entitled to leave
under the Rules this would weigh heavily in the proportionality assessment
under Article 8(2) as it would reduce (or remove) the public interest in
removing him from the UK.  Therefore, even though the judge was not
required to determine the appeal under the Immigration Rules he did need to
consider the relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules in order to
undertake an adequate assessment under Article 8 ECHR.

Paragraph 298 of the Rules sets out the requirements to be met by a child
of a British Citizen who is seeking to remain in the UK.  This is precisely
the position of the appellant and therefore it should have been obvious to
the Tribunal that it needed to be considered.  Evaluating the
proportionality of the appellant being removed from the UK without
assessing, as part of this, whether he met the requirements under Paragraph
298, was a material error of law.


Although I accept that the failure to consider Paragraph 298 was a material
error of law, I do not accept the appellant's contention that the judge's
findings of fact inevitably lead to the conclusion that the appellant
satisfies the requirements of that paragraph.  The judge made a number of
factual findings which are relevant to the assessment under Paragraph 298,
but taken alone they are insufficient to determine whether Paragraph 298 is
satisfied.

Re-Made Decision

In re-making the decision, my starting point is that the factual findings
of the First-tier Tribunal were not challenged and are preserved.

I heard evidence from the appellant's mother, as well as submissions from
Mr Nasim and Ms Isherwood, focussing on the issue of whether the appellant
satisfies the requirements of Paragraph 298.

The preserved factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal include:

      a) The appellant's mother is his primary carer and has the main
         responsibility for his care.

      b) The appellant's mother has an income from employment and receives
         financial support from the appellant's grandfather.

The oral evidence of the appellant's mother was that she earns
approximately �800 a month and in addition receives regular substantial
financial support from her father, who has provided this support since she
separated from the appellant's father.  Bank statements were adduced which
corroborate this oral evidence.

In addition, the appellant's mother submitted a tenancy agreement (executed
on 21 December 2017) which shows that she and her mother rent a property
(which they have exclusive use of) for �2,100 a month.  Her evidence is
that she resides in the property with the appellant and her mother.

The appellant's mother also submitted a contract of employment showing a
start date of 7 July 2018.

Mr Nasim argued that the evidence, as summarised above, establishes that
the requirements of Paragraph 298 are met and therefore that there is no
public interest in removing the appellant from the UK.

Ms Isherwood contended that there are gaps in the evidence.  She maintained
that there had not been an adequate explanation as to how the appellant
could afford a monthly rent of �2,100, given her income.  She noted that
although bank statements support that there have been regular transfers
from the appellant's grandfather it had not been established that these
would continue such that the appellant's mother would not become a burden
on the state.  Ms Isherwood also highlighted that Judge Powell had found
the appellant's mother to not be an honest witness.

Having considered the evidence and submissions I find as follows:

The appellant is living in the UK with his British national mother.  The
appellant's removal from the UK would significantly interfere with the
family life he presently enjoys with his mother, who is his primary carer.
Article 8(1) is therefore engaged.

I now turn to consider Article 8(2) and whether removing the appellant
would constitute a disproportionate interference with his rights under
Article 8.

My starting point is to assess whether he satisfies the requirements in
Paragraph 298 of the Rules as his compliance (or non-compliance) with the
Rules will weigh heavily in the Article 8(2) proportionality balancing
exercise.

      c) Under Paragraph 298(i)(c) the appellant must show that his mother
         is present and settled in the UK and has had sole responsibility
         for his upbringing or that he normally lives with her and not his
         father.  The preserved findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal
         make clear that this element of Paragraph 298 is satisfied.

      d) Under Paragraph 298(ii) the appellant must have or have had limited
         leave to enter the UK and be under the age of 18.  This element is
         met as the appellant was born in 2007 and entered the UK as a
         visitor with leave until 27 November 2018.

      e) Under Paragraph 298(iii) it must be shown that the appellant is not
         living an independent life, is unmarried and has not formed an
         independent family unit.  Given his age, this is clearly satisfied.



      f) Paragraphs 298(iv) and (v) require that the appellant will be
         accommodated adequately by his mother without recourse to public
         funds in accommodation which she owns or occupies exclusively and
         that he will be maintained adequately by his mother without
         recourse to public funds.  This was the main area of contention
         during the rehearing.  Having considered the documentary and oral
         evidence, as well as the findings of the First-tier Tribunal, I am
         satisfied that this criterion is met.  The evidence indicates (and
         I find as a fact) that the appellant lives with his mother and
         grandmother in a house which has a one year tenancy and where a
         rent of �2,100 is paid monthly.  The documentary evidence shows
         (and I find as a fact) that the appellant's mother and grandmother
         are supported financially by the appellant's grandfather and that
         this substantial support provides a significant supplement to the
         income earned by the appellant's mother through her employment in
         the UK.  The financial and accommodation circumstances of the
         appellant are, in my view, sufficient to satisfy Paragraphs 298(iv)
         and (v).

      g) None of the other elements of Paragraph 298 are relevant.

      h) I am satisfied, therefore, that the appellant meets the
         requirements of Paragraph 298.

Given that the appellant would be entitled, under the Immigration Rules, to
a grant of indefinite leave to remain in the UK, I am satisfied that there
is not a public interest in his removal. Consequently, requiring him to
leave the UK would constitute a disproportionate interference with his
right to respect for his family life with his mother under article 8 ECHR.
I therefore allow the appeal.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier tribunal contains a material error of law
and is set aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family.  This direction
applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
