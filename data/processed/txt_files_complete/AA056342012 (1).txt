                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Ms R Chapman, instructed by Birnberg Peirce & Partners
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, JG, date of birth 1.1.78, is a citizen of Afghanistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Canavan, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to  refuse   his   asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 27.2.14.

 3. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  McCarthy  refused  permission  to
    appeal on 7.4.14. However, when the  application  was  renewed  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, Upper Tribunal  Judge  C  Lane  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 28.4.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Canavan should be set aside.

 6. Although the claimant claimed asylum on 16.6.08, the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State refusing his claim was not made until  28.5.12.  His
    appeal against that decision was dismissed in May 2013,  but  following
    an application for permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  the
    matter was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh  hearing,
    heard before Judge Canavan on 27.2.14.

 7. The essence of the Secretary of  State's  case  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was that the claimant had admitted in  interview  engaging  in
    conduct as a Taliban fighter which gave rise  to  serious  reasons  for
    considering that he fell within Article 1F(a) and (c)  of  the  Refugee
    Convention and as such a certificate was issued excluding him from  the
    protection of Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. The Secretary of
    State also concluded that he would not be at risk on return, relying on
    the country guidance of PM & Others (Kabul - Hizb-i-Islami) Afghanistan
    CG [2007] UKAIR 00089.

 8. In essence, these were the  two  issues  in  the  appeal:  whether  the
    claimant was excluded from protection; and whether he was  at  risk  on
    return. In respect of the  latter  issue,  there  was  also  a  primary
    factual issue as to whether he had escaped from detention  or  in  fact
    been released.

 9. In her careful and detailed determination, Judge  Canavan  reached  the
    conclusion  that  the  evidence  of  the   claimant's   activities   in
    Afghanistan,  principally  from  his  interviews,  was   insufficiently
    reliable to justify exclusion from protection under Article  1F(a)  and
    in respect of Article 1F(c) insufficiently clear and credible or strong
    to justify exclusion from protection of the Convention.

10. From �41 onwards, the judge then turned to consider the claimant's risk
    on return and at �48 - �50 concluded that it  is  reasonable  to  infer
    that the Afghan authorities are likely to have an adverse  interest  in
    the claimant and that there is a serious possibility that he  would  be
    at risk of serious harm if  detained  for  questioning  as  an  escaped
    Taliban prisoner.

11. In the circumstances, the appeal  was  allowed  on  refugee  and  human
    rights grounds.

12. As drafted, the grounds of application for  permission  to  appeal  are
    very short. It is submitted that the judge adopted a perverse approach,
    finding that the claimant's mental state only affected his  ability  to
    give cogent evidence in respect of war crimes, but did not  affect  any
    of the other evidence. "It is respectfully  submitted  that  the  judge
    cannot in effect pick and chose  which  evidence  is  affected  by  his
    mental health and which is not, without giving any reason why  this  is
    so, particularly in light of the serious nature of the  offences  which
    he initially admitted to."

13. Before me, Mr Tufan raised  further  grounds,  which  he  claimed  were
    'Robinson obvious.' First,  that  the  medical  evidence  submitted  on
    behalf of the claimant did not state anywhere that he would confess  to
    serious offences that he did not commit. Second,  that  the  judge  was
    looking for reasons to allow the appeal and between �43 and �48 ignored
    or 'overturned' the country guidance in PM & Others,  wrongly  deciding
    that it was not to be applied.

14. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Lane observed that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge noted that the claimant may have been  so  mentally
    unwell at the time of his asylum interview that the answers given  were
    not reliable. However, elsewhere in the determination, for example at �
    42 where the judge found  that  the  appellant  had  given  "a  broadly
    consistent" account of  his  escape  from  detention,  the  appellant's
    evidence appears to have been accepted as reliable. "It is argued  that
    the judge  should  have  given  reasons  for  accepting  parts  of  the
    appellant's account whilst rejecting other parts; the  appellant  seems
    to have struggled to give evidence both at interview and at the hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal."

15. With respect to the Secretary of State and  Judge  Lane,  and  for  the
    reasons set out below, I find that the grounds of appeal  substantially
    misstate the judge's determination. It  is  unfair  and  inaccurate  to
    suggest that there was an inconsistency  between  findings  as  to  the
    claimant's evidence in relation to Article 1F and acceptance  of  other
    parts of his account when addressing risk on return.

16. I agree with the view taken by Judge McCarthy in refusing permission to
    appeal. "The grounds are misguided. The author of the  grounds  ignores
    the fact that the approach to the  assessment  of  issues  relating  to
    exclusion from refugee status is different  to  that  relating  to  the
    assessment of risk or persecution and risk on  return.  The  judge  was
    clearly aware of the different legal approaches; she refers to them  in
    paragraphs 13 and 31. The judge recognised that the Secretary of  State
    relied on the appellant's own admissions of "war crimes" that  he  made
    during his asylum interview. The judge recognised  that  the  interview
    process had not been sufficiently robust to obtain  such  a  confession
    and given the standard of proof  that  applied  to  the  assessment  of
    exclusion was entitled to find that the evidence did not show that  the
    admissions were reliable.

17. "In addition, the judge recognises throughout  her  determination  that
    the appellant's testimony is weakened  because  of  his  mental  health
    condition. In assessing risk of persecution and  risk  on  return,  she
    relies not simply on his accounts but on the additional expert evidence
    provided and the facts that were agreed. In so doing  she  applied  the
    relevant legal approaches to these issues, which  were  different  from
    those relating to exclusion. As the judge was very  careful  to  assess
    all the evidence and applied the relevant legal provisions, the grounds
    are not made out and permission to appeal is refused."

18. I am satisfied on reading the determination  that  it  addressed,  took
    into account, and dealt with all  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal,
    resolving relevant issues and giving cogent reasons  for  the  findings
    made  and  conclusions  drawn.  It  was  a   careful   and   considered
    determination.

19. At �13 the  judge  set  out  the  relevant  standard  when  considering
    exclusion from  protection.  There  has  to  be  "serious  reasons  for
    considering" that the claimant had individual responsibility  for  acts
    coming within the scope of  Article  1F.  Relying  on  Al  Sirri  &  DD
    (Afghanistan) [2012]  UKSC  54,  "serious  reasons"  is  stronger  than
    "reasonable grounds." The evidence must  be  "clear  and  credible"  or
    "strong." This is not a requirement to be satisfied  beyond  reasonable
    doubt, but it is unlikely to be sufficient unless  the  decision  maker
    can be satisfied on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  is.  In
    relation to article 3, and the burden on the claimant to establish  his
    claim, he has to show that there  is  a  real  risk  that  he  will  be
    subjected to persecution or serious harm.

20. It is thus clear that there is  a  very  different  standard  of  proof
    required in relation to the two issues in the  appeal.  The  judge  set
    about her task in relation to the issue  of  exclusion  by  considering
    both the evidence of admissions against interest by the claimant during
    his interviews, and the evidence as to his physical and  mental  health
    at the time of the interview and thereafter.

21. At �25 the judge correctly stated that she had to assess  how  reliable
    the interview record is and the weight to be  placed  on  the  apparent
    admissions. In some 15 subparagraphs to �25,  the  judge  analysed  the
    interview record and the admissions made. A number  of  criticisms  are
    made as to the conduct and structure of the interview. Three  different
    medical reports were assessed, together with more up to  date  evidence
    as to the claimant's health. At �26 the judge accepted that taken alone
    some of the specific answers appear to be serious admissions, including
    that he had killed "many people" and had engaged in torturing people.

22. At �27, however, the judge sought to take  a  step  back  and  put  the
    evidence of admissions in context to his answers as a whole, which were
    very confused and in many cases unclear. It was not clear, for example,
    whether the claimant was admitting  having  killed  people  himself  or
    whether he was referring to the Taliban collectively or more generally.
    The judge rightly pointed out that many questions were left unclarified
    and unresolved, such as whether his killing of many people was  in  the
    context of an internal armed conflict against other fighting  units  or
    against civilians  and  thus  amounting  to  a  war  crime.  The  judge
    complained that insufficient follow up questions were asked in relation
    to his apparent involvement in torture.

23. The assessment was not all one-sided as the grounds suggest. At �30 the
    judge recognised that the claimant may have been obfuscating  in  order
    to reduce his personal responsibility for such crimes. In some cases he
    failed to answer questions direction. The judge also noted that he  was
    evasive in evidence at the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing.  At  �31  the
    judge agreed that his apparent admission to being a  Taliban  commander
    at the time of well-documented abuses gave rise to a suspicion that  he
    may have committed acts that would give  rise  to  exclusion  from  the
    Convention.  However,  the  judge  pointed  out   that   suspicion   is
    insufficient to conclude that there are serious reasons for considering
    that he had individual responsibility for such acts. At �32  the  judge
    accepted that if considering the interview record  alone  the  evidence
    might be sufficient  to  reach  the  serious  reasons  for  considering
    threshold. However, the judge then went on from  �33  to  consider  the
    other evidence before her.

24. That evidence included the medical and mental health evidence, as  well
    as comments he made  about  how  he  felt  during  the  course  of  the
    interviews. After considering  this  evidence  the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion at �36 that there was real doubt as to  the  reliability  of
    his admissions in interview. "The extent of his mental health  problems
    are so significant that they  could  have  seriously  impacted  on  his
    ability to comprehend the questions put to him." On close assessment of
    the apparent admissions in �37, the judge found they were not as clear-
    cut as might at first appear. Considering the evidence as a whole,  the
    judge reached the conclusion that the admissions  could  not  be  given
    serious weight and, at  �38,  "the  medical  evidence  is  sufficiently
    strong to cast  real  doubt  on  the  reliability  of  the  appellant's
    evidence at interview."

25. Taking a restrictive  and  cautious  interpretation  of  the  exclusion
    clauses, bearing in mind the serious consequences of exclusion, at  �38
    the judge found that "whilst there is evidence that  creates  suspicion
    it is not sufficiently reliable (to) meet  the  threshold  of  "serious
    reasons  for   considering"   that   the   appellant   had   individual
    responsibility for acts that amounted to war crimes or  crimes  against
    humanity as  defined  in  the  international  instruments.  As  such  I
    conclude that there is insufficiently reliable evidence  before  me  to
    exclude the appellant under Article 1F(a) of the  Refugee  Convention."
    The judge reached a similar conclusion at �39 in  relation  to  Article
    1F(c).

26. I find that, whilst another judge may have reached  somewhat  different
    conclusions, the conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge were ones
    open to her and for which she has given careful and  cogent  reasoning.
    It is very clear that the judge has given the most anxious scrutiny  to
    the evidence and carefully considered the findings to be made.

27. In the circumstances, I find no error in respect of this aspect of  the
    determination. In fact, the grounds do not  specifically  suggest  that
    this part of the decision is flawed, but complain that the findings  in
    respect of risk on return are inconsistent with the findings in respect
    of exclusion from protection and thus the determination as a  whole  is
    perverse. For reasons set out below, I find that submission is not made
    out.

28. First, as set out above, there is a very different standard of proof in
    relation to risk on  return  and  article  3  of  the  Convention.  The
    claimant only has to demonstrate a reasonable degree of  likelihood  of
    risk  of  harm  on  return.  The  judge  set  that  out  twice  in  the
    determination, at the outset and reminded herself of it at �41.

29. Second, it is clear from the refusal decision  that  the  Secretary  of
    State accepted a  large  part  of  the  claimant's  account.  In  large
    measure, as summarised by the judge at �20, the  Secretary  of  State's
    assessment of the claimant's credibility relied  on  his  inability  to
    give clear and consistent dates for events. However, many of the events
    he did  describe  were  accepted  as  consistent  with  the  background
    evidence. It is accepted that he was captured by the Northern  Alliance
    in 2001 and detained for a number of years without charge or trial.  It
    is also accepted that he was  severely  ill-treated  in  detention,  an
    account consistent with the medical evidence. The judge  considered  at
    length, commencing from �42 the claimant's account of his escape, which
    was  broadly  consistent  with  the  background   evidence   but   more
    significantly with the expert evidence  of  Mr  Foxley,  a  former  MOD
    analyst in Afghanistan.

30. It is neither accurate nor fair to suggest that on  the  basis  of  his
    mental health the judge chose to disregard parts of his evidence as  to
    the commission of atrocities but relied on other aspects of  his  case.
    That is an oversimplification, not justified by a  careful  reading  of
    the determination. It is not necessary for  me  to  summarise  all  the
    judge's findings in respect of risk on return, but it is significant to
    point out that in large measure the claimant's account was:

      a) Accepted by the Secretary of State;

      b) Consistent with the background evidence;

      c) Supported by medical evidence;

      d) Supported by expert evidence;

31. In essence, much of the claimant's background  account  of  events  and
    locations was either accepted by the Secretary of State or found to  be
    consistent  with  other  evidence,  even  though  he  has  been  vague,
    inconsistent, or evasive as to dates and level of involvement.  In  the
    circumstances, I do not accept the submission of Mr Tufan that there is
    an inconsistency between accepting this account, including escape  from
    detention, and the finding that  the  evidence  of  admission  was  too
    unreliable to reach the higher evidential threshold to exclude him from
    protection.

32. It was in the light of the judge's over assessment, that  she  accepted
    the claimant's account of escaping  from  detention  when  the  Taliban
    intercepted the  transport  of  prisoners.  Significantly,  it  was  an
    account that Mr Foxley considered to be "highly plausible."

33. It was also "highly  plausible"  that  the  claimant  would  remain  of
    interest to the Afghan authorities if his personal history became known
    to Afghan intelligence or security authorities. Thus at �48  the  judge
    reached the conclusion that there was a reasonable degree of likelihood
    that the  claimant  would  be  of  continued  interest  to  the  Afghan
    authorities if returned and a serious  possibility  that  he  could  be
    detained and questioned as a known Taliban fighter. The  fact  that  he
    had been detained and tortured in the past, which  had  been  accepted,
    was a serious indication that he is likely to be at risk  of  suffering
    similar ill-treatment if returned to Afghanistan.

34. I find no error of law in the judge's distinguishing of PM & others  at
    �48. The judge gave  a  number  of  different  reasons  for  doing  so,
    including more recent background and expert evidence.

35. In light of the fact that he has been previously recruited  into  armed
    insurgent groups, the judge considered it at least likely that  he  may
    be approached to join such groups again, even though he may not wish to
    do so. However, the judge found  that  in  the  light  of  his  current
    physical and mental health problems there was insufficient evidence  to
    show a real risk of forcible recruitment.

Conclusions:

36. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.








Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
