                                NADER CHEGENI
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                             NOTICE OF DECISION

 1. The appellant brings an  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the
    decision of FTTJ Bannerman, dismissing his appeal  against  a  decision
    refusing him leave to enter. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
    was granted on the 22 September 2015.

 2. The Secretary of State has now granted the appellant  leave  to  remain
    (as a Refugee). The appellant's section 82 appeal is to be  treated  as
    abandon pursuant to section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 from the point in time that  the  grant  of  leave  was
    made.

 3. This, however, does not bring the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal
    to an end.  The appellant has not withdrawn his appeal before the Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. Given the circumstances of this appeal it is prudent for  the  Tribunal
    to bring the proceedings to an end  and  I  do  so  by  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal hereto. Such decision is no reflection on the merits
    of the appellant's case, which I have not considered - it  is  made  in
    order to dispose of the appeal which, for the reasons given above,  has
    become unnecessary.




    Signed








    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor
    Date: 25 November 2015
