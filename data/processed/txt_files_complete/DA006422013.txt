    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: the appellant was not
           legally represented
          For the Respondent: Mr P Deller a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who  was  born  on  25  December
      1971. He has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  a
      panel consisting of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Beg and non-legal member
      Dr P L Ravenscroft ("the panel") who dismissed his appeal against  the
      respondent's decision of 15 March 2013 to  make  a  deportation  order
      against him under section 5 (1) of the Immigration Act 1971.


   2. The appellant entered the UK illegally using a forged  Dutch  passport
      in October 2001. On 7 December 2001 he claimed asylum. He was asked to
      complete a statement of evidence form but failed  to  do  so  and  his
      asylum claim was refused on 30 January 2002. On 11 July  2002  he  was
      convicted of handling stolen goods and failing to surrender to custody
      at the appointed time. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. On 9
      May 2003 he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to 12
      months imprisonment. On 22 May 2003 he was convicted of conspiracy  to
      defraud and sentenced to one year and nine months imprisonment. He was
      ordered to pay �12,395 in compensation.


   3. On 26 May 2007 the appellant was convicted of driving a motor  vehicle
      with excess alcohol and disqualified from driving for 12  months.  His
      licence was endorsed and he was fined �150 with costs of �70.  He  was
      also ordered to serve one day for the offence of failing to  surrender
      at the appointed time. On 6 July 2007  he  was  convicted  of  driving
      whilst disqualified and given a  community  order  of  12  months,  an
      unpaid work requirement of 60 hours, disqualification from driving for
      12 months and his driving licence was endorsed. He was also  convicted
      of having no insurance and given a community order of  12  months,  an
      unpaid work requirement of 60 hours, his driving licence was  endorsed
      and he was ordered to pay costs of �75.


   4. And 17 September 2010 further representations were submitted on behalf
      the appellant relating to his private and family life. He  claimed  to
      be in a relationship with his partner,  Miss  B,  their  son  and  his
      stepson. Further representations were made on 8 December 2011. It  was
      said that he had an older stepdaughter.


   5. Following the respondent's decision the  appellant  appealed  and  the
      panel  heard  his  appeal  on  14  August  2013.  Both  parties   were
      represented and the panel heard oral evidence from the appellant,  his
      partner and his stepdaughter. The panel considered  the  human  rights
      grounds under paragraph 362 to 400 of the Immigration  Rules  relating
      to deportation which had come  into  force  on  9  July  2012  and  in
      particular paragraphs 399 and 399A. The deportation of  the  appellant
      was conducive to the public good because he had been convicted  of  an
      offence for which he had been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of
      less than four years but at least 12 months.  In  these  circumstances
      "it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest
      in deportation  will  be  outweighed  by  other  factors".  The  panel
      referred to a number of authorities including MF (Nigeria) [2012] UKUT
      00395, Maslov v Austria (1683 - 03) [2008] ECHR 546, N (Kenya)  [2004]
      UKIAT 00009, RG (automatic deport) [2010] UKUT 275, Uner v Netherlands
      (46410/00) [2006] ECHR, Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, Huang [2007]  UKHL  11,
      VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA, Beoku-Betts [2008]  UKHL  39,  ZH  (Tanzania)
      [2011] UKSC 4 and Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31.  The  panel  concluded
      that the appellant was not a credible witness. A  two  stage  approach
      was adopted,  first  considering  the  Article  8  grounds  under  the
      Immigration Rules and then under the Article 8  jurisprudence  outside
      the Immigration Rules. It was found that the appellant did not satisfy
      the mandatory requirements and that his Article 8 grounds failed under
      the Immigration Rules. The panel went on to  consider  the  Article  8
      grounds  under  the  jurisprudence  outside  the  Immigration   Rules,
      applying the  five-step  Razgar  tests.  The  best  interests  of  the
      children were treated as a primary consideration and it was  concluded
      that their welfare would best be served if they continued to live with
      their mother. There was no suggestion  that  the  children  should  be
      removed from this country. The appellant could keep in touch with  his
      partner and the children through modern  means  of  communication  and
      they could also visit him in Nigeria. His partner had her own  parents
      living  in  Nigeria.  His  stepdaughter  was  an   adult   and   their
      relationship did not amount to family life.


   6. The  panel  set  out  the  factors  militating  for  and  against  the
      proportionality of the appellant's proposed removal from  the  UK.  It
      was  found  that  his  criminal  offences  undermined  the  system  of
      immigration control. He  had  used  a  false  passport  to  enter  the
      country. The offences of conspiracy to defraud involved  sophisticated
      dishonesty. Whilst the appellant had a private and family life in  the
      UK and had been here since 2001  the  offences  were  serious.  Having
      attempted to obtain asylum he then absconded and made  no  attempt  to
      contact the Home Office until 2010. It was concluded that he  did  not
      contact the Home Office because he recognised that he had a very  weak
      asylum claim which was likely to  fail  and  that  deportation  action
      would be taken against him. His failure to regularise his  immigration
      status provided further evidence of his dishonesty and  disregard  for
      the laws of the country. It was concluded that the  right  to  respect
      for private and family life did not outweigh the  public  interest  in
      deportation. His appeal was dismissed.


   7. The appellant applied for permission to  appeal  submitting  that  the
      panel erred in  law;  firstly,  by  failing  correctly  to  apply  the
      principles in Uner v Netherlands. Secondly, by  making  an  irrational
      and perverse finding as  to  the  appellant's  propensity  to  offend.
      Thirdly, by failing  to  take  into  account  the  delay  between  the
      commission of the offences and the making of  the  deportation  order.
      Fourthly, by incorrectly applying the new Immigration Rules which post
      dated the appellant's application. Fifthly, by failing to give  proper
      weight to  the  appellant's  contribution  to  the  parenting  of  the
      children.


   8. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused by a  judge  in
      the First-Tier Tribunal but granted on renewal to the Upper  Tribunal.
      There is a Rule 24 response from the  respondent  which  submits  that
      there is no error of law.


   9. The appeal came before me on  14  November  2013.  Both  parties  were
      represented, the appellant by counsel and the respondent by Mr Deller.
      In relation to the question of whether the panel erred in law I  heard
      full submissions from the appellant's counsel. During  the  course  of
      submissions  from  Mr  Deller  a  query  arose  as  to   whether   the
      determination of the panel which was before me and the representatives
      was complete, correct and the final version.  There  were  indications
      that it might not be. In the circumstances I adjourned  for  enquiries
      to be made. After these were made, including contacting the First-Tier
      Tribunal judge who chaired the panel,  it  was  established  that  the
      determination which had been promulgated was  not  the  final  correct
      version. The final correct version has now been sent to all parties. I
      gave directions enabling the appellant to amend the grounds of  appeal
      and the respondent to amend  the  Rule  24  response  if  desired.  No
      amendments have been made.


  10. At the adjourned hearing before me on 3 February 2014  the  respondent
      was represented by Mr Deller. The appellant attended with his partner,
      child and stepchildren. He said that he could no longer  afford  legal
      representation. In response to my suggestion he said that he wished to
      rely on the full submissions made  by  his  counsel  at  the  previous
      hearing.

  11. Mr Deller accepted that what  the  panel  said  in  paragraph  31  was
      factually incorrect. The appellant's partner did not  look  after  the
      children whilst he was in prison because at that stage  they  had  not
      met. Paragraph 32 of the determination contained a  correct  statement
      of the law and it was clear that the panel considered  the  Article  8
      grounds on the basis that the appellant would leave  the  country  and
      the rest of the family  would  remain  here.  There  had  been  proper
      consideration of the best interests of the children. He accepted  that
      in reaching a decision in 2012 the respondent relied on  a  conviction
      in 2003 and accepted that delay was a factor which needed to be  taken
      into account. He submitted that, overall,  the  grounds  disclosed  no
      error of law and asked me to uphold the determination.


  12. The appellant and his partner emphasised that the criminal restitution
      order was being paid and would be paid in full. �12,395 had been  paid
      plus  approximately  �5000  in  interest.  Approximately   �1500   was
      outstanding and was being paid at the rate of �50  per  month  by  the
      appellant's partner out of her earnings. The appellant's partner  made
      a plea for him to be allowed to remain in this country  to  help  look
      after the children. She did not want to be a single parent. He  was  a
      changed man and good with the  children.  He  had  not  committed  any
      serious offences since 2002  which  was  a  long  time  ago.  I  asked
      whether, if I needed to re-determine the appeal, the  appellant  would
      wish to submit any further evidence. He said that he would like me  to
      consider up-to-date school reports which he handed in.


  13. The appellants counsel submitted that there were  three  main  issues,
      the length of time since the convictions  for  serious  offences,  the
      reasons why deportation action was not  taken  earlier  and  the  best
      interests of the children. She argued that notwithstanding  paragraphs
      31  and  32  of  the  determination  there   had   been   insufficient
      consideration of the best interests of the children. Furthermore,  the
      panel misunderstood the evidence. The statement in paragraph  31  that
      "for the period when the appellant was in prison his partner was  able
      to make arrangements for the care of the children" was a factual error
      because at that time they had not even met. I note that this was not a
      point raised in the grounds of appeal.


  14. Counsel argued that, whilst the panel referred to Uner  v  Netherlands
      in paragraph 26 (in fact it was paragraph 27) these principles had not
      been properly applied in considering  the  appellant's  propensity  to
      reoffend. In paragraph 27 the panel summarised their understanding  of
      the effect of Uner on this appeal; "The court held that the nature and
      seriousness of the offence committed by the appellant should be  taken
      into  account  alongside  the  time  elapsed  since  the  offence  was
      committed and the appellant's conduct during that period  as  well  as
      his family situation." Read in the context of the rest  of  paragraphs
      26 and 27 and the determination as a  whole  I  find  that  the  panel
      properly applied Uner principles and that in this regard there  is  no
      error of law.


  15. Counsel relied on the grounds of appeal that the basis of the  finding
      as to the appellant's propensity to reoffend in paragraph  26  in  the
      light of his failure to disclose a previous conviction for  conspiracy
      to defraud in his 2011 application was perverse. Counsel accepted that
      there was a high threshold for the test of perversity. In paragraph 26
      the panel gave a  number  of  reasons  for  the  conclusion  that  the
      appellant had a propensity to behave dishonestly only one of which was
      his failure to disclose a serious previous conviction when making  his
      application for leave to remain in 2011. On the evidence it  was  open
      to the panel to reject appellant's  explanation  for  the  failure  to
      mention this. Neither the reasoning nor the  conclusion  is  perverse.
      There is no error of law.


  16. Counsel submitted that the panel failed to give detailed  or  adequate
      reasons  for  the  respondent's  inexplicable  delay  in  making   the
      deportation order so long after the commission of the  index  offence.
      The respondent could have made a deportation order and  served  it  on
      the appellant at his last known address. I find that  the  panel  were
      aware of and did take into account  the  lapse  of  time  between  the
      commission of  the  index  offence  and  the  deportation  order.  The
      findings of fact make this clear. The panel made findings of  fact  in
      relation to this period, which were open to them on the  evidence.  In
      paragraph 35 it is said; "We find that the appellant  having  made  an
      application  for  asylum  after  his  arrival  in  this  country  then
      absconded. We find that he made no attempt to contact the Home  Office
      until 2010. We find that the reason he did not contact the Home Office
      is because he recognised that he had a very weak asylum claim  and  he
      believed that it would be dismissed and the deportation  action  would
      be taken against him." Whilst the  respondent  has  not  provided  any
      explanation why no action was taken during this period it was open  to
      the panel to find that fault lay with the appellant. There is no error
      of law.


  17.  Counsel  withdrew  the  ground  of  appeal  which  alleged  that  the
      respondent and the panel should not have applied the  new  Immigration
      Rules in relation to the Article 8 grounds. She was correct to do  so.
      The ground is misconceived. In this case the law  to  be  applied  was
      that in force at the date of the decision. There is no error of law.


  18. In relation to the last ground of appeal counsel  submitted  that  the
      panel misunderstood the  evidence  and  that  the  error  impinged  on
      consideration of the best interests of the children. The statement  in
      paragraph 31 that "for the period when the appellant was in prison his
      partner was able to make arrangements for the care  of  the  children"
      was a factual error because at that time they had not met. This is not
      a point raised in the original grounds of appeal but Mr Deller did not
      object and I allowed it to be argued because  I  find  that  there  is
      error of fact which should be assessed. The appellant  was  in  prison
      from May 2002 until July 2003. At that stage  the  appellant  and  his
      partner had not met. They met in 2007.  The  appellant's  stepson  was
      born in May 2003 and his son in December 2008. I must consider whether
      this factual mistake amounts to an error of law such that I should set
      aside the decision. I find that it does not. Notwithstanding the error
      any panel properly directing itself would inevitably have reached  the
      same conclusion. Had I concluded otherwise and that there was an error
      of law such that the decision should be set aside then in remaking the
      decision in the light of the evidence available at  the  date  of  the
      hearing before me I would have reached the same conclusion to  dismiss
      the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds.

  19. I consider that it is necessary to  anonymise  this  determination  in
      order  to  protect  the  interests  of  the  appellant's  partner  and
      children.


  20. I make an order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
      matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant
      or any member of his family.

  21. I uphold the decision of the panel to dismiss the appeal.
