For the Appellant:     Miss A Watterson instructed by Caveat Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Sudan  born  on  20  June  1996  and  he
    appealed against a decision dated 20 August 2014 to remove him from the
    United Kingdom following a refusal to grant  him  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and protection under the European Convention.

 2. He claims to have left Sudan in June 2012 travelling initially to Libya
    and from Libya by boat to Italy.   He  then  travelled  from  Italy  to
    Calais in France by train and entered the UK on 29 November 2013  on  a
    lorry.  He applied for asylum on 3 December 2013.  His appeal was heard
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal A Khawar on 12  November  2014  who
    dismissed his appeal on all grounds on 27 November 2014.

 3. The appellant made an application for permission to appeal on the basis
    that the judge had erred in fact and recorded at paragraph 30 that  the
    appellant had managed to save �700 to pay for his trip  from  Sudan  to
    Libya.  The judge failed  to  consider  that  one  Sudanese  pound  was
    equivalent to 0.1116 sterling  and  would  have  come  to  a  different
    conclusion having been satisfied at paragraph 21 that the appellant had
    provided a broadly consistent account.

 4. The appellant would not have been able to rent a room with that  amount
    in Sudan so he was destitute and lived in the streets  thereby  putting
    him at risk of being arrested sooner  or  later  because  of  his  skin
    colour and because he would have no home or  family  to  return  to  in
    Sudan.

 5. A second ground was  that  the  judge  erred  in  concluding  that  the
    appellant was either sleeping or living in the market which appeared to
    have been a  matter  of  choice.   The  appellant  in  fact  saved  the
    equivalent of �80 and the money could only take the appellant to  Libya
    by car.  The judge would have come to a  different  conclusion  had  he
    considered the series of events that made the appellant leave Sudan for
    Libya.  If the judge had  taken  into  account  the  appellant's  fears
    because of his skin colour his destitution and his arrest  cumulatively
    he would have reached the threshold as it was the fear  that  made  him
    leave Sudan.

 6. In ground 3 the judge failed to consider the fact  that  the  appellant
    stated that he was moving from place to place, sleeping in  markets  to
    avoid having been caught and was in constant fear which made him seek a
    way of escape to Sudan or Libya.

 7. The judge noted in paragraph 21:

         "Having carefully considered all the evidence I  am  satisfied  the
         appellant  has  provided  a  broadly  consistent  account  on  each
         occasion that he has been questioned.  In addition his  account  is
         consistent   with   objective   evidence   in   relation   to   the
         treatment/discrimination meted out to Darfurian blacks."

 8.  The  appellant's  series  of  treatment,  discrimination  when   taken
    cumulatively was  capable  of  meeting  the  threshold  that  made  the
    appellant seek refuge outside Sudan.

 9. A Rule 24 response was submitted contending that whether the  appellant
    saved �700 or �80 made no material impact on the outcome of the appeal.
     The fact is that the judge concluded that the appellant  was  able  to
    save enough money to leave Sudan  and  left  for  economic  betterment.
    There was no history of persecution and there was  an  option  for  the
    appellant to relocate.

10.  At the hearing before me Miss Watterson made a preliminary  application
    to expand her grounds of appeal and to rely on case  law,  specifically
    MM (Darfuri) Sudan CG [2015] UKUT 00010  (IAC).   She  pointed  to  the
    conclusion of that case to support her contention that this case should
    be considered in the light of the appellant being perceived as  a  non-
    Arab Darfuri.  I cannot accept a proposition that the judge should have
    considered a country guidance case promulgated after he had promulgated
    his own case.  It was Miss Watterson's  contention  that  there  was  a
    racial element to the Darfuri conflict.  The judge had perceived him as
    a black Darfuri and that he was  at  risk  of  arrest.   The  fact  she
    contended was that the appellant looked like someone  from  an  African
    tribe.  Indeed he was arrested in 2006 as being associated with the JEM
    and she referred me to Country of Origin Information to show  that  the
    appellant was one of the Arab tribes associated with the opposition  of
    government.

11.  Ms Watterson pointed to Country of Origin Information Report  at  16.35
    and stated it was not quite as simple as him just  not  falling  within
    the non-Arab Darfuri category but there was a racial element  and  that
    he would be perceived as a dark-skinned Darfuri.  I asked what evidence
    was presented to the First Tier Tribunal of persecution of rather  than
    discrimination towards the appellant, because of his  colour,  and  was
    not pointed to evidence in that regard.

12.  I do not accept the amendment to that ground.  The ground  was  put  on
    the basis  that  the  appellant  received  a  series  of  treatment  or
    discrimination and when taken cumulatively was capable of  meeting  the
    threshold.  Even if I had allowed that ground  to  be  expanded  as  Mr
    Parkinson pointed out there was nothing in  the  evidence  to  indicate
    that absent the sweep of arrests of many, that non-Arab  Darfurians  by
    virtue of their dark skins were at real risk of persecution.

13.  Miss Watterson also stated that  the  appellant  had  been  moved  from
    place to place to avoid being caught by the police but I note that  the
    judge specifically recorded the account which he accepted that  he  was
    arrested by the army in 2008 "along with others" and  although  he  was
    accused by the army of being a supporter of Khalil Ibrahim  "he  denied
    such accusations and eventually the army released him".

14.  The judge also found that at 28 the appellant's "only claim is that  he
    was arrested twice by the police during this five year period [2008  to
    June 2013] but does not claim to have  been  ill-treated".   The  judge
    found that the appellant had stated that he was released by the army in
    2008 because he was not a supporter of JEM.

15.  AA  (non-Arab  Darfuri  -  relocation)  Sudan  CG  [2009]  UKAIT  00056
    confirmed that non-Arab Darfuri are at risk of  persecution  in  Darfur
    and cannot reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere in Sudan.   The
    fact is that the appellant is from the Taisha tribe which is in fact an
    Arab tribe.  The judge recorded that he had been arrested and  mistaken
    as a JEM supporter but considered that the any further arrest would  be
    remote and that was not satisfied that simply by  virtue  of  his  dark
    skin and that he may be destitute that would happen again [33].

16.  The judge accepted  that  there  was  racial  prejudice  meted  out  to
    individuals with the appellant's skin colour but clearly found that the
    authorities had come into  contact  with  the  appellant  and  had  not
    considered him to be linked to the JEM.  The judge found at  [29]  that
    the appellant had faced the discrimination only.  The  judge  confirmed
    he considered the objective evidence did not reach the threshold either
    that of inhuman or degrading treatment which as  Mr  Parkinson  pointed
    out in this instance would be a similar threshold to that  of  claiming
    asylum.

17.  I therefore do not  allow  Miss  Watterson  to  amend  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  The appellant confirmed that he  was  from  the  Taisha  tribe
    which is an Arab Darfuri tribe and clearly the authorities had accepted
    this.  Had they not done so despite the colour  of  his  skin,  on  the
    basis of the country guidance he would have been at risk of persecution
    which on the evidence accepted by the judge was not the case.

18.  The Operational Guidance Note August  2012  at  3.9.13  confirmed  that
    issues of ethnicity and identity had become increasingly blurred and to
    that end I do not find that there was evidence placed before the  judge
    that the appellant would be primarily identified as  African  or  Arab,
    albeit that the judge referred to the appellant  as  a  black  Darfuri.
    The clear conclusion of the judge was that the authorities did not find
    the appellant to be identified with the insurgents particularly  as  he
    was released on three occasions. This was a finding open to the judge.

19.  It was further stated at 3.10.4 that not  all  African  tribes  support
    the rebels and not all Arab tribes support the government:

         "The various tribes that  have  been  the  object  of  attacks  and
         killings.... do not appear to make up ethnic groups  distinct  from
         the ethnic group to which persons  or  militias  that  attack  them
         belong.  They speak the same language, Arabic and embrace the  same
         religion, Muslim.  In addition, also due to  the  high  measure  of
         inter marriage they can hardly be distinguished  in  their  outward
         physical appearance from  the  members  of  tribes  that  allegedly
         attack them.  Furthermore, inter-marriage and coexistence  in  both
         social and economic terms have over the years tended  to  blur  the
         distinction between the  groups.   Apparently,  the  sedentary  and
         nomadic character  of  the  groups  constitutes  one  of  the  main
         distinctions between them.  It is also notable that members of  the
         African tribes speak their own dialect in addition to Arabic, while
         members of Arab tribes only speak Arabic."

20.  Miss Watterson referred to at 21.12 of the Republic  of  Sudan  Country
    of Origin Information Report  September  2012  as  "the  cattle-herding
    Baggara of South Darfur which included the Taisha".  This  stated  that
    the large Baggara tribes generally opposed government policies  towards
    Darfur but I note that this extract still referred to the Taisha  (that
    of the appellant) as being one of  the  Darfur  Arab  groups  and  also
    confirmed that there were blurred communities  within  the  Abbala  and
    Baggara.  I do not accept that this is evidence  that  there  would  be
    persecution or  that  it  undermines  the  judge's  findings.   It  was
    accepted that there was stigmatisation but this is not persecution, and
    the judge took the appellant's  case  at  its  highest  and  took  into
    account his lifestyle and what had happened  to  him  whilst  in  Sudan
    overall in the decision and particularly at [28] [29] and [30].   I  am
    not persuaded that the judge has erred in this regard.

21.  Turning to ground 1 and 2 which were inter-linked  the  judge  recorded
    in the evidence and the Record of Proceedings that  the  appellant  had
    saved �700.  This was taken in oral evidence and the witness  statement
    did not make mention of this. I do not find therefore that  it  can  be
    shown that the judge has erred in this regard.  Further,  it  is  clear
    that the judge qualified his consideration of this money at  [30]  when
    he stated that the appellant had managed to save essentially to pay for
    his trip from Sudan to Libya and that this was a journey which took six
    days by car.  The judge had in mind the  amount  of  money  that  would
    allow the appellant to leave Sudan. The judge found that  he  saved  up
    his money with a view to travelling abroad and that this was  what  the
    money was used for.   Indeed  the  judge  found  that  his  reason  for
    travelling to Libya appeared to be for economic reasons and not with  a
    view to escaping ill-treatment.  I find that there is no error in  this
    regard.  The judge found essentially that the money saved was money  to
    assist  his  travel  and  this  could  have   been   directed   towards
    accommodation.

22.  With respect to ground 2, the judge found he was credible but found  he
    was not perceived by the authorities as working with the JEM because of
    his ability to live for a period of 5 years until his departure without
    suffering ill treatment [28] and, in line with the country guidance, he
    found  that  non-Arabs  from  Darfur  were  not  at  risk.   The  judge
    incorporated into his reasoning the events that  had  occurred  to  the
    appellant during his life in Sudan but found that he was arrested,  not
    only his skin colour, but also because of his homelessness and that  he
    was released.  The  judge  found  this  treatment,  in  the  particular
    circumstances, essentially amounted to discrimination  not  persecution
    or a breach of Article 3.

23.  I am not persuaded that the judge has made an error in  his  assessment
    or cumulative assessment such that the appellant was at risk on return.
    I find that there is no error  of  law  which  would  make  a  material
    difference to the outcome and the decision  shall stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 13 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-
tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
