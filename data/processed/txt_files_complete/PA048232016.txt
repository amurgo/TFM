Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Eaton of Counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis &
Co
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    An anonymity direction has been made in this case and unless and  until
    a Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is  granted
    anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly
    identify her or any member of her family.  This direction applies  both
    to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. This appeal was last before me on 2 June 2017 when  I  found  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal had contained a material  error  of
    law.  I will incorporate much of what I set out within the Decision and
    Reasons which I gave following that hearing into this decision.

 2. The appellant in this case  is  a  national  of  Albania  who  appealed
    against the respondent's rejection of her asylum claim.  In the  course
    of her appeal she  also  sought  to  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal to grant her leave to remain under Article 8.  The  appeal  was
    heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Devittie sitting at Taylor House
    on 22 December 2016 and in a determination promulgated  on  16  January
    2017 he dismissed the appellant's  asylum  appeal  essentially  on  the
    basis of adverse credibility findings which he made.

 3. As I noted in my last decision, in which I found an error  of  law,  it
    was common ground that Judge Devittie had made no findings at all  with
    regard to the Article 8 claim, even though this had been argued  before
    him and was contained in the skeleton argument which had been  prepared
    for that hearing.  The respondent did not seek to persuade the Tribunal
    that the failure to consider the Article 8 claim was not  an  error  of
    law and I found that this failure was a procedural error of  sufficient
    magnitude as to amount to an error of law such  that  the  appeal  with
    regard to Article 8 now had to be reheard, so that this aspect  of  the
    appeal could be properly considered, which it had not been so far.

 4. I noted that when granting permission to appeal in this case First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Osborne  had  also  considered  that  Judge  Devittie's
    decision was "an otherwise careful and  focused  decision"  and  I  too
    found that there had been nothing arguably unlawful about  the  adverse
    credibility findings which he had made which were open to  him  on  the
    evidence and which were fully and adequately reasoned.  For this reason
    I considered that it would not be appropriate to remit this appeal  for
    reconsideration by the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  that  it  should  be
    retained in the Upper Tribunal to be determined by me in light  of  the
    findings which Judge Devittie had made but also such  further  evidence
    as the appellant might choose to give with  regard  to  her  Article  8
    position.  Her Article 8 rights would have to be determined as  at  the
    date of the hearing, and I considered that therefore she  ought  to  be
    given an opportunity of providing such further  evidence  as  might  be
    appropriate.

 5. Because the appellant had not been present at the previous  hearing  it
    was necessary to adjourn and the  appeal  was  again  before  me  at  a
    hearing at Field House on 14 July 2017  when  I  was  provided  with  a
    further psychiatric report from Dr Kunal  Choudhary  and  also  a  very
    recent updated statement from the appellant which  was  dated  30  June
    2017.  I heard evidence at this hearing from the appellant  and  I  was
    also provided with the relevant extracts from the bundle which had been
    produced for the First-tier Tribunal hearing, which was  copied  during
    the hearing so that Counsel for the appellant  could  refer  to  it  in
    argument.  Regrettably this bundle had not  been  included  within  the
    file.

 6. The appellant was cross-examined and I heard submissions on  behalf  of
    both parties respectively from Mr Bramble on behalf of  the  respondent
    and Mr Eaton on behalf of the appellant.  I made a  full  note  of  the
    evidence which I heard and also the submissions and these are contained
    in the Record of Proceedings which I made contemporaneously.   I  shall
    not set out verbatim everything that was said to me during  the  course
    of the hearing, but will  refer  below  only  to  those  parts  of  the
    evidence and the submissions as are necessary for the purpose  of  this
    decision.  I have, however, had regard to everything which was said  to
    me and all the evidence contained within the file whether  or  not  the
    same is specifically set out or referred to below.

 7. The appellant's case as advanced before the First-tier Tribunal was  in
    essence that she had been the victim of domestic violence; her  parents
    in conjunction with other members of the local community  had  arranged
    for her to marry her husband, who was an Albanian national, and she had
    been compelled to marry him in October  2014.   Her  husband  had  been
    abusive and had subjected her to violence including assaulting her when
    she became pregnant.  She claimed that it was because this that she had
    decided to leave Albania.  She suffered a miscarriage, she says,  as  a
    result of her husband attacking her but  subsequently  became  pregnant
    again and she left Albania on this occasion without telling her husband
    beforehand and with the assistance of a friend who had apparently given
    her about ï¿½1,500 to assist in her escape.  Although  it  was  her  case
    that the child due to be born as a result of her second pregnancy might
    not be her husband's, until the hearing before this Tribunal on 14 July
    2017 no further details were given with regard to  this  pregnancy  nor
    has it ever been suggested that she has told anybody  in  Albania  that
    her son, who was born in January last year, might not be the son of her
    husband.  The basis of how her claim is now put can  be  summarised  as
    follows.  It is accepted on her behalf by Mr Eaton, (as it has to  be),
    that the appellant cannot now go behind the findings of fact which were
    made by Judge Devittie at the original hearing.  It  is  also  accepted
    that that has some impact on the psychiatric evidence  which  has  been
    adduced because the basis upon which the report was made was  that  she
    had been the victim of domestic violence.  However, it is still  argued
    on her behalf that at least some of the symptoms which she exhibits  do
    provide some support for the conclusion  that  she  is  suffering  from
    posttraumatic stress disorder and it is said the  psychiatric  evidence
    cannot be totally discounted.

 8. It is common ground between the parties that  in  the  event  that  the
    appellant  cannot  establish  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    difficulties in her and her son reintegrating into Albania  on  return,
    there could be no basis upon which it could be  said  that  there  were
    other compelling features about her claim such that  exceptionally  she
    should be granted leave to remain  outside  the  Rules.   Although  the
    Tribunal has to have regard to the best interests of her son,  pursuant
    to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009,  it
    is accepted that those best interests  will  normally  require  that  a
    child is brought up by his or her parent and in these circumstances, as
    both the mother and the child  are  Albanian,  unless  there  are  very
    significant obstacles which would make it difficult for  the  appellant
    and her son to reintegrate into Albania on return it could not properly
    be said that it was disproportionate to require them to return to  that
    country.  Accordingly the issue which would have to be  established  by
    the appellant before a claim could succeed under  Article  8  would  be
    that the requirement of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules  is  established,  which  is  that  there  are  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant and her son reintegrating  into  Albania  on
    return.  Mr Eaton referred the  Tribunal  to  the  expert  evidence  of
    Antonia Young, an acknowledged expert on Albania who has  given  expert
    evidence in a number of cases concerning conditions  in  Albania  which
    had been considered within  this  Tribunal  and  also  to  the  country
    guidance given by this Tribunal in TD and AD  (Trafficked  women)  (CG)
    [2016] UKUT 92,  which  contained  a  number  of  findings  as  to  the
    difficulties which would be faced by women returning on their own  (and
    by analogy the difficulties would be even greater in respect of a woman
    returning on her own with a very small child)  where  such  a  returnee
    lacked family support.  Mr Eaton accepted  for  the  purposes  of  this
    appeal that in the event that the Tribunal was not satisfied  that  the
    appellant would be returning to a situation where she  would  not  have
    family support she  would  be  unable  to  establish  very  significant
    obstacles.  Accordingly the first matter which  the  appellant  has  to
    establish is that she would lack family support on return.

 9. On behalf of the respondent it was Mr Bramble's submission first of all
    that it was not even established that the appellant could or would  not
    return to her husband.  In light of Judge Devittie's finding  that  her
    claims as to the circumstances in which she had felt required to  leave
    Albania were concocted, she had failed to establish even that  she  had
    genuinely split from her husband.  In reply to this submission Mr Eaton
    submitted that on the balance of probabilities at least  this  Tribunal
    should accept  that  whatever  the  reason  might  have  been  for  the
    appellant's decision to leave Albania, the fact was that she  had  done
    so nearly two years ago and in those  circumstances  her  marriage  was
    effectively at an end and therefore she would not be returning  to  her
    husband.

10. Mr Eaton submitted that her position would be  that  her  family  would
    disown her because she would have brought shame on them by parting from
    the man they had chosen for her as a husband, in circumstances where  a
    child had been born shortly after she had left such that  it  would  be
    perceived within Albanian society that that child may very well not  be
    her husband's.  The background evidence would support her position with
    regard to this  claim,  because  Albania  was  known  to  be  a  highly
    patriarchal society where women who have been perceived to have behaved
    in an immoral way would be likely to be shunned both by their  families
    and by society in general.

11. Mr Eaton further submitted that there was no reason why  the  appellant
    should be disbelieved  having  claimed  throughout  that  she  was  not
    certain whether or not the child was that of her husband.

12. Mr Bramble's position on this was that even if the  appellant  did  not
    wish to return to her husband, there was no reason to assume  that  she
    would not have the support of her family.

    My Findings

13. Although Mr Eaton has expressed his submissions in a persuasive manner,
    nonetheless, having  given  very  full  and  anxious  scrutiny  to  the
    arguments he has advanced, I am unable to find that the  appellant  has
    established as she has to that she would lack family support on return.
     The part of her evidence which I did accept entirely was when she said
    in terms that "I want my child to grow up in an English culture".   Her
    evidence with regard  to  her  contact  with  her  family  however  was
    unconvincing.  She claims that she has not been in contact with  anyone
    in Albania since leaving; apparently this even includes her friend  who
    on her case gave her ï¿½1,500 or so, which is an enormous sum for someone
    in Albania to find, to the extent that she did  not  even  send  her  a
    postcard or any other communication to let her know that she was  safe.
    If she had been in contact with this friend who had helped her so  much
    in the past it might have been difficult for her  to  explain  why  she
    would not be prepared to assist her further in the future.

14. She was also, in my  judgment,  in  difficulties  with  regard  to  her
    evidence regarding the person  she  claimed  that  she  had  "committed
    adultery" with before the birth of her child.  Initially  reluctant  to
    give any details, she then said his name was "Alex" but  that  she  had
    not been in any contact with him either.  Furthermore, she did not know
    even where he lived or how to get in contact with him, and nor did  she
    wish to do so.  Again, she gave no further particulars as to  why  this
    should be.  Essentially, what she was saying was  that  she  has  never
    been in contact with anybody in Albania, does not wish to  do  so,  and
    would not get any support from any of them on return.   As  the  people
    with whom she claims not to have had contact or even  to  wish  contact
    with include a friend who has provided so much assistance to her in the
    past, a lover with whom she must have had a relationship which was  not
    said to be just a transient one, her mother, to whom she did speak even
    though she may have believed (in evidence which was  not  accepted)  to
    have been dominated by her own husband and her husband (concerning whom
    again her evidence was  disbelieved)  I  cannot  accept  that  she  has
    established as she needs to that  she  would  lack  family  support  on
    return.

15. I also have to consider the appellant's evidence in this regard from  a
    starting point that she is a person who has chosen to concoct  a  false
    claim about the circumstances in which she came to this  country.   The
    highest that I can find her case made out is that she  is  currently  a
    single woman living in this country with a child.  In my  judgment  she
    has not established any more than that; she has  not  established  that
    her family would not support her on return, that  she  would  not  have
    continued to have the assistance of her friend whom she says had helped
    her so greatly in the past, that she would not be  able  to  have  some
    assistance from the man she now claims might be the father of her child
    or even that she  would  not  have  the  continuing  support  from  her
    husband, even if she does not wish to return to him.

16. In these circumstances, her claim is simply not  made  out  and  it  is
    therefore not necessary to embark on a hypothetical exercise of whether
    or not if she had established what she has not established she would or
    would not face significant difficulties on return.

17. On the findings that I have made, which is that the appellant  has  not
    made out that she would lack family support on return, she has not made
    out  that  there  would  be  very  significant  difficulties   to   her
    reintegrating, with her son, on return.  Furthermore, when  considering
    proportionality,  and  her  son's  best  interests,  as  she  has   not
    established  that  her  husband  has  behaved  towards   her   in   any
    discreditable or violent way, she has not made out either that it would
    not be in her son's best interests to grow up in a society where he can
    see his father.  Even if her son's father  is  a  man  other  than  her
    husband (and again this is not established either and nor is there  any
    reason why her doubts should be expressed to anyone  either)  it  would
    seem to be in her son's best interests to see his father (whether  this
    is the appellant's husband or her lover).

18. Accordingly, the appellant has not established that she is entitled  to
    succeed under Article 8 or under the Rules, and in these circumstances,
    on the particular facts of this case,  as  has  been  accepted  on  her
    behalf by Mr Eaton, she cannot succeed  under  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules either.

19. It follows that the  Article  8  aspect  of  the  claim  must  also  be
    dismissed and I will so find.

    Decision

    I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Devittie  to  the
    extent that  he  failed  to  make  any  findings  with  regard  to  the
    appellant's Article 8 claim, and I substitute the following decision:

    The appellant's appeal is dismissed, on  asylum  grounds  and  also  on
    human rights grounds, Articles 3 and 8.
