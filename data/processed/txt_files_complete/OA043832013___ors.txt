Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms K Smith, instructed by Iris Law Firm


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Oliver,  who  for  reasons  given  in  his
    determination  dated  13  January  2014  allowed  the  appeals  by  the
    respondents.  I shall refer to the respondents as the claimants.   They
    comprise four Afghan nationals being the wife and children of Mr Khalil
    Hussayni.  He is also an Afghanistan national and has indefinite  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom which was granted on 13 January 2010.

 2. The claimants made application for entry clearance  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom with the sponsor on 14 June  2012.   Their  applications
    were refused for reasons given in decisions  dated  22  November  2012.
    The sponsor had relied on income from a  pizza  business  to  meet  the
    maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules then  in  force.   So
    far as the first claimant was concerned, paragraph 281(v) required that
    the parties would be able to maintain  themselves  and  any  dependants
    adequately without recourse to  public  funds.   Different  Immigration
    Rules related to the other claimants, whose applications  were  refused
    in line with that of their mother but the problem they  faced  was  the
    same.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer  did  not  accept  the  evidence  that  the
    sponsor was on target to earn �23,504 before tax and national insurance
    in the year of application.  He observed that the claimants  needed  to
    demonstrate a minimum of �1,327 per month net income after the costs of
    accommodation of �400 per month and council tax of �100 per  month  had
    been taken into account, this being the current  threshold  for  public
    funds.

 4. The judge heard evidence from the sponsor and had before him  a  volume
    of documentation produced to support the claimed income stream from the
    pizza business.  He noted some of that evidence  in  the  determination
    but did not undertake a detailed analysis.  He concluded  at  paragraph
    9:

         "I had no reason to doubt the honesty of the sponsor and  therefore
         accept that he had been running the pizza business for a sufficient
         time to be able to make a reasoned estimate of his likely  earnings
         as reflected in his self-assessment figures to HMRC.  On this basis
         he not only meets the relevant DWP figures but would  even  satisfy
         the new and much more onerous figures  without  even  touching  the
         surplus in his bank account."

 5. The challenge by the Secretary of State is in essence to  the  adequacy
    of the judge's reasons for  finding  in  the  claimants'  favour.   The
    complaint is that the judge had failed to give adequate reasons why  he
    accepted  the  sponsor's  oral  evidence  in   the   absence   of   any
    corroboratory documentation.

 6. Ms Smith, on my direction, helpfully tabulated the documentation relied
    on by the  claimants  which  she  then  discussed  with  Ms  Johnstone.
    Although Ms Johnstone observed that some of the  documents  before  the
    judge had not been before the Entry Clearance Officer  and  thus  there
    had been no opportunity for the Entry Clearance Officer to verify them,
    nevertheless she conceded that a number of the documents did show  that
    the claimants could meet the level of income support rate.   There  was
    no dispute that they did not relate to the date of decision.   Candidly
    she accepted in the light of the exercise that had been  undertaken  by
    Ms Smith that it was open to the Tribunal to find that any error by the
    judge was not material.  In the  light  of  that  approach  it  is  not
    necessary for me to carry out an analysis of the documents.

 7. It has to be said that the judge's determination is thin  on  reasoning
    and it is a pity that he  did  not  provide  further  reasons  for  his
    conclusion.  Had he done so it may well have meant that  there  was  no
    need for the Secretary of State to bring her challenge.

 8. Ms Johnstone had no further submissions to make beyond those I have set
    out above. My conclusion is that the judge erred but that his error was
    not material  on  the  basis  that  the  material  before  him  clearly
    supported the conclusion he had reached.

 9. Accordingly the appeal by the Secretary of State in the Upper  Tribunal
    is dismissed. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
