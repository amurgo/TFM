                                  JUDGMENT


      INTRODUCTION

      1.  This  is  an  application  for  judicial  review  challenging  the
         Respondent's decision dated 18 January 2018 ("the First  Decision")
         maintained following administrative review on 5  March  2018  ("the
         Second Decision") refusing the First  Applicant's  application  for
         indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") as a Tier 1  (general)  migrant.
         The Second and Third  Applicants  were  refused  ILR  in  line  and
         therefore the success or otherwise of their applications depends on
         that of the First Applicant.   Hereafter,  I  refer  only  to  "the
         Applicant" as meaning the First Applicant.


      2. The basis of the refusal of the  Applicant's  application  is  that
         paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules  ("the  Rules")  applies.
         The application of paragraph 322(5) is itself premised on a factual
         inconsistency between a declaration of self-employed income to  the
         Home Office in an application made in 2013 and that declared  in  a
         self-assessment tax return to HMRC in January  2014  (dealing  with
         the tax year  2012-13).    I  deal  with  the  way  in  which  that
         discrepancy is said to have arisen below.


      3. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by UTJ Lindsley
         on the papers in a decision sent on 11 October 2018.   She  granted
         permission on the basis that ground one is arguable.  That concerns
         the application of paragraph 322(5) and whether  the  Applicant  is
         guilty of dishonesty.  However, as  Mr  Saini  points  out  in  his
         skeleton argument, the grounds on which permission was granted were
         not limited by Judge Lindsley and he therefore  has  permission  to
         argue all grounds.


      4. Detailed grounds were filed by the Respondent on 15 November  2018.
         The application was initially scheduled to come  before  me  on  12
         December 2018 but I adjourned the  hearing  with  consent  of  both
         parties because the Applicant's previous  direct  access  barrister
         was not able to attend.  I need say no more about  this  not  least
         because the Applicant has since instructed solicitors  and  changed
         barrister.


      5. I received a bundle of documents from the Applicant.  References to
         that bundle  below  are  given  as  [AB/xx].   I  also  received  a
         supplementary bundle of documents from the Respondent  referred  to
         as [RB/xx] and a joint  bundle  of  authorities.  I  received  very
         helpful skeleton arguments from both Counsel which I have  read  in
         full but refer to only so far as necessary.  I am grateful to  both
         Counsel for the detailed nature  of  the  written  submissions  and
         their more succinct oral submissions.


      FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE


      6. The Applicant came to the UK as a student on 30  April  2010.   His
         leave was extended as a Tier 1 general migrant  to  13  June  2016.
         The discrepancy relates to an application for further leave made in
         2013.  On 11 June 2016, he made an application for  ILR  which  was
         refused by the First Decision.  Prior to the making  of  the  First
         Decision,  the  Respondent  sent  the  Applicant  a   questionnaire
         requiring certain information about this application and  including
         questions relating to his self-employment income which lays at  the
         heart of the discrepancy.


      7. The covering letter to that questionnaire sent  on  27  April  2017
         appears at [AB/53].  Having set out the provisions of paragraph  19
         of Appendix A  to  the  Rules  relating  to  genuine  earnings  and
         paragraph 245CD(b) by reference to paragraphs 322(1) to (13) of the
         Rules relating to the general  grounds  of  refusal,  the  covering
         letter continues as follows (so far as relevant):


           "Therefore, in order to enable us to  consider  the  application
           further, and in accordance with Appendix A paragraph 19(i) (with
           reference to paragraphs 19(j) and (k)), and paragraph 245CD  (b)
           of the Immigration Rules, please can you provide  the  following
           documentation.  Please ensure that you send  ORIGINAL  documents
           as photocopies are NOT acceptable for the purposes  of  deciding
           your application.
            Documents required:
             .  Please  complete  and  return  the  attached   questionnaire
               summarising your finances relating to your  self  employment.
               Please  also  provide  any  supporting  evidence   you   have
               referenced within the questionnaire.
             . Please provide a SA302 form and Tax  year  overview  for  the
               period in which you have been registered as self employed, or
               have been  a  director  of  a  limited  company.   These  are
               available from your accountant's tax software  or  your  HMRC
               online account.
             . If you are the director of a  limited  company,  please  also
               provide  audited  annual  accounts   where   available,   and
               unaudited accounts if not up to 5 years.  Please also provide
               Company Tax returns for the period  that  your  business  has
               been trading up to 5 years."


         The letter goes on to point to the duty set out in the HMRC website
         to keep tax records  for  at  least  five  years  from  31  January
         following the tax year to which the tax return relates.


      8.  The  questionnaire  itself  is  at  [AB/79-83]  and  includes  the
         following relevant questions and answers:


            (a)  The tax years in which  the  applicant  was  self-employed,
           whether tax returns were submitted in each of those years and by
           who - the Applicant confirmed that he was self-employed  in  the
           period 2011/12 to 2016/17, that tax returns were filed  for  all
           years and that those were filed by Mahendra V Nagda (and not,  I
           note, Doshi & Company which is the firm said to have  filed  the
           relevant tax return: nothing turns on that though as it is clear
           from the tax return - to which I refer  below  -  that  Doshi  &
           Company did file the relevant tax return).


            (b)  In relation to the turnover, net profit, gross  profit  and
           expenses  figures,  the  Applicant  simply  said   "Please   see
           enclosed" - it is not clear to me  what  was  enclosed,  but  by
           reference to the documents requested,  the  Applicant  ought  to
           have sent a SA302 and Tax year  overview.   The  SA302  for  the
           relevant year is at [AB/176] and shows that the return was filed
           on 31 January 2014 by Doshi  &  Company.   For  that  reason,  I
           reject Mr Saini's submission that the Applicant would  not  have
           known his tax calculation for the year in question.  I  also  do
           not accept his submission that the Applicant would not have time
           to check the return because it was filed on  the  last  day  for
           filing (31 January 2014): it cannot  be  inferred  just  because
           that was the date of filing that the Applicant was not  provided
           with it earlier and  given  time  to  check  it.   He  expressly
           confirmed in answer to question  12  that  he  had  checked  and
           signed all returns.   He confirmed at question 13  that  he  was
           satisfied that the returns accurately reflected his income  from
           self-employment and in response to question 14 that he  had  not
           ever needed to correct his returns.


            (c)  There is reference at question 15 to penalties having  been
           imposed for late submission of returns, but I do not  understand
           that to relate to the discrepancy here.   It  is  common  ground
           that the Applicant did not amend his tax return for the year  in
           question until after the Decisions.


      9. This case is slightly unusual on its facts from other cases of this
         nature in that the Applicant had not made any application to  amend
         his tax return and therefore  repeated  in  the  questionnaire  the
         figures which he had given in his  2013  application  to  the  Home
         Office.  The  discrepancy  is  said  to  be  between  self-employed
         earnings for 2012-13 declared to the Home Office as ï¿½35,499  and  a
         figure given to HMRC for self-employed income for the tax year 2012-
         13 of ï¿½28,552.  The difference is ï¿½6,947.


     10. This is also an unusual case because the discrepancy arises from  a
         combination of asserted mistakes rather than one single  error.   I
         clarified with the parties at the outset my  understanding  of  how
         the  discrepancy  is  said  to  arise.   I  will  deal  below  when
         considering the grounds, with the way in which  the  Applicant  has
         explained the discrepancy to the Respondent insofar as he has.   It
         is however helpful to set  out  my  understanding  of  the  factual
         position which was confirmed by the parties as correct.


     11. The Applicant's accounting year for self-employment purposes was  1
         May 2012 to 30 April 2013 (see accounts at [AB/162]).  As such, his
         income crossed two tax years, 2012-13 and 2013-14.   An  adjustment
         might therefore have been required to the figures in  the  accounts
         for the 2012-13 tax year.   According  to  the  tax  return,  which
         appears at [AB/164-177], the adjustment claimed was ï¿½2,596.


     12. There were two other errors as also set  out  in  two  accountants'
         letters dated 1 February 2018  which  appear  at  [AB/148-149]  and
         which the Respondent accepts  were  sent  with  the  Administrative
         Review.  It is convenient to set out what is said in the fuller  of
         those two letters from  Mahendra  V  Nagda  FCCA  (the  Applicant's
         current accountant) as follows:


           "We should  inform  that  we  have  taken  over  from  Anthony's
           Services and have investigated the matter of Mr [M]'s SA302  for
           12-13 and have found that  the  subcontractor  Doshi  &  Co  who
           submitted the Return on behalf  of  Anthony's  Services  made  a
           human error in entering the figures on the Return which resulted
           in the incorrect profit figure.
           Instead of entering  sales  as  ï¿½37,820  as  per  accounts  they
           entered ï¿½35,499 as sales which is the profit figures.  The other
           3 errors they made was to enter motor expenses as ï¿½1,684 when it
           should have been ï¿½684 and second error was to claim home rent of
           ï¿½450 when this was not on the accounts and the third  error  was
           to claim ï¿½667 when accounts showed ï¿½87.  The combined effect  of
           this was to show profit as ï¿½31,148.  In  addition  there  was  a
           further reduction due to tax calculation in accordance with  tax
           law.  The taxable profit was reduced by ï¿½2596 to  adjust  profit
           for 12-13 to be covering period April 12 to  March  13  and  our
           client had started  in  May  12  to  April  13.   We  hope  this
           clarifies the profit position.  We enclose a  copy  of  the  Tax
           Return for 12-13 so you can see the errors.
           We have a letter from Doshi & Co to HMRC explaining the error to
           them and asking them to adjust the tax  which  our  client  will
           pay."


     13.  The  other  letter  from  Doshi  &  Company  (which  is  the  firm
         responsible  for  the  2012-13  tax  return)  is  less   full   but
         corroborates what is said about the nature of the errors - at least
         so far as the first two errors are concerned.


     14. The discrepancy in the figures (leaving aside  the  financial  year
         adjustment) is also evident  from  a  comparison  between  the  tax
         return filed on 31 January 2014 (at [AB/164-176]) and the  accounts
         for the Applicant's business dated 24  May  2013  relating  to  the
         financial year 1 May 2012 to 30 April 2013 (at [AB/162-163]).  As I
         understand it, those were the accounts submitted to the Home Office
         in 2013 to support the Applicant's application for further leave to
         remain.


     15. The accounts were prepared by an accountant other than the one  who
         submitted the tax return on the Applicant's behalf.   However,  the
         letter from the current accountant  records  that  the  latter  was
         acting as a subcontractor for the previous accountant who  prepared
         the accounts.  It is also worthy of  note  that  the  turnover  and
         profit figures in those accounts correlate with the  figures  which
         it is said should have been inserted in the tax return for 2012-13.
          There is no record in the 24 May 2013 letter of any  need  for  an
         adjustment  to  income  based  on  the  different  financial  year.
         Indeed, the accountant, in the letter at [AB/163]  says  that  "our
         client's net profit from self-employment [recorded as ï¿½35,499] will
         be declared on Self-Assessment Return for 2012-13 to be  issued  by
         HM Revenue & Customs".


     16. In short summary, as well as the adjustment for the  accounting/tax
         year of ï¿½2,596, there is said to be one error in the insertion of a
         wrong figure for turnover which had  the  effect  of  reducing  the
         profit figure by ï¿½2,321 and further errors, one of which may  be  a
         transposition error but which taken  together  had  the  effect  of
         inflating expenses by ï¿½2,030 and therefore reducing profits by  the
         same figure.  The total effect of those three errors equates to the
         ï¿½6,947 on which discrepancy reliance is placed.


     17. Mr Saini makes the point that the amount of the discrepancy in this
         case is not significant.  He says that the tax difference  is  only
         ï¿½1,389 and, given the amount of tax which the Applicant did pay  at
         the time, there would be no incentive for him to under-declare  his
         earnings to HMRC.


     18. As I have understood the Respondent's case, however, it is that the
         Applicant is rather more likely to have over-declared income to the
         Home Office in order to succeed in his 2013  application  (although
         it remains the Respondent's position that he does not know which of
         the two declarations is the wrong one).  In order to  consider  the
         position in that regard, I enquired of the  Respondent  during  the
         hearing what the position  would  have  been  in  relation  to  the
         application in 2013 if the Applicant  had  declared  as  his  self-
         employed earnings the figure he gave to HMRC.


     19. Mr Holborn very helpfully caused enquiries to be made in the course
         of the hearing and informed me that, based on the Rules at the time
         of the 2013 application, the Appellant would be required  to  score
         75 points for attributes under paragraph 7 of  Appendix  A  to  the
         Rules.  The Applicant scored 80 points  which  included  35  points
         awarded for earnings of ï¿½55,000 to ï¿½65,000.  The Applicant's  total
         income earnt was declared to the Home Office as ï¿½56,120.28 made  up
         of the  ï¿½35,499  plus  earnings  from  employment  (which  are  not
         disputed).  If self-employed earnings were  as  declared  to  HMRC,
         this would have the effect of reducing income  to  ï¿½49,173.28.   At
         the relevant time, earnings of ï¿½40,000 to ï¿½50,000 led to  an  award
         of only 25 points and earnings of ï¿½50,000 to ï¿½55,000 to 30  points.
         Accordingly, if all the discrepancy were discounted, the  Applicant
         would not have been granted leave.  If  only  one  or  two  of  the
         elements making up the discrepancy were discounted,  the  Applicant
         would have scored 75 points and therefore would have  been  granted
         leave to remain.


    THE DECISIONS


    The First Decision


     20. As I  have  already  noted,  the  Applicant,  when  completing  the
         questionnaire sent to him, declared  the  same  figure  as  he  had
         declared in his earlier application to the Home Office that  is  to
         say turnover of ï¿½37,820, net profit  of  ï¿½35,499  and  expenses  of
         ï¿½2,321.  He did so under the heading of the 2012-13 financial  year
         and declared  nil  self-employed  earnings  for  2013-14.   As  the
         Respondent points out, that is inconsistent with the point made  in
         the accountant's letter that the figures in  the  tax  return  were
         adjusted for the difference between the tax and  accounting  years.
         In any event, the Applicant ought to have declared  the  additional
         income to HMRC in the following tax year.  It is common ground that
         he did not do so until after the discrepancies were brought to  his
         attention.  He says that this is the accountant's fault for failing
         to inform him that he had income on which tax had not been paid.


     21. The First Decision, having set out the Applicant's answers  in  the
         questionnaire goes on as follows:


           "You have provided an SA302 (printed 09 May  2017)  which  shows
           that the declared profit for 2012/13 from  self  employment  was
           declared as ï¿½28,552.00.
           We have also gathered information from HMRC  which  corroborates
           this amount was declared to HMRC.
           This figure is ï¿½6,947 less than what was  declared  to  UKVI  in
           respect to your application dated 25 May 2013.
           The information provided by yourself  (SA302)  also  contradicts
           your answer to question 5 where you state net profit for 2012/13
           as ï¿½35,499.  This therefore casts doubt on  the  credibility  on
           your self employed earnings.
           The Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the  earnings  you
           declared in your previous Tier 1 (General) application of 25 May
           2013 are not consistent with your declarations made to  HMRC  in
           the relevant tax periods.  The fact that you  declared  earnings
           to UKVI in your Tier 1 (General) application dated 25  May  2013
           compared to what you declared to  HMRC  for  a  similar  periods
           differed  significantly,  does   not   demonstrate   that   your
           declaration of earnings to both UKVI and HMRC are consistent.
           In view of the clear discrepancies between  the  above  earnings
           that you have declared to HMRC and the earnings you had declared
           to UKVI for your previous immigration  application  we  are  not
           satisfied that you have been able to credibly  account  for  why
           the earnings declared to HMRC were significantly less  than  the
           earnings you had declared  in  your  initial  Tier  1  (General)
           applications.
           Had you declared earnings in your Tier 1  (General)  application
           of  25  May  2013  which  were  consistent  with  your   initial
           declarations to HMRC,  you  would  not  have  scored  sufficient
           points under the Immigration Rules for leave  to  remain  to  be
           granted.
           We are satisfied  that,  based  on  your  actions  in  declaring
           different amounts of income to HMRC and UKVI,  you  have  either
           misrepresented your earnings to HMRC in order to reduce your tax
           liability or provided false information about your  earnings  to
           UKVI in order to obtain leave to remain or both.
           In view of the above, and with regard  to  the  fact  that  your
           declarations to HMRC did  not  corroborate  with  your  earnings
           claimed in your initial application, the Secretary of  State  on
           balance  of  probabilities  is  not  satisfied  that  your  self
           employed earnings claimed in your previous and  current  Tier  1
           (General) applications are genuine."


     22. Having set out the text of rule 322(5), the Respondent continued as
         follows:


           "You submitted the requested Questionnaire on the  24  May  2017
           detailing your previous earnings and Tax.  These documents  have
           been considered by our department and it has been concluded that
           you do not meet Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.
           The Secretary of State has  considered  whether  the  particular
           circumstances of your case merit  the  exercise  of  discretion.
           Having considered those circumstances the Secretary of State  is
           satisfied that  the  refusal  remains  appropriate  and  is  not
           prepared to exercise discretion in your favour.
           Your actions in declaring different amounts of  income  to  HMRC
           and UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light of your  character
           and conduct it would be undesirable to allow you  to  remain  in
           the United Kingdom.  Your character and conduct with regards  to
           declaring  your  income  would  lead  to  a  refusal   of   your
           application  under  General  Grounds  Paragraph  322(5)  of  the
           Immigration Rules is not a mandatory decision, it is  considered
           that your actions in declaring different income to HMRC and UKVI
           would  mean  that  a   refusal   under   Paragraph   322(5)   is
           appropriate."


     23. As  a  result  of  that  conclusion,  the  Respondent  refused  the
         application under paragraph 245CD(b) of the Rules.  The  Respondent
         also  refused  the  application  under  paragraph   245CD(g)   with
         reference to Appendix A to the Rules on the basis that he  was  not
         satisfied that the Applicant's self-employed earnings were genuine,
         having regard to the earlier discrepancy.


     24. I enquired of Mr Holborn what was the effect  of  the  Respondent's
         conclusion as to the genuineness of earnings as this has  not  been
         separately challenged by the Applicant.  Mr Holborn  accepted  that
         this part of the First Decision stands or falls with my  conclusion
         about the Respondent's reliance on the Applicant's dishonesty.   He
         said that the only point on which it might make a difference  would
         be if I accepted that the Respondent was entitled to conclude  that
         the Applicant was dishonest but did not accept that the  Respondent
         exercised discretion lawfully.  If the Applicant were dishonest, it
         would follow that the Respondent was entitled to conclude that  the
         earnings were not genuine.  The application  could  therefore  fall
         for refusal irrespective of the exercise of any discretion.


    The Second Decision


     25. The Applicant  applied  for  administrative  review  of  the  First
         Decision.  I do not have a  copy  of  the  application  before  me.
         However, the substance of it can be inferred from what is  said  in
         the Second Decision as follows:


           "In your  administrative  review  you  state  that  due  to  the
           accountant's error, the  information  filed  to  HMRC  has  been
           changed to what it should have been.  You also  state  that  you
           have paid a very high amount of tax, therefore it was  not  your
           incentive to file for any reduction.  You add that the error  of
           the accountants was not spotted, even at the time you  completed
           the questionnaire and that it was the  Secretary  of  State  who
           made you aware of the discrepancy.  You further state  that  you
           had no knowledge of  the  error  and  the  accountant  has  made
           mistakes when filing your tax return."


     26. The Respondent replied as follows:


           "However, having entered the UK and decided to  engage  in  self
           employment  it  is  your  responsibility  to  maintain  accurate
           records of your finances and  tax  liabilities  and  ensure  any
           earnings are accounted for and declared in line with the UK  law
           and HMRC  regulations.   The  ultimate  responsibility  for  the
           requirements lies with you and not your accountant, as  you  are
           responsible for ensuring that when the tax returns are submitted
           to HMRC the details within  are  correct.   It  is  additionally
           noted there would have been a clear benefit to  yourself  either
           by under-reporting your  self  employed  earnings  to  HMRC  and
           therefore reducing your personal  tax  liability,  or  by  over-
           inflating your self employed  earnings  in  order  to  meet  the
           threshold for points required as a  Tier  1  (General)  migrant.
           Upon  review  we  are  satisfied  the  original  caseworker  has
           assessed your application correctly and we have  maintained  the
           original decision."


     27. Mr Holborn asked me also to have regard to what is recorded in  the
         Respondent's G-CID notes which were produced for  the  hearing  (at
         [RB/5-40]) because, as he pointed  out,  there  have  been  various
         explanations given for how the discrepancy arose.  I can  obviously
         take account only of what  was  said  to  the  Respondent  and  not
         explanations which may have come  to  light  after  the  First  and
         Second Decisions were made.   Under  "Reason(s)  why  applicant  is
         challenging the decision" ([RB/33]) the following is said:


           "Due to the accountant's error the information filed on the HMRC
           has been changed to what it should have been.
           It is submitted that applicant has paid very high amount of  tax
           and it was not in his incentive to file any reduction.
           The error of the accountants which was not spotted even  at  the
           time the questionnaire was completed and returned  to  the  Home
           Office.
                 Attached are letters that accountant has given.
           It is submitted that  the  SSHD  made  applicant  aware  of  the
           discrepancy in regards to the tax return prior  to  the  refusal
           Applicant would have surely resorted to contact  the  accountant
           to explain to him the discrepancy in the  information  that  was
           supplied.
           Clearly this was not within the knowledge of the  applicant  and
           the account has mistakenly done the mistake in the filing.
            Raises SH (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016]
            Raises evidential flexibility
            Missing evidence
           Although applicant does  not  consider  there  was  any  missing
           evidence, the evidence in question can be  submitted  again  for
           its assessment
            The accountants letter can invite the case to be reassessed
           The applicant is also in the process of filing the  amended  tax
           returns for which the accountant is undertaking the liability of
             Request  that  application  is  considered   under   evidential
         flexibility policy."


         I have already set out the  content  of  one  of  the  accountant's
         letters at [12] above.


      THE GROUNDS


     28. I begin  by  summarising  the  four  grounds  relied  upon  by  the
         Applicant:


         (1)      The Applicant challenges the Decisions by reference  to  a
         review carried out by the Respondent following a  commitment  given
         to the Home Affairs Select Committee in May  2018  ("the  Review").
         That culminated in a document published by the Home Office entitled
         "Review of Applications by Tier 1 (General) Migrants Refused  under
         Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules" (BA/641  onwards)  ("the
         Review Document") published in November 2018.  The  Applicant  says
         that the Decisions are not  consistent  with  the  content  of  the
         Review Document ("The Review Ground").


         (2) The Applicant says that the Decisions applying paragraph 322(5)
         of the Rules  are  irrational  and/or  unlawful  ("The  Rationality
         Ground").


         (3)  The  Applicant  also  says  that  the  Respondent  has  failed
         lawfully to exercise his discretion under paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Rules ("The Discretion Ground").


         (4) Finally, the Applicant says that the procedure adopted  in  the
         making of the Decisions  was  unfair  ("The  Procedural  Unfairness
         Ground").

      THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND SUBMISSIONS


     29. I received a joint bundle of authorities but was taken to very  few
         of the cases with  which  I  deal  below  in  the  context  of  the
         submissions made grouped together by reference to each of the above
         grounds.


    The Review Ground


     30. The Review arose in the context of a commitment made  to  the  Home
         Affairs Select Committee by the Respondent by letter dated  25  May
         2018.  It is accepted that matters have moved on since the original
         judicial  review  grounds  were  drafted.   Mr  Saini  directed  my
         attention to the Review Document which at [BA/651] makes  reference
         to discrepancies in excess of ï¿½10,000 being found  in  90%  of  the
         cases and that the average discrepancy  was  ï¿½27,600.   The  Review
         Document goes on to say that "[w]e considered these to be major and
         significant differences rather than minor  errors  by  applicants."
         Mr Saini makes the point that the discrepancy  here  is  less  than
         ï¿½10,000. He inferred therefore that the Respondent was not entitled
         to rely on the discrepancy as being "significant".


     31. Mr Holborn submitted that the significance lies not in  the  amount
         of the discrepancy but the impact of it in  terms  not  only  of  a
         saving of tax (which I accept is not substantial in this particular
         case) but also in terms of obtaining leave to remain to  which  the
         Applicant might not otherwise have been entitled.


    The Rationality Ground and The Discretion Ground


     32. It is convenient to take these two grounds together as the majority
         of the submissions made both in writing and  orally  concern  these
         two grounds and Mr  Saini  accepted  that  there  is  some  overlap
         between the two.


     33. It is common ground  that  the  test  which  I  should  apply  when
         assessing the rationality of the First and Second Decisions is  the
         usual "Wednesbury" test.  However, Mr Saini says, by  reference  to
         cases such as R (on the application of Giri) v Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ  784  that  a  heightened
         standard of review applies.  However, I do not  read  Lord  Justice
         Richards' judgment as of assistance to the Applicant's case on this
         point.   He  refers  at  [32]  to  the  submission  made  that  the
         "Wednesbury" test was an insufficient basis on which to assess  the
         Respondent's decision concerning deception (by reference  to  cases
         such as Pham v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2015]
         UKSV 19 on which Mr Saini also relies) but goes on to say this:


           "I accept that a finding that deception has been used should  be
           scrutinised very carefully but I do not accept that the relevant
           question is anything other than whether it was  reasonably  open
           to the decision-maker, on the material before him, to find  that
           deception had been used."


         In other words, the test remains whether the decision is one  which
         no reasonable decision maker could make but the decision has to  be
         carefully scrutinised in relation to  the  evidence  on  which  the
         decision rests. There may be a heightened level of scrutiny, but no
         heightened standard of review applies.


     34. The headnote to the case of R (on the application of Khan)  v  SSHD
         (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT  384  (IAC)
         ("Khan"), a decision of Mr Justice  Spencer  sitting  as  an  Upper
         Tribunal Judge, bears  setting  out  in  full  as  to  the  general
         approach to cases of this nature:


           "(i)   Where there has been a significant difference between the
           income claimed in a previous application for leave to remain and
           the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is  entitled
           to draw an inference that the Applicant has  been  deceitful  or
           dishonest  and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR   within
           paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.   Such  an  inference
           could be expected where there is no  plausible  explanation  for
           the discrepancy.
           (ii)  Where an Applicant has presented evidence to  show  that,
           despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact  dishonest
           but only careless, then  the  Secretary  of  State  must  decide
           whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view,
           to displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.
           (iii)  In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary  of
           State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof
           is the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has
           been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with
           the consequence that he is denied settlement in this country  is
           a very serious finding with serious consequences.
           (iv)  For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
           an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not  be
           the end of the matter, given that the accountant will or  should
           have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate
           and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the  Applicant
           will have known of his or her earnings and will have expected to
           pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within  a
           reasonable time to remedy the situation, the Secretary of  State
           may be entitled  to  conclude  that  this  failure  justifies  a
           conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty.
           (v)    When  considering  whether  or  not  the  Applicant  is
           dishonest or merely  careless  the  Secretary  of  State  should
           consider the following matters,  inter  alia,  as  well  as  the
           extent to which they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):
                                   i.    Whether the explanation  for  the
error by the accountant is plausible;
                                ii.      Whether the  documentation  which
            can be assumed to exist (for  example,  correspondence  between
            the Applicant and his accountant at the time of the tax return)
            has been disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why
            it is missing;
                              iii.     Why the Applicant did  not  realise
            that an error had been made because his liability  to  pay  tax
            was less than he should have expected;
                              iv.      Whether, at any stage, the Applicant
            has taken steps to remedy the situation and, if so, when  those
            steps were  taken  and  the  explanation  for  any  significant
            delay."


     35. In relation to what he submits is the correct test for whether  the
         Applicant has been dishonest,  Mr  Saini  draws  attention  to  the
         speech of Lord Hughes in Ivey  v  Genting  Casinos  (UK)  Ltd  (t/a
         Crockfords) [2017] UKSC 67 as follows:


           "When dishonesty is in question the fact-finding  tribunal  must
           first  ascertain  (subjectively)  the  actual   state   of   the
           individual's  knowledge  or  belief  as  to  the   facts.    The
           reasonableness or  otherwise  of  his  belief  is  a  matter  of
           evidence (often in practice determinative) going to  whether  he
           held the belief, but it is not an  additional  requirement  that
           his belief must be reasonable; the question  is  whether  it  is
           genuinely held.  When once  his  actual  state  of  mind  as  to
           knowledge or belief as to facts  is  established,  the  question
           whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is to be  determined
           by the fact-finder by  applying  the  (objective)  standards  of
           ordinary decent people..."


     36. Mr Saini asserted that the test as there set out applied equally to
         the Respondent as, in essence, the fact-finding tribunal.  Whilst I
         have no difficulty with the submission that the Respondent is to be
         treated as the primary fact-finder, the test as explained  in  Ivey
         has to be looked at in  its  context  which  was  a  civil  dispute
         between parties which involved a criminal element being  determined
         by the court based on oral evidence and not  an  application  being
         determined on written evidence.  The test is similar  to  that  set
         out in Khan but not identical and, since  Khan  involves  the  same
         factual context, I prefer the  test  as  explained  by  Mr  Justice
         Spencer in that latter case.


     37. Mr Saini also refers to the judgment of the Court of Session in Oji
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] CSOH 127  which
         dealt with a similar factual context as follows:


            "[30]      In my opinion the mere fact  that  different  amounts
           were  declared  to  HMRC  and  to  UKVI  did  not  constitute  a
           sufficient basis for the  conclusion  that  the  petitioner  had
           acted dishonestly and that it  was  accordingly  undesirable  to
           grant him permission to remain.  The letter does not contain any
           indication  that  the  respondent  addressed  her  mind  to  the
           question whether the discrepancy indicated inadvertence  on  the
           one hand or intentional wrongdoing on the other.  No  reason  is
           given for the conclusion that there was as a  deliberate  under-
           statement or over-statement of income in one  or  other  of  the
           declarations.  In the circumstances of  the  present  case,  one
           would have expected the respondent to explain why  an  inference
           of dishonesty was to be drawn despite not  having  afforded  the
           petitioner an opportunity to explain how it came about  that  he
           declared  such  small  amounts  of   self-employed   income   by
           comparison with the amounts declared to UKVI and subsequently to
           HMRC when the amendments were submitted."


         That passage has to be read in the context of  the  facts  of  that
         case,  however,  which  included  that  the  petitioner  had   been
         interviewed, was not asked about the discrepancy and  was  assessed
         as credible in the course of that interview.   The Court of Session
         cited the judgment in Khan at [27] of  the  judgment  with  evident
         approval for the guidance there given.  I am not assisted either by
         the judgment of UTJ Canavan in Williams v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department (JR/10532/2017): in that case  also  there  had
         been an interview of the applicant in which he had been assessed as
         credible which did not sit comfortably with the assessment that  he
         was not credible as to the explanation given for  failing  to  file
         any tax returns.


     38. I accept however by reference to what is said in Khan  itself  that
         the decision  whether  an  applicant  has  been  dishonest  in  his
         dealings with either HMRC or the Respondent does not  arise  solely
         by reason of the discrepancy.  As is said by Spencer J at [34],  an
         accountant's error may be a valid explanation for  the  discrepancy
         if explanation is given and it is plausible but, as is  also  there
         said, the Tribunals in previous cases have "rightly been sceptical"
         about whether the discrepancy is merely due to such an error.


     39. Mr Saini drew my attention to the Respondent's guidance in relation
         to the general grounds of refusal  entitled  "General  grounds  for
         refusal  Section  4  -  v26.0  (published  19  April  2016)   ("the
         Guidance").  As he accepts, although the guidance  in  relation  to
         paragraph 322(5) refers to criminal offences and  similar  conduct,
         it does emphasise that there is no need for a  criminal  conviction
         for paragraph 322(5) to apply.  The essential question  is  whether
         it is undesirable to allow  a  person  to  enter  or  remain.   The
         guidance refers to cases where a migrant has used devices such as a
         sham marriage to evade immigration control.    He  submits  however
         that the conduct must be akin  to  criminal  conduct  and  of  such
         gravity to lead to the conclusion that the migrant's presence is no
         longer conducive to the public good.


     40. Mr Saini also draws  attention  to  the  section  of  the  Guidance
         concerning  the  mandatory  grounds  of  refusal  under  paragraphs
         322(1A), 322(2) and 322(2A) of the Rules which  he  says  are  more
         appropriate to deal  with  cases  such  as  this.   That  reads  as
         follows:


           "When an applicant has used deception either in their current or
           previous application, for example, made a false  representation,
           submitted  false  documents  or  information  or  not  disclosed
           material facts, you:
               . Must refuse their application under paragraph 322(1A), when
                 deception has been used in a current application
               . Should refuse their  application  under  paragraph  322(2),
                 when deception was used in a previous application
               . Should refuse their application  under  paragraph  322(2A),
                 when  deception  was  used  in  a   current   or   previous
                 application to get a document from the Secretary  of  State
                 that shows that the applicant has a right to reside in  the
                 UK"


     41. Mr Saini moves from this reference to the section of  the  Guidance
         which states that, in order to apply those paragraphs,  there  must
         be positive evidence that the applicant has  lied  or  submitted  a
         false document.


     42. To the extent that Mr Saini's submission is that it is  not  lawful
         or rational for the Respondent to rely on paragraph  322(5)  rather
         than 322(1A) etc based on what is said in the  Guidance,  I  reject
         that submission.  The issue in  cases  such  as  this  is  that  an
         applicant is said to have provided information  to  HMRC  which  is
         inconsistent when compared with that produced to the  Home  Office.
         However, the Respondent is unlikely to know which of the  two  sets
         of information is false (assuming either is true).


     43. The paragraphs dealing with deception are mandatory  and  therefore
         require  cogent  proof  of  what  is  said  to  be  the  underlying
         deception.  In cases such as this, there is an inference drawn from
         the inconsistency for which an applicant may be able to provide  an
         explanation.  Unless he is able to do so, however, his  conduct  is
         characterised as dishonest and he may be refused  leave  to  remain
         depending on the nature of and reasons for that discrepancy.


     44. I am not greatly assisted either by the reference to character  and
         conduct in the guidance concerning applications for  naturalisation
         as a British citizen.  There may be some read-across  to  cases  of
         dishonesty  applying  paragraph  322(5)  but  the  purpose  of  the
         application is different.  Even if that  guidance  does  apply,  it
         does not assist  the  Applicant.   The  relevant  section  of  that
         guidance reads as follows (so far as relevant):


           "The decision maker will normally refuse  an  application  where
           the person has attempted to deceive or  otherwise  been  clearly
           dishonest  in  their  dealings  with   another   department   of
           government...
           The decision  maker  will  assess  the  extent  to  which  false
           information was provided and what, if anything, was intended  or
           actually gained as  a  result.   The  decision  maker  will  not
           normally refuse an application because the person made a genuine
           mistake on an application form or because they claimed something
           to which they reasonably believed  or  were  advised  they  were
           entitled."


         That is not inconsistent  with  the  discretion  which  applies  to
         paragraph 322(5) of the Rules which is  that  the  Respondent  will
         "normally" refuse an application where an applicant's character  or
         conduct  is  such  that  his  continued  presence  in  the  UK   is
         undesirable.  Nor is it inconsistent with  what  is  said  in  Khan
         regarding the possibility that an applicant has made a  mistake  or
         indeed the way in which the decision-makers approached the issue in
         this case.


     45. In relation to The Discretion Ground, Mr Saini relies on  the  case
         of R (on the application of Ngouh) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
         Home Department [2010] EWHC 2218. He says that the  application  of
         paragraph 322(5) is  a  two-staged  process.   Not  only  must  the
         Respondent be satisfied that there is dishonesty and that it is  of
         such magnitude that it justifies the application of the  paragraph,
         but he must take into account all the relevant circumstances  known
         about an applicant in order to determine  whether  the  applicant's
         continued presence is undesirable.


     46. Whether that is a one-stage or two-stage process,  I  accept  as  a
         proposition that the  Respondent  must  be  satisfied  that  it  is
         appropriate  to  refuse  leave  based  on  the  dishonest  conduct;
         paragraph 322(5) is after all a discretionary  ground  of  refusal.
         However, I am not greatly assisted by what is said in Ngouh in this
         regard.  The context of that case is very different.  I accept that
         in some ways the conduct which was held against Mr Ngouh  was  more
         serious than that relied upon in this case. However,  equally,  the
         factors in his favour were stronger particularly in relation to the
         evidence put forward on his behalf when he sought ILR.  That was  a
         case involving a soldier in the British Army who had served in Iraq
         and  who  had  received  glowing   reports   from   his   superiors
         notwithstanding an offence to which  he  had  pleaded  guilty.   As
         Foskett J says at  [110],  "[a]ny  fair-minded  assessment  of  the
         Claimant's character and conduct does require a true balance to  be
         struck between the conviction and its surrounding circumstances, on
         the one hand, and the very positive references he received from the
         Army, those references to be assessed also against  the  background
         of that part of his service of this country  in  what  was  a  very
         dangerous part of the world  at  a  very  dangerous  time,  on  the
         other".


     47. It is clear from the passage cited that the  facts  in  Ngouh  were
         very different to those in this case as was the nature  and  extent
         of the evidence available to the  decision-maker.  Insofar  as  the
         judgment  lays  down  the  principle  that  all  the  known   facts
         surrounding the conduct complained of must be considered, I  accept
         that those must be considered by the Respondent.  However, I do not
         consider that the judgment can be applied more widely than that  in
         terms of general principles.


     48. In relation to the information  which  the  Applicant  says  it  is
         necessary for the Respondent to seek before making a  decision,  Mr
         Saini relies on the "Tameside duty" which emerges from  the  speech
         of Lord Diplock in Secretary of State for Education and  Science  v
         Tameside MBC [1977] AC 1014.  Mr Saini relies on principles derived
         from the authorities about this duty  as  set  out  in  R  (on  the
         application of Plantagenet Alliance Limited) v Secretary  of  State
         for Justice [2014] EWHC 1662 (Admin) as follows:


           "Duty to carry out sufficient inquiry/Tameside duty
           99.   A public body has a duty to carry out a sufficient inquiry
           prior to making its decision. This is sometimes known as the
           'Tameside' duty since the principle derives from Lord Diplock's
           speech in Secretary of State for Education and Science v
           Tameside MBC [1977] AC 1014, where he said (at page 1065B): "The
           question for the court is, did the Secretary of State ask
           himself the right question and take reasonable steps to acquaint
           himself with the relevant information to enable him to answer it
           correctly?".
           100.  The following principles can be gleaned from the
      authorities:
           (1) The obligation upon the decision-maker is only to take such
           steps to inform himself as are reasonable.
           (2) Subject to a Wednesbury challenge, it is for the public
           body, and not the court to decide upon the manner and intensity
           of inquiry to be undertaken (R(Khatun) v Newham LBC [2005] QB
           37 at paragraph [35], per Laws LJ).
           (3) The court should not intervene merely because it considers
           that further inquiries would have been sensible or desirable. It
           should intervene only if no reasonable authority could have been
           satisfied on the basis of the inquiries made that it possessed
           the information necessary for its decision (per Neill LJ in R
           (Bayani) v. Kensington and Chelsea Royal LBC (1990) 22 HLR 406).
           (4) The court should establish what material was before the
           authority and should only strike down a decision by the
           authority not to make further inquiries if no reasonable council
           possessed of that material could suppose that the inquiries they
           had made were sufficient (per Schiemann J in R (Costello) v
           Nottingham City Council (1989) 21 HLR 301; cited with approval
           by Laws LJ in (R(Khatun) v Newham LBC (supra) at paragraph
           [35]).
           (5) The principle that the decision-maker must call his own
           attention to considerations relevant to his decision, a duty
           which in practice may require him to consult outside bodies with
           a particular knowledge or involvement in the case, does not
           spring from a duty of procedural fairness to the applicant, but
           from the Secretary of State's duty so to inform himself as to
           arrive at a rational conclusion (per Laws LJ in (R (London
           Borough of Southwark) v Secretary of State for
           Education (supra) at page 323D).
           (6) The wider the discretion conferred on the Secretary of
           State, the more important it must be that he has all relevant
           material to enable him properly to exercise it (R (Venables) v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [1998] AC 407 at
           466G)."


     49. Mr Saini accepts by reference to principle (5) that the  Respondent
         was entitled to liaise with  HMRC  about  the  information  in  its
         possession relevant to the Applicant's earnings.  He relies however
         on what he says is a duty to gather all material  relevant  to  the
         exercise of discretion (by reference to principle (6)).  I observe,
         however, that the extent of the duty depends on the breadth of  the
         discretion to be exercised and the discretion inherent in paragraph
         322(5) of the Rules is a narrow one: the rule provides  that  where
         offending  character  or  conduct  is  established,   this   should
         "normally" lead to refusal.  I deal further with the nature of  any
         duty to  seek  out  information  when  considering  The  Procedural
         Unfairness Ground below.


     50. In summary of his submissions concerning  the  rationality  of  the
         Decisions  and  exercise  of  discretion,  Mr  Saini  asserts   the
         following flaws:


         (1)      There was no allegation of subjective  dishonesty  and  no
         reliable, positive evidence that a false statement  of  income  was
         deliberately and dishonestly made to HMRC and/or the  Respondent  -
         this includes that there is a lack of positive  evidence  to  prove
         that the Applicant has lied;


         (2) The Respondent did not comply with the "Tameside duty" in order
         to gather the information  necessary  to  come  to  a  "Wednesbury"
         reasonable conclusion, particularly where HMRC  had  not  issued  a
         penalty (which would have been known to  the  Respondent  from  the
         enquiries made of HMRC);


         (3)  The Respondent failed to take into account  that  this  was  a
         single, isolated error in a general pattern of properly  accounting
         to HMRC as to tax - this includes that the Respondent has failed to
         consider that the Applicant has paid a substantial  sum  and  would
         have no incentive to under-declare the small amount involved in the
         discrepancy (the tax difference is in the order of ï¿½1389);


         (4) "Given the absence of evidence demonstrating fraud (as  opposed
         to a mere difference in declarations and  not  even  a  significant
         one) the assessment that there was sufficient evidence  to  justify
         engagement of paragraph 322(5) was irrational and perverse";


         (5)  The Respondent has failed to engage with the explanation given
         and failed to consider the Applicant's explanation that  he  simply
         relied on advice - this includes failure to consider the  different
         nature of taxation on companies and individuals and  a  failure  to
         take into account levels of personal allowance;


         (6)  In relation to  the  discretion  ground,  the  Respondent  has
         treated paragraph 322(5) of the Rules as  a  mandatory  requirement
         rather than a discretionary one  -  there  is  no  evidence  of  an
         exercise of discretion.


     51. Mr Holborn relies squarely on the judgment in Khan.  He  makes  the
         following points arising from what is there said:


         (1) It is for the Respondent to  consider  whether  an  applicant's
         character or conduct is  "questionable".   It  is  not  for  me  to
         substitute my view for  that  of  the  decision-maker  tasked  with
         making such decisions based on  experience  of  other  cases  where
         similar conduct has occurred and including other related  areas  of
         government.  The issue is whether the  Decisions  are  "within  the
         range of reasonable responses";


         (2) The legality of the Decisions has to be assessed  by  reference
         to  the  material  before  the  decision  maker  when  making   the
         Decisions;


         (3) The Respondent is  entitled  to  refuse  an  application  under
         paragraph 322(5) of the Rules if he rationally  concludes  that  an
         applicant "has not been honest or transparent" with either HMRC  or
         the Respondent in relation to his income;


         (4) The Respondent is entitled to refuse an application whether  or
         not HMRC has imposed a  penalty  -  HMRC's  role  is  fundamentally
         different to that of the Respondent;


         (5) In general, it is not a satisfactory defence for  an  applicant
         to blame a discrepancy on his accountant.


     52. Mr Holborn relies on the fact of the discrepancy as  sufficient  to
         draw a prima facie inference that the Applicant has been  dishonest
         (applying Khan). As he points out, in response to the questionnaire
         sent to the Applicant  he  clearly  stated  that  the  tax  returns
         submitted were correct,  that  he  had  never  had  to  correct  or
         resubmit them and that he reviewed, checked  and  signed  each  tax
         return.


     53. Mr Saini points out in response that this may be an indication that
         the Applicant did not know of the discrepancy  as  the  alternative
         explanation for those answers is that he knew  but  was  so  brazen
         that he thought it unlikely that he  would  be  "caught  out"  even
         though the covering letter to the  questionnaire  made  clear  that
         this is a point which the Respondent may wish to investigate.


     54. Mr Holborn submits that the onus  following  the  drawing  of  that
         inference is on the Applicant to provide  an  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.  He pointed out that the Applicant's  explanation  for
         the discrepancy has shifted.


     55. The letter dated 24 May 2013 ([AB/163]) which accompanied the  2013
         application for leave to remain is inconsistent with what  is  said
         in the accountant's letter accompanying the  administrative  review
         application about the errors.  The tax figure given in the  24  May
         2013 letter is different to that in the tax return.


     56. Mr Holborn  also  submitted  that  the  information  given  in  the
         Applicant's questionnaire differs from what is later said about his
         tax position.  He says that his tax liability in  2013-14  was  nil
         but now says that over ï¿½2000 from the 2012-13 tax year fell  to  be
         declared in 2013-14.  The Applicant accepts that he did not file  a
         return  in  2013-14  which  failure  he  now  also  blames  on  his
         accountant.


     57. Mr Holborn makes the point in his  skeleton  argument  that  it  is
         implausible that the Applicant would make ï¿½6,947 in the first month
         of the 2013-14 tax year.  That the  whole  of  the  discrepancy  is
         accounted for by the difference in financial years as compared with
         tax years comes from [14] of the judicial review grounds (which are
         supported by a statement of truth) where it is said that the reason
         for the discrepancy is that  the  earnings  spanned  two  financial
         years and that it is  this  which  the  Respondent  has  failed  to
         appreciate.  It is thereafter accepted at [20] of the grounds  that
         the Applicant should have but did not file a  tax  return  for  the
         2013-14 tax year because he believed there was  no  tax  liability.
         It is then said that he so  believed  because  he  thought  he  had
         discharged his obligation by paying corporation tax and income  tax
         during the period.  However, the grounds go on to say that  he  was
         not advised that he had to pay tax on the sum of ï¿½6947,  being  the
         total amount of the discrepancy with the inference that he ought to
         have filed a tax return.  There is no mention  of  the  discrepancy
         being due to other errors.


     58. Although the letter post-dates the Decisions,  Mr  Holborn  pointed
         out that the explanation given to HMRC for the discrepancy  in  the
         letter  at  [AB/151]  is  also  not  consistent  with   the   other
         explanations.  I observed however that this is a  letter  from  the
         Applicant which does not provide any explanation at all and  simply
         asks HMRC to adjust his tax to coincide with what he says should be
         his self-employed income of  ï¿½35,499.   In  fact,  this  letter  is
         somewhat more supportive of the Applicant since  it  suggests  that
         the Applicant still does not understand the discrepancy and how  it
         has arisen.  The letter from HMRC in response is perhaps clearer as
         to how it understands the discrepancies, but  that  too  post-dates
         the Decisions and I do not take either into account.


     59. The  accountants'  letters  which  accompanied  the  administrative
         review are probably the fullest explanation.  Mr Holborn says  that
         these letters still fail to explain the whole  of  the  discrepancy
         because they do not explain why it is that the  Applicant  did  not
         file a tax return in the following tax year. Further, he says  that
         the letter from the firm  which  filed  the  tax  return  makes  no
         mention of the discrepancy being due in any way to a difference  in
         the financial year and that the letter from the other firm tends to
         suggest that the discrepancy arose at the start  of  the  financial
         year (by reference back to the previous tax year) and  not  at  the
         end.  I do not accept that analysis on a fair reading of the letter
         which I have set out at [12] above.


     60. Mr Holborn suggested that the differing explanations (of  which  he
         said there are about five) show an extreme lack of care on the part
         of the Applicant.  Mr Saini accepted that this may be the case  but
         said that was not deception.


     61. Mr Holborn  also  places  some  emphasis  on  the  benefit  to  the
         Applicant of over-declaring income to the  Respondent  than  under-
         declaring it to HMRC.  It was for that  reason  that  I  asked  for
         information (which I have set out above) about  what  the  position
         would have been if the  earnings  as  declared  to  HMRC  had  been
         declared to the Respondent in 2013.  Mr Holborn's  answer  to  that
         question is that the Applicant could  not  have  succeeded  if  the
         whole of the  discrepancy  were  taken  into  account  because  the
         earnings would have been ï¿½49,173, the  Applicant  would  have  been
         awarded only 25 points and he would not have sufficient  points  to
         meet the 75 points required (the  Applicant  scored  80  points  in
         reliance on earnings which  scored  him  35  points).   Mr  Holborn
         accepted  that  if  the  Applicant's  earnings  had  in  fact  been
         somewhere between the two figures declared and over  ï¿½50,000,  then
         the Applicant could have succeeded in obtaining leave in 2013.


     62. Mr Saini in response pointed out that the Respondent had  documents
         in 2013 which must have been accepted as showing that the Applicant
         earned what he said he did.  He said that an immigration  advantage
         was less likely to be the reason behind the discrepancy.


     63. Mr Holborn points out that the Decision makes express reference  to
         the exercise of discretion.  There is  recognition  that  paragraph
         322(5) is not a mandatory ground.


    The Procedural Unfairness Ground


     64. Moving on then to the procedural fairness ground,  in  relation  to
         the principles of fairness on which Mr  Saini  relies,  he  accepts
         that what fairness requires depends on context (R  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department, ex p.  Doody  [1993]  UKHL  8).   He
         directs my attention however to the  cases  of  Bank  Mellat  v  HM
         Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39 and R (Osborn) v Parole Board [2014]
         AC 1115.


     65. Mr Saini relies on the case of Osborn as to the extent of the  test
         for me, and to show why it is necessary to have a procedurally fair
         decision-making process.  He refers to the speech of Lord  Reed  at
         [65] onwards as follows:


            "[65]      The first matters concerns the role of the court when
           considering whether a fair procedure was followed by a decision-
           making body such as the board....The court  must  determine  for
           itself whether a fair procedure was followed...Its  function  is
           not merely to review the reasonableness of the  decision-maker's
           judgment of what fairness required.
            [66] The second matter to be clarified concerns the  purpose  of
           procedural fairness....
            [67] There is no doubt that one of the virtues  of  procedurally
           fair decision-making is that it is liable to  result  in  better
           decisions, by ensuring  that  the  decision-maker  receives  all
           relevant information and that it is properly  tested...At  least
           two other important values are also engaged.
            [68]   The  first  was  described  by  Lord  Hoffman  ...as  the
           avoidance of the sense of injustice which the person who is  the
           subject of the decision will  otherwise  feel...Respect  entails
           that such persons  ought  to  be  able  to  participate  in  the
           procedure by which the decision  is  made,  provided  they  have
           something to say which is relevant to the decision to be taken."


     66. I have no difficulty with accepting the principle set out  at  [65]
         of the judgment that whether the procedure  was  fair  is  for  the
         Tribunal to assess and is not merely a review of  the  Respondent's
         opinion of what fairness demands.


     67. Lord Sumption in Bank Mellat repeats the principle taken from Doody
         to which I have already referred that  "what  fairness  demands  is
         dependent on the context of the decision" and goes on to  say  this
         (also citing from Doody):


           "(4) An essential feature of the context is  the  statute  which
           creates the discretion, as regards both  its  language  and  the
           shape of the legal and administrative system  within  which  the
           decision is taken. (5) Fairness will very often require  that  a
           person who may be adversely affected by the decision  will  have
           an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf  either
           before the  decision  is  taken  with  a  view  to  producing  a
           favourable result;  or  after  it  is  taken,  with  a  view  to
           procuring its  modification;  or  both.  (6)  Since  the  person
           affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations  without
           knowing what factors may weigh against  his  interests  fairness
           will very often require that he is informed of the gist  of  the
           case which he has to answer."


     68. Mr Saini also refers to the speech of Lord  Neuberger  which  makes
         the point that, unless there are some "special facts"  there  is  a
         common law duty on a decision maker to give notice to a  person  in
         relation to whom a decision is to be taken and for that  person  to
         be heard.


     69. The Bank Mellat case arises in a very  different  context  to  this
         case as it concerned a decision made without notice rather than one
         made in the context of and in reply to an application made.   As Mr
         Holborn pointed out, the application  process  is  the  Applicant's
         opportunity  to  put  forward  all   relevant   information.    The
         Applicant's opportunity to be heard therefore has to be  viewed  in
         that context.   That context is also relevant to the extent of  any
         "Tameside duty" on the Respondent  to  seek  out  information:  the
         Applicant can be expected to put forward all information  which  he
         wishes the Respondent to consider.


     70. Moreover, in this case,  the  Applicant  was  on  notice  that  the
         Respondent might conclude that his earnings were not genuine.   The
         Respondent put  the  Applicant  on  notice  by  the  sending  of  a
         questionnaire prior to the making of the First Decision.   For that
         reason, I  reject  Mr  Saini's  submission  that  the  process  was
         procedurally unfair because the Applicant was  not  put  on  notice
         that his application would be refused on the basis of his  conduct.
         Mr Holborn submits that the extent and the nature of  the  duty  of
         fairness  is  academic  because  the  Applicant   was   given   the
         opportunity to explain any discrepancies by  the  sending  of  that
         questionnaire.

      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

      The Review Ground

     71. I can deal shortly with The Review Ground.   Insofar  as  Mr  Saini
         seeks to argue that the Respondent was not  entitled  to  view  the
         discrepancy in this case  as  "significant"  because  of  the  sums
         involved, I do not consider that this  can  be  inferred  from  the
         Review Document.  The Review Document merely states that the common
         and average differences were thought to be  significant.   It  does
         not say that other differences would be disregarded  or  should  be
         considered to be any less significant.


     72. In terms of assessing character and conduct, the issue is  how  the
         discrepancy arose, whether an applicant knows or should have  known
         of the discrepancy and therefore whether he has acted  dishonestly.
         For that reason,  as  Mr  Holborn  submitted,  and  I  accept,  the
         significance lies in the consequence of  the  discrepancy  and  any
         advantage gained.  It may be that the lower the  figure,  the  less
         likely it is that an applicant would have  cause  to  question  the
         difference because it may not have significant implications to  the
         amount of tax involved.  However, as the Respondent points out, the
         advantage to the Applicant is not necessarily to be  found  in  the
         saving of tax.  In fact, given the amounts involved, I  doubt  that
         this is likely to be the reason.   The  greater  advantage  to  the
         Applicant in this case would lie in the over-declaration of  income
         to the Respondent.


     73. For those reasons, the Decisions are not unlawful for reliance on a
         discrepancy which is not as substantial as some of  those  referred
         to in the Review Document.


      The Procedural Unfairness Ground

     74. I can also deal shortly with The Procedural Unfairness Ground.  The
         Applicant was given the opportunity to  explain  any  discrepancies
         prior to the Decision.  The covering letter  to  the  questionnaire
         and the questions posed in the questionnaire  would  have  put  the
         Applicant on notice as to the concerns of  the  Respondent.   Those
         did not need to be spelt out further.  It  is  not  entirely  clear
         what documents the Applicant provided for  the  relevant  financial
         years, but he was asked to  provide  the  tax  calculations  and  a
         simple check of that calculation against his  accounts  (which  are
         contained  in  a  one-page  letter  from  the   accountant)   would
         immediately have shown that there was a discrepancy.  The fact that
         the Applicant did not conduct that exercise does not  indicate  any
         lack of procedural fairness on the part of the Respondent.


     75. The Applicant was also given the opportunity to  explain  (and  did
         explain) the discrepancy after the First Decision.  He provided the
         accountants' letters to which I have already referred.  I accept Mr
         Holborn's submission  that  an  administrative  review  is  not  an
         opportunity to make a second application; it is  a  review  of  the
         First Decision.  However, I accept that the Respondent was  obliged
         to consider the accountants' letters since those were  put  forward
         by the Applicant as explanation for the discrepancy.  I  deal  with
         what those show and the extent to which the  Respondent  considered
         them below. I do not accept that there was any further duty on  the
         Respondent to seek out information relating to the discrepancy  and
         reasons for it.  The Applicant was firmly on notice by  this  stage
         of the case he had to meet and needed to ensure that  he  explained
         the errors and how those came about.


     76. For those reasons, I do not accept that the Respondent has acted in
         a  manner  which  is  procedurally  unfair.   No  unlawfulness   is
         established in this regard.


      The Rationality Ground and The Discretion Ground


     77. I begin with The Discretion Ground as I do not consider  that  this
         adds  materially  to  The  Rationality  Ground.    I   accept   the
         Respondent's submission  that  the  nature  of  the  discretion  is
         "normally" to refuse an application where dishonesty is  shown.   I
         also accept that, if an applicant  is  concluded  to  have  behaved
         dishonestly, the Respondent is  generally  entitled  to  refuse  an
         application on character and conduct grounds.  I  accept  that  the
         Respondent is required to take into account  information  which  he
         has about an applicant.  However, the matters relied  upon  by  the
         Applicant as not being  taken  into  account  in  the  Respondent's
         discretion in this case are all matters which are said to go to the
         explanation  given  for  the  discrepancy  rather  than  extraneous
         matters  about  the  overall  conduciveness  of   the   Applicant's
         residence  in  the  UK.   As  such,  they  are  more  appropriately
         considered  under  the  heading  of  The  Rationality  Ground.    I
         therefore turn to deal with this.


     78. I accept as a starting point that the  Respondent  is  entitled  to
         draw a prima facie inference of dishonesty  from  the  discrepancy.
         It is accepted by  the  Applicant  that  there  is  a  discrepancy.
         Whilst it may be the case that part of it relates to the difference
         between financial and tax years (although there may be  some  doubt
         about whether that is genuinely  the  case  when  the  accountant's
         letter at [AB/163] is taken into account), the Respondent could not
         be expected to know that this  was  the  position  when  the  First
         Decision was made.  It was incumbent on the Applicant to explain if
         that were the case.  The  questionnaire  made  no  mention  of  it.
         Indeed, the Applicant's assertion that he earned nothing from self-
         employment in 2013-14 positively conflicts with his case as now put
         forward. Moreover, it is common ground that the Applicant  did  not
         submit a tax return (or therefore pay tax) on the amount which fell
         into the following tax year.  His conduct therefore in that  regard
         also requires explanation.


     79. The Respondent relies on the Applicant's  dishonesty  in  declaring
         different amounts for what should be the same  income  (subject  to
         the point about the difference in tax and  financial  years).   The
         Respondent does not say which is the correct amount.  He cannot  be
         expected to know.  Whilst I accept that he had  documents  produced
         to him in 2013 which state  the  Applicant's  self-employed  income
         consistently with the amount declared in the 2013 application,  the
         fact  that  the  income  differed  from  that  declared  to   HMRC,
         ostensibly  for  the  same  period,  was  sufficient  to  give  the
         Respondent  cause  for  concern  about  the  genuineness   of   the
         declaration made to him, and to require the  Applicant  to  explain
         how that arose, and  otherwise  why  that  conduct  should  not  be
         considered to be dishonest.


     80. It may be relevant, as Mr Saini submits, that the Applicant did not
         alert the Respondent to  the  discrepancy  when  he  completed  the
         questionnaire.  Unlike in many cases of this nature, the  Applicant
         had not amended his tax return at the time of or immediately before
         making  the  application  for  ILR.   Such  apparently   unprompted
         amendments immediately before making an application  for  ILR  when
         the discrepancy might be  discovered  certainly  give  rise  to  an
         inference that the applicant is aware of the discrepancy.  The fact
         that the Applicant in this case  did  not  do  so  when  given  the
         opportunity may be an indication  that  he  was  oblivious  to  the
         discrepancy.  However, the Respondent was  entitled  to  take  into
         account  that  the  Applicant  had  answered   questions   in   the
         questionnaire indicating that there were no discrepancies, that  he
         had not had to  amend  tax  declarations  in  recognition  of  such
         discrepancies and,  most  importantly,  that  he  had  checked  his
         returns and signed them.   That too was sufficient to raise a prima
         facie inference of dishonesty.


     81. For those reasons, based on the information  which  the  Respondent
         had at the time of the First Decision, the First  Decision  is  not
         unlawful or unreasonable. The Respondent was entitled  to  rely  on
         the differing amounts declared to him and  HMRC  for  the  relevant
         period and lack of explanation therefor.


     82. I turn then to consider the issues as set out at (ii) to (v) of the
         headnote in Khan.  In so doing, I have clearly in mind that  it  is
         not for me to form my own view on what the evidence shows (although
         the plausibility of the explanation put forward or lack of  it  may
         form part of my consideration whether the Respondent has adequately
         considered that explanation).


     83. As Mr Holborn points out, there have been  a  number  of  different
         explanations put forward for the discrepancy.  The relevant one for
         my purposes is what was said in response to the First  Decision  in
         the administrative review.  It is the Respondent's consideration of
         and answer to any  explanation  there  put  forward  which  is  the
         important one for my  purposes.  The  fact  that  the  position  is
         misrepresented in the grounds, even though those are supported by a
         statement of truth, does not undermine the  Applicant's  case.   It
         may well be that the Applicant's solicitors did not understand  the
         position; it appears from the correspondence with HMRC which  I  do
         not take into account either that the Applicant  himself  may  well
         not have understood how the discrepancy arose.


     84. I turn then to what was said in the administrative  review.   As  I
         said earlier, I do not have the administrative review  application.
         However, it is accepted that the two accountants' letters were laid
         before the Respondent. I have set out the content of the fuller  of
         those two letters at [12] above.


     85. The explanation there given is consistent with the way in  which  I
         explained the discrepancy at [16] above.  In  other  words,  it  is
         made up of at least four separate discrepancies.


     86. One  of  those  errors  might  be  explained  by  carelessness.   A
         qualified accountant ought of course  to  know  that  turnover  and
         profit are different things.  However, that does not mean  that  an
         error of inserting one for the  other  could  not  arise  by  human
         error, and that it was made is  consistent  with  the  tax  return.
         However, there is no explanation as to how that error  came  to  be
         made.  It is simply stated that it is an error.


     87. One might be described as not a discrepancy at all.  It is based on
         the Applicant's financial year being different to the tax year.  Of
         course, that does not excuse the Applicant's failure to declare the
         income in the following year and does not explain  the  discrepancy
         in the declaration to the Home Office of "nil" in the following tax
         year.  However, one can see how an individual being advised that he
         had declared income for a particular year might  consider  that  he
         had declared all income for that year in the earlier tax return and
         not understood that he had a duty to account to HMRC for tax in the
         following tax year.  As  I  have  noted,  however,  the  letter  at
         [AB/163] which set out the accounts for  the  business's  financial
         year does not suggest that any such adjustment needed to  be  made.
         Whilst the fact of an adjustment having been claimed is  consistent
         with  the  tax  return,  it  is  not  explained  why  there  is  an
         inconsistency between that claimed adjustment and the accounts  nor
         between that and the Applicant's explanation and assertion that  he
         earned nothing from self-employment in the 2013-14 tax year.


     88. The remaining discrepancies are less readily explicable as  errors.
         One of them may be due to the insertion of a "1" in  front  of  the
         correct figure.  The others though appear to be an attempt  whether
         by the accountant or the Applicant to deliberately inflate expenses
         with a view to reducing taxable income.   That  may  make  it  more
         likely that the "error" in relation to the insertion of the  profit
         figure in the turnover box  was  deliberate  and  not  inadvertent.
         Again, there is no explanation for how  those  errors  came  to  be
         made.  The letter from Doshi & Company at [AB/149]  says  that  one
         error was to include ï¿½450 for home rent which was  not  claimed  in
         the accounts and that the other was to  claim  ï¿½667  for  a  figure
         given in the accounts as ï¿½87 but it does not  explain  how  or  why
         those came to be made.  The figures in the accountant's  letter  at
         [AB/163] could not be plainer.  Doshi & Company were acting as that
         accountant's sub-contractor in the filing of the  tax  return.   As
         such, they ought to  be  able  to  explain  how  it  is  that  very
         different figures came to be  included  in  that  tax  return  when
         compared with the business accounts.  Their letter does not do so.


     89. It is fair to observe as did Mr Saini that the tax implications  of
         those discrepancies even in combination are small.  The tax avoided
         is only just over ï¿½1,000.  Further, as I explained at  [19]  above,
         the Applicant would only have failed in his  2013  application  for
         leave if all the discrepancies were taken into account against him.
          If the difference in income due  to  the  difference  between  the
         financial year and the tax year were disregarded on the basis  that
         this was not a discrepancy at all, then the  Applicant  would  have
         qualified for leave in 2013.  This brings into play the Applicant's
         submission  that  the   amount   of   the   discrepancy   was   not
         "significant".  To my mind, when considering significance, what the
         Respondent has to consider is the effect of the discrepancy not the
         size of it.  It would matter not if the discrepancy were  only,  as
         here, in the order of ï¿½6,000,  but  the  effect  of  that  for  the
         purposes of the earlier application was that leave to remain  would
         have been refused.  When considering the discrepancy, however, that
         is the approach which the Respondent took (see passage  cited  from
         the Second Decision at [26] above).   He clearly stated that  there
         would be a benefit to the Applicant based either on an underpayment
         of tax or obtaining leave to remain to which he would not otherwise
         have been entitled.  Whether he was entitled to  take  that  latter
         point depends on the explanation given for all of the errors.


     90. The question which arises for consideration  therefore  is  whether
         the Respondent was entitled to  take  the  view  he  did  that  the
         accountants' letters did not alter  his  view  of  the  Applicant's
         responsibility for the inconsistent declarations.  I  have  already
         set out why it might be said that at least two of the errors  arose
         from carelessness.  However, that is  not  what  was  said  by  the
         responsible accountants.  The errors are  simply  stated  as  such.
         They do not explain how those errors arose.   Doubt  about  whether
         those can be considered to be mere  errors  is  also  cast  by  the
         difference  in  the  expenses  claimed  for  which  there   is   no
         explanation let alone a plausible one.   As  I  indicated  at  [88]
         above, it is difficult to categorise those as anything other than a
         deliberate  over-inflation  of  expenses  when  compared  with  the
         accounts.


     91. Moreover, as the Second  Decision  points  out,  the  Applicant  is
         responsible for his own tax  affairs.   He  had  confirmed  in  his
         responses in the questionnaire that he had checked and  signed  his
         tax returns and considered them to be correct.  I take into account
         Mr Saini's point that it would require a  brazen  approach  not  to
         admit to the discrepancy before making the application for ILR when
         the Respondent had put the Applicant on notice as to his  concerns.
         It may be that the Applicant had forgotten  about  the  discrepancy
         since it was some years ago. It is not for me (or  the  Respondent)
         to speculate. The fact remains that if the  Applicant  checked  his
         returns  as  he  said  he  did,  neither  he  nor  the  responsible
         accountant explained how it was that the  tax  return  came  to  be
         inconsistent with his accounts.  It was after all a  simple  matter
         of checking the figures in the  return  itself  with  the  one-page
         letter at [AB/163] from which it would be evident that inconsistent
         figures were being inserted.  Even if he trusted his accountant and
         did not understand much about accounts, it would  be  evident  that
         there was a difference which needed clarifying.


     92. As such, although the  Respondent's  consideration  in  the  Second
         Decision of the evidence put forward is limited, that consideration
         is sufficient to deal  with  the  evidence  because  that  evidence
         simply fails to explain the errors or cast doubt on  the  inference
         that the inconsistency was due to dishonest conduct on the part  of
         the Applicant.  The Respondent was entitled therefore  to  maintain
         the view that the inconsistency arose from dishonest conduct of the
         Applicant and that it was appropriate to refuse him ILR due to that
         conduct.  There is nothing irrational in  that  conclusion  on  the
         evidence put before him.


     93. For those reasons, I am satisfied that neither the  First  Decision
         nor the Second Decision is unlawful.  This application for judicial
         review is refused.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
