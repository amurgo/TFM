For the Appellant:      Mr S Cox, Counsel instructed by IAS
For the Respondent:     Mr S Ouseley, Home Office Presenting Officer

The following comprise general guidelines in assessing  risk  on  return  to
Burma of a Burmese citizen:

(1)  A Burmese citizen who has left Burma illegally is in  general  at  real
    risk on return  to  Burma  of  imprisonment  in  conditions  which  are
    reasonably likely to violate his rights under Article 3  of  the  ECHR.
    Exit will be illegal where it is done without  authorisation  from  the
    Burmese authorities, however obtained, and will  include  travel  to  a
    country to which the person concerned was not permitted to  go  by  the
    terms of an authorised exit. We consider it is  proper  to  infer  this
    conclusion from the effect in the Van Tha case  of  the  employment  of
    Article 5(j) of the Burma Emergency Act 1950, either on  the  basis  of
    the application of that Article in that case or also as  a  consequence
    of a breach of the exit requirements we have set out in paragraph 83.

(2)  A Burmese citizen is in general at real risk of  such  imprisonment  if
    he is returned to Burma  from  the  United  Kingdom  without  being  in
    possession of a valid Burmese passport.

(3)  It is not reasonably likely  that  a  Burmese  citizen  in  the  United
    Kingdom will be issued with a passport by the  Burmese  authorities  in
    London, unless he is able to present to the Embassy an expired passport
    in his name.

(4)  If it comes to the attention of the Burmese authorities that  a  person
    falling within (1) or (2) is a failed asylum seeker, that is reasonably
    likely to have a significant effect  upon  the  length  of  the  prison
    sentence imposed for his illegal exit and/or entry. To  return  such  a
    person from the United Kingdom would accordingly be a breach of Article
    33 of the Refugee Convention.  Whether that  fact  would  come  to  the
    attention of the authorities will need to be determined on the facts of
    the particular case, bearing in mind that the person is  highly  likely
    to be interrogated on return.

(5)  It has not been shown that a person who does not  fall  within  (1)  or
    (2) above faces a real risk of persecution or Article  3  ill-treatment
    on return to Burma by reason of having claimed  asylum  in  the  United
    Kingdom, even if the Burmese authorities have reason to believe that he
    has made such a claim, unless the authorities have reason to regard him
    as a political opponent.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Burma.   She appealed to  an  Immigration
    Judge against the Secretary of State's  decision  of  29  January  2005
    refusing leave to enter the  United  Kingdom.   The  Immigration  Judge
    dismissed  her  appeal.    Reconsideration  was  ordered  by  a  Senior
    Immigration Judge on 8 June 2005.

2.   On 13 September 2005 the Tribunal concluded that there was an error  of
    law in the Immigration Judge's determination on  the  following  basis.
    It was held that there was a material error of law in  the  failure  by
    the Immigration Judge to take into account the argument in paragraph 19
    of the skeleton argument before her concerning problems experienced  by
    the appellant previously in Burma and the failure to make  findings  on
    what she said happened to her in Burma between October 2004 and January
    2005.   A full reconsideration was ordered.

3.   The hearing took place before us on 29 November 2005.   Mr  S  Cox  for
    the IAS appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Mr S Ouseley  appeared
    on behalf of the Secretary of State.

4.   The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  29  January  2005  and
    asked for asylum.  At a screening  interview  she  said  that  she  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom from Thailand.   She had been  there  for
    two nights after leaving Burma.   She said that she did  not  have  her
    own passport, having given it to an agent after they  left  the  plane.
    Her passport was a genuine one. She had not destroyed it, the agent had
    taken it.  She was able to give the passport number and said  that  she
    had a copy of the passport on her.  She said that that was  because  in
    Burma people always copied important documents.  She was asked what the
    point of handing the passport to the agent was and she said she did not
    know what to do after she left Burma so the  agent  looked  after  her.
    While she was pushing the trolley along the corridor she  said  someone
    asked her for her passport and she handed  it  over  as  she  had  been
    instructed to do so.   She said that she gave the passport to the agent
    as she walked along a corridor and did so because she was instructed to
    do so.

5.   She had previously obtained by official means a marriage visa to go  to
    the United Kingdom.   The purpose of this  was  to  get  married  to  a
    Burmese man living here.   She had also been successful in obtaining  a
    visa to go to Thailand and on each occasion she had used her own name.

6.   It transpired  that,  shortly  before  obtaining  the  visa  to  go  to
    Thailand, she had been refused a  visa  and  she  said  that  this  was
    because she had bought a single ticket to Bangkok and was told that she
    should hold a return  ticket.   Therefore  a  return  ticket  was  then
    purchased.   With regard to the previous visit to the  United  Kingdom,
    she said that she had gone to get married but she had had  a  row  with
    her fianc� and she had to go home.   She had come back because she  had
    had problems in Burma since she had  returned  previously.    She  said
    that she was followed by the  authorities  constantly  and  she  needed
    help.

7.   In her asylum interview she said that  she  feared  the  government  in
    Burma because she had been involved with someone who was  a  politician
    and this was her former fianc�.  The  engagement  was  now  off.    Her
    former fianc� had no party but had demanded democracy by himself.   She
    herself had never belonged to a political party and nor  had  she  ever
    been arrested in her country.

8.   She had met her former fianc� when he was a teacher in Burma  and  that
    was when she was about fourteen years old and they had  kept  in  touch
    thereafter.  They had got engaged unofficially  in  March  2004.    Her
    fianc� had demanded democracy when in the United Kingdom when the civil
    uprising in Burma started in 1988. He had gone to the United Kingdom in
    1978.   In the meantime she had seen him whenever he visited Burma  and
    he had done so frequently including coming several times in 1996.

9.   They had not married when she came to  the  United  Kingdom  previously
    because they had irreconcilable differences.   She was  asked  why  her
    fianc� had never been arrested when he returned to Burma to  visit  her
    and she said he was visited constantly and was interrogated and  before
    he visited Burma he signed a form promising that he would  not  do  any
    politics in Burma and that was why he was allowed  in.    She  did  not
    marry him then as she did not love him enough then.   She thought  that
    it was in 2001 or perhaps 2002 that  he  was  not  allowed  in  at  the
    airport and had to return and that was why he had sent for her in  2004
    instead of visiting Burma.

10.  She was asked in more detail about why the marriage did not take  place
    and she said that they did not see eye to eye.  She said that when they
    were walking in the street  for  example  when  she  walked  slowly  he
    shouted at her and said she was walking slowly. She did not know how to
    cook and he had told her that she was useless and told her it was  like
    looking after a five year old.

11.  She was asked what happened when she returned to her country  from  the
    United Kingdom. She said that the government had suspicion and wondered
    why she had come back so quickly and suspected that she was to  contact
    someone and that she had some documents and suspected that  she  was  a
    spy.  When she arrived at the airport they did not let her go and  they
    interrogated her.   It was the day when  the  Prime  Minister  and  the
    Military Intelligence had been purged and this led the  authorities  to
    be more suspicious. She had been held for two days, not all the time at
    the airport but she was taken somewhere else and detained there.   They
    had asked her what she was doing there and who was she  going  to  meet
    and who had asked her to contact whom and they wanted to  look  at  her
    papers.

12.  She was asked how she was treated while  detained  and  she  said  that
    they interrogated her all the time.   She was  asked  whether  she  was
    harmed physically and said no, but they threatened her verbally and hit
    the table and frightened her and said that they would arrest her.

13.  She was asked what happened when she was released  from  detention  and
    she said she had bribed them. This was why she was released.   She said
    that the members of the Intelligence Corps treated her worst,  but  she
    met members from other groups who detained her and she was detained  by
    other groups who were not very strict.   As to what happened after  her
    release she said that they always asked  her  and  telephoned  her  and
    asked her where she was going and to tell them the places she was going
    to  and  when  she  went  out  they  followed  her.   She   was   under
    surveillance.  She said that they were from  the  military  government.
    She  received  frequent  phone  calls  and  they  sent  for   her   for
    interrogation about five times.  She did  not  remember  the  dates  of
    those interrogations.   She gave the address of where she had had to go
    for interrogation.   She was interrogated at  a  different  place  each
    time. They had not kept her overnight but let her go on  the  same  day
    and again she was asked why she had come back and who had told  her  to
    do what.  She said she was followed almost every day.

14.  She was asked when she decided that she had to leave Burma  again.  She
    said that she felt that nothing would happen to her if she did  not  do
    anything but she got news that her ex-fianc� was coming back to  Burma.
     She said that if he did come then she could not prevent  anything  and
    would be suspected of espionage and arrested, but the government  would
    not be able to arrest him because he was a foreigner (he had  become  a
    British citizen).

15.  She was asked why the relationship would  put  her  in  danger  if  the
    relationship was over and she said the fact that  it  was  over  was  a
    private matter but the government was still suspicious. She  said  that
    he planned to visit her when he came back to Burma although she did not
    know why.

16.  The appellant made a statement dated 21 March 2005.    At  paragraph  7
    she referred to the fact that she had taken part in demonstrations  but
    had not come to the attention of the authorities.   With regard to  her
    treatment when she returned to Burma from the United Kingdom in October
    2004, she said that at the airport she was taken by the Special  Branch
    to a place and interrogated for two days and they questioned her  about
    her reasons for returning to Burma, her friends and associates in Burma
    and her politics and they accused her of being her  ex-fianc�'s  agent.
    She said that she was released after paying  them  a  bribe.  She  also
    referred to problems that Muslims such as she face in Burma.

17.  Subsequent to the hearing before the Immigration Judge  and  subsequent
    to the first stage of the reconsideration hearing, the appellant made a
    further statement, on 17 November 2005.   In this she provided greater
    detail  concerning  what  happened  to  her  during  the  two  days  of
    interrogation when she returned to Burma.   She said that she was asked
    questions by different people at different  times  and  sometimes  they
    were polite and sometimes they shouted and swore at her and hit her  on
    the hands with their hands (without causing harm).    They  shouted  at
    her that they would never let her out and would put her in  prison  and
    she said she was very frightened.   They brought her bread  and  coffee
    but she was scared that it might have been drugged so  she  just  drank
    water.   They did not give her a bed or let her lie down  and  did  not
    leave her alone although she was able to rest her  head  on  the  table
    when there was a break in interrogations. She was not  able  to  sleep.
    She said that  she  became  exhausted  and  very  disorientated.    She
    suffered from angina and believed that she would have  a  heart  attack
    and die.

18.  At the hearing on 29 November 2005 Mr Ouseley put  in  a  copy  of  the
    appellant's passport without objection from Mr Cox.   He also sought to
    put in a further statement by the appellant and accepted that it  could
    have been served in time.   It was one which she had had  with  her  on
    arrival in the United Kingdom. Mr Cox argued that it was  too  late  to
    put it in as it had been on the file all along and  many  opportunities
    had existed for it to be put in.

19.  After brief consideration we concluded that we would not  exercise  our
    discretion to allow this statement to be admitted.  There  had  been  a
    clear failure to comply with standard  directions  with  no  acceptable
    explanation provided for the failure to comply.  Nor were we  satisfied
    that  there  were  other  special  circumstances  justifying  the  late
    submission and hence admission of the statement.

20.  The appellant gave evidence.   She confirmed her name and  address  and
    also that the statement she had most recently put in was to the best of
    her knowledge true.

21.  When cross-examined by Mr Ouseley the appellant said that she  recalled
    making her earlier statement and being interviewed by the  Home  Office
    and that to the best of her knowledge she  had  told  the  truth  then.
    She agreed that what she said in answer to Questions 35, 38 and 39   at
    the Home Office interview was correct.   She agreed that that  was  the
    whole truth of what had happened to her in detention and  that  nothing
    else had happened to her.   In this regard she  was  also  referred  to
    paragraph 15 of the first witness statement.

22.  She was asked why she had not said the things that she  had  now  given
    detail of concerning what had happened to her  in  the  course  of  the
    interrogation in the most recent statement, for  example  being  denied
    sleep, fearing her food had been drugged and  fearing  that  she  would
    suffer a heart attack.   She  said  that  at  the  time  she  had  only
    mentioned the gist of what had happened and there were many things that
    she had wanted to explain so she could only give the  abstract  of  it.
    The further matters were the detail.  At the time  when  the  questions
    were phrased she could only answer the most important parts.   She  was
    asked whether she was saying it was not important that she  was  denied
    sleep and she said it was.   At the time there  were  so  many  details
    that she had to present.   She said that that was  the  most  important
    aspect and when asked why she had not said so earlier but waited  until
    later she said that mainly at that  time  the  issue  was  whether  her
    fianc� was active in politics or not.  She said that at that time  they
    were more interested in the matter of detention. How she ate  or  lived
    there was not a risk and she could only talk to  them  about  what  had
    happened between them and her.   The  matters  on  which  she  had  now
    provided greater detail were important but as to which specific  matter
    was the most important she had not known at the time.   She  was  asked
    whether she had believed that she might have a heart  attack  and  said
    that she thought that she was going to die and again was asked why  she
    did not mention that earlier if it were true.   She said  that  in  the
    earlier statement she had explained why she could not  be  returned  to
    Burma and had had to come back as there was danger for her and she  had
    explained those more important matters.  It was put to her that she had
    not mentioned these matters earlier because it was not  true  that  she
    had been ill-treated in detention. She said that when she answered them
    she had only answered the most important fact of what had happened.

23.  She was asked how she had managed to bribe the authorities if  she  was
    in detention.  She said that the father of her friend had found out she
    was in detention there and he had acted as a guarantor that  she  would
    not engage in political activities.

24.  She had left Burma on her  own  passport  a  copy  of  which  had  been
    provided today.   A bribe had been paid for her to leave Burma  on  the
    second occasion.  She had left Thailand on her own valid  passport  and
    had had an exit stamp when she left Burma and this was an official exit
    stamp which had been obtained by bribery.  Normally bribery  would  not
    be necessary but in her case she had had to pay.  So there were  proper
    government stamps in her passport and they were not forged.

25.  The main reason for breaking up with her fianc� was that he had  wanted
    her to follow the Muslim religion strictly.  She had not been aware  in
    advance that he was a strict Muslim. She agreed that she had known  him
    a long time.   She thought at the time that he was not  that  strong  a
    Muslim person.  Previously he had not asked her to wear a  burka,  only
    afterwards, and had insisted that after marriage she should do so.  She
    had thought in the past that he was  just  an  average  Muslim  because
    praying five times a day was what every normal Muslim person  did,  but
    afterwards he had insisted on very strict adherence to  the  teachings.
    This included matters like not wearing jeans or  talking  to  strangers
    and when guests came she should remain inside and not come out and talk
    to them and not go to weddings and  not  visit  his  relatives  in  the
    United Kingdom as they would teach her bad things.

26.  She confirmed that she had been involved in politics in Burma when  she
    was at university and a lot of her classmates were  arrested  and  some
    went missing and she had demanded that they be released.  She  had  not
    been arrested.  She had not been a prominent leader.

27.  When she was questioned on return to Burma  they  had  asked  her  what
    political organisation she had contacted when in  the  United  Kingdom.
    They had said that it was linked to her fianc�'s politics owing to  the
    fact that he was involved in  anti-government  politics  and  they  had
    considered her to be a spy and were interested in whom she was going to
    meet.   She had had a visa for six  months  but  had  stayed  for  only
    twenty six days and had a multi-visa which would have  enabled  her  to
    return  again  and  they  had  considered  that  because  she  had  the
    entitlement to go back  and  forth  she  would  come  back  to  contact
    somebody.   They had asked her why she did not stay until  the  end  of
    the visa.   She had not admitted that she had been  acting  politically
    in the United Kingdom.    She  had  only  said  that  because  she  had
    relationship problems with her fianc� she had come back.   She  had  no
    relatives or family in the United Kingdom and nowhere to live after she
    fell out with him and she had to return.

28.  On re-examination the appellant said that if she had been told  by  her
    fianc� before she came that in England as his wife he would expect  her
    to conform to his requirements she would not have married him  or  even
    come to the United Kingdom.  Her parents were Muslim.    They  had  not
    expected her to do any of the things she had  objected  to  her  fianc�
    asking her to do.

29.   She  recalled  being  interviewed  by  the   representative   of   the
    Immigration Advisory Service for the March 2005  statement.    She  had
    not been asked whether she was able to sleep during detention  but  had
    only been asked how she was freed.  She had not been  asked  about  the
    arrangements for food during her detention.   As  to  whether  she  had
    been asked about how the treatment during detention had made her  feel,
    she said this was only in a very brief way in that she had  been  asked
    to where she was sent and whether it was a big prison  or  a  detention
    centre.

30.  Her fianc� had told her about his past political activities, but  after
    he proposed he did not talk about those things. When he came  to  Burma
    he came to teach English as well. The government considered that he was
    gathering people to be organised, and later  on  he  was  followed  and
    photographed, so he decided to stop teaching.

31.  We asked the appellant why she had given the agent  the  passport.  She
    said that, because her ex-fianc� had stopped her from  coming  back  to
    the United Kingdom and because she could not go back to Burma as  well,
    it was risky for her to go back to Burma.  The agent had told her  that
    he would guarantee.  She did not know how he had  arranged  things  for
    her.  She thought when she handed over  the  passport  that  the  agent
    would deal with the authorities on her behalf.

32.  The photocopy of the passport was taken in Burma. After  she  gave  the
    agent the passport he suddenly disappeared. He had asked her to  follow
    him, and he went ahead towards the immigration desk.   He  walked  very
    fast and disappeared.

33.  The next witness was  Mr  Martin  Morland  CMG.   Mr  Morland  was  the
    British Ambassador to Burma between 1986 and  1990,  having  previously
    been Third and then Second secretary in Burma between  1957  and  1961.
    After his retirement  from  the  Diplomatic  Service  in  1993  he  has
    maintained an interest in Burmese  affairs,  keeping  up  contact  with
    successive British Ambassadors to Burma and following events using  the
    Internet,  specialist  periodicals,  the  general  press,   radio   and
    television.  He has contributed regularly to the  BBC  Burmese  Service
    and World Service and has kept in contact  with  BBC  staff  and  other
    journalists specialising in Burmese affairs.  He has needed to keep  up
    with events in Burma as Chairman of Prospect Burma since  1994.    This
    is an educational charity founded after the uprising in Burma  in  1988
    to help Burmese students forced to flee the country to  continue  their
    higher education abroad.

34.  In his evidence Mr Morland referred to two reports of  Ms  Chris  Lewa.
    It will be helpful if we set out the essence of those reports before we
    describe his evidence.

35.  Ms Chris Lewa's reports are dated 7  September  2005  and  14  November
    2005.   Ms Lewa is clearly well qualified, as can  be  seen  from  the
    detail of her background and credentials set out at the  start  of  her
    first report.  This report concerns the case of Stanley Van Tha who was
    deported from Switzerland to Burma in April 2004.   Ms  Lewa  has  been
    able to obtain  from  a  credible  source  a  copy  of  the  unofficial
    translation of the judgment  of  the  court  against  Mr  Van  Tha  and
    attached this document to her statement.

36.  Mr Van Tha is a Chin from Burma whose asylum claim was rejected by  the
    Swiss authorities and who was deported under  Swiss  police  escort  to
    Yangon Airport on 15 April 2004.   He was arrested  upon  arrival  and
    detained in prison and on 17 August 2004 he was sentenced to  nineteen
    years in prison.   This  appears  to  comprise  firstly  a  seven  year
    sentence under the Burma Emergency Act 1950, Article 5(j) in respect of
    which the court ruled that he acted to undermine the  security  of  the
    Union and the restoration of law and order, an offence under the  above
    provision. He had travelled illegally from Burma to  Bangkok  and  then
    from Bangkok to Zurich where he had claimed asylum and used a letter of
    recommendation he had requested from a political activist recognised as
    a refugee in the United Kingdom.   The reasoning for the conviction was
    based solely on those events and there was no finding that Mr  Van  Tha
    had engaged in political activities inside or outside Burma.  Secondly,
    there was a further seven year sentence under Article 468 of the  Penal
    Code on the basis of being found guilty of forging documents, since his
    passport included stamps which were not original, including  a  Burmese
    exit stamp and forged visa.  According  to  the  judgment  the  Burmese
    authorities keep lists of those who leave Burma on  a  properly  issued
    exit stamp.  Thirdly, Mr Van Tha was given a five year  sentence  under
    the Burma Immigration Act of 1947, Section 13(1) for illegal entry into
    the Union of Myanmar.   This was  despite  the  fact  that  he  was  in
    possession of a passport issued in his own name.

37.  Ms Lewa concludes from this that the appellant in the appeal before  us
    would be at serious risk of arrest, persecution and possibly torture if
    removed to Burma.  In her additional statement of 14 November 2005  she
    refers to the regular deportation by the Thai  immigration  authorities
    of Burmese migrant workers.  She says that little  is  known  of  their
    fate once they have crossed the border and  been  handed  over  to  the
    Burmese authorities, though there is a reference to examples of  people
    being detained or being required to do forced labour. She  also  refers
    to recent developments in Burma which  indicate  that  the  country  is
    deteriorating, and the current leadership no longer heeds international
    pressures  and  this  leads  to  a  restriction  of  the  movement   of
    humanitarian agencies and a tougher stance being taken with  regard  to
    political activism.  She is convinced that the appellant,  if  removed,
    as a rejected asylum seeker would be at danger of  arrest  and  torture
    especially since she does not possess a valid passport  and  any  valid
    exit stamp.

38.  In a report he had  prepared  for  the  purposes  of  the  hearing,  Mr
    Morland provides helpful comments on a number  of  matters  germane  to
    this appeal.   Some of those matters relate to the  general  background
    situation in Burma and others are more specific to the  appellant.   He
    comments on such  matters  as  the  general  attitude  of  the  Burmese
    security agencies  towards  political  dissent,  the  attitude  towards
    failed  asylum  seekers  returned  to  Burma,   whether   the   Burmese
    authorities would be prepared to grant an entry visa to a  person  such
    as the appellant's former fianc�, whether the  appellant's  description
    of how she was treated by  the  authorities  on  return  to  Burma  and
    thereafter is plausible, whether she would  have  been  issued  with  a
    passport and exit visa given the level of interest in her and whether a
    bribe would be accepted by the authorities to enable such a  person  to
    leave the country.

39.  Mr Morland refers in his report to a description that  has  been  given
    of Burma as an army with a country rather than a country with  an  army
    and the corresponding absence of tolerance  of  any  form  of  dissent.
    Trials take place in secret.   There is an  underlying  intolerance  of
    any manifestation of political dissent.  The authorities' behaviour  is
    unpredictable.   The Burmese Embassy  in  London  has  members  of  its
    military intelligence among the diplomatic  staff  who  photograph  and
    identify dissidents who  demonstrate  outside  the  embassy,  and  also
    informants among the Burmese community. There will be suspicion of  any
    Burmese who lives in the West and returns for a visit that they will be
    bringing back  subversive  ideas.    As  regards  the  obtaining  of  a
    passport, association with a prominent political exile might well cause
    problems but links with anyone  less  prominent  whose  anti-government
    activities had not attracted recent attention in the UK would not  lead
    to a problem in getting hold of a passport, given a suitable bribe.

40.  Mr Morland also refers to the case of Stanley Van Tha  which  is  dealt
    with in some detail in Ms Lewa's report.  She  considers  that  on  the
    basis of this precedent the appellant could expect to be  arrested  and
    interrogated very likely under torture and sentenced to at  least  five
    years imprisonment for illegal entry and  would  very  likely  face  an
    additional seven years sentence if the authorities learn that  she  had
    claimed asylum abroad.

41.  He considers that it is perhaps surprising that a person  such  as  the
    appellant's ex-   fianc� would be granted a visa to  return  to  Burma,
    given his history.   He concludes however that they may well have  done
    so with the intention of finding out  more  about  him,  in  particular
    seeing if he has really  discontinued  his  political  activities,  and
    checking up on anyone he met besides family members.

42.  He considers the appellant's treatment by the authorities to  be  quite
    plausible given her unexpected return to Burma and  her  links  with  a
    former political activist.  He  considers  the  more  detailed  account
    given in her second statement as being in line with other  accounts  of
    the behaviour of the security service towards  people  from  whom  they
    judge that they can extract information by  harassing  and  humiliating
    them and depriving them of sleep without needing to  have  recourse  to
    outright torture.

43.  As regards the appellant's second exit from Burma,  he  concludes  that
    someone about whom the authorities  are  uneasy  but  is  not  a  major
    opposition figure, can perfectly well bribe their way out with the help
    of rich friends able to pay immigration officials what to them are huge
    sums.

44.  Mr Morland  gave  oral  evidence  before  us  and  confirmed  that  his
    statement was true to the best of his knowledge and belief.

45.  He confirmed what he said in the statement comparing the  situation  in
    Burma to the Soviet  Union  under  Stalin.    He  agreed  that  it  was
    surprising that the appellant's ex fianc� would be allowed back in, but
    referred to what he had said at paragraph 15 of his report on that.  It
    was not for him to decide whether what the appellant  said  about  this
    was true or not but he did not find her implausible.

46.  It was put to him that the Van Tha case could be rather different  from
    the usual case and he said it was not just the fact that he had had the
    asylum letter on him but there were a number  of  different  sentences.
    It was put to him that the letter could be the initial trigger  and  he
    said that other shots had been fired also.   It was  suggested  to  him
    that a person who was not carrying such a letter would not be  at  risk
    and he said it would be extremely risky.

47.  He was asked what effect it would have on return  where  a  person  had
    genuine entry and exit stamps.  He said it was different in the Van Tha
    case.  There was no doubt that the Burmese disliked people  who  sought
    asylum abroad, and there would be problems for  the  appellant  if  she
    returned under escort.  If she did not return under  escort  then  they
    would be questioning which she would be unlikely to be able  to  resist
    and it would be likely to be terrifying as he knew from friends who had
    experienced it.   There would definitely be problems  for  her  if  she
    returned on an invalid passport.   If a person returned  with  no  past
    problems  with  the  Burmese  authorities  then   the   situation   was
    hypothetical but the story did not sound made up to him.

48.  He was asked how often the offences referred to such as slandering  the
    state would be employed.  He said that there had been  a  dozen  or  so
    asylum cases in the last couple of years and it was a feature sometimes
    but it was unclear whether it would apply to  the  appellant.   It  was
    suggested to him that since the appellant had had a Burmese passport in
    the past, if she were unsuccessful in her appeal she could go and get a
    new passport and he said she could not,  that  the  Burmese  were  very
    reluctant to give out passports in the West although it would sometimes
    be done for example in Singapore.

49.  He was aware of  the  cases  of  people  who  had  been  deported  from
    Thailand being treated differently.   Association  with  the  West  was
    what the Burmese authorities disliked.

50.  He was asked what illegal entry into  Burma  meant  as  a  charge,  for
    example whether a person entering with an  expired  passport  would  be
    guilty of illegal entry.  He said that it appeared so.    The  response
    was selective and it could be a bad response and it was random.

51.  We referred Mr Morland to the point made in the letter from  the  South
    East Asia Department of the Foreign and  Commonwealth  Office  dated  3
    February 2004 where it was said that Burmese citizens could renew their
    passports at the Burmese Embassy in London.   He  said  that  if  there
    were unusual features they would have  to  refer  the  matter  back  to
    Rangoon.   The appellant would show  up  as  a  person  under  previous
    suspicion.   He was surprised by  the  statement.    It  was  clarified
    however that this appeared to refer to  the  case  of  a  person  whose
    passport expired while they were in the United Kingdom  being  able  to
    renew it at the Burmese Embassy.   He said that one reason for the long
    sentence in the Van Tha case was that  he  had  returned  as  a  failed
    asylum seeker.  You could renew a passport abroad.   He  did  not  know
    whether the Burmese authorities would know that the appellant had  gone
    to Thailand, although it was possible that they would.   That  she  had
    no visa for the United Kingdom would raise questions.  The  system  was
    not one hundred per cent secure but it could cause trouble.

52.  We asked Mr Morland whether he was  aware  of  the  way  in  which  the
    United Kingdom Government, faced with a Burmese asylum  seeker  who  is
    unsuccessful  and  did  not  have  a  passport  would  seek  to  obtain
    documentation from Burma facilitating  return.    Mr  Morland  was  not
    aware that it had ever  been  done  in  Burma.   The  authorities  were
    suspicious and they would scrutinise such a person closely on  arrival.
    He would have thought that it was unlikely.

53.  In his submissions Mr Cox dealt  first  with  the  credibility  issues.
    Page 66 of the bundle confirmed the situation  of  the  appellant's  ex
    -fianc�.  This corroborated what the  appellant  said  about  his  past
    activities.   She had had the opportunity to claim asylum here had  she
    wanted to previously but she had not taken it and had returned to Burma
    and the fact that she had  only  then  later  returned  to  the  United
    Kingdom bolstered her credibility.   Her  evidence  was  that  her  ex-
    fianc�'s activities had essentially ceased and  therefore  it  was  not
    surprising that she had got a passport on the basis of bribery or  that
    he would have been allowed to return to Burma to see relatives.   There
    was a range of people who were suspected but were allowed to  go  about
    their lives.

54.  Mr Cox argued that the appellant's credibility was not damaged  by  the
    greater detail provided in the most recent statement.  He  referred  us
    to the appellant's answers at interview.   She could  have  been  asked
    for far greater detail and had not done so.    It  could  be  that  the
    representatives when the earlier statement was taken had not thought it
    important for her to give a detailed account; after  all  she  had  not
    claimed to have been harmed.   It had not  been  contended  that  there
    were contradictions, she had simply provided a  lot  more  information.
    It was reasonably likely that when she said that she  had  not  thought
    that the most important aspect of her case, it  was  true.   Her  point
    about the fear of a heart attack was not something the authorities  had
    done to her or something she had told them about.  Inevitably she would
    be very frightened, as her answer  to  question  39  of  the  interview
    confirmed.

55.  Risk on return should be assessed in relation to what had  happened  to
    her previously when she went back.  She had had an answer previously as
    to why she had gone to the United Kingdom but had no answer now.    She
    would not return with a passport with a visa on it.   She would have no
    passport but there would be an official record that she had been issued
    with a passport and it might be that there would be a  record  of  what
    she had said when she had left.

56.  The Home Office letter at page 73 of the bundle referred  to  only  one
    case of a return and that could have been done on any one of  a  number
    of bases.   It was likely that the appellant would  have  come  to  the
    attention of the authorities and also likely that they would  be  aware
    of the previous interrogation and suspicions.   She would be seen as  a
    political opponent of the regime, and therefore  there  was  a  Refugee
    Convention reason.

57.  Even if what she had said of what had  happened  to  her  on  her  last
    return was not true, there was a real risk of it happening  should  she
    be returned today, and in any  event  she  would  receive  a  prolonged
    period of imprisonment.

58.  The Tribunal was referred to page  5  of  the  objective  bundle  where
    there is an  analysis  of  the  relevant  material  and  in  particular
    references to  the  provisions  of  the  Burma  Immigration  (Emergency
    Provisions) Act 1947.   The Van Tha  case  should  be  borne  in  mind,
    albeit that there were significant factual differences.   The report of
    Ms Lewa on that case was of assistance.  The authorities were  willing
    to use the Penal  Code.    If  the  appellant  got  an  exit  stamp  by
    deception it was likely to be treated as being the same as forgery.

59.  Mr Cox also argued that the cases in the bundle AH,S and TW  could  all
    be distinguished.

60.   We  asked  him  to  address  the  implications  for  the   appellant's
    credibility  of  the  application  of  Section  8  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.  He contended that
    on the one hand the appellant had a reasonable explanation for  failing
    to produce a passport on request to an Immigration Officer on the basis
    of what she said had happened.    In  any  event  she  had  produced  a
    photocopy to the Immigration Officer and had therefore  not  sought  to
    conceal her identity.   Any damage to  her  credibility  was  therefore
    minimal.

61.  In his submissions Mr Ouseley  contended  that  by  not  producing  her
    passport it could be said that  the  appellant  had  sought  to  thwart
    return given what was said about problems that would be experienced  by
    a person who no longer had a passport and therefore arguably failure to
    produce the passport would frustrate removal.  Her account as to how it
    was that the agent at Heathrow had "disappeared" was not credible.   It
    was a matter for the Tribunal.

62.  He also argued that she was not credible on the entire account of  what
    had happened on return to Burma.  Saying that the matters now  referred
    to in the  third  statement  were  not  important  lacked  credibility.
    Clearly her representatives would have appreciated  the  importance  of
    these matters if they were true, especially with regard  to  a  country
    such as Burma. She had had two opportunities to tell the truth and  had
    not done so.   She had been asked specifically about ill-treatment, and
    if she had such fears she would have said so.   If what  she  said  had
    happened to her were true it would be torture and a person to whom that
    had happened would want to say what had happened and not leave it until
    later.   It was her whole case that she feared the same or worse and it
    could not be said to be unimportant.   What she said was not true about
    her ex-fianc� as she would have been aware of his wishes and also there
    was the point that it was surprising that he would be allowed  back  to
    Burma.

63.  It had been said by the expert that if  she  were  not  credible  there
    would not be problems on return.    Clearly  there  were  problems  for
    returnees to Burma.  The Van Tha case had to be borne in mind and a lot
    of reliance had been placed on that but it was an extreme  case.    The
    particular circumstances of that case were significant.

64.  We drew Mr Ouseley's attention to what was said in the South East  Asia
    Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office letter of 3  February
    2004 that the Burmese Government regards those who leave or  return  to
    Burma without a valid passport as doing so illegally and subject  to  a
    seven year jail sentence which the United Nations  High  Commission  on
    Refugees advises is enforced. Mr Ouseley said he had  to  accept  that.
    However, the appellant's passport had been in currency until July 2005.
     She could have kept it and taken it to the  Burmese  Embassy  as  they
    would not carry out checks with Rangoon.

65.  The case of the returnees from Thailand was different  and  they  would
    not be treated as slandering the government abroad  and  so  it  was  a
    question of looking at the detail of the cases.  There would not  be  a
    problem if her passport had expired and there was no other explanation.
     Various elements needed to be considered, for  example  whether  there
    could be said to have  been  forgery.  There  would  be  no  record  of
    forgery.  It was unclear what was on the original passport which had  a
    valid exit stamp.   The Van Tha case should be contrasted with that.

66.  By way of reply Mr Cox did not accept that  there  were  no  checks  in
    Rangoon when there was a need to renew a passport.  He referred  us  to
    page 65 of the bundle concerning the kind of checks that were likely to
    be made.   It was not said that checks would be  invariable  but  there
    would be likely to be suspicions.   The Van Tha case was relied  on  as
    it was a well documented case about the situation for  a  returnee  and
    contrasted with the absence of any evidence from the Home Office  about
    people who had been returned to Burma.

67.  With regard to the credibility issue,  the  Immigration  Officer  could
    have been expected to ask about the detail of what had happened to  the
    appellant when she was interrogated on her return to Burma.  It  should
    be questioned why she would invent such a story if it were not true and
    if it were invented why she had not stayed on in the United Kingdom  in
    the first place.  What the appellant said about the agent was credible.



    Conclusions

68.  We consider first the issue of credibility in this  case.   Mr  Ouseley
    has challenged the appellant's credibility, in part on the basis of the
    further detail provided in the second statement in contrast to what she
    had said at interview and in her earlier statement happened to her when
    she returned to Burma in October 2004, but  also  with  regard  to  her
    claimed reasons as to why it was that she came  back  from  the  United
    Kingdom at that time and also with  regard  to  what  happened  to  the
    passport and the Section 8 issues arising from that.  We have  set  out
    above the differing accounts given by the appellant in this regard.  It
    is right to note, as Mr Cox pointed out, that  no  contradictions  have
    been identified but rather  it  is  contended  that  the  significantly
    greater detail in the second statement contrasts with what was said  at
    interview and in the first statement to the extent that the appellant's
    account cannot be believed.

69.  We remind ourselves of the essence of  what  the  appellant  said  with
    regard to the interrogation when she was interviewed.   She  said  that
    the authorities suspected that she was a spy and they interrogated  her
    "all the time" during the two days when she was held.    They  had  not
    harmed her physically but they threatened  her  verbally  and  hit  the
    table and they frightened her and said that they would arrest her.  She
    said very little at paragraph 15 of the first statement other than that
    she was interrogated for two days and  described  in  broad  terms  the
    matters concerning which she was questioned.   As  regards  the  second
    statement, it remains the case that she said that she  was  not  caused
    harm and she referred again to being very frightened and to the kind of
    questions that were put to her.  Significant contrast can  be  seen  in
    the fact that she was not allowed to sleep  and  became  exhausted  and
    very disorientated and feared she would  have a heart attack and die on
    account of the fact that she suffers from angina.

70.   Mr  Ouseley  contended,  and  we  think  with  some  force,  that  the
    appellant's explanation for not setting out this detail  earlier,  that
    in effect she did not regard it as being as important as the fact  that
    she was being detained and the reasons why she  was  being  questioned,
    lacks substance.  He argued that in effect this went to the whole basis
    of her claim and that we should not accept  the  further  details  that
    have been provided as being credible. We shall  return  to  this  point
    shortly,  but we think it is worth mentioning at this  stage  the  fact
    that to quite an extent albeit in less specific terms  the  essence  of
    what the appellant said happened in her second statement  can  be  seen
    from the  interview  where  she  referred  to  such  matters  as  being
    frightened and being threatened and set out the kind of questions  that
    she was asked.

71.  Mr Ouseley also invited us not to accept what the appellant said  about
    the reasons for the engagement breaking down.   He contended  that  the
    appellant would have been aware of  her  ex-fianc�'s  wishes  and  also
    referred to the fact that it was surprising that he  would  be  allowed
    back into Burma given his history.  In this regard  however  it  is  of
    relevance to bear in mind what was said by Mr Morland at  paragraph  15
    of his statement that it may be  that  the  ex-fianc�  was  allowed  to
    return with the intention of finding out more about him and checking up
    on anyone he met beside family members.   Though this is no  more  than
    surmise we find it persuasive in the context of  the  country  evidence
    regarding the behaviour of the Burmese Government.

72.  In this regard we must also take account of section  8  of  the  Asylum
    and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.   This,  where
    relevant, states as follows:

    "(1) In determining whether to believe a statement made by or on behalf
         of a person who makes an asylum claim or a human  rights  claim,  a
         deciding authority shall take account, as damaging  the  claimant's
         credibility, of any behaviour to which this section applies.


    (2)  This section applies to any behaviour by  the  claimant  that  the
         deciding authority thinks -


         (a)  is designed or likely to conceal information,


         (b)  is designed or likely to mislead, or


         (c)  is designed or likely to obstruct or  delay  the  handling  or
             resolution of the  claim  or  the  taking  of  a  decision  in
             relation to the claimant.


    (3)   Without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  subsection  (2)  the
         following kinds of behaviour shall be treated as designed or likely
         to conceal information or to mislead -


         (a)  failure without reasonable explanation to produce  a  passport
             on request to an immigration officer or to  the  Secretary  of
             State


              ...


73.  We have set out above the appellant's own evidence with regard to  what
    she says happened to her passport.   At interview  the  appellant  said
    that she gave it to the agent because he told her to give  it  to  her.
    When we asked her why she gave him the passport she said that as her ex-
    fianc� had stopped her from coming  back  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
    because she could not go back to Burma as well and it was risky for her
    to go back to Burma and the agent had told her that he would guarantee.
     She did not know how he had arranged things for her.   She had thought
    when she handed over  the  passport  the  agent  would  deal  with  the
    authorities on her behalf.  To our mind this is indicative of behaviour
    which is designed to  conceal  information.  She  has  given  differing
    explanations as to why it was that the passport was  not  produced.  We
    can accept that it was given to the agent, but the reasons  for  giving
    it to the agent seem to vary between her differing  accounts.   To  our
    mind that is indicative of a person who is  aware  that  returning  her
    might be made more awkward by the fact  that  she  no  longer  had  the
    passport.  Accordingly we have concluded that there is not a reasonable
    explanation for her failure to produce a  passport  and  that  this  is
    relevant to the assessment of credibility as being a  matter  which  is
    damaging to the appellant's credibility.

74.  That having been said, we have to consider  the  extent  to  which  her
    credibility is damaged.   We see force in Mr Cox's submission  that  if
    the account of the first visit to the United Kingdom  and  return  were
    not true then it is perhaps  surprising  that  the  appellant  did  not
    remain in the United Kingdom and claim asylum  then.    What  she  says
    happened is consistent with the claim  that  she  came  and  found  her
    fianc� to make demands of her  that  she  considered  unreasonable  and
    returned to Burma as a consequence.   No  alternative  explanation  has
    been provided for the fact that she clearly had a fianc� visa  to  come
    to the United Kingdom and yet returned after a  few  weeks.    We  find
    credible her claim that she found that her fianc�'s  expectations  were
    not ones that she had been aware of before and  were  not  expectations
    which she felt able to fulfil. Accordingly we accept that she  came  to
    the United Kingdom on the first occasion  for  the  reasons  given  and
    returned for the reasons given.

75.  As regards what happened to her  at  the  interrogation  on  return  to
    Burma in October 2004, we consider that she has sought  to  augment  in
    the second statement what previously  she  said  happened  to  her.  We
    consider that what was said at interview is most likely to  be  a  true
    account of what happened to her at that  time,  and  clearly  what  she
    experienced was unpleasant.  She was questioned over a  period  of  two
    days "all the time" and was frightened and was threatened with  arrest.
     In this context it is also not without relevance to bear in  mind  her
    unchallenged  evidence  that  after  release  she  was  telephoned  and
    followed and placed under surveillance and called in for questioning on
    a number of occasions and released on  the  same  day.   That  we  find
    consistent with what she said happened  to  her  during  the  two  days
    interrogation period on her immediate return to Rangoon.

76.  We share Mr Morland's surprise at the fact  that  the  appellant's  ex-
    fianc� would be allowed to return to Burma, but we find persuasive  the
    surmise of Mr Morland at paragraph  15  of  his  statement  as  to  the
    reasons why the Burmese authorities might let the appellant's ex-fianc�
    back into Burma, bearing in  mind  also  the  point  that  he  made  at
    paragraph 8 of that statement concerning the  unpredictability  of  the
    authorities' behaviour.   It is clear from the document at pages 65  to
    66 in the  second  part  of  the  appellant's  bundle  from  the  Times
    subscription service that the appellant's ex-fianc� does exist and  the
    title he has in relation to the movement he was involved with  at  that
    time supports what the appellant says about his history.

77.  We also find credible  the  appellant's  claimed  fear  of  what  might
    happen to her when she learned that her ex- fianc� was planning to come
    back to Burma.  In the light of what, as we have found above,  happened
    to her previously, we find credible that she would  have  been  alarmed
    and concerned  about  what  the  authorities  might  do  to  her  as  a
    consequence of his return, given the interest they had in  her  in  the
    past on account at least in  part  of  her  relationship  or  perceived
    relationship with him.

78.  We turn to the country information.  We  start  with  the  Home  Office
    Operation Guidance Notes of  June  2005  on  Burma.    It  is  said  at
    paragraph 2.2 that since 1962 Burma has been ruled by a  succession  of
    highly authoritarian military regimes dominated by the majority  Burman
    ethnic group.  At paragraph 2.7 it is said that  Burma's  human  rights
    record remains a cause for  grave  concern.    There  is  reference  to
    arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, the  large
    number of political prisoners, abuse of women's and  children's  rights
    and the complete absence of democracy.   It is said  at  paragraph  2.8
    that the government's extremely poor human rights  record  worsened  in
    2004 and the government continued to commit  numerous  serious  abuses.
    Security forces continued to carry out extrajudicial killings  and  the
    government did  not  permit  domestic  human  rights  organisations  to
    function independently, and remained hostile to outside scrutiny of its
    human rights record.

79.  Various categories of claims are considered in this document.    Claims
    based on involvement with opposition political  parties  in  Burma  are
    assessed and the conclusion is that claimants with close links  to  the
    opposition movement are likely to  face  difficulties  if  returned  to
    Burma and  therefore  opposition  political  activists  are  likely  to
    qualify for a grant  of  asylum.    There  is  said  to  be  widespread
    prejudice against Burmese of South  Asian  origin,  most  of  whom  are
    Muslims, and there was anti-Muslim violence during 2004 and  monitoring
    of Muslims' activities and restrictions on Muslim  travel  and  worship
    country wide.

80.  There is a specific section on those who  have  left  Burma  illegally.
    It is said at paragraph 3.10.3 that if an  individual  has  left  Burma
    without a passport and in breach of bail conditions (for a political or
    criminal case) it is unlikely that the Burmese Embassy would issue  him
    a new passport.  If he were to return  to  Burma  through  an  official
    entry point he would almost certainly be arrested and probably  jailed.
     It is said at paragraph 3.10.5 that Burmese citizens who  have  worked
    illegally in other Asian countries without passports have been able  to
    return to Burma without difficulty, and in cases where the passport has
    expired the holder is usually able to renew it at the  Burmese  Embassy
    following payment of any outstanding taxes.   The penalty  imposed  for
    exiting from or returning to Burma without a valid passport is normally
    less than  the  maximum  sentence  of  seven  years  imprisonment,  but
    offenders who are known political activists can face harsher  sentences
    and additional charges; if charged under different laws, sentences have
    to be served consecutively. It is said that if a claimant has no  valid
    passport it will be necessary to ascertain whether they left legally or
    illegally and if the passport has expired whether it will  be  possible
    for it to be renewed at the Burmese Embassy.

81.  At paragraph 3.11.16 we find the conclusion that prison  conditions  in
    Burma are severe and likely to reach the Article 3 threshold  and  that
    therefore a grant of humanitarian protection will be appropriate  where
    individual  claimants  are  able  to  demonstrate  a   real   risk   of
    imprisonment on  return  to  Burma  and  a  grant  of  asylum  will  be
    appropriate where the real risk of imprisonment relates to one  of  the
    Refugee Convention grounds.

82.  We referred above at paragraph 51 to a letter from the South East  Asia
    Department of the Foreign and  Commonwealth  Office  dated  3  February
    2004.   In the first paragraph it is said in summary that if  a  person
    is not a genuine political activist, having a failed claim  for  asylum
    is not a reason for persecution on return provided they return  with  a
    valid Burmese passport but otherwise the claimant  will  face  a  seven
    year jail sentence.  The British Embassy in Rangoon believes that if  a
    problem arises it will not be because  a  person  is  a  failed  asylum
    seeker but because they have been  deported  without  a  valid  Burmese
    passport.   The Burmese Government regards those who leave or return to
    Burma without a valid passport as doing so illegally and subject  to  a
    seven year jail sentence which the  UNHCR  advise  is  enforced.    The
    reference to the ability to renew a passport at the Burmese Embassy  in
    London appears to relate to a person  who  has  a  passport  which  has
    expired.

83.  The general views expressed in the Operational Guidance  Notes  can  be
    seen to be reflected in other objective evidence. For  example  the  US
    State Department Report on Burma for 2004 refers  to  the  government's
    extremely poor human rights record having worsened.  There is reference
    to the fact that in the past the government has accepted the return  of
    several thousand illegal migrants from Thailand though  the  government
    has not established  legal  arrangements  to  accept  Burmese  citizens
    deported from other countries.   Citizens' movements are monitored  and
    they are required to notify the local officials of  their  whereabouts.
    A rigorous control of  passport  and  exit  visa  issuance  perpetuated
    rampant corruption.   Acts of  discrimination  and  harassment  against
    Muslims continued.   In section 2(d) of that report it can be seen that
    an ordinary citizen needs three documents to travel outside the country
    - a passport from the Ministry of Home Affairs, revenue clearance  from
    the Ministry of Finance and Revenue, and  a  departure  form  from  the
    Ministry of Immigration and Population.

84.  In the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service Burma  Information  on
    Exit and Return Report of 12 July 2001,  it  is  said  that  those  who
    return to Burma with an expired passport and  those  who  have  "caused
    embarrassment" to the government, e.g. applied for asylum abroad, could
    be immediately jailed upon  return  to  the  country  (if  the  Burmese
    Government becomes aware of the embarrassment to the regime).


85.  We have set out above at paragraphs 35-37 the  substance  of  Ms  Chris
    Lewa's reports, in particular in respect of the case of Mr Van Tha.  In
    addition, there is a helpful summary at pages 3 to 12 of the  objective
    bundle comprising a research analysis by the IAS of the  situation  for
    failed asylum seekers who have illegally exited Burma.   Attached to it
    are the provisions of the Burma Immigration (Emergency Provisions)  Act
    1947.   Section 13 of that Act states as follows,

    (1)  Whoever enters or attempts to enter the Union of Burma or  whoever
         after legal entry remains or attempts to remain  in  the  Union  of
         Burma in contravention of the provisions of this Act or  the  rules
         made thereunder or any of the conditions set out in any  permit  or
         visa shall be punished with imprisonment for a term  not  exceeding
         two years, or with fine, or with both.


86.  It seems that this paragraph was amended in 1990, when  the  expression
    "not exceeding two years, or with fine, or with both" was  replaced  by
    the expression "which may extend from a minimum  of  six  months  to  a
    maximum of five years or with fine of  a  minimum  of  K.1500  or  with
    both".

87.  Mr Cox has been unable to find a copy  of  any  rules  made  under  the
    provisions of the Act.

88.  Section 3(2) of the Act states as follows:

    ...


    (2)  No citizen of the Union of Burma shall enter the Union  without  a
         valid Union of Burma passport, or a certificate  in  lieu  thereof,
         issued by a competent authority."


89.  We have also set out in general terms  the  contents  of  Mr  Morland's
    report and his comments on the matters raised  with  him  arising  from
    that report which he dealt with in his oral evidence  before  us.    We
    have found his  evidence  to  be  extremely  helpful.  Clearly  he  has
    considerable experience of Burmese society over a number of  years  and
    also has maintained his contacts so that he can properly  be  described
    as a well informed authority on Burmese affairs.

90.  It is clear to our mind  that  the  appellant  would  return  to  Burma
    without a passport if she were sent back.    This  would  clearly  fall
    foul of  the  provision  in  section  3(2)  of  the  Burma  Immigration
    (Emergency Provisions) Act 1947 to which we have  referred  above.   It
    would appear from the current wording of section 13 that she is at risk
    of facing imprisonment for up to a period of five years or  a  fine  or
    both.   In the light of Ms Lewa's report, which has not been challenged
    by the respondent, there must be a real risk that she would  receive  a
    substantial sentence of imprisonment.   Mr Ouseley suggested  that  the
    authorities' view of Mr Van Tha might have been coloured  by  the  fact
    that he was found to have with him a letter of  recommendation  he  had
    requested from a political activist recognised  as  a  refugee  in  the
    United States.  Mr Morland, however, did not consider that  that  could
    properly be said, given the other charges that had been brought against
    Mr Van Tha.  He was of the view that it would  be  extremely  risky  to
    return a person whose situation might be similar to that of Mr Van  Tha
    but lacking the incriminating letter of recommendation.  We do not know
    the  extent  of  the  knowledge  of  the  Burmese  authorities  of  the
    appellant.   It would seem likely from what Ms Lewa says that lists are
    kept of those who leave Burma on a properly issued exit stamp.  We take
    that from the last sentence of page 4 of her first report.  Accordingly
    the authorities can be taken to be aware that the appellant left  Burma
    on a Burmese passport with a visa enabling her to go  on  a  relatively
    brief visit to Thailand. It is obviously the case that she never had  a
    visa to come to the United Kingdom at that time.  She  would  therefore
    return  as  a  person  without  a  passport  perhaps  returned  on   EU
    documentation, and it may well be that the fact that she  is  returning
    from the United Kingdom would be a  matter  of  which  the  authorities
    would be aware.   If  they  were  not  immediately  aware  then  it  is
    reasonably likely that the authorities would extract  that  information
    from the appellant when questioned on return.    Unlike  the  situation
    when she returned from the United Kingdom previously, she does not have
    a coherent story to give of a kind that could ultimately be expected to
    satisfy the Burmese authorities.   They released her  last  time  after
    giving  her  a  relatively  unpleasant  time  during  questioning   and
    threatening  her  and  following  this  up  with  further  questioning,
    surveillance and bringing her in for questioning during  the  day  from
    time to time.  That was in the context of the history she had  at  that
    time of a person who had been to the United Kingdom and had  come  back
    relatively soon and was a known former associate of a  person  in  whom
    the Burmese authorities had had an interest in the past.  As we say, no
    such explanation could  be  provided  this  time  on  return,  and  the
    likelihood is that the Burmese authorities would discover that she  was
    a failed asylum seeker who had failed to comply with the conditions  on
    which she was allowed to  leave  Burma,  and  who  would  be  returning
    without a valid passport.  If that was the case then there would  be  a
    real risk that she would face a prison sentence of up  to  seven  years
    under the Burma Emergency Act 1950, Article 5(j) as did Mr Van Tha  or,
    if not the maximum that he received, a  lesser  but  still  substantial
    term.  We also consider that there is a real risk that she would face a
    sentence of imprisonment of up to a maximum of five years (rather  than
    the seven years thought to be the case by the Foreign and  Commonwealth
    Office) under section 13(1) of the Burma Immigration Act 1947.  It  was
    not suggested by Mr Ouseley that she might face no more than a fine and
    in  the  circumstances  we  consider  there  is  a  real  risk  that  a
    significant period of imprisonment potentially up to the maximum  would
    be imposed.

91.  As regards the three IAT authorities in the bundle; in AH [2004]  UKIAT
    00085, the appellant was a Rohingya Muslim much of whose  evidence  was
    disbelieved by the Adjudicator; in S [2003] UKIAT 00135  there  was  no
    adverse  interest  in  the  appellant  on  the  part  of  the   Burmese
    authorities; and TW [2004] UKIAT 00285 was concerned with the need  for
    Adjudicators to make specific findings  on  whether  Burmese  nationals
    left Burma with or without authorisation.  None is therefore of  direct
    relevance to this appeal.

92.  We bear in mind the point  made  by  Mr  Ouseley  that  in  effect  the
    appellant could  be  said  to  have  made  it  more  difficult  if  not
    impossible for her to be removed by giving the passport to  the  agent.
    However, we are of the view that in fact there would be little material
    difference if the appellant had kept her  passport.   If  she  returned
    with her own passport (which was of course the situation for Mr Van Tha
    also) we consider that there is a real risk that she would nevertheless
    be prosecuted for illegal entry since she  had  not  conformed  to  the
    terms  of  the  visa  given  to  her.   We  consider  that  is  not  an
    unreasonable inference to draw in the light of what happened to Mr  Van
    Tha.     As regards the situation for  this  particular  appellant,  we
    have concluded that she is credible to the extent that we have set  out
    above, and we have concluded that there is a real risk that  she  would
    be prosecuted under section 13  of  the  Burma  Immigration  (Emergency
    Provisions) Act 1947.  We accept that there  is  a  Refugee  Convention
    reason of imputed political opinion in this case in the  light  of  her
    history and perceived associations, and it must follow  and  indeed  it
    was common ground before us, that a person who is at real risk of being
    imprisoned in Burma is a person who if there  is  a  Convention  reason
    faces a real risk of persecution and who is in any event at  real  risk
    of Article 3 ill-treatment.

93   On the basis of our assessment of the above evidence, we have  come  to
    the following generic conclusions:

    (1)  A Burmese citizen who has left Burma illegally is  in  general  at
         real risk on return to Burma of imprisonment  in  conditions  which
         are reasonably likely to violate his rights under Article 3 of  the
         ECHR.  Exit will be illegal where it is done without  authorisation
         from the Burmese authorities, however obtained,  and  will  include
         travel to a country to which the person concerned was not permitted
         to go by the terms of an authorised exit. We consider it is  proper
         to infer this conclusion from the effect in the Van Tha case of the
         employment of Article 5(j) of the Burma Emergency Act 1950,  either
         on the basis of the application of that Article  in  that  case  or
         also as a consequence of a breach of the exit requirements we  have
         set out in paragraph 83 above.


    (2)  A Burmese citizen is in general at real risk of such  imprisonment
         if he is returned to Burma from the United Kingdom without being in
         possession of a valid Burmese passport.


    (3)  It is not reasonably likely that a Burmese citizen in  the  United
         Kingdom will be issued with a passport by the  Burmese  authorities
         in London, unless he is able to present to the Embassy  an  expired
         passport in his name.


    (4)  If it comes to the attention of the  Burmese  authorities  that  a
         person falling within (1) or (2) is a failed asylum seeker, that is
         reasonably likely to have a significant effect upon the  length  of
         the prison sentence imposed for his illegal exit and/or  entry.  To
         return such a person from the United Kingdom would accordingly be a
         breach of Article 33 of the Refugee Convention.  Whether that  fact
         would come to the attention of the  authorities  will  need  to  be
         determined on the facts of the particular  case,  bearing  in  mind
         that the person is highly likely to be interrogated on return.


    (5)  It has not been shown that a person who does not fall  within  (1)
         or (2) above faces a real risk of persecution  or  Article  3  ill-
         treatment on return to Burma by reason of having claimed asylum  in
         the United Kingdom, even if the Burmese authorities have reason  to
         believe that he has made such a claim, unless the authorities  have
         reason to regard him as a political opponent.

94.  We conclude therefore that the appellant has made out  her  claim.   We
    substitute for the  decision  of  the  Immigration  Judge  therefore  a
    decision that this appeal is allowed on both asylum  and  human  rights
    grounds.
