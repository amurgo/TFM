                                                                  Respondent
Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Sponsor present (assisted by her Mackenzie Friend)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer  to  the  appellant  as  the
      "entry clearance officer" and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant is a national of Pakistan, born on 14th August 1983.  His
      appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 22nd February 2013
      refusing his application for entry clearance as the spouse of a person
      present and settled in the UK was allowed under the Immigration  Rules
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull in a determination  promulgated  on
      13th May 2014. It had been contended on behalf of the entry  clearance
      officer that the claimant had failed to meet  the  relevant  financial
      requirements under the rules.


   3. The Judge found that the couple had a  subsisting  marriage  and  that
      they intended to live together permanently [14].


   4. With regard to the financial requirements  for  entry  clearance,  the
      Judge found the sponsor's evidence credible because the documents from
      Companies House supported her evidence that Gold Flower  is  a  parent
      company and trades as Hotel Management Services.  Gold  Flower  issues
      the payslips.


   5. The Judge referred to the evidence  in  the  claimant's  bundle  which
      included his sponsor's payslips and bank  statements  for  the  period
      10th January 2012 to 10th January 2013. She submitted income  evidence
      for both jobs. The Judge considered her gross and net pay  from  Marks
      and Spencer and Gold Flower, the latter from 30th  May  2012  to  20th
      October 2012.


   6. The annual gross income is stated on the payslips. He cross referenced
      the net pay with the credits into the HSBC bank  account  as  per  the
      bank statements. He found that the net income for each month shown  on
      the payslips corresponds to the credits into the bank account.


   7. He found on balance that at the date of decision - which he stated  to
      be the relevant date - the sponsor's total gross income from both jobs
      for the  12  month  period  was  in  excess  of  �19,841.67.  He  also
      considered the evidence of savings, noting that the couple had had  in
      excess of �20,000 in savings at the date of decision which  he  stated
      was not challenged by the entry clearance officer.


   8. He found that the maternity  leave  resulting  in  a  drop  of  income
      started on 16th June 2013, after the date  of  decision.  She  was  in
      receipt of maternity pay. She submitted documentary evidence that  she
      would recommence her full time job at Marks and Spencer  on  22nd  May
      2014 as well as a part time job through the same agency.


   9. The Judge accordingly found that the  appellant  met  the  maintenance
      requirement.


  10. On 22nd July 2014, Upper Tribunal Judge  McGeachy  granted  the  entry
      clearance officer's application for permission to appeal. The  reasons
      were as set out in the grounds of appeal, namely, that as there was  a
      failure in the documentary  evidence  provided  by  the  sponsor,  the
      appeal should have been dismissed even  where  that  failure  was  not
      specifically mentioned in the grounds of refusal. He  found  that  all
      the grounds of appeal were arguable.


  11. Mr Kandola on behalf of the entry clearance officer submitted that the
      requirements  regarding the specified  evidence  to  be  provided  are
      comprehensively set out at Appendix FM-SE to the rules. These refer to
      the types of evidence required, the periods they cover and the  format
      they should be in.


  12. He submitted that the First-tier tribunal Judge had no regard to  this
      as is evident from paragraphs 13-19 of the determination which set out
      the Judge's findings.


  13. Whilst some documentation had been submitted, it failed  to  meet  the
      relevant requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE.  Accordingly,  the
      First-tier Judge 'failed to fully  engage  with'  and  deal  with  the
      issues raised in the reasons for refusal letter regarding the evidence
      submitted in support of the application.


  14. He accordingly  erred  in  law,  having  failed  to  comply  with  the
      immigration rules and the findings are therefore unsustainable.


  15. It is also evident that the Tribunal did not have  appropriate  regard
      to the relevant date. For Appendix FM, the  significant  date  is  the
      date of  application  and  the  "significant  evidence"  is  from  the
      specified period before that date. The Tribunal has not addressed  the
      relevant evidence from prior  to  28th  November  2012,  the  date  of
      application  as  demonstrated  at  paragraph  16   and   17   of   the
      determination where  the  Judge  found  that  the  evidence  submitted
      demonstrated that the sponsor earned the requisite amount "at the date
      of decision" which he found to be the relevant date. That also renders
      the conclusions unsustainable.


  16. Accordingly, it is not clear what the sponsor's  actual  annual  gross
      income was as at the date of application.


  17. Further, the bank statements provided ended more than 28 days prior to
      the date of application. There was a missing payslip for November.


  18. Further, the requirements relating to bank statements  under  Appendix
      FM-SE had not been met. Paragraph 2 of that appendix, which refers  to
      salaried employment in the UK, sets out the  evidence,  all  of  which
      must be provided. That includes wage slips covering a  period  of  six
      months prior to the date of application  if  the  applicant  has  been
      employed by their current employer for at least six months.


  19. Further, a letter from the employer who issued the  payslips  must  be
      provided with the necessary information. There must also be  a  signed
      contract of employment.


  20. Finally, it is a requirement that  monthly  personal  bank  statements
      corresponding to the same period(s) as the wage slips showing that the
      salary has been paid into the account in the name of the person, or in
      the name of the  person  and  their  partner  jointly,  must  also  be
      provided.


  21. Mr Kandola submitted that the rule is clear. It must  be  demonstrated
      that the salary has been paid into the relevant bank account.


  22. The claimant's sponsor has not been able to show that and has produced
      bank statements in which it is not possible to conclude that  payments
      made to her in cash by Hotel Management  Services  are  identified  or
      identifiable in the bank statements relating to that relevant  period.
      In addition, the applicant must provide specified  evidence  from  the
      sources listed of a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600,
      alone  or  in  combination  with  specified  savings  of  �16,000  and
      additional savings of an amount equivalent to  2.5  times  the  amount
      which is the difference between  the  gross  annual  income  from  the
      sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2.(a)-(d)  and  the  total  amount
      required under paragraph E-ECP.3.1(a).


  23. Mr Kandola referred to the reasons for refusal with regard to savings.
      The entry clearance officer used  figures  actually  'quoted'  in  the
      claimant's solicitor's letter identifying a  shortfall  of  �4260.  In
      order to qualify, the claimant and his  sponsor  required  �26,650  in
      savings in order to meet the financial requirements.


  24. The claimant had provided no specified evidence of such  savings  held
      by the claimant or his sponsor, continuously for the last six  months.
      That also constituted a  basis  for  refusing  the  application  under
      paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the rules.


  25. The Judge considered the evidence of savings and noted that the couple
      had in excess of �20,000 in savings at the date of decision.


  26. As the sponsor was present with her Mackenzie friend, I  explained  to
      her in detail what the entry clearance officer grounds of appeal were.
      I drew their  attention  to  the  relevant  passages  in  the  Judge's
      determination. I am also satisfied that  the  sponsor  understood  the
      nature of the submissions made by Mr Kandola.


  27. I also afforded the sponsor  an  opportunity  to  ascertain  from  the
      documentation  before  the  first-tier  Tribunal  whether  she   could
      demonstrate the correspondence between the payslips from  Gold  Flower
      and deposits into her account.


  28. I accordingly stood the matter down for some time.  On resumption  the
      claimant was not able to draw my attention to payments into  her  HSBC
      account apart from from those from Marks and Spencers. Although  there
      are payments of cash from time to time, these are irregular  and  vary
      in amounts.


  29. I have also considered a document  dated  22nd  March  2013  from  the
      claimant's  nominated  "non  professional  representative"  containing
      representations in respect of the appeal. With regard to the financial
      requirements component of the refusal, the submissions  are  found  at
      paragraph 3. With regard to  the  contentions  relating  to  the  bank
      statement being older than 28 days as  at  the  date  of  the  initial
      application as well as the failure to  provide  "sufficient  evidence"
      regarding the employment of the sponsor in the UK (paragraph  3.2  and
      3.3) the contentions are that her payslips were produced.


  30. However, there is no submission made regarding the  correspondence  of
      pay as reflected in the sponsor's bank statements. Nor are  there  any
      submissions or disputes raised relating to the amount of  savings  the
      entry clearance officer alleged to be required.


  31. Nor has  the  sponsor  produced  signed  contracts  of  employment  in
      accordance with Appendix FM-SE (2)(e). Although not relied on  in  the
      reasons for refusal, as noted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy,  as
      there was a failure  in  the  documentary  evidence  provided  by  the
      sponsor, the appeal should have been dismissed even where that failure
      was not specifically mentioned in the grounds for refusal.


     Assessment


  32. From the determination it is evident that the Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer at the hearing before the first-tier tribunal  relied  on  the
      reasons set out in  the  refusal  letter  [11].  It  was  specifically
      asserted that the evidence she produced "does not satisfy that she has
      the income that is claimed."


  33. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has however paid no regard at all to the
      Appendix FM-SE setting out comprehensively  the  documentary  evidence
      required.


  34. It had been acknowledged by the  entry  clearance  officer  that  some
      documentation had been submitted, but that this still did not meet the
      relevant requirements set out in the appendix. This is clearly set out
      in the reasons for refusal. In particular, no regard was  had  to  the
      requirement that the bank statements provided  ended  on  5th  October
      2012 whereas the application was made on 27th November 2012 which  was
      more than the 28 days specified in the rule.


  35. Further, the Judge failed to have regard to the fact that, as required
      under Appendix FM-SE,  the  claimant  had  been  required  to  present
      monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as
      the sponsor's wage slips showing that her salary had  been  paid  into
      the account in her name.  The failure to engage with the Appendix  and
      to give effect to and apply its requirements as to the  evidence  that
      was required to be produced is a material error of law.


  36. I accordingly find that the making of the decision involved  an  error
      of law for the reasons given. I accordingly set aside the decision and
      re-make it.


  37. The claimant had not provided all the necessary documentation set  out
      in Appendix FM-SE to the rules. That includes, but is not limited  to,
      the failure to produce signed contracts of employment.









Decisions


     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge involved  the  making  of
an error on a     point of law. I set aside the  decision  and  re-make  it,
dismissing the claimant's  appeal.


     I set aside the fee award that was made.
