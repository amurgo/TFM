                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
  pursuant to Rule 17 (5) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008

  1.  By  letter  sent  by  fax  on  4  February  2015,   the   appellant's
     representative notified the Upper Tribunal that the  appellant  wished
     to withdraw his appeal for the somewhat complicated reason referred to
     in the letter and arising from the grant of permission given by First-
     tier Tribunal Judge Kelly on 26 January 2015.
  2. Pursuant to Rule 17(2) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
     Rules 2008, a notice of withdrawal will  not  take  effect  until  the
     Upper Tribunal consents to the withdrawal, which I now give.

OUTCOME
      The appeal is withdrawn.
                                                               [pic]
