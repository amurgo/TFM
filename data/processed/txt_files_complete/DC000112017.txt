                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
   the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
   decision under section 40(6) of  the  British  Nationality  Act  1981  to
   deprive the claimant of citizenship of the United  Kingdom,  because  she
   considers that the claimant is, and at all material times was, a  citizen
   of Lebanon.

Chronology

November/December 2000:  British  Protected  Person  application  ('the  BPP
application')

2. On 30 November 2000, the claimant  applied  at  the  British  Embassy  in
   Beirut for British Protected Person (BPP) status by descent, based on his
   father's status as a person born in the former  British  Protectorate  of
   Sierra Leone.  The claimant's father  was  granted  BPP  status  on  that
   basis, which has never been revoked.  The claimant was 27  when  he  made
   the BPP application.

3. There is no copy in the bundle of any covering  letter  accompanying  the
   BPP application, but the Secretary of State's records indicate  that  the
   claimant supplied copies of pages from a Lebanese passport in the name of
   Dany Taan Ibrahim, his father Taan Ibrahim's  birth  certificate,  and  a
   certified extract of the birth record in the district of  Kenema  in  the
   Western Area of Sierra Leone purporting to show that Taan Ibrahim's birth
   was registered at Kenema, Sierra Leone, in November 1936. The  claimant's
   father is described on that document as the male child of the  claimant's
   grandfather Dibe Ibrahim, a Lebanese citizen, and his grandmother  Haidar
   Ibrahim, also a Lebanese citizen.

4. On 4 December 2000, the claimant was granted  the  status  of  a  British
   Protected Person (BPP) and issued with a British passport.

August-  December  2004:   British   citizenship   application   (the   2004
application)

5. On  26  August  2004,  the  claimant  applied  for  British  citizenship,
   pursuant to section 4(B) of  the  British  Nationality  Act  1981,  which
   provided for registration as  a  British  citizen  for  'certain  persons
   without other citizenship'.  The 2004  application  contained  a  warning
   that 'to give false information on this form knowingly or recklessly is a
   criminal offence' pursuant to section 46(1) of  the  British  Nationality
   Act 1981.  The claimant signed a declaration that  'to  the  best  of  my
   knowledge and belief,  the  information  given  in  this  application  is
   correct'.  At section 8 of the 2004 application form,  which  deals  with
   current nationality, the claimant said that he  was  a  BPP  by  ancestry
   (because of his father's status) and confirmed by ticking a box  that  he
   had never held, nor did he hold, any other citizenship or nationality.

6. The application was accompanied by:

    a) a copy of the claimant's birth certificate, showing him as  born  on
       September 25 1973 to Taan  Ibrahim  and  Zeinab  Ibrahim  (with  the
       correct date of birth for each of them), in Beirut,  Lebanon,  where
       his mother was living;

    b) a letter from the Sierra Leonean authorities dated  16  March  2004,
       stating that 'According to our records,  [the  claimant]  has  never
       applied for nor has he been issued with a Sierra Leonean  passport'.



7. On 4 December 2004, the claimant was granted British citizenship  and  on
   2 December 2004, he was  issued  with  a  British  passport,  expiring  2
   September 2015.

8. The claimant then married and started a family  in  the  United  Kingdom.
   His wife and children are all British citizens.

September 2015: Application to renew claimant's British passport

9. The claimant's passport expired on 2 September 2015, and at  the  end  of
   2015, he applied to renew his passport, triggering further  investigation
   into his status and entitlement to BPP and thus British  citizen  status.
   There was a delay, while the Secretary of State made her enquiries.

October 2016 - January 2017: deprivation of citizenship

10. On 10 October 2016, the Secretary of State wrote  to  the  claimant  say
   that she was reviewing his case and was considering depriving him of  his
   British citizen status and  right  of  abode  because  she  had  received
   information suggesting that he provided non-genuine documents as part  of
   his BPP application in 2000, and further, that she was in  possession  of
   documents attesting to his Lebanese nationality, including a copy of  his
   Lebanese passport, which he had  submitted  to  the  British  Embassy  in
   Beirut in 2000.

11. The letter stated that the claimant must reply  in  writing,  within  21
   days, with the following information:

      a) Evidence that the claimant was entitled to a passport as a BPP;
      b) An explanation as to why  the  claimant  in  the  2004  application
         claimed not to hold Lebanese nationality;
      c) Any information the  claimant  wished  to  be  taken  into  account
         regarding the reasons for his false representations;
      d) Any family ties the claimant had in the United Kingdom;
      e) Any relevant compassionate circumstances which the claimant  wished
         the Secretary of State to take into account; and
      f) Details of any human rights issues which  the  claimant  wished  to
         have taken into account.

12. On 13 October 2013, 3  days  later,  the  claimant  replied  personally,
   saying that 'with all respect to your decision, I do  not  agree  to  the
   contents mentioned in your letter dated 10 October 2016'.  No particulars
   regarding to the matters set out above were provided.

13. On 28 or 29 December 2015, the claimant's father died  in  Beirut.   The
   question whether he was entitled to BPP status and/or British citizenship
   based thereon died with him.

14. On 31 January 2017,  the  Secretary  of  State  decided  to  revoke  the
   claimant's British citizenship on the basis that he was, and  always  had
   been, a Lebanese citizen because both his father's parents were Lebanese,
   and he was entitled to Lebanese citizenship by virtue of his birth  to  a
   Lebanese father.  There being no evidence that the claimant had lost  his
   Lebanese citizenship, the Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied  that  the
   certificate of naturalisation had been obtained by means of fraud,  false
   representation or concealment of  a  material  fact,  which  pursuant  to
   section 40(3) of the 1981 Act entitled her by order to deprive him of the
   citizenship status acquired in 2004.

First-tier Tribunal decision

15. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davidson  recorded  that  the  Home  Office
   Presenting Officer was unable to  confirm  how  the  claimant's  Lebanese
   passport  came  into  her  possession.   He  found,  on  the  balance  of
   probabilities, that the claimant had indeed furnished  this  passport  as
   part of his 2000 BPP application but that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
   nevertheless granted him first BPP  and  later  British  citizen  status,
   apparently in the  knowledge  that  there  was  a  Lebanese  passport  in
   existence.

16. The Judge also found that the Secretary of State had not challenged  the
   BPP status of the claimant's father, overlooking the  fact  that  he  had
   been deceased since the end of 2016.  He preferred the  evidence  of  the
   father's birth in Sierra Leone rather than in Lebanon and found that  the
   birth certificate from Sierra Leone was likely to be genuine.

17. The Judge allowed the appeal against deprivation of citizenship.

Permission to appeal

18. The Secretary of State appealed, arguing that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge had erred in law in failing to engage  with  the  argument  in  the
   refusal letter that the claimant knew that he had  Lebanese  nationality,
   in 2000 before he made the BPP application, and then failed  to  disclose
   that citizenship in the 2004 application.   She considered that to be  at
   least a failure to disclose a material  fact,  based  on  which  she  was
   entitled to deprive him of his British citizenship.

Rule 24 Reply

19. The claimant's Rule 24 Reply sets out section 4B of  the  1981  Act  and
   acknowledges that in order to be registered as  a  British  citizen,  the
   claimant was required to show that he was not a citizen either of  Sierra
   Leone or Lebanon.  The claimant maintains that  he  never  submitted  the
   Lebanese passport on which the Secretary of State relies,  and  that  the
   passport is that of another person, who renewed their passport in Rio  de
   Janeiro, in 1998.   He says he has never been to Rio de Janeiro.

20. The claimant relies on the First-tier Tribunal's finding  of  fact  that
   the Secretary of State had not explained how the Lebanese passport was in
   her or the claimant's possession, and that  there  was  no  reference  to
   submission of any such passport on the BPP application form in 2000.   He
   asserts that the pages from the Lebanese passport did not  accompany  any
   of his applications, though he recognises that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge found to the contrary.  The claimant in his Rule  24  Reply  denies
   fraud,  but  does  not  engage  with  the  other  section  40  bases  for
   deprivation of citizenship (false  representation  or  concealment  of  a
   material fact).

21. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.





Upper Tribunal hearing

22. At the Upper Tribunal hearing, Mr Jarvis  for  the  Secretary  of  State
   took me through the history of the claimant's  various  applications  and
   assertions thereon.  The Secretary of State was not required to challenge
   the BPP status of all members of the family: it remained open to  her  to
   challenge only that of the claimant, if she  chose  to  do  so.   In  any
   event, the claimant's father was deceased at the date of decision.

23. He asked me to  prefer  the  version  of  the  Lebanese  Civil  Register
   obtained  by  the  Secretary  of  State  directly   from   the   Lebanese
   authorities, which stated that the claimant's father was born in Lebanon,
   to those presented by the claimant.   Mr Jarvis noted that there  was  no
   cross-appeal against the finding that the claimant  had  indeed  provided
   the Lebanese copy passport pages to the  British  Embassy  in  Beirut  in
   2000.

24. For the claimant, Ms Record argued that when the claimant's  father  was
   born in 1936, there was no such country as Lebanon, since  the  area  now
   known as the Republic of Lebanon was then part  of  the  Ottoman  Empire.
   There was no clarity  as  to  whence  the  disputed  passport  pages  had
   emerged, nor had the Secretary of State discharged the burden upon her of
   showing that the claimant  had  used  fraud,  false  representations,  or
   concealed any material fact.  The claimant's position  remained  that  he
   never had any other nationality, nor a Lebanese passport,  and  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal Judge had not erred in allowing his appeal.

Relevant legal framework

British Nationality Act 1981

25. Section 4B sets out the circumstances in which a person  who  is  a  BPP
   may acquire British citizenship, on or after 4 July 2002 (unless they are
   a British Overseas Citizen, in which case the applicable date is 19 March
   2009):

         "4B Acquisition by  registration:  certain  persons  without  other
         citizenship

         (1)  This section applies to a person who has the status of. . .
             (c)  British protected person...

         (2)  A person to whom this section applies shall be entitled to  be
         registered as a British citizen if-
             (a)  he applies for registration under this section,
             (b)  the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person  does
             not have, apart from the status mentioned in  subsection  (1),
             any citizenship or nationality, and
             (c)  the Secretary of State is satisfied that the  person  has
             not after the relevant day renounced, voluntarily relinquished
             or  lost  through  action  or  inaction  any  citizenship   or
             nationality

         (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), the  "  relevant  day  "
         means-
             ...(b)   ... 4th July 2002."

26. Section 40 of the 1981 Act sets out the circumstances in which a  person
   may be deprived of acquired British citizenship:

         "40  Deprivation of citizenship.

         (1)  In this section a reference to a person's "citizenship status"
         is a reference to his status as-
             (a)  a British citizen, ...
             (e)  a British protected person, ...

         (3)  The Secretary of State may by order  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship  status  which  results  from   his   registration   or
         naturalisation if the Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the
         registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-
             (a)  fraud,
             (b)  false representation, or
             (c)  concealment of a material fact. ...

         (6)  Where a person acquired a citizenship status by the  operation
         of a law which applied  to  him  because  of  his  registration  or
         naturalisation   under   an   enactment   having   effect    before
         commencement, the Secretary of  State  may  by  order  deprive  the
         person of the citizenship status  if  the  Secretary  of  State  is
         satisfied that the registration or naturalisation was  obtained  by
         means of-

             (a)  fraud,
             (b)  false representation, or
             (c)  concealment of a material fact."

27. That is the legal framework under which this  application  falls  to  be
   considered.

Discussion

28. The claimant was not entitled to apply for British citizen status  until
   after 4 July 2002.  The finding of fact by the First-tier  Tribunal  that
   the claimant probably did supply copies from a Lebanese passport for  the
   BPP application in 2000 was open to the Judge,  on  the  evidence  before
   him. The claimant's challenge to that decision is  in  the  nature  of  a
   disagreement and a reassertion of his own version of events, rather  than
   a cross-appeal  on  the  facts.   There  is  nothing  in  the  claimant's
   challenge which  comes  close  to  meeting  the  R  (Iran)  standard  for
   interference with a finding of fact.

29. The Judge did fall into an error of  law  in  his  application  of  that
   fact.  It is not sufficient to say  that  in  the  2004  application  the
   claimant committed no fraud.  If it was the claimant  who  submitted  the
   Lebanese passport in the BPP application in 2000, then by ticking  a  box
   saying he had never had any nationality, the claimant arguably  concealed
   a material fact and the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  in  law  in  not
   engaging with sub-sections 40(6)(b) and (c).

30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the law must  be  set  aside.
   It is not necessary to remit the appeal for  a  further  hearing  in  the
   First-tier Tribunal, as the section 40(6) questions turn on the  evidence
   and documents.





Remaking the decision

31. The Secretary of  State  asserts,  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   found, that it was likely that the claimant's application in 2000 at  the
   British Embassy in Beirut was accompanied by his Lebanese passport issued
   in Beirut on 17 March 1993, expiring after 5 years, on 17 March  1998.  A
   copy of that passport is  in  both  the  Secretary  of  State's  and  the
   claimant's bundle:  it states that  the  claimant's  name  is  Dany  Taan
   Ibrahim, that his mother's name is  Zeinab,  and  that  he  was  born  in
   Beyrouth (Beirut) in 1973.  The passport bears a stamp from the  Lebanese
   Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, which is  otherwise  illegible,  as  is  the
   photograph of the holder.

32. I am not persuaded by the submission made  at  the  hearing  today  that
   this is another person's passport.  The details are sufficiently close to
   those of the claimant, the Judge found that the  claimant  submitted  the
   passport, and I have rejected Ms Record's assertion that such  a  finding
   was not open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  It is  a  mystery,  which
   now will not be resolved, as to why the claimant  was  then  granted  BPP
   status but that is not determinative of this appeal in his favour.

Status of claimant's father

33. It is not disputed that the claimant's father was recognised  as  a  BPP
   pursuant to section 38 of the 1981 Act, it being accepted  at  the  time,
   and by the First-tier Tribunal, that he was born in 1936 in Sierra  Leone
   to parents who both described themselves as  Lebanese  citizens.   Sierra
   Leone was then a protectorate under the British Nationality Act 1948.

34. The claimant's father had BPP status when the  claimant  was  born,  and
   the Secretary of State has never challenged that status for  his  father.
   The claimant therefore was entitled to apply  for  status  as  a  BPP  by
   descent.

35. The Sierra Leone Citizenship Act  1973,  a  copy  of  which  is  in  the
   bundle, specifies that every person born in Sierra Leone before 19  April
   1971, or who resided in Sierra Leone on 18 April 1971  and  was  not  the
   subject of any other state, is deemed to be a citizen by birth  but  only
   if his father or grandfather was born in Sierra Leone and he is a  person
   of 'negro African descent'.  Neither of the provisos is applicable to the
   claimant's father, as the claimant confirmed at the  hearing  today:  the
   claimant's paternal grandfather and  great  grandfather  were  not  black
   Africans, as the Sierra Leonean constitution and the 1973 Act require, so
   his father is not of 'negro African  descent'  and  cannot  claim  deemed
   Sierra Leonean citizenship under the 1973 Act.  It is not suggested  that
   the claimant's father was ever naturalised as a Sierra Leonean citizen.

36. Curiously, in  the  2004  application,  the  claimant  gave  details  of
   countries where he had lived for 5 years or more:  he said  that  he  had
   lived in Sierra Leone 'since he was born', although at the  date  of  the
   application he was living in West London.





Lebanese citizenship and documents

37. Ms Record's submissions regarding whether in 1936 Lebanon remained  part
   of the Ottoman Empire are chronologically inaccurate:  in May 1926, under
   the French  mandate,  the  Lebanese  Representative  Council  approved  a
   constitution and the unified Republic of Lebanon was  declared.   Lebanon
   became fully independent in 1944.

38. The records kept by the Lebanese authorities of births,  marriages,  and
   deaths, have been badly affected by the civil war which  began  in  1975.
   When investigating the claimant's status in 2015, the Secretary of  State
   caused enquiries to be made of the Republic of  Lebanon  via  the  United
   Kingdom  Embassy  in  Beirut,  regarding  the  Civil  Register  for   the
   claimant's family.

39. On 30 October 2015, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Expatriates  of
   the Republic of Lebanon responded via the  Embassy,  enclosing  a  letter
   from the General Directorate of Civil Status dated 13 October 2015 and  a
   copy of the Civil Register. That document showed the claimant's father as
   having been born on 10 November  1936,  but  in  Ghobeiri,  Lebanon,  not
   Sierra Leone. The claimant was shown as born in Beirut,  on  the  correct
   date in 1973, and married.  All of the other family details were correct.



40. The claimant has since produced two further purported extracts from  the
   Civil Register in Beirut, one apparently extracted on  14  January  2009,
   showing his father as having been born in 'Canama' in Sierra Leone on  10
   November 1936, which is produced in translation but with no copy  of  the
   original, and one, obtained on 3 April 2017 from the Lebanese embassy  in
   London, which records his father as having been born in  'Kenemar  Sierra
   Leone 10 November 1936' and 'deceased in Beirut on 28 December 2016'.

41. On July 24 2015, using  a  microfilm  copy  of  the  Civil  Register  of
   residents in Achrafieh, Beirut for the  year  1967,  the  Lebanese  Civil
   Status General Department provided information regarding the marriage  of
   the claimant's parents, which had been solemnised at the Shii Legal Court
   of Beirut on 3 November  1958,  the  husband  being  Taan  Ibrahim,  born
   November 10 1936 (no indication where) and the wife Zeinab  Ibrahim  born
   15 May 1941.  Those details have never been disputed.  The  Civil  Status
   General Department regretted that:

         "With reference to the microfilm of the register  of  residents  of
         Achrafieh/Beirut, of the year  1967,  register  of  the  family  no
         79/Moslem Shii, it appeared the following record: ...

         It is not possible to issue a true copy of the marriage certificate
         since it has been lost during war events.    This  attestation  has
         been issued according to  the  microfilm  kept  at  our  department
         instead of the marriage certificate."

42. It is necessary to decide which version of the Civil Register is  to  be
   preferred.  Having regard to  the  existence  of  the  Lebanese  passport
   submitted (at least in part) with the BPP application in 2000, and to the
   source of the copy register obtained by the Secretary  of  State  through
   the British Embassy in Beirut, I prefer the  evidence  therein  and  find
   that it is more likely than not that the claimant's father  was  born  in
   Lebanon.  To that extent, I vary the factual finding  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal, since I consider that the weight of the evidence is  in  favour
   of his father having been born in Lebanon.  However, for  the  reasons  I
   now set out, wherever his father was born, the  evidence  points  to  his
   having had Lebanese citizenship when the claimant was born.

Lebanese citizenship

43. The claimant was asked to clarify the question of previous  nationality,
   during the Secretary of State's consideration of  the  2004  application.
   By a letter dated 27 September 2004, the Secretary  of  State  asked  the
   claimant's solicitors, ACS Solicitors, to provide  'Written  confirmation
   from the Lebanese authorities stating that your client does not have  nor
   has ever held Lebanese citizenship'.

44. The claimant and his solicitors did not provide such a document  at  any
   time.  Instead, the claimant's solicitors furnished evidence that he  had
   never had refugee status in Lebanon: they sent to the Secretary of  State
   a copy of a letter dated 14 October  2004,  from  Lebanon's  Ministry  of
   Interior and Municipalities General Directorate of Political Affairs  and
   Refugees, stating that:

         "The General Directorate of Political Affairs and  Refugees,  after
         verification of its records, certifies that: Dany Taan Ibrahim, his
         mother Zeinab Ibrahim, is not registered in the Refugees records in
         Lebanon, therefore, he has not the right  to  obtain  any  personal
         document, belonging to the refugees registered in Lebanon, for  him
         or for any member of his family.  This  attestation  was  delivered
         upon request of the concerned person."

   It had never been the claimant's case that he was a  refugee  in  Lebanon
   and this is an oblique and  unhelpful  response  to  the  question  about
   Lebanese citizenship.

45. The evidence on Lebanese citizenship before  me  consists  of  the  1925
   Decree No 15 on Lebanese nationality  of  the  Republic  of  Lebanon  (as
   amended in 1934, 1939 and 1960) , included in the claimant's bundle,  and
   from the Secretary of State's bundle, a Response  to  Country  of  Origin
   request  (the  COI  Response)  regarding  the  transmission  of  Lebanese
   citizenship.

46. The 1925 Decree provides that the following  categories  of  person  are
   Lebanese citizens:  every person born of a Lebanese father; every  person
   born in the Greater Lebanon territory, who  did  not  acquire  a  foreign
   nationality by birth or by affiliation; and every person who was born  of
   unknown parents or parents of unknown nationality.

47. The COI Response  confirms  that  children  born  to  Lebanese  fathers,
   within Lebanon or abroad, are entitled to Lebanese citizenship,  subject,
   in relation to children born abroad, to a requirement to enter the  birth
   in the Civil Acts Register in Lebanon.  Lebanese citizenship is lost only
   by renunciation, by engaging in the service of  a  foreign  state  or  by
   committing an offence against the security of the Lebanese state. Lebanon
   accepts the principle of dual citizenship: acquiring another  nationality
   does not result in losing one's Lebanese citizenship.

48. If the claimant's father was born in Lebanon  of  Lebanese  parents,  he
   was Lebanese.  If he was born in Sierra Leone, of  Lebanese  parents,  he
   was a Lebanese citizen if his birth was registered.  Additionally, it  is
   plain from the Sierra Leonean legislation that the claimant's father  was
   not a Sierra Leonean citizen, because he could not  show  'negro  African
   descent'.

49. All of the copies of  the  Civil  Register  which  have  been  produced,
   whatever the place of birth, show that the claimant's father's birth  was
   registered in the Civil Acts Register in Lebanon.   Accordingly,  to  the
   ordinary civil standard of  proof  of  balance  of  probabilities,  I  am
   satisfied on the evidence before me that  the  claimant's  father  was  a
   Lebanese citizen and that means  that  the  claimant,  who  was  born  in
   Lebanon of a Lebanese father, is a Lebanese citizen by birth.

50. It follows from all  of  this  that  the  passport  which  the  claimant
   produced in 2000 is likely to have been evidence of  a  past  or  current
   Lebanese citizenship and that such citizenship should have been  declared
   on the 2004 application.  Such a declaration would have been fatal to the
   2004 application, since section 4B registration  is  available  only  for
   persons 'without other citizenship'.

51. I am satisfied that the evidence before me discharges the burden on  the
   Secretary of State to show that the claimant had  failed  to  disclose  a
   material fact (his Lebanese citizenship) and made a false  representation
   on the 2004 application form, when he ticked a box indicating that he had
   never held any other citizenship.  On that basis, the Secretary of  State
   was unarguably entitled under section 40(6)  to  exercise  her  power  to
   deprive the claimant of his British citizenship.

52. There is no removal decision and the Secretary of  State  has  taken  no
   other steps which would affect the claimant's private and family life  or
   the section 55 rights of any minor children.

53. I therefore substitute  a  decision  dismissing  the  claimant's  appeal
   against the Secretary of State's decision to deprive him of citizenship.

DECISION

54. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.


   I set aside the previous decision.


   I remake the decision in this appeal by dismissing the claimant's  appeal
   against the Secretary of  State's  decision  to  deprive  him  of  United
   Kingdom citizenship pursuant to section 40(6) of the British  Nationality
   Act 1981.
