Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, (Senior Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan  born  on  the  1st  January
    1989.

 2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008,  the  Appellant  has  been  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings and  after  their  conclusion,  absent  any  order  to  the
    contrary by the Upper Tribunal or any other court  seized  of  relevant
    proceedings. No report of these proceedings, in whatever  form,  either
    during the proceedings or  thereafter,  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the Appellant.  Failure to comply with this order  could  lead
    to a contempt of court.

The Background:

 3. The Appellant arrived in the UK on the 14th May 2014 and claimed asylum
    on the same date. He was deemed  suitable  to  be  dealt  with  in  the
    Detained  Fast  Track  Process  and  was  detained   at   Harmondsworth
    Immigration Centre. A screening interview took place on  the  17th  May
    2014 and a substantive interview followed on the 28th May 2014.   In  a
    decision made on the 29th May 2014, the Secretary of State refused  his
    claim for asylum/humanitarian protection and on human rights grounds.

 4. In a refusal letter of the same date the, Secretary of  State  set  out
    the full reasons for refusing his claim.  The Appellant  exercised  his
    right to appeal that decision and the matter came before the First-tier
    Tribunal  (Mayall)  on  the  9th  June  2014  and  in  a  determination
    promulgated on the 12th June 2014 dismissed his appeal. An  application
    was made for permission to appeal that  decision  which  culminated  in
    permission being granted on the 17th June 2014 by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hodgkinson.

 5. The matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on the  25th  June
    2014 who found an error of law in the determination of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and set aside the decision in  its  entirety  and  listed  the
    hearing as a resumed hearing before the Upper Tribunal for all  matters
    to be considered afresh. He  considered  that  the  appeal  should  not
    remain in the fast track process and the matter was thus  removed  from
    that process under the  provisions  of  Rule  30  of  the  Asylum,  and
    Immigration Tribunal (Fast Track Procedure) Rules 2005.

 6. The decision made by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy is set out below:-

    "DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

          1. The appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan,  born  on  1  January
             1989, appealed against a decision of the  Secretary  of  State
             made on 29 May 2014 to refuse to  grant  asylum  and  to  make
             removal directions to Afghanistan.  His appeal  was  heard  by
             Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mayall on  9  June  2014  and
             dismissed.  On 17 June 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
             Hodgkinson granted permission to appeal.

          2. The basis of the appellant's  claim  to  asylum  was  that  he
             worked for the American forces as an interpreter  between  May
             2009 and May 2010, living with the US Army  and  returning  to
             his home village on only  two  or  three  occasions.   He  had
             received a number of threatening letters, the  first  in  2009
             but when, in 2010, he returned to his home to see  his  family
             he was told that the Taliban had come to the house saying that
             the appellant should either leave his  work  or  he  would  be
             killed.  He had worked for  a  further  two  months  when  the
             Taliban had again called on his  family  and  further  threats
             were received - he was threatened four or five times including
             receiving two phone calls.

          3. His brother had also received  threatening  letters.   He  had
             attended a police station in January 2010 but the threats were
             not investigated by the police. He had reported the threats to
             the US Army and they had advised him to leave his job.  He had
             then done so, moving  to  Kabul  to  hide  from  the  Taliban.
             However, there he was attacked twice by the Taliban  in  2013.
             He decided to leave Kabul and left Afghanistan travelling  via
             Iran.

          4. The  Secretary  of  State,  while  refusing  the  application,
             accepted that the appellant had worked as an  interpreter  for
             the US armed forces between May 2009 and May 2010.  However it
             was not accepted that the appellant had received threats  from
             the Taliban.  Weight was placed by the Secretary of  State  on
             the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in H and  B
             v United Kingdom of April 2013.  It was  not  considered  that
             the appellant's claim was credible and indeed the Secretary of
             State assessed that there would be a sufficiency of protection
             for the appellant in Kabul.

          5. Before the appeal the  appellant  produced  a  statement  from
             Kabul City Hospital stating that he had  been  treated  for  a
             bullet wound on 9 March 2013.

          6. The judge noted the appellant's evidence about  attempts  made
             to recruit him by the Taliban and the threats he had received.

          7. In his assessment of the evidence the judge noted that it  was
             accepted that the appellant had worked as an  interpreter  for
             the US Army but he did not accept that the appellant had  been
             further threatened and attacked in Kabul.

          8. The judge referred to some background information, including a
             report which referred to an earlier report  from Dr Giustozzi,
             and concluded in paragraph 86 that it was  extremely  unlikely
             that the Taliban would target the appellant who had quit   his
             job in response to threats  many  years  before  and  who  was
             hiding quietly in Kabul.   He  said  that  there  was  nothing
             exceptional about this  particular  appellant.   He  concluded
             that the appellant could have continued to live  in  Kabul  in
             safety.

          9. Grounds of appeal argued that there had been procedural errors
             at the hearing, suggesting that the judge  had  "proceeded  to
             make noises" to urge the representative to continue  with  his
             questions which had given the  distinct  impression  that  the
             judge was wanting to proceed to cross-examination  as  rapidly
             as possible.   They  stated  that  this  was  distracting  and
             accused the judge of bias.

         10. The  second  ground  alleged  that  the  judge  had  erred  by
             misdirecting himself on a material matter - whether or not the
             attackers in the first attack had been  in  a  vehicle  or  on
             motorbike.  It was argued that the questioning  by  the  judge
             was hostile.  It was  then  argued  that  not  only  were  the
             judge's  findings  perverse  but  that  his  conclusions  were
             unreasoned and that he had failed to resolve conflicts of fact
             or opinion on a material matter.

         11. At the hearing of the appeal before me Ms Fisher  referred  to
             the Suthendran guidelines and to the statement  of  Mr  Wells,
             the Counsel who had appeared before Judge  Mayall  and  argued
             that it had  been  wrong  for  the  judge   to  interrupt  the
             proceedings and that he had that,  in  any  event,  given  the
             perception of bias.  She argued  that  the  reference  by  the
             Judge to espionage was a red herring in that that was not what
             the appellant had claimed. She agued that, in  any  event  the
             appeal should not have been in the  fast  track  and  that  an
             expert report would have  been  of  use.   The  appellant  had
             claimed that he was targeted and this was a not  an  issue  on
             which the judge had made any appropriate findings.   Moreover,
             the background information  on  which  the  judge  had  relied
             related to interpreters for NGOs rather  than  those  for  the
             American army. She argued that the Judge had  been  irrational
             when considering the appellant's claim to  have  been  treated
             for a bullet wound. Moreover, there  was  background  evidence
             which referred to "night letters". In all she stated that  the
             conclusions of the Judge were against the weight of evidence.

         12. In reply Mr Phillips argued that Mr Wells, who had represented
             the appellant, was not present to  be  cross-examined  on  his
             statement and that there  was  nothing  on  the  face  of  the
             determination to indicate that the Judge had  been  biased  in
             any way.  The Judge had considered the  evidence  and  reached
             conclusions which were fully open to him thereon.  The grounds
             were really a perversity challenge which  had  not  been  made
             out. He asked me therefore to conclude that the  determination
             of the Judge should stand.

         Discussion

         13. I note the terms of Mr Wells' statement and the comments of Ms
             Fisher at the hearing.  I do not consider that any  allegation
             of bias against the judge had been made out.  It is the nature
             of hearings in the fast track system that it is incumbent upon
             the judge to move the hearing along as quickly as possible and
             I consider that it may be a possibility that that was what the
             judge was doing.  I do not accept that  the  judge  was  doing
             anything other than  trying  to  get  to  the  truth  of  this
             appellant's claim.

         14. However, I am concerned about the  conclusions  of  the  judge
             that this appellant's claim was  not  credible.  There  are  a
             number of instances where he reached conclusions where,  given
             the background  evidence  relating  to  those  who  have  been
             accepted as having been interpreters, I consider that there is
             merit in the argument that too high a standard  of  proof  was
             applied in this case.  I refer, for example,  to  the  Judge's
             consideration of the appellant's claim that he had  been  shot
             at and had been treated  at  a   hospital  in  Kabul  and  his
             assertion that he had received warnings from the Taliban.

         15. While I consider that  there  was  an  error  of  law  in  the
             standard of proof  applied I also consider that there  was  an
             error of law  in placing weigh on the  European Court of Human
             Rights decision in H and B v UK  as that decision  deals  with
             the position of interpreters for NGOs..  I consider that it is
             likely that there would be an  increased  level  of  risk  for
             those who were army interpreters and that therefore there  was
             a material error of  law  in  placing  undue  weight  on  that
             decision.

         15.  I therefore set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Judge.
             Although I consider that the findings of fact  of  the  First-
             tier Judge cannot stand and I set aside the  determination  in
             its entirely I consider  that  it  is  appropriate  that  this
             appeal remain in the Upper tribunal.

         16. I do not consider that it  is  appropriate  that  this  appeal
             should remain in the fast track  system.   I  therefore  order
             that the appeal be removed from the fast  track  system  under
             the provisions of  Rule  30  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
             Tribunal (Fast Track Procedure) Rules 2005.

         17. Moreover, given the issues raised I  consider  that  it  might
             well be of use if this appeal were considered as a vehicle for
             country guidance. To this end the appeal will be listed in due
             course for a "for mention" hearing at Field House.

         Decision

         18. The appeal will proceed to a hearing afresh  on  all  grounds.
             I order that the appeal be taken out of the Fast track system.
             "

 7. The case came before the Upper Tribunal (Deputy Judge  Mailer)  on  the
    19th November 2014. The  case  did  not  proceed  and  the  appeal  was
    therefore adjourned and directions were issued. The following was  also
    recorded on the order by Judge Mailer:-

         "Mr Spurling informed the Tribunal  that  paragraph  15(a)  of  the
         Determination and reasons of Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy  is  not
         correct to the extent that Appellant B in H and B  v  UK  [15]  had
         worked as an interpreter for the US Armed Forces and ISAF - para 15
          of H and B v UK."

The Appellant's Claim:

 8. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  He was born and grew up  in
    Wardak Province between Ghazni and Kabul.

 9. The Appellant started school at 9 years old and  left  school  in  2008
    when he was 19 years of age and went to work for a British company as a
    salesman.  He left that job after about six or seven months as  he  was
    unable to support himself and the company closed down sometime after he
    left the job.

10. After undergoing a training course, the Appellant went to  work  as  an
    interpreter for the US Military in May 2009 when he  was  20  years  of
    age.  It is said that he worked at  the  Zormat  US  Military  Base  in
    Zormat, Paktia District and the Base was divided into two  parts.   One
    part was under US Army control and the other  part  under  Afghan  Army
    control.  The Appellant worked in the part controlled by the  US  Army.
    Furthermore during his period of employment he had worked at two  other
    camps (the Lightening Camp, an Afghan National Army Camp in Paktia  and
    another Afghan  National  Army/US  Army  Camp  based  in  Gardez  City,
    Paktia).  In the course of his duty  he  acted  as  an  interpreter  in
    questioning Taliban detainees.

11. During his time as an interpreter it is said  that  he  first  received
    threats from the Taliban over the telephone in 2009 (see paragraph 6 of
    statement 27/11/2014).  There were several threatening  calls  that  he
    should leave his employment or he would be killed.

12. In 2009 he received  the  first  threatening  letter  but  he  was  not
    particularly worried because his friend had received something  similar
    which had proved to be a hoax.  The Appellant kept the  letter  because
    he thought there was a possibility that it may be genuine.   The  local
    district was in the nominal control of the Government and  the  Taliban
    were in the area.

13. There were also threats to his family.  The Taliban attended the family
    home in 2010 in Wardak threatening to kill him and he received  several
    threat letters. He reported these threats to the local district  Afghan
    National Police Station but they refused to assist, saying that he  was
    not important enough to merit protection.  He reported  the  threat  to
    his employers and they advised him to leave his job which he did in May
    2010 because he and other members of the family were receiving  threats
    from the Taliban.

14. After leaving his job in May 2010, the Appellant went to live in  Kabul
    where he remained with his uncle and aunt  until  he  left  Afghanistan
    around four years later.

15. During the time that he spent in Kabul, it is stated that he received a
    threatening letter at his uncle's address at Chari  Qambar,  Kabul  and
    was attacked twice.  The first attack  happened  in  or  about  January
    2013.   He  said  that  this  took  place  on  a  road  which  was  not
    particularly busy and he had left the house  with  his  cousin  to  buy
    bread.  He was driving a car with the Appellant in the passenger  seat.
    They bought bread and his cousin started the car.  As they pulled  away
    shooting started, there were three  Taliban  on  motorcycles  and  they
    fired from behind.  Four of the bullets hit the car  and  one  hit  the
    back window.  They did not stop to look who it was.  His  cousin  drove
    at full speed to get away from the danger.   They  drove  to  a  police
    station, and the gunman left,  where  they  lodged  a  complaint.   The
    officer gave his telephone number and said he would look  into  it  but
    every time the Appellant rang for an update the officer  said  that  he
    was still looking (see paragraph 20 of A's evidence before the FTT).

16. The second attack took place in March 2013 when he was in the main town
    buying fruit from a shop which was a red shipping  container  set  back
    from the service  road.   He  was  by  himself  buying  fruit  and  the
    shopkeeper was inside his shop.  The Taliban  suddenly  drove  past  on
    motorcycles and started shooting.  There were two of them  and  as  the
    motorcycles were making excessive noise he  turned  round.   They  were
    wearing black clothes, their faces were covered with  black  and  white
    checked scarves.  One of the bullets grazed  his  right  arm  near  his
    shoulder and when they shot, he jumped into  a  drain  which  left  the
    shopkeeper exposed.  The shopkeeper had got two bullets in the left leg
    near to his hip.  The Appellant said seven or eight  shots  were  fired
    and a passerby came and took him to the hospital.   He  remained  there
    for a few hours where he was given painkillers and put a bandage on the
    wound.  The same person who took him to hospital then dropped him  near
    his uncle's house in Kabul (paragraphs 21  to  24  of  the  Appellant's
    evidence FTT).

17. In his statement at paragraph 8, the Appellant stated that they accused
    him of being a spy when the attack took place.

18. After the second attack in  March  2013  he  started  to  stay  at  his
    auntie's home and lived in Dar el-Aman with her family about one and  a
    half hours drive from Chari Qambar on the  other  side  of  Kabul.   He
    stated that he used to move between his uncle's place  and  his  aunt's
    and only went to Dar el-Aman during the night and was careful  when  he
    went out.

19. He was in hiding when living in Kabul (see paragraph 10 statement  24th
    November 2014).  The Appellant left Afghanistan with the assistance  of
    his uncle in or about September 2013.  He travelled to the UK overland.



20. He asserted that his brother K was still receiving threats.

The Law:

21. The Appellant appeals to the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  pursuant
    to Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, (the
    2002 Act), as amended by  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  (Treatment  of
    Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, (the 2004 Act), by a Notice of Appeal  dated
    4th  November 2004 and the Tribunal has borne in mind  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal set out in that notice, which refer to  an  alleged  prospective
    breach of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status  of  Refugees  and
    its 1967 Protocol, as well as a prospective breach of the 1950 European
    Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms
    (ECHR), as that Convention has been incorporated  into  United  Kingdom
    domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.

22. In reaching my decision I have borne fully in mind the relevant law and
    Immigration Rules, including the 1951 Convention relating to the Status
    of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and the Handbook on  Procedures  and
    Criteria for  Determining  Refugee  Status  ("The  Handbook")  (Geneva,
    January 2000).  By Article 1(a)(2) of the Refugee Convention  the  term
    "refugee" shall apply to any person who:-

         "Owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted  for  reasons  of
         race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social
         group  or  political  opinion,  is  outside  the  country  of   his
         nationality, and is unable, or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to
         avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having
         a nationality and being outside the country of his former  habitual
         residence is unable, or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return
         to it."


23. The provisions of SI [2006] No.2525 "The Refugee or Person in  Need  of
    International Protection (Qualification) Regulations  2006"  now  bring
    into United Kingdom domestic law the  Council  of  the  European  Union
    Directive 2004/83/EC of 29th April 2004 on "minimum standards" for  the
    qualification and  status  of  third  country  nationals  or  stateless
    persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need protection and the
    content of the protection granted, normally referred to in  the  United
    Kingdom as the Qualification Directive.  Commensurate changes were made
    in the Immigration Rules by  means  of  Statement  of  Changes  in  the
    Immigration Rules also taking effect on 9th October 2006.

24. The determination I have made has approached the issues in this  appeal
    from the perspective of the 2006  Regulations  and  in  particular  has
    applied the  definitions  contained  there,  in  deciding  whether  the
    Appellant is a refugee under the 1951 Geneva Convention.  I  have  also
    applied the amended Immigration Rules.   These  have  permitted  me  to
    consider whether the Appellant is in need of humanitarian protection as
    being at risk of serious harm, as defined  in  paragraph  339C  of  the
    Rules.  Finally, I have gone on to consider whether the Appellant is at
    risk of a violation of his human rights under  the  provisions  of  the
    ECHR.

25. The burden of proof is upon the Appellant.  The standard of  proof  has
    been  defined  as  a  "reasonable  degree  of  likelihood",   sometimes
    expressed as "a reasonable chance" or a  "serious  possibility"'.   The
    question is answered by looking  at  the  evidence  in  the  round  and
    assessed at the time of hearing the appeal.  I regard the same standard
    as applying in essence  in  human  rights  appeals  although  sometimes
    expressed as "substantial grounds for believing".   Although  the  2006
    Regulations make no express reference  to  the  standard  of  proof  in
    asylum appeals, there is no suggestion  that  the  Regulations  or  the
    Directions were intended to introduce a change in either the burden  or
    standard of proof.  The amended Rules, however, deal expressly with the
    standard of proof in deciding whether  the  Appellant  is  in  need  of
    humanitarian protection.

26. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules defines a person  eligible  for
    humanitarian protection, as a person who does not qualify as a  refugee
    but in  respect  of  whom  substantial  grounds  have  been  shown  for
    believing that the person concerned, if returned,  would  face  a  real
    risk of suffering serious harm.  It seems to us  that  this  replicates
    the standard of proof familiar in  the  former  jurisprudence  and,  by
    implication, applies the same standard in asylum cases.

27. Accordingly, where below I refer to "risk" or "real risk" this is to be
    understood as an abbreviated way of identifying respectively:-

      i) whether on return there is a well-founded fear of being  persecuted
         under the Geneva Convention;

     ii) whether on return there are substantial grounds for  believing  the
         person would face a real risk of suffering serious harm within  the
         meaning of paragraph 339C of the amended Immigration Rules; and

    iii) whether on return there are substantial grounds for believing  that
         the person would face a real risk of being exposed to a  real  risk
         of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.

28. In reaching my conclusions as to whether the Appellant will be at  real
    risk  on  return,  I  have  been  further  mindful  that  the   amended
    Immigration Rules contain among other provisions, paragraph 339K  which
    deals with the approach to past persecution and paragraph  339O  headed
    "Internal Relocation".

29. The Appellant places specific reliance on Article 3 of the ECHR.  It is
    for an Appellant  to  show  that  there  are  substantial  grounds  for
    believing that he or she is at real risk of ill-treatment  contrary  to
    Article 3 ECHR, which prohibits torture, inhuman or degrading treatment
    or punishment.  The  standard  of  proof  equates  to  that  in  asylum
    appeals.  Where there is a failure to show a breach of Article 3, there
    may be a breach of the right to  physical  and  moral  integrity  under
    Article 8.  Unlike Article 3, Article 8  rights  are  qualified  rights
    protecting the right to respect for private and family life,  home  and
    correspondence.  It is for an Appellant to show that  one  or  more  of
    such qualified rights is engaged and that there is an interference with
    such a right or  rights.   The  Respondent  must  then  show  that  any
    interference pursues a legitimate aim, is in accordance  with  the  law
    and is proportionate.

The Hearing:


30. Thus the matter came before the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  19th  January
    2015. At the hearing, the Appellant was  represented  by  Mr  Spurling,
    Counsel and the Respondent was represented  by  Mr  Bramble,  a  Senior
    Presenting Officer.

31. Mr Bramble on behalf of the Secretary of State referred the Tribunal to
    the refusal letter dated 29th May 2014 in which it  was  accepted  that
    the Appellant was an interpreter for  the  Army.   Whilst  the  refusal
    letter raised questions of credibility concerning threats made  to  him
    in his home village, and the threats and attacks upon him in Kabul,  Mr
    Bramble referred the Tribunal to the decision of the ECHR in  H  and  B
    (the Appellant's  bundle  page  357)  and  submitted  that  whilst  the
    Secretary of State had previously relied on paragraphs  97  and  98  of
    that decision that there was little evidence of the  Taliban  targeting
    interpreters, at paragraph 100 of that decision, the  court  considered
    that there would still be individuals who may be able to demonstrate  a
    risk of harm in Kabul depending on the individual acts of the case.  In
    those circumstances he submitted that on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State he would accept that there are circumstances  where  interpreters
    who work for the American Forces can be targeted and thus it would  not
    be necessary to go through the objective evidence and that if his  case
    was found to be credible to the lower standard of proof concerning  the
    events in Kabul then the Appellant will have proved his case.  Thus  it
    was also accepted that he had been threatened in his home town  by  the
    Taliban before leaving for Kabul.

The Evidence

32. The Appellant's legal advisors produced three bundles of  documents  in
    support of the appeal.  The Appellant provided a consolidated bundle of
    385 pages including a  witness  statement  of  the  Appellant,  various
    letters and ID documents, an objective bundle with a number of articles
    including UNHCR Guidelines and the COIS Report for 2013 and a copy of H
    and B v UK (ECHR).  In addition  before  the  hearing  there  were  two
    further bundles of documents,  firstly  a  supplementary  bundle  which
    consisted of a number of articles and objective material (58 pages) and
    a second supplementary bundle which included further evidence including
    statements from T E Burd and ID document, witness statement of Z and ID
    document, witness statement of AS and ID document,  and  a  What's  App
    exchange.  That  bundle  numbers  eleven  pages.   The  Appellant  also
    provided a copy of the Doctor's letter from Kabul  City  Hospital  that
    was referred to by the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Mr  Spurling  helpfully
    produced a skeleton argument upon which he placed reliance and also  an
    addendum for the hearing which made reference to the country  materials
    which had been produced  in  the  Appellant's  bundle.  The  Respondent
    relied upon the bundle including  the  decision  and  the  accompanying
    reasons for refusal letter and the notes  of  screening  interview  and
    asylum interview.

33. At the outset of the hearing there was preliminary point  raised  about
    which language the Appellant would give his evidence in as Counsel  had
    raised the issue about him giving evidence in English.  However, it was
    agreed that as the nature of the court proceedings would include cross-
    examination and that as the interpreter was present it would be a safer
    course for him to give his evidence in his first language.

34. Mr WA gave evidence with the assistance of the  court  interpreter  and
    gave evidence in the Pashtu language.  I carried out an introduction of
    the proceedings so that the Appellant was familiar with  the  procedure
    that would be adopted during the court  hearing  and  in  particular  I
    ensured that the Appellant and the interpreter  could  understand  each
    other.  There were no difficulties identified.  I note that during  the
    hearing there were no difficulties with the  Appellant  being  able  to
    give evidence or with the interpretation and no concerns were raised at
    any time during the hearing in relation to that.

35. There is a full record of oral evidence of that evidence which  appears
    in the Record of Proceedings.

36. The Appellant confirmed his two statements (page 1 to 5  of  the  first
    bundle) and the statement dated 27th November 2014.  Those were adopted
    as his evidence-in-chief.  In addition, he was referred  to  his  first
    witness statement (paragraph 6) in relation to the  four  letters.   He
    confirmed that there were four letters, three to his home  and  one  to
    his uncle's home.  The first  letter  came  in  2009  and  his  brother
    received two threatening letters in 2010.  He confirmed  that  the  two
    threatening letters that his brother had received were part of the four
    letters that he had received.  Thus he confirmed he had  received  four
    letters in total.  He was asked if he was allowed to work  in  the  UK,
    what would he do, he stated he was interested in interpreting and would
    like to become a court interpreter.

37. In cross-examination he was asked about the time that he lived with his
    uncle.  He confirmed that the first attack took place  when  living  at
    his uncle's house and the second attack he said happened  when  he  was
    coming from his aunt's house travelling to his  uncle's  house  to  buy
    things from the market.  He said he was living at his aunt's  house  at
    the time of the second attack because after the first attack he changed
    his residence.  He was referred to question 166 (B31) and  why  he  did
    not mention in his screening interview that he was attacked  in  Kabul.
    The Appellant stated he was asked not to give  all  the  details  about
    attacks in the screening interview.  He  said  he  was  going  to  give
    information but he was told not to give  all  the  information  in  the
    screening interview.  He was asked to look at the  screening  interview
    (A8 4.1) and the question he was asked namely what was the  reason  for
    coming to the UK and a follow-up question, why was he  in  danger.   It
    was put to him that he had said "I received threats  from  the  Taliban
    because working for the US Army".  In those circumstances why  did  you
    not mention the attack?  The  Appellant  said  that  he  mentioned  the
    attack but when I was going to give more information I was asked not to
    do so.  It was put to him that the word said "threat" not "attack"  and
    he confirmed that it was different.

38. He was asked in respect of the individual attacks, he was  asked  about
    the month and year that they took place, he said he  was  under  stress
    and could not remember each and every date.  He explained that  he  had
    come here with difficulty and he could say the number of people but  he
    could not remember the month or year of the attack.  It was put to  him
    that he had remembered it by the date of his witness statement.

39. He was asked about the attack  further  and  referred  to  his  witness
    statement (paragraph 15) where he said there were three.  It was put to
    him that he was asked in the interview at B31 were they in vehicles and
    he replied "No".  He was  asked  why  he  did  not  say  they  were  on
    motorcycles.  He said that  by  the  word  vehicle  he  understood  the
    interpreter to mean a motor car.  He was asked to explain and  say  why
    they were on motorcycles.  The Appellant stated that he was asked if it
    was in a motor car and the answer was no.  He said  that  when  he  was
    attacked there were three men but later on there were  two  people  and
    there was one motorcycle.  He was asked to confirm  his  evidence  that
    there was one motorcycle and three people on it and he stated yes  that
    there were three people riding one motorcycle.  He  was  asked  how  he
    would know they were Taliban if he did not stop to look.  The Appellant
    stated that when the first incident took place we saw them and left, we
    started the car and did not stop.

40. He was asked about the driver of the car whom he  referred  to  as  his
    cousin.  It was put to him that he never mentioned  his  cousin's  name
    but his cousin's  name  was  Z.   The  Appellant  stated  that  he  had
    mentioned it before.  He was asked to look at Z's letter  in  which  he
    said there were two motorcycles.  The Appellant said that he might have
    seen two motorcycles but the Appellant saw one motorcycle.  It was  put
    to him his cousin said he had seen two masked men when you  saw  three.
    The Appellant said that with his own eyes he saw one motorcycle.

41. As to the second attack, he was travelling from his aunt's house to his
    uncle's home and he was asked where he took a graze to  his  arm.   The
    Appellant said it was to his left arm.  He was asked  to  look  at  the
    letter from the doctor in which it said he had sustained an injury  due
    to a single bullet wound resulting in severe soft  tissue  damage.   He
    was asked why the doctor said it was severe when he had said it  was  a
    graze?  He was asked if he had had any medical examination in  the  UK.
    The Appellant said he had not.  He was also asked  about  the  doctor's
    comments that the gunshot wound was as a result of an attack  from  the
    Taliban.  He was asked how the doctor knew that?   The  Appellant  said
    that when the attack took place it was understood it was by the Taliban
    and he had told the doctor that it was them.   He  was  asked  why  the
    court should place importance on the letter from AS who saw the  second
    attack?  He said that no-one had asked his name, about  the  cousin  or
    the shopkeeper.  In respect of the second attack he was asked  that  if
    he was travelling from his aunt's home back to his  uncle's  home,  and
    his aunt's home was a one and a half hour drive away the  Taliban  must
    have worked out that the was living at his aunt's house.  The Appellant
    said that was so.  He was asked about his fianc� and he confirmed  that
    she still was his fianc� and lived in Kabul.  He said that she was  not
    an extended family member and she does not live  close  to  either  the
    uncle or the aunt.

42. He was asked about the circumstances after the second attack  in  Kabul
    and whether the family who remained in the village  received  any  more
    threats.  He said they had received calls by the telephone  asking  for
    my address.  He said the threats had not stopped and  referred  to  his
    brother being in hiding.  As to his uncle, he said that his  uncle  was
    very old and the Taliban do not harm ladies and that is  why  they  had
    not been attacked.  He was asked to confirm that the  brother  who  had
    received two letters if he was the  same  brother  who  had  gone  into
    hiding and he confirmed it was.  When asked why his brother  went  into
    hiding, he said when he left the country the  Taliban  went  after  his
    brother.  He left Afghanistan in September 2013.  He said that he  went
    into hiding about one month after  he  left.   The  Taliban  asked  his
    brother about his address.  He was asked when his brother decided to go
    into hiding.  He said the  Taliban  visited  his  house  several  times
    asking for the address and his brother was afraid of  them.   He  could
    not say when he went into hiding as he did not have much  communication
    with him.  He was asked about Z, and his location.  The Appellant  said
    that he was not in Afghanistan but was in  Germany.   He  said  he  had
    received the letter from Z by fax but he did not have a copy of the fax
    transmission.  As to the letter from the grocer AS, he  said  that  his
    brother had sent  it  to  him  by  fax  but  he  did  not  have  a  fax
    transmission.

43. In re-examination he was asked about the first  witness  statement  and
    was asked how many days before the hearing  the  statement  was  taken?
    The Appellant said he did not know.  He stated that when he  first  got
    the document it was about three or four days  before  the  hearing  and
    that the information was given over the phone.

44. As to the gunshot wound he was asked what treatment he had and referred
    to questions 180-187 and 181.  Therefore to clarify he was asked if the
    doctor sewed up his wound or  bandaged  it?   The  Appellant  said  the
    doctor only applied a bandage.  He said he  had  not  seen  a  scarring
    expert in the UK because he did not think it necessary.  He  said  that
    he had a slight scar there.   He  was  asked  about  contact  with  his
    brother K (questions 20-25  at  B11,  B12).   At  question  22  he  had
    contacted his brother K two to three times since  he  left  Afghanistan
    and the last time was three days before the asylum  interview  on  25th
    May 2014 and it was said that he  had  contact  by  phone  and  with  a
    mobile.  He was asked when did he find out his brother was  in  hiding?
    The Appellant said that he did not have much communication  because  he
    did not want to talk  about  difficulties  because  his  sister  became
    upset.  He said a week ago he was also told that his brother was hiding
    from the Taliban.

45. There were some questions in clarification.  The  Appellant  was  asked
    how the documents from ZA and AS had come to the  UK.   He  said  those
    documents were sent by  post  and  the  copies  came  by  fax  but  the
    originals came by post.  When asked where the original  documents  were
    the Appellant pulled out an envelope.  He said that they had been  sent
    by post by his brother K and the envelope had a mark on it  saying  4th
    January 2015, sent from Kabul City.  When asked what  the  address  was
    given on the envelope he said it was Kabul Section C.  When  asked  why
    he was in Kabul, he said he had come to send the documents and  was  in
    hiding.  He said he did not know the address given for his brother,  it
    might be a friend but he did not know.  There were no questions arising
    from that.

Submissions of the Parties:

46. At the conclusion of the oral evidence I heard submissions from each of
    the advocates. Mr Spurling had provided a skeleton argument at the last
    hearing and had produced at the hearing a further document. I have  had
    regard to those documents when reaching a decision of  the  appeal.   I
    shall briefly summarise those submissions.

The Respondent's Submissions:

47. Mr Bramble on behalf of the Secretary of State relied upon the  refusal
    letter dated 29th May 2014.  He  confirmed  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position.  It was accepted that the Appellant was  an  interpreter  and
    accepting  the  background  information  and  that  that  followed  the
    decision of the ECHR in H and B it refers to individuals that can still
    be at risk acting as interpreters  for  the  Allied  Forces.   Thus  he
    submitted it came to a matter of the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    account and whether or not he was attacked in Kabul by the Taliban.  He
    further accepted the evidence which was that in his home area there was
    a stronger threat and that he had given up his job  as  an  interpreter
    because of those threats and that was not challenged.   The  issue  was
    what has happened in Kabul, therefore he confirmed that he accepted the
    Appellant's account up until he had moved to Kabul.

48. Thus he submitted the two attacks that took place in Kabul had not been
    demonstrated to have occurred to  the  lower  standard  of  proof.   He
    submitted there was no  mention  of  either  attack  in  the  screening
    interview and he had been given the opportunity to  set  out  what  had
    happened.  The Appellant's claim was that he had kept his answers short
    but given the importance of this issue he should have  stated  that  in
    the screening interview.   As  for  the  first  attack,  he  could  not
    remember the date but when looking at the  questions  he  was  specific
    about numbers and those involved but  could  not  remember  the  actual
    date.  Looking at the Appellant's account as to the incident there were
    three men on a motorcycle whereas his cousin had said  there  were  two
    men on two  motorcycles.   When  considering  the  second  attack,  the
    Appellant claimed he was wounded during the attack and  had  to  go  to
    hospital.  In evidence he said it was a graze but the letter  from  the
    doctor referring to the incident refers to severe  soft  tissue  damage
    which would suggest more than a graze.  He did  not  have  any  sutures
    just bandages  and  there  has  been  no  subsequent  medical  evidence
    provided to give any further information.  There was also a letter from
    the grocer, the Appellant had never mentioned any name associated  with
    the grocer and his cousin was also not  named.   There  is  a  lack  of
    clarity to the lower standard as to how much weight should be  attached
    to those letters.  The information came in a letter  from  Kabul  dated
    4th January 2015.  K was in hiding yet there was time for him  to  send
    the information.  When it was put to him, that there was no evidence of
    continuing threats he said that there had been last week.   Mr  Bramble
    submitted that that was simply to bolster his account.

49. As to threats in the home  area,  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  it  was
    surprising that his uncle and aunt who have assisted the Appellant have
    not been approached or harassed.  His explanation for this was that his
    uncle and aunt were old but it is surprising that  no-one  had  pursued
    the extended family.  The objective material made reference  to  Afghan
    interpreters seen as a threat and thus it was even more surprising that
    the Taliban did not choose  to  find  his  fianc�  who  remained  there
    unaffected.

50.  It  was  further  submitted  that  whilst  his  core  claim  might  be
    consistent, the supplementary  documentary  evidence  produced  further
    concerns upon that evidence and there has been no clarity as  to  those
    events.  Thus he submitted that he has not made out the threats to  him
    in Kabul and had not shown there was any continued interest in  him  by
    the Taliban as a former interpreter and thus he would be able to return
    to Kabul where he has strong family connections having lived there  for
    three years.  Thus he would be at no risk on return.

The Appellant's submissions:

51. Mr Spurling relied on the skeleton argument that he  had  produced  for
    the earlier hearing and also the addendum that related to the objective
    material and references to that.

52. As to the credibility of the account, Mr Spurling submitted that he had
    given credible evidence about Kabul and the events  that  had  occurred
    there and that he had given a credible account and  also  a  consistent
    one. He invited the Tribunal to consider the issue of  consistency  and
    that it was important to look at the evidence given  and  look  at  the
    reasons for the inconsistencies.  The Presenting Officer had said  that
    where there was an inconsistency, it was because it was  not  true  and
    that  thus  it  was  important  to  bear  in   mind   the   surrounding
    circumstances including the passage of time and the circumstances where
    evidence was given, for example,  the  screening  interview.   In  this
    respect he relied upon his skeleton  argument.   The  asylum  interview
    also was carried out whilst in detention shortly after  a  seven  month
    journey to the UK and it would not be surprising if some of the answers
    did not demonstrate being able to provide all the information,  in  the
    light of those circumstances.  He was in detention fast track,  it  was
    not an open interview and he did not set the  pace  of  the  interview.
    Furthermore the circumstances regarding the  witness  statement  should
    also be taken into account.

53. As to the difference between the accounts given in the documents of his
    cousin and the doctor, he invited the Tribunal to take into account the
    fallibility  of  two  peoples'  memories   when   talking   about   the
    circumstances and that when people  talk  about  an  event  often  they
    disagree and that  is  completely  normal  but  it  is  not  enough  to
    undermine the credibility of the Appellant's account.

54. As to the points raised by Mr Bramble, he submitted that the  screening
    interview did not demonstrate that he had not given a credible account,
    the record of the answers were not verbatim but were  brief  notes  and
    referred to his skeleton argument at paragraph 15.  As to the  date  of
    the first interview, whilst he could not remember when first asked,  he
    gave a date, a month and the year at question 148.  His evidence was at
    the time he was interviewed he had answered 148 questions and was under
    stress but he could remember the details and  that  was  the  important
    part of the claim.  As to those details he said that he saw  three  men
    on one motorcycle whereas his cousin said two men on  two  motorcycles.
    He said his cousin was driving the car.  However it  was  important  to
    understand the circumstances, it happened very quickly and neither were
    seeing the same view.  The Appellant only gave an account as to what he
    was seeing and it was credible  that  they  can  remember  the  account
    slightly differently without making anything  up.   Furthermore  it  is
    possible that they were not looking at everything from the  same  angle
    and it is happening very quickly.  As  to  the  injury  sustained,  the
    Appellant said it was a graze and it was bandaged and whilst the doctor
    referred to it as a severe soft tissue injury this is the way it looked
    like to an expert.  The Appellant was not trying  to  make  the  injury
    sound worse, he could have said it had been stitched but  he  did  not.
    He said that there was a scar and  the  way  he  described  the  bullet
    striking him it went past and thus he called it a  graze.   As  to  the
    letters, he had already identified  his  cousin  and  his  account  was
    credible and consistent.  The letters were posted from  Kabul  and  the
    Appellant's account was that he  did  not  recognise  the  address  but
    assumed it must be a friend's address  but  that  was  consistent  with
    someone leaving the village and having moved around.

55. Whilst the uncle and aunt and fianc� had not been harassed  it  is  not
    known why they have not been targeted.  Whilst the  Presenting  Officer
    raised the point that if  someone  was  wanted  by  the  Taliban  their
    extended family would be at risk, there was no  objective  evidence  to
    support that and it very much depended on the profile of the individual
    concerned.  In any event the Appellant's evidence was the second attack
    took place at the uncle's house and there was nothing to say  that  the
    Taliban knew where the aunt lived.  Thus the core of  his  account  was
    consistent and there was no legal requirement to  produce  evidence  in
    support of his claim but he had produced evidence and where  there  may
    be a difference in that evidence, that is not a reflection of its  lack
    of consistency but that often happens when there are  different  people
    giving their view as to what had happened.  It may have been the doctor
    was trying to help the Appellant and may have been more technical  than
    necessary.  However it does not mean that the evidence is false.   Thus
    the account is credible and that he was attacked in Kabul.

56. In terms of risk, he made reference to the  pages  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle  and  the  addendum  showing  interpreters  face  threats.    He
    submitted that it was accepted that he was an interpreter  and  further
    accepted that he had left his job because of the threats of  harm  that
    he had received and that was the reason why he had relocated to  Kabul.
    Thus the question still remained that even if he  had  not  experienced
    specific attacks in Kabul, is there a  reasonable  likelihood  that  he
    would be at risk on return?  He referred  to  the  background  material
    showing interpreters were at risk and that there had been attacks  upon
    them even after they had stopped working.  He said the Taliban's  reach
    was extending in Kabul and the insurgency after the troops had left was
    still intensifying (reference  made  to  the  supplementary  bundle  of
    background material).

57. Mr Spurling also relied upon his skeleton argument at paragraph 20  and
    the  issue  which  he  described  as  "causality  and  the   relocation
    alternative".  It was submitted that if he had ceased  employment  from
    fear or as a result of threat and would  otherwise  have  continued  to
    work as an interpreter, then  relocation  was  not  an  alternative  to
    persecution but evidence of it.   He  submitted  that  in  Afghanistan,
    interpreting for the military was seen by the Taliban  as  evidence  of
    political opinion which is a protected characteristic and therefore  an
    interpreter who is unable to work in his chosen field because to do  so
    would expose him to risk on the basis of an imputed  political  opinion
    is entitled to the benefit of the HJ (Iran)/RT (Zimbabwe) principle.

58. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision which I now
    give.

Assessment of Evidence and Findings of Fact :

59. I must make findings as to the credibility of  the  Appellant  and  the
    claim in the light of the totality of the evidence that is  before  me,
    including the background evidence, the medical evidence and that of the
    witnesses and the documentary evidence.  The Respondent took  the  view
    that the Appellant's claim was not credible for the  reasons  indicated
    in her letter of the 29th May 2014.  However, it is  not  in  issue,  I
    should say, that the Appellant is a national of Afghanistan  and  I  so
    find.

60.  I confirm that in reaching my  findings  I  have  considered  all  the
    evidence "in the round" in making an assessment.

61. I should first of all set out what is agreed between the parties. It is
    accepted by the Secretary of State that  the  Appellant  worked  as  an
    interpreter for the US Army for the period  from  May  2009  until  May
    2010.  The Appellant provided documentation in support of his work with
    the US Army in the form of photographs showing him pictured with  other
    interpreters and members of the US  Armed  Forces  as  well  as  having
    provided ID cards for two of the three camps that he had worked in.  In
    addition, the most recent evidence filed included a  statement  from  a
    Platoon Sergeant T Burd, from the US Army, which also provides  further
    support for his account  of  working  as  an  interpreter  and  further
    information about his time with the US Forces based in Zormat.  None of
    that is in dispute.

62. Mr Bramble, on behalf of the Secretary of State also accepts  that  the
    Appellant's account of events in his home area of Jaghato,  a  district
    of Wardak Province, whereby he and his family members  were  threatened
    by the Taliban.  This was by a threat made over the telephone  in  2009
    in which he received a threat to leave his employment as an interpreter
    or he would be killed and receiving a threatening letter  in  September
    2009 and a visit made to his family home.

63. The issues of credibility that I have to decide relate  to  the  events
    that the Appellant claimed to have occurred after he left his home area
    and when he relocated to Kabul.  I have had the opportunity to consider
    the evidence, both documentary and oral evidence  and  in  reaching  my
    conclusions as to the account given, I have considered those events  in
    the context of the country materials and the background  material  that
    has been placed before me.

64. When considering documentation, I remind myself of the  guidance  given
    in the decision of the Tribunal in Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439  in
    which the  Tribunal  acknowledged  the  argument  that  "documents  and
    information contained in them may be either genuine or false; documents
    may be genuine but that information itself may be false; documents  may
    not be genuine but the  information  may  nonetheless  be  true".   The
    Tribunal in that case went on to state:-

         "It is trite in immigration and asylum law that we must  not  judge
         what is or is not likely to happen in other countries by  reference
         to our perception of what is normal within in the  United  Kingdom.
         The principle applies as much to documents as to any other form  of
         evidence.  We know from experience  and  country  information  that
         there  are  countries  where  it  is  easy  and  often   relatively
         inexpensive to obtain 'forged' documents.  Some of them  are  false
         in that they are not made by whoever purports to be the author  and
         the information they contain is wholly or partially  untrue.   Some
         are 'genuine' to the extent that they emanate from a proper source,
         in the proper form, on the proper paper, with the proper seals, but
         the information they contain is wholly or  partially  untrue.   ...
         The permutations of truth, untruth, validity and 'genuineness'  are
         enormous.  At its simplest we need to  differentiate  between  form
         and content; that is whether a document is properly issued  by  the
         purported author and whether  the  contents  are  true.   They  are
         separate questions.  It is a dangerous oversimplification merely to
         ask whether a document is 'forged' or even 'not genuine'."

65. The only question is whether the document is one  upon  which  reliance
    should properly be placed.  Such documentation should be not looked  at
    in isolation but should be assessed along with other pieces of evidence
    and therefore "in the round".  I confirm that I have had in mind  those
    words of the Tribunal when making  an  assessment  of  the  variety  of
    documents that have been produced in this case.

66. I have considered this part of the Appellant's account  with  care  and
    the documents produced in support of it in the light of  Tanveer  Ahmed
    and in the light of the background country materials.

67. The first incident relates to an attack made upon him in January  2013.
    His account is that he had left the house with his cousin to buy  bread
    and he was driving a grey Toyota Corolla and the Appellant was  sitting
    in the passenger seat.  He stated that they had just bought  bread  and
    as his cousin started the car and pulled away, they  started  shooting.
    He describes his attackers as three of them on  one  motorcycle  firing
    from behind.  He further described that four bullets hit the  car,  one
    hit the back window and that they (the Appellant and  his  cousin)  did
    not even stop to look who it was and they drove away at speed  (witness
    statement paragraph 15 page 17 of bundle).

68. In support of the account he has provided a witness  statement  from  a
    person he has now identified as his cousin Z  (dated  11th  June  2014,
    witness statement page 4).  Whilst Mr Bramble  submitted  that  he  had
    never identified his cousin by name until the provision of this witness
    statement in what is now the  second  set  of  proceedings,  I  do  not
    consider that to be a fair credibility point as no-one appears to  ever
    have asked the Appellant the  name  of  his  cousin.   However  I  have
    considered the evidence as a whole and in the light of the decision  of
    Tanveer Ahmed.  I find that the account given by the Appellant  is  not
    consistent with the account given in the  witness  statement  provided.
    The Appellant's account is that he was attacked by three men all on one
    motorcycle.  However the account given by the witness is  that  he  saw
    two motorcycles with two masked men with turbans on, on each motorcycle
    holding  pistols  in  their  hands.   Thus  the   evidence   given   is
    inconsistent as to the number of men who carried out the attack and the
    number of motorcycles involved in the incident.

69. The Appellant's claim in his evidence was that he did not stop to  look
    who it was yet he was able to state in his interview that they were the
    Taliban describing them as having "big beards  and  turbans".   In  his
    interview, when recounting the events  he  made  no  reference  to  his
    assailants being on motorcycles at all.  In interview at question  157,
    he was asked about his assailants and "Were they in  a  vehicle  too?".
    The Appellant stated "No".  He was asked in  cross-examination  why  he
    had not said that they were on a motorcycle.  He explained in his  oral
    evidence that when the interviewer said "vehicle" he understood  it  to
    mean a motor car.  Even if that were so, it is reasonable  for  him  to
    have identified how his assailants had travelled to the place in  which
    they intended to carry out the attack.  Whilst Mr Spurling submits that
    the fact that the witness's evidence is inconsistent with that  of  the
    Appellant and that that should not count against him on the basis  that
    witnesses  may  have  different  recollections  of   the   events   but
    necessarily  the  core  is  true,  I  do   not   consider   that   that
    satisfactorily explains what  is  an  important  inconsistency  in  the
    evidence concerning both the  number  of  people  responsible  and  the
    number of motorcycles involved.

70. The Appellant also gave an inconsistent account as to what happened  in
    that attack.  In his interview at question 154  he  was  asked  if  the
    attacker had said anything and he  responded  that  they  did  not  say
    anything.  However in his witness  statement  (see  paragraph  3  dated
    27/11/2014) he stated "They started  shooting  and  firing  at  me  and
    accused me of being a spy".  That is wholly inconsistent with the claim
    in his interview that on this attack the attackers had said nothing  to
    him.  If they had shouted at  him  accusing  him  of  being  a  spy,  I
    consider that he would have said so at the time he was interviewed when
    the events were clear in his mind.

71. After the second attack, the Appellant's account that on 9th March 2013
    he was buying fruit and the shopkeeper was inside the  shop  and  "they
    drove past on their motorcycles and started  shooting".   He  described
    two men wearing black clothes with their  faces  covered.   He  further
    described the incident as follows:-

         "They shot at me, one bullet grazed my right arm near my shoulder."
         (see paragraph 16; page 4 witness statement).

72. He described jumping into the drain which left the  shopkeeper  exposed
    and that the shopkeeper was injured having received two bullets in  the
    left leg.  He described a "random passerby"  taking  him  to  hospital.
    After treatment he stated "I remained there for a few hours.  They just
    gave me painkillers and put a bandage on  the  wound."  (paragraph  17;
    page 4 witness statement).

73. The Appellant has provided two documents in support  of  his  claim;  a
    letter from the doctor who it is said treated him at the  hospital  and
    the shopkeeper who witnessed the  incident.   I  have  considered  that
    evidence  with  care  but  find  that  it  is  inconsistent  with   the
    Appellant's account as to the events that he claimed occurred  on  that
    day.  The doctor's letter is on headed notepaper "Kabul City  Hospital"
    and is undated.  It is entitled "To whom it may concern" and states the
    following:-

         "This is a letter to confirm that Mr W A was treated in Kabul  City
         Hospital on 9th March 2013 for an injury to  his  left  arm.   This
         injury was sustained due to a  single  bullet  wound  resulting  in
         severe soft tissue damage.  The gunshot wound was a consequence  of
         an unprovoked brutal attack from the  Taliban,  in  an  attempt  to
         execute my patient Mr W A.  If you have any further queries, please
         feel free to contact me at any time on the details provided."

74. It is signed by Dr Javid Shahab described as a "Senior Consultant".

75. Whilst the refusal letter raises as an issue  of  credibility  that  an
    Internet search was made on all the hospitals in Kabul and it  did  not
    identify "Kabul Hospital" as one that existed in Kabul; this being  the
    name that the Appellant had initially given to the Secretary  of  State
    as the place he was treated, I do not place any weight on that point as
    a factor adverse to the Appellant.

76. However the description of the injuries received and the  site  of  the
    injury and the mechanism is wholly inconsistent with the evidence given
    by the Appellant.

77. As for the mechanism of the injury, the doctor's letter states that the
    injury was sustained due to a single bullet wound resulting  in  severe
    soft tissue damage.  However this description  of  the  injury  is  not
    consistent with the Appellant's account.  In his interview he was asked
    about his injury and specifically if the bullet entered  his  arm.   He
    was clear and stated that it did not  and  that  the  interview  record
    demonstrates that the Appellant showed the interviewer a "grazing  act"
    and later confirmed that his arm was bandaged.  The same  was  said  in
    his oral evidence.  I do not accept the description given by the doctor
    of a single bullet wound resulting in "severe soft tissue injury" to be
    consistent with a graze which required little or no treatment save  for
    painkillers and a bandage.  The doctor later describes it as a "gunshot
    wound" and that also in my judgment is inconsistent  with  the  account
    given by the Appellant as to the nature and mechanism  of  the  injury.
    Mr Spurling submits that there is in reality no inconsistency with  the
    Appellant referring to it as a graze and the doctor  referring  to  the
    same injury as a severe soft tissue injury and that whilst  the  doctor
    had described it in that way, it may not have been seen  as  severe  by
    this Appellant.  However I do not consider that properly  accounts  for
    the difference between the two descriptions.  Furthermore, this  letter
    has been before the First-tier Tribunal and there has been  no  attempt
    to either clarify that evidence or to  seek  further  evidence  of  the
    doctor notwithstanding its contents and that  the  letter  acknowledges
    that if there are any further queries or clarifications necessary,  the
    doctor would be able to answer such questions.

78. A further important inconsistency in my judgment is to the site of  the
    injury.  The Appellant in his witness statement at paragraph  16  (page
    4) identifies that the bullet grazed his "right arm near my  shoulder".
    The same evidence was given before the First-tier  Tribunal  (paragraph
    75).  However the letter from the doctor identifies  the  site  of  the
    injury as his left arm.  I do not believe that  if  the  Appellant  had
    sustained an injury to his person in that way that he  would  not  have
    been consistent as to where he had sustained such an injury.  Whilst in
    his oral evidence he stated it was his left arm, it  does  not  explain
    when giving his account  in  the  witness  statement  that  he  clearly
    identified it as happening to his right arm; a statement he accepted in
    his evidence not only before this Tribunal but also before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal as an accurate reflection of his account.

79. As to the statement from AS (see witness statement 6th December  2014),
    there has been no explanation as to why this  statement  has  not  been
    provided before.  I  find  the  contents  of  the  statement  are  also
    inconsistent  with  the  Appellant's  account   as   to   the   alleged
    perpetrators.  The witness describes seeing a  customer  lying  on  the
    shop floor and "a person who arrived  on  a  motorbike  fired  at  me".
    However in the Appellant's account there was more  than  one  assailant
    and gives a description in his witness statement of being a  number  of
    men driving past on "their motorcycles".

80. The Appellant did not make  any  reference  to  have  been  either  the
    subject of a physical attack or  being  shot  by  the  Taliban  in  his
    screening interview on 17th May 2014.  At question  4.1  he  was  asked
    about his reasons for coming to the UK and he gave an answer  that  his
    life was in danger and he fled to the UK. The interviewer  followed  up
    that question with "Why was it in danger?".  The Appellant  replied  "I
    received threats from the Taliban because I was  working  with  the  US
    Army".  He was then asked at 4.2  "Can  you  briefly  explain  why  you
    cannot return to your home country?".  He answered "I received a threat
    from the Taliban that I would be beheaded".

81. I have taken into account the explanation given by  the  Appellant  for
    there being no reference whatsoever to any  physical  injury  or  being
    shot at.  In his asylum interview at question 166, he was asked why  he
    did not mention the attack in the screening  interview.   He  explained
    "They said don't go into any detail but say why you are  scared".    At
    question 167 he  was  asked  "Were  you  scared  of  the  attack?"  the
    Appellant replied "Yes".  At question 168 he  was  asked  "So  why  not
    mention them before?".  The Appellant replied "I was  scared  but  they
    said don't mention everything".  In his witness  statement  at  page  2
    paragraph 7, he gave an explanation that he had tried to mention it  to
    the Interviewing Officer that he had been shot by the  Taliban  but  he
    was told not to go into details and that all relevant information  will
    be taken at the full interview.  He goes on to state "I did  mention  I
    had been shot but  they  did  not  write  that  down  anywhere  in  the
    screening interview".  In his oral evidence he stated that he was asked
    not to give all the details.

82. I do not accept that the Appellant has given a plausible explanation as
    to the failure to make reference to what was a central feature  of  his
    factual account namely having been physically injured or being shot  at
    on two separate occasions.  Whilst I would accept the  submission  made
    by Mr Spurling that a screening interview is not  intended  to  give  a
    full account of all events, that does not explain why, even if  he  was
    asked to provide brief details and keep his responses  short,  that  he
    did not mention the two attacks which really were the core of his claim
    to be at risk of harm.

83. Furthermore, I cannot accept his account that he did  mention  that  he
    had been shot but it had not been written down  anywhere  (see  written
    statement paragraph 7 at page 2).  If the Appellant had stated  to  the
    interviewer that he had been shot, I do not find that such an important
    detail would either have been inadvertently missed off  the  record  of
    interview or that the interviewer would not think it  important  enough
    to record.  This is the most serious incident to  support  his  account
    and I do  not  believe  that  the  interviewer  had  failed  to  record
    something like this which was of potential significance to his claim.

84. I further find that the Appellant  has  given  no  coherent  or  cogent
    account as to how the  Taliban,  who  had  targeted  him  in  his  home
    village, had located him in Kabul.  The chronology of events  was  that
    he had moved there in May 2010.   Even  on  his  own  account  the  two
    incidents took place in January and March  2013  (there  also  being  a
    letter sent in later on in  2013)  and  therefore  there  had  been  no
    interest in him for nearly three years after leaving his home  village.
    It was his own account that he had stopped work as  an  interpreter  in
    May 2010 having been asked to do so and that he did not  work  in  this
    capacity in Kabul (see paragraph 10 witness statement) as he could  not
    go anywhere openly as it was too dangerous to  look  for  interpreters'
    jobs (see witness statement paragraph 13).  In interview he  was  asked
    why the Taliban was still threatening him (question 190) and he replied
    "I don't know because I was working with the US Government".  When  the
    interviewer followed up with the question  as  to  why  they  would  be
    interested in him now, the Appellant could give no explanation  stating
    "I don't know".  Furthermore in cross-examination, he was  asked  about
    the communication threats to  his  family  who  remained  in  the  home
    village.  He said that the Taliban had called by telephone  asking  for
    his address.  However the Appellant has not properly explained how  the
    Taliban had tracked him down if they did not know his address and  were
    asking his family for it and why they would continue  to  do  so  three
    years after he  had  left  his  employment  which  is  what  they  have
    requested him to do.

85. I have also considered his account of what had happened to  members  of
    his extended family with whom he lived with in  Kabul.   He  was  asked
    about their position in cross-examination.  The first attack took place
    when living at his uncle's house therefore the Taliban would have known
    where he was living and knew in relation to the second attack  that  he
    lived at his aunt's.  In cross-examination he accepted  that  when  the
    second attack took place he was travelling from his aunt's  house  back
    to his uncle's house.  The aunt's home was one and a half  hours  drive
    to the other side of Kabul and he accepted  in  cross-examination  that
    the Taliban would have worked out that he  was  living  at  his  aunt's
    house to target him en route.  However neither his uncle  or  aunt  has
    been the subject of any threats or reprisals either at  the  time  when
    the Appellant was residing in Kabul or at any  time  thereafter.   When
    asked to explain why that should be so, the Appellant stated  that  his
    uncle was "very old" and that the Taliban "don't harm  ladies".   I  do
    not find that either of those are adequate explanations for the lack of
    interest shown in his close family members.  Whilst Mr Spurling submits
    that there is no objective material to demonstrate the  Taliban  target
    family  members,  that  is  not  supported  by  the  material  in   the
    Appellant's own bundle.  At page 33, the UNHCR Report  makes  reference
    to the targets of reprisals and civilians associated with or  perceived
    as supportive of the  ANSF  or  the  IMF.   It  makes  a  reference  to
    civilians, including children, who are reported to be targeted  on  the
    basis of suspicions that members of their families worked for the ANSF.
     At page 15 of the supplementary bundle there is an  article  referring
    to an interpreter whose family was killed by the Taliban near  Kandahar
    in which it is asserted that the Taliban had threatened to kill him and
    his family because he was an interpreter for the Canadian Forces.  Thus
    there is evidence that members of the Taliban do target family members.
     The Appellant's  fianc�  also  continues  to  live  in  Kabul  and  he
    confirmed in cross-examination that she had had no  interest  shown  in
    her by the Taliban.

86. As to his brother, it is claimed that he has  received  recent  threats
    and has gone into hiding.  There is no reference to such threats in his
    witness statement of 27th November 2014.   When  specifically  asked  a
    number of times as to when he went into hiding, he first  of  all  said
    that he had gone into hiding when he had left the country stating "When
    I left the country they went after my brother".  He was asked  when  he
    left Afghanistan and he stated  "September  2013".   When  asked,  when
    after September 2013 his brother went into hiding, he claimed  that  it
    was one month after leaving that the  Taliban  had  asked  his  brother
    about his address.  He was asked again when his brother decided  to  go
    into hiding and the Appellant's answer was that the Taliban had visited
    his house several times to ask for the address.  When pressed  to  give
    dates as to when his brother had gone into hiding, the Appellant stated
    "I did not have much communication with him; he keeps himself and lives
    with relatives' and friends' houses in the village". His account of his
    brother going into hiding was vague  and  in  his  evidence  failed  to
    answer questions as to  when  this  actually  occurred.  However  later
    evidence from the Appellant was that his brother was in Kabul and  that
    he had sent documentary evidence to him for the purposes of the  appeal
    hearing on 4th January 2015 and this was evidenced by the production by
    the Appellant of an envelope sent from his brother with an  address  in
    Kabul City Section C.  At this point the Appellant stated that  a  week
    ago he had been told that he was in hiding  there  but  when  asked  in
    cross-examination if he had told him when he  had  started  hiding  the
    Appellant stated "He didn't tell me".  The evidence he has produced  is
    that his brother had sent him documents from Kabul.  He  did  not  know
    the address and thought it might be a friend.  In  the  light  of  that
    evidence, I find that it is unlikely that he would go to  Kabul  if  he
    knew that that was a place where his brother was targeted.   From  that
    evidence, it appears that he  felt  sufficiently  safe  and  secure  to
    obtain statements and  further  documents  and  to  send  them  to  the
    Appellant and I do not accept that his brother is at a current risk  of
    harm in Kabul.

87. I have also considered the background country materials relating to the
    Appellant's claim.  It is plain from reading the evidence  as  a  whole
    that the UNHCR have identified  in  their  eligibility  guidelines  for
    assessing the international protection needs  of  asylum  seekers  from
    Afghanistan in 2013 as those who are individuals  associated  with,  or
    perceived as  supportive  of,  the  Government  and  the  international
    community, including the international  military  forces  and  in  that
    context those who work as interpreters for either  the  UK  of  the  US
    forces would fall into that category as civilians  associated  with  or
    perceived as supportive of the ANSF or  the  IMF.   There  is  evidence
    within the Appellant's supplementary bundle of  interpreters  in  their
    home areas being targeted by the Taliban as a result of their activity.
     It is accepted that the Appellant was targeted by the Taliban  in  his
    home area in Wardak Province, an area in which the Taliban  are  active
    and where the Appellant states the Taliban control most of the Province
    (paragraph 2 witness statement 27th November 2014).  However I have  to
    consider the materials relating to Kabul, and in  the  context  of  the
    Appellant's factual claim.  The evidence in the EASO Report  refers  to
    the position of cities and in particular Kabul.  It is recorded that  a
    political analyst based in Kabul  stated  "There  are  primary  targets
    (red/high risk), like interpreters, contractors and  suppliers  of  the
    military and high ranking Government  officials.   The  risk  for  mid-
    ranking Government officials is lower (yellow/orange).  There is a  low
    risk for the low  ranking  or  ordinary  Government  officials  in  for
    example Mazir or other areas in the north.   Only  when  travelling  in
    volatile areas in the south, southeast or east there is a risk for  the
    latter, as there is for  anyone,  ordinary  people  or  NGO  staff  for
    example.  Mid or low ranking profiles are not at risk in  Kabul,  Herat
    or Mazir, except if there was another specific reason for targeting".

88.  It is reported that Dr Giustozzi stated in 2011 that in cities  or  in
    Kabul, the Taliban usually devote their  efforts  at  attacking  higher
    profiles,  ranking  from  serving  Government  officials  upwards.   Dr
    Giustozzi stated that in Kabul, colonels in the  army  and  the  police
    have been targeted as well as commanders of security services, but that
    in the south, officials of all ranks were targeted.  The material  goes
    on to state "This point of view was shared by UNAMA that stated in 2012
    that high profile persons might be targeted in Kabul, but that  it  was
    not likely that the Taliban would make it a priority or would have  the
    capacity to track down low profile individuals in Kabul.  According  to
    the Danish Immigration  Service  the  UNHCR  also  confirm  that,  most
    probably, the Taliban would not make it a priority to  track  down  low
    profile people in Kabul.  Several other  organisations  interviewed  by
    the Danish Immigration Service, such as the  AIHRC,  the  International
    Organisation for Migration (IOM) and Co-operation for Peace  and  Unity
    (CPAU) agreed that it would most probably not be the Taliban's priority
    to track down low profile people in Kabul.   The  IMO  added  that  the
    security situation in Herat City and Mazir is similar to the  situation
    of Kabul.

89. The report at page 108 further goes on to state:-

         "The Danish Immigration Service  referred,  in  their  Fact-Finding
         Mission report of May  2012,  to  an  independent  policy  research
         organisation that stated that Afghans associated with  or  employed
         by the IMF do not run a  high  risk  of  being  targeted  if  their
         workplace is Kabul.   If  their  workplace  is  outside  of  Kabul,
         however there is a high risk for them regardless of the kind of job
         or position they have.  This includes contractors,  service  staff,
         drivers and interpreters.   The  Danish  Immigration  Service  also
         referred to  the  UNHCR  that  stated  that  all  Afghans  who  are
         associated with foreigners could be at risk in Kabul or other parts
         of the country.  However according to the UNHCR, the risk is higher
         outside Kabul.... Thus the conclusion of the EASO Report  was  that
         higher profiles face a real risk of being targeted by insurgents in
         all parts of Afghanistan including Kabul City but that in  general,
         low profiles do not  face  much  risk  of  being  targeted  by  the
         insurgents in the cities of Kabul, Mazir and Herat because of their
         position,  activity  or  job  as  such.   However,  individual  and
         specific circumstances might lead to an increased risk."

90. Further information in the bundle  make  reference  to  those  who  are
    either escaping threats, defecting or quitting activity and fleeing the
    area.  This would fit the profile of the Appellant who claims  to  have
    been threatened by the Taliban to cease his  work  as  an  interpreter,
    which he did, and left his home village to live in Kabul.  At page 110,
    it is cited  that  Dr  Giustozzi  explained  in  2011  that  Government
    collaborators were aware of the effective Taliban intelligence  systems
    and avoided Taliban controlled  areas.   He  further  stated  that  the
    Taliban have the ability to track down and target people who go to work
    and do not hide but Dr Giustozzi stated that:-

         "Those escapees who stop their collaboration  with  the  Government
         were a low priority for the Taliban in the cities or in  Kabul  and
         they have not been actively targeted any longer, neither have their
         relatives.  The Taliban did not seem to transfer information  about
         targeted individuals  from  one  area  to  another;  they  have  no
         databases.   There  could  be  a  request  for  information  on  an
         individual from one area to another if  needed,  depending  on  the
         Taliban's activities.  It is also recorded that the UNAMA sometimes
         brings its staff to Kabul when they are  facing  a  security  risk.
         According  to  the  Danish  Immigration  Service,  the  UNHCR  also
         confirmed that, most probably, it would be possible for low profile
         people fleeing a conflict with the Taliban in his area of origin to
         seek protection within his community in Kabul.  The  UNHCR  advised
         assessing this case by case."

91. Whilst at page 111, another political analyst in Kabul  considered  the
    risk to an interpreter if they quit their activity, who could escape if
    he joined the Taliban or contacted them and proved to them  he  was  no
    longer supporting the Government or the IMF, the  analyst  went  on  to
    state the risk is also confined to areas  in  the  easy  route  to  the
    Taliban such as rural areas.  He did not  identify  Kabul  as  such  an
    area.  Thus the summary at page 111 demonstrates that  those  who  quit
    their activity and moved to cities have not been  the  subject  of  any
    targets and that whilst the Taliban had the possibility to track people
    down who went to work, it was not a priority for them in cities such as
    Kabul.  The UNHCR confirmed that it would be possible for  low  profile
    people  to  escape  targeting  if  they  could  relocate  within  their
    community in Kabul.  It is plain from reading the article  as  a  whole
    that  whilst  the  individual  circumstances  of  a  particular  person
    determine whether the Taliban would target or threaten a  person  after
    he quit his job,  stopped  his  activities  or  defected,  examples  of
    circumstances which increased such a  risk  were  identified  as  there
    being either a feud with the Taliban  or  the  profile  of  the  victim
    working for the IMF or the  ANSF.   Neither  of  those  apply  to  this
    Appellant as it is not said he was in feud with the Taliban nor  is  he
    said to be working for the IMF  or  the  ANSF  in  Kabul  and  also  he
    remained there from May 2010 until almost three years later on his  own
    account with there being no interest in him by the Taliban.

92. The  Appellant  has  produced  an  extract  of  the  UNHCR  eligibility
    guidelines of August 2013 in  which  individuals  associated  with,  or
    perceived  as  supportive  of  the  Government  and  the  international
    community may be  at  risk  and  therefore  a  careful  examination  is
    required of those individuals.  At page 32, it is noted  that  in  2012
    the campaign of systematic targeting intensified with UNAMA documenting
    the deaths of 698 civilians and the wounding of 379 others in incidents
    of targeted killings or attempted targeted  killings.   The  first  six
    months of 2013 saw a further 29 increase in civilian  casualties  as  a
    result of such attacks compared to the same period in  2012,  with  312
    civilians killed and 131 injured.  Among the primary  targets  of  such
    attacks are national or local political leaders, Government  officials,
    teachers and other civil servants, off  duty  police  officers,  tribal
    elders, religious  leaders,  women  in  the  public  sphere,  civilians
    accused of spying for pro-Government  forces,  human  right  activists,
    humanitarian and development workers, construction workers and  persons
    supporting the peace process.  They have also reportedly threatened and
    attacked  Afghan  civilians  who  worked  for  the  IMF   as   drivers,
    interpreters or in other civilian capacities (page 33).

93. I have considered the Appellant's account of events  in  Kabul  in  the
    light of the documents that he has produced in support of those  events
    and in the light of the country materials.  I  do  not  find  that  the
    Appellant has given a credible or consistent account as to having  been
    the subject of two attacks in Kabul either in January or  in  March  of
    2013 for the reasons that I have given.  When considering  the  attacks
    in the context of the background country materials, whilst I  have  set
    out the evidence as to risks to interpreters in general, I do not  find
    that that evidence demonstrates that the Appellant has  demonstrated  a
    reasonable likelihood that he was specifically targeted when  he  lived
    in Kabul.  The evidence of Dr Giustozzi at page 112 of the  bundle  was
    that there was no reporting of targeting of those  who  flee  to  urban
    centres such as Kabul.  The  evidence  also  demonstrates  that  whilst
    there are possibilities of the Taliban tracking down those  individuals
    although no databases exist, it would not be a priority for them.   The
    factual  circumstances  of  the  account  also  demonstrate  that   the
    Appellant was not targeted by the Taliban in the way  that  he  claims.
    On his own account he left his  home  village  where  he  had  been  of
    interest to the Taliban by leaving his employment as an interpreter and
    leaving the area.  He did not receive any interest by the Taliban until
    some three years later.  He had been living in Kabul and had  not  been
    working as an interpreter nor had he sought any such work,  thus  there
    was no reason for the Taliban to have any interest in  him.   Therefore
    taking the evidence as a  whole,  I  do  not  find  that  it  has  been
    demonstrated that the Appellant has discharged the burden upon  him  to
    show that he was the target of the Taliban in  Kabul  during  the  time
    that he resided there.

94. Mr Spurling submits that even if the  Appellant's  account  as  to  the
    events in Kabul are not found to be credible that his past  profile  as
    an interpreter would now lead him to be at risk of harm in the light of
    the  recent  country  evidence.   I  have  therefore  considered   that
    submission in the light of the most recent material provided on  behalf
    of the Appellant in the supplementary bundle.  Since the Appellant  has
    left Afghanistan there have been two rounds of  presidential  elections
    amid serious security threats and nationwide security  responsibilities
    were transferred from NATO to an undertrained Afghan national  security
    force.  The election resulted in a National Unity Government  in  Kabul
    headed by President Ghani and  Abdullah  Abdullah  (his  runner-up)  as
    Chief Executive (see page  4:  A's  bundle).   There  still  remains  a
    violent insurgency (page 5) and the news reports make reference  to  an
    intensified Taliban  insurgency  coupled  with  daunting  economic  and
    political governance challenging Afghanistan in 2014.  The material  in
    the bundle make  reference  to  attacks  on  the  Taliban  upon  police
    officers in the Northern Afghan Province at a checkpoint (page  6)  and
    there is no dispute from that evidence  that  members  of  the  Taliban
    continue to undertake attacks in Afghanistan upon civilians.  The UNAMA
    reported that civilian casualties and  deaths  in  2014  had  increased
    (page 7) including a suicide bomb attack in a high  school  theatre  in
    Kabul in December 2014 (page 8) and  a  dozen  "high  profile"  attacks
    including suicide bombers in a foreign guest house  near  the  National
    Parliament and the killing of a South African aid worker.

95. The Appellant relies on specific news reports relating to interpreters.
     However  those  reports  do  not  demonstrate  that  the  Taliban  are
    searching and targeting interpreters who have left their home area  for
    large cities such as Kabul.  Nor does it  demonstrate  that  those  who
    returned to Kabul who were formerly interpreters are at risk.  At  page
    19 there is a reference to aid Afghan workers who were killed on  their
    way to work at an American Military Base (in  July  2013).   A  further
    article makes reference to the Taliban kidnapping four interpreters  in
    Khost Province but this is a report from 2010 and does  not  relate  to
    the circumstances of this  particular  Appellant  returning  to  Kabul.
    There is further reference at page 34 of an interpreter now  living  in
    Kunar Province having previously worked for the UK  forces  in  Helmand
    Province.  At page 39 of the bundle a BBC news article makes  reference
    to interpreters working with the US forces in Afghanistan being  hunted
    down by the Taliban.  A reference is given to a man  called  Nader  who
    lives an hour's drive north of  Kabul  in  hostile  territory  for  the
    Taliban.  He was found in his village but it is stated that as a result
    "he, like many other former interpreters remaining in Afghanistan,  now
    lives in Kabul".  Whilst he states that he is not safe  in  Kabul,  the
    article does not provide support for the Appellant's claim  that  as  a
    returning resident of Kabul that he would be at risk of harm solely  as
    a result of his previous employment.

96. It is plain from reading the UNHCR 2013 guidelines, (although there  is
    only  an  extract  in  the  Appellant's  bundle)  that  those  who  are
    associated with or perceived or supportive of  the  Government  or  the
    international community or forces may, depending  on  their  individual
    circumstances, be at risk  on  account  of  their  (imputed)  political
    opinion, particularly in areas where armed anti-Government  groups  are
    operating or have control.  However it is also  clear  that  not  every
    person with links  to  the  international  community  or  forces  would
    automatically be at risk in Afghanistan.

97.  Having considered the evidence before me,  I  do  not  find  that  the
    Appellant has given  a  consistent,  credible  account  concerning  the
    events he claims have taken place in Kabul for the reasons that I  have
    set out.  I therefore find that notwithstanding the  problems  that  he
    faced in his home area in 2009 and 2010, that in May 2010 until he left
    in September 2013, the Appellant was able to live in Kabul with members
    of his extended family without any interest being shown in him.

98. Furthermore, I do not consider that the country  materials  demonstrate
    that there is any risk identified to the Appellant from his profile  as
    a former interpreter now having relocated to  Kabul.   His  profile  is
    such that he would return to Kabul, a city where he  has  close  family
    members residing,  including  his  fianc�,  uncle  and  aunt  who  have
    remained there unharmed and unmolested by the  Taliban.   Even  if  his
    account is right that his brother has left his home village and is  now
    in Kabul, there is no credible or cogent evidence before  the  Tribunal
    that the Appellant would now be targeted by the Taliban  on  return  in
    the light of the findings of fact made that he had lived  there  for  a
    prolonged period prior to his departure in  September  2013;  a  period
    which postdated his work as an interpreter and indicates  that  he  has
    not demonstrated that he is at a reasonable likelihood of being at risk
    of harm upon return.

99. A further argument advanced on behalf of the Appellant is on the  basis
    that if the Appellant ceased employment from fear or as a result  of  a
    threat and would otherwise have continued to work  as  an  interpreter,
    then relocation is not an alternative to persecution  but  evidence  of
    it.   In  this  context  it  is  submitted  by  Mr  Spurling  that   in
    Afghanistan, his work as an interpreter for the military is  viewed  by
    the Taliban as evidence of  political  opinion  which  is  a  protected
    characteristic and therefore in essence, an interpreter who  is  unable
    to work in his chosen field because it would expose him to risk on  the
    basis of imputed political opinion, is entitled to the benefit of  what
    it described as the "HJ (Iran) - RT (Zimbabwe) principle".

100. In his oral submissions Mr Spurling did not seek to provide  any  legal
    authorities in support of that submission nor did he take the  Tribunal
    to any paragraphs of HJ (Iran) or RT (Zimbabwe) and made it plain  that
    he was not saying that work is necessarily a fundamental right but that
    if he is not able to undertake a job and is  prevented  from  doing  so
    through fear  then  that  is  a  sign  of  continuing  persecution  and
    therefore relocation cannot apply.

101. I have therefore considered the argument  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant which is in effect a reference to  the  modification  of  his
    behaviour and whether it is a  case  of  the  Appellant  modifying  his
    behaviour to be an interpreter to avoid persecution  and  whether  this
    gives rise  to  a  need  for  international  protection.   HJ  (Iran  v
    Secretary of State [2011] 1 AC 596 set out the approach the Tribunal is
    required  to  take  when  considering  circumstances  where   potential
    persecution may be avoided by the concealment or exercise of discretion
    as opposed or part of  internal  relocation.  In  the  decision  of  RT
    (Zimbabwe v Secretary  of  State  [2012]  UKSC  38  the  Supreme  Court
    considered whether an individual who has no political views and who did
    not support the persecutory regime in his home country can be  expected
    to lie and feign loyalty to that regime in order to avoid  persecution.
    The relevant paragraphs of the judgment for the purposes of this appeal
    are at paragraphs 47-52 and the distinction between core  and  marginal
    rights. The same point is made a paragraph 90 of HJ (Iran) and that for
    the purposes of  refugee  determination,  the  focus  must  be  on  the
    "minimum core entitlement conferred by the relevant right". Thus  where
    the risk of harmful action  is  only  on  the  margin  of  a  protected
    interest is prohibited, it is  not  logically  encompassed  within  the
    notion of "being persecuted."

102.  In this context I do not find that such modification, even if it  took
    place would result in a change  to  a  core  right  such  as  religion,
    sexuality or ethnicity (as set out in the Qualification Directive).  RT
    (Zimbabwe) applying HJ (Iran), to political rights made it  plain  that
    there was a right not to have to lie  about  an  absence  of  political
    rights and views as an example of political opinion.  However,  on  the
    facts of this appeal, the Appellant's wish to take up employment as  an
    interpreter does not involve the protection of  a  core  right  and  it
    cannot properly be  said  the  Appellant  has  lost  his  right  to  be
    gainfully employed.  Whilst he may wish to work as an interpreter, that
    does not prevent the Appellant undertaking gainful  employment  in  any
    other field in which he can use his experience in the English language.
      I  therefore  do  not  find  that  it  can  be  said  that  in  those
    circumstances relocation is not an alternative to persecution and  that
    on the facts of this case, the Appellant can return to  Kabul  to  live
    with his extended family members safely as he did previously.

103. The Qualification Regulations define  "refugee"  and  Immigration  Rule
    339C defines when a person will be granted  "humanitarian  protection".
    An Appellant is entitled to refugee status if  he  has  a  well-founded
    fear of being persecuted for reasons of  race,  religion,  nationality,
    political opinion or membership of  a  particular  social  group  on  a
    return to his or her home country.  If an Appellant does not qualify as
    a  refugee  then  he  will  be  granted  humanitarian   protection   if
    substantial grounds are being  shown  for  believing  that  the  person
    concerned, if he or she returned to his or her own country,  with other
    reasons a real risk of suffering serious harm.

104. As a result of the findings of fact set out  in  the  earlier  part  of
    this determination the Appellant does not qualify as a refugee  or  for
    humanitarian protection for the reasons given.

105. If an Appellant neither qualifies as a refugee  nor  has  been  granted
    humanitarian  protection,  it  would  then  be  relevant  that   either
    Appellant may also have a human rights claim if returned to their  home
    country would breach their  protected  human  rights  under  the  Human
    Rights Convention.

106. The Appellant relied on the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.   The  Appellant
    claims that she is fearful upon his return that he will be the  subject
    of serious harm.  Upon the material facts  of  the  matters  which  are
    those set out above and the background material before me and  for  the
    same reasons set out in relation to the refugee aspect of the appeal, I
    find that the Appellant has not shown that he will experience  torture,
    inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for the reasons claimed. I
    find that substantial grounds have not been shown  for  believing  that
    the Appellant would face a real risk of being  subjected  to  treatment
    contrary to Articles 2 and/or 3 (see Chahal v the UK [1997] 23EHRR  413
    and therefore this in respect of the appeal also fails.



Decision:

 1. The decision is remade as follows:

 2. The appeal is  dismissed  on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds.  The
    Appellant is not entitled to a grant of Humanitarian Protection.
