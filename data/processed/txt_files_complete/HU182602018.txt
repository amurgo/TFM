Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Hodson, instructed by Elder Rahimi Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of  Zimbabwe  born  in  1979.   She  appeals
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow promulgated on
    14 May 2019 dismissing her appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision
    dated 23 August 2018 refusing leave to remain as a spouse.

2.   In a decision promulgated on 15  October  2019,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Stephen Smith found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law  and
    he set aside the decision with  no  findings  of  fact  preserved.  The
    matter was listed to be re-heard in the Upper Tribunal to consider  the
    following points. Firstly, the question of whether  the  Appellant  and
    the  Sponsor  would  face  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
    continuing in  Zimbabwe  or,  in  the  alternative,  whether  it  would
    unjustifiably harsh  to  expect  the  Appellant  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom. Upper Tribunal Judge  Smith  directed  that  further  evidence
    should  be  served  fourteen  days  before  the  resumed  hearing.   In
    compliance with that direction, the Appellant  served  a  supplementary
    bundle.

3.   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in October 2000 with  entry
    clearance as a visitor valid until 15 April 2001. She has not had leave
    since then although she has made numerous attempts  to  obtain  student
    leave and, latterly, leave to remain as a spouse. It is the Appellant's
    case that her  husband  has  suffered  from  a  lifelong  condition  of
    obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD] such that there were insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.



Oral Evidence

4.   The Appellant gave evidence relying on her statements  dated  27  April
    2018, 11 March 2019 and her supplementary statement of 6 November 2019.
    She stated that her first language was Shona and  her  second  language
    was English, in which she was fluent.  She had a GCSE in English  which
    she obtained in Zimbabwe in 1992. She had never been asked to  take  an
    English language test in any of her applications she had  made  to  the
    Home Office.

5.   In cross-examination, she confirmed that she came to the UK in  October
    2000 and her visa expired in April 2001. She  married  ML  in  November
    2017 at a time when she did not have  leave  to  remain.  She  did  not
    discuss going back to Zimbabwe at the time  she  married  but  she  had
    discussed it since. She stated that if she was forced  to  go  back  to
    Zimbabwe it would be hard for ML to let her go without him and if  they
    were separated ML would want to follow her.

6.   The Appellant has relatives in Harare although her  mother  is  in  the
    UK. Her mother has visited her  half-sister  in  Zimbabwe  on  numerous
    occasions. Her half-sister lives with her husband and two children. Her
    half-sister works for UNESCO and her husband works for a bank. Although
    employment prospects were poor in Zimbabwe, they were fortunate  enough
    to be able to work and  the  children  had  not  started  school.   The
    Appellant was not in touch with anyone else in Harare,  although  there
    were other extended family members.

7.   If she had to go back to  Zimbabwe,  the  Appellant  said  her  husband
    would not accompany her because he works and has to stay in the UK.  He
    has OCD. At the moment he was working as a bus driver which was  better
    for him because he knows what he is doing.  Everything is set out in  a
    routine and he knows his hours in advance for several months ahead.  He
    previously worked as a taxi driver and in his mother's care home.

8.   ML gave evidence, relying on his witness statements of 24  April  2018,
    which was written by him with no assistance,  and  the  two  statements
    written with the help of solicitors dated 11 March 2019 and 6  November
    2019. ML stated that he had been working for Arriva North  Bus  Company
    since September 2019. His training had started on 29 July  and  he  had
    been paid �10.55 an hour which was increased to �10.90 an hour when  he
    qualified. His monthly income was 38 hours a week at �10.90  per  hour.
    This was the minimum amount he earned in a week because he  very  often
    worked more than 38 hours.

9.   He was asked about his mother's ill-health and he said that she  had  a
    problem with her lung and they were keeping an eye on it. She also  may
    have a procedure on her heart and all this was a bit worrying.  ML  did
    not want to leave his mother,  she  was  nearly  70  and  had  had  two
    illnesses come up in the last month. It was very worrying  for  ML  and
    his mother. She was going to have to close the care home which she  had
    been running for the last 25 years. She also worried about ML.  He  was
    worried about his mother's health.  ML stated that his mother supported
    him and he supported her.  He could not do this from  another  country.
    They would not be able to support each other if  he  lived  in  another
    country.

10.  ML was asked what he would do if  the  Appellant  had  to  go  back  to
    Zimbabwe. He said that his first option was to sponsor  an  application
    because he was working in the UK, but saying that and doing  that  were
    two different things. It was hard to do  the  job  he  was  doing  with
    everything here and what was going on. He was not  sure  how  he  would
    cope without the Appellant. It was a big responsibility driving  a  bus
    and hard to maintain concentration. It  would  be  made  worse  if  the
    Appellant was sent away. He did not know how he would be able to do his
    job safely. If the Appellant left  for  Zimbabwe  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance and ML could not meet the  financial  requirements  he  would
    have to move out to Zimbabwe and much as he loved his mother he  wanted
    to live with the Appellant. He could not see a happy ending  with  what
    he knew of Zimbabwe.

11.  ML was referred to his first statement in which he listed a  number  of
    concerns about living in Zimbabwe.  He confirmed that these were  still
    worries for him and that none of these matters  had  improved  and,  in
    fact, most were possibly worse. He had been looking  on  the  internet.
    He was the sort of person who was a chronic worrier living  in  the  UK
    and he was finally doing something now that he had met  the  Appellant.
    He stated that he was barely a success in England.  He  knew  he  'over
    worries' and he was lucky that he and the Appellant were in the UK.  He
    had provided a lot of the information on Zimbabwe in the  bundle  which
    he had found online. It was all saying the same thing. It was hard  not
    to worry. Even if he did not have an  anxiety  disorder,  he  would  be
    worried about relocating to Zimbabwe.

12.  In cross-examination, he stated that  he  had  always  lived  with  his
    mother and their home had been converted into a residential care  home.
    His mother had been well until recently save for ten years ago when she
    had had an irregular heartbeat. He was not caring  for  his  mother  as
    such but he was supporting her.  She now got out of  breath  and  could
    not walk very far and needed more support.

13.  In the past, ML's work had been very haphazard.  He  had  worked  as  a
    taxi driver but that did not suit him because it was very solitary  and
    he did not like being his own boss. He had done 'The Knowledge' four or
    five years ago and enjoyed driving. He had worked as a taxi driver  for
    two to three years after completing 'The Knowledge' in  2006.  He  then
    went through a rather bad period where he smoked weed  because  he  did
    not really know where he was going. He had tried to do radiography  but
    they had mixed up his DBS and so he could not do a  placement.  He  was
    told to wait a year. However, he made a very silly decision. He had met
    the Appellant at that time and he could make more money driving  a  cab
    than he could in radiography. He therefore went back to  working  as  a
    taxi driver.  He came to realise that it  did  not  suit  him  and  was
    pleased to have become a bus driver because this was something he could
    do. He had done online research and  was  worried  about  the  problems
    living in Zimbabwe as a white man and a British citizen.

14.  In re-examination, he stated that he had not  been  taking  medication,
    he had been offered it and looked into medication himself  but  it  was
    not a magic cure and there were side effects. He stated that  he  could
    end up with different problems than the ones he already had  and  since
    he was doing a driving job and was a meticulous  worrier,  he  did  not
    want to have an accident because he was  drowsy.   If  he  thought  the
    medication  would  cure  his  condition,  he  would  take  it  but  the
    medication would not significantly change his position.

15.  Dr Klemperer gave evidence and Mr Hodson submitted a  printout  of  the
    details on  her  website,  which  she  confirmed  were  up-to-date  and
    accurate. She had supplied five reports in this appeal  and  relied  on
    those as evidence-in-chief. She stated that ML's symptoms had got worse
    since she first met him in  April  2018.  ML  worried  about  making  a
    catastrophic  error  and  lived  in  fear  that  he  would  be   solely
    responsible. He therefore makes notes if he thinks he has made an error
    and this has been increasing over time depending on his  stress  level.
    She was asked whether there was a cure and she confirmed that  OCD  was
    very difficult to treat as ML had stated in his  evidence.   Medication
    could reduce the intensity of the compulsions and obsessions  but  they
    very rarely went away. Medication helped to reduce the level of stress,
    although intrusive thoughts still continued.

16.  Dr Klemperer  stated  that  living  in  Zimbabwe  would  be  incredibly
    worrying for ML.  This was one of the key things  of  anxiety  disorder
    and could increase his compulsions.   ML  was  managing  his  condition
    because he was able to drive and had obtained a job that he was able to
    do notwithstanding his disorder.  If he was not active,  then  his  OCD
    would severely impact on his life. Medication could reduce the level of
    stress but, in her opinion, the situation  in  Zimbabwe  would  be  too
    difficult for ML. He would not be living in the  house  he  had  always
    lived in with his mother and  his  OCD  would  become  so  severe  that
    medicine would have no impact and  be  inconsequential.   Further,  OCD
    sufferers feared using medicine because of the side  effects,  some  of
    which may disappear early on.  However, it was common to suffer a  lack
    of libido and there were other long-term side effects.

17.  ML was currently able to function in the UK because he had two  pillars
    of emotional support, his mother [RL] and  the  Appellant.  If  ML  was
    forced to choose between the two and lose one of his pillars of support
    his anxiety would increase and it was likely that he would  suffer  low
    mood and depression. He had gone through a similar  period  earlier  in
    his life where he had stayed in his room making obsessional notes.  His
    OCD had become unmanageable at that time. He was unable to sleep in his
    bed because it was covered with bin bags full of  notes.  Dr  Klemperer
    said it was likely  this  would  happen  again  if  his  stress  levels
    increased. He was  currently  able  to  drive,  but  if  the  Appellant
    returned to Zimbabwe, ML would be overwhelmed by his anxiety  disorders
    and it is likely he would be unable to function and go to work.

18.  ML is a man in his late 30s who has always lived  with  his  mother  in
    the same house.  He had no other relationships. He had had  friendships
    but none currently. His mother's health had been  good  until  recently
    and ML was  now  feeling  under  threat  which  fed  into  his  anxiety
    disorder. Leaving the UK was a considerable threat. If he had to go  to
    Zimbabwe it would be very difficult for him  to  leave  his  mother.  I
    asked if he would feel responsible if anything happened to  his  mother
    and Dr Klemperer stated that he was always in fear of  catastrophe  and
    the fear of losing his mother  would  have  a  detrimental  effect.  Dr
    Klemperer confirmed that the evidence that ML had given  to  the  court
    about his OCD was accurate. In her opinion he had not been dishonest or
    exaggerated his symptoms. His presentation was coherent and  consistent
    with other OCD sufferers and OCD was her specialisation.

19.  In cross-examination, Dr Klemperer stated she  had  first  seen  ML  in
    April 2018 when he had requested a report to submit in the  Appellant's
    immigration appeal. She had not obtained notes from  his  GP,  but  had
    sent a letter to his GP even though she had not referred to this in her
    report. She did not feel it necessary to see the GP notes  because  the
    Appellant had not received any treatment. She was  aware  that  he  had
    seen a psychiatrist but ML could not remember his  name.  She  did  not
    know if the GP notes disclosed the psychiatrist's name but since ML did
    not want to make too much of his difficulties, because of  his  driving
    job, it may well be that he did not want treatment so he did  not  want
    any psychiatric report to be shared with his GP.

20.  ML was currently storing notes which he put in bin bags. He  was  aware
    that it was irrational to do so as he would never be able to locate the
    relevant note in the future.  In 2004, he had felt so low that  he  had
    retreated to his room and made obsessional notes. He felt that his life
    was not going anywhere and did not know how to take it forward. His OCD
    then filled this space. Staying  in  employment  had  a  very  positive
    effect on ML's OCD.

21.  Dr Klemperer was asked if she would recommend  medication.  She  stated
    that medication is a personal decision for the  patient  and  with  the
    assistance of the doctor's opinion it was necessary to balance  benefit
    and side effects. One of the  difficulties  of  OCD  was  that  ML  was
    indecisive because of his fear of consequences and making mistakes.  ML
    found it difficult to make decisions and was in  fear  of  consequences
    that he had not allowed for and for which he would be responsible.  The
    potential threat of unpleasant side effects was enough to stop ML  from
    taking medication. She would have recommended medication  if  she  felt
    that ML's life was too constrained by his OCD. There were a variety  of
    medicines and it could well  be  appropriate  to  try  different  ones.
    However, medication was not a cure. She would be reluctant to recommend
    medication in Zimbabwe. In order to manage ML's condition, it would  be
    necessary to go over the recommended dosages and this would  require  a
    level of monitoring which was possible in the UK. She did not  know  if
    this was possible in Zimbabwe. Exceeding the stated doses would  be  an
    additional  worry  for  ML.  She  accepted  that  there  may  be   some
    speculation on his previous history, but it was unlikely that ML  would
    be able to cope in Zimbabwe with medication.  It  was  fairly  unlikely
    that the first line of treatment would have an impact on ML's OCD given
    his likely stress level if  he  went  to  live  in  Zimbabwe  with  the
    Appellant. Dr Klemperer could not compel ML to take medicine, but  even
    if he was willing, the first line of treatment was  not  sufficient  in
    his case.  The second line of treatment involved a  level  of  sedation
    such that he would not be able to work as a bus driver.  If  a  patient
    became so overwhelmed by stress then sedatives would  be  required.  It
    was difficult to reduce anxiety without being so sedated  that  it  was
    still safe to drive a bus ML would have to agree to sedation which  was
    likely to wipe away his livelihood. She had discussed  medication  with
    him and he was very wary of sedation. She would only consider it if  ML
    was on a break from driving. ML was scared of taking medicine and  this
    was very common given his OCD and his driving job.

22.  At the present time, ML's OCD was manageable and it did  not  interfere
    with his work.  When he was a taxi driver his OCD  did  interfere  with
    his work because he would pull over to make notes. He would also repeat
    journeys to make sure he had not made an  error.  This  was  consistent
    with his symptoms. His OCD did not interfere with his job at the moment
    because his job was a repetition of the same route  and  had  the  same
    structure to it, of which he was notified of in advance.  The  severity
    of ML's OCD waxed and waned and was sensitive to external pressures. At
    the moment, for example, ML's OCD  was  manageable  because  he  had  a
    structure to his job and was engaged in activities so that his life was
    not empty. Any extra stress caused by  separation  from  his  wife,  or
    worse separation from his home, was likely to result in a deterioration
    of his mental well-being. ML's OCD would become very severe and then it
    would be likely he would regress and it was difficult  to  do  anything
    other than stay in his room.

23.  Dr Klemperer did not know how common OCD was.  She stated that  it  may
    not be as common as depression or general anxiety disorder but that may
    be because it  remained  hidden,  as  sufferers  were  ashamed  of  the
    condition and generally did not ask for help.

24.  RL, ML's mother, gave evidence relying on her statements dated 8  March
    2019 and 2 November 2019. She had had  an  appointment  concerning  her
    heart and was on the waiting list for a procedure. It was  likely  they
    would freeze the four main vessels in her heart in order  to  stabilise
    her arrhythmia. It was possible she would have  to  wait  up  to  three
    months for the procedure.  She had been  offered  counselling  and  was
    able to change  her  mind.  There  were  some  risks  attached  to  the
    procedure but medical opinion was that the procedure would be  of  some
    help because her arrhythmia would get worse as she got older and it was
    better to have the procedure while she was younger. She did not know if
    she would be  hospitalised.  She  had  also  been  to  the  respiratory
    specialist who was fairly certain that the cysts in her lung  were  not
    malignant, but he could not rule out cancer and wished to  monitor  the
    growths. She had another scan in three months.

25.  RL stated that ML felt responsible for looking  after  her.  Her  other
    son was in a depressive state and all her family were in  Ireland.  Her
    late husband was an only child.  There were no relatives apart from her
    two sons CL and ML in the UK and she relied on ML more than CL. ML  was
    very preoccupied and worried by  the  Appellant's  immigration  appeal.
    The Appellant had been very calm and supportive to him and  to  RL.  RL
    had used the Appellant as a confident as she did not want to worry  ML.
    She had to contain the news about the possibility of  cancer  initially
    and had spoken to the  Appellant  about  it.  ML  would  find  it  very
    difficult in Zimbabwe. He was very caring at home and went through  all
    sorts of rituals at night, checking that the  windows  and  doors  were
    locked. ML would find it very distressing if he could not look after RL
    and she needed to support  her  other  son.  The  plans  to  close  the
    residential care home were going ahead. She had three residents and she
    was hoping to receive help until the  council  were  able  to  identify
    alternative places for her residents.

26.  In cross-examination, she stated that she relied on ML for  everything.
    He took her to hospital; helped her with the residents in the care home
    and with shopping; she discussed her worries with him and would  depend
    on him. He took her to hospital and to church. He did not need to  make
    her meals, but she did not  want  him  to  be  in  another  country  if
    anything happened to her. Her mother and aunt had died  suddenly.   She
    did not want ML to be in Zimbabwe  or  for  something  catastrophic  to
    happen to her without ML being there. She was frightened  that  it  had
    been very sudden for her mother and aunt and that the same would happen
    to her. She did not want ML to be at the other side  of  the  world  if
    that happened because he was the only person she could rely on. He  too
    would be devastated if he was not in the UK should anything  happen  to
    her.

27.  ML's OCD was quite troublesome. If he printed anything,  he  printed  a
    number of copies at a time, he would not accept copies with smudges  or
    marks and the printer had to be washed. There were endless  amounts  of
    cartridges and ink and there were rooms and a shed full of bin bags  of
    paper. The floor in his room was carpeted with paper and the  Appellant
    was very understanding. He had two cupboards full of bags of paper.  He
    was unable to answer the phone unless he wrote down what was said or to
    answer the door, so the Appellant and  RL  would  do  those  things  to
    prevent him having to write everything down.  ML  had  a  cold  at  the
    moment and did not want RL to get  it  so  he  did  not  disinfect  the
    kitchen, the Appellant did it. Everything had to be disinfected because
    ML did not want RL to catch his cold. He took things to the extreme. He
    had broken two door handles on the car because he checked them five  or
    six times every night before he came into the house after work. She had
    to check oxygen levels on one of her residents and she would  find  him
    writing down on paper what had happened in the day before  he  went  to
    bed.

28.  RL described her life caring for ML and setting up the  care  home.This
    was very distressing for her and she had gone to a  lot  of  effort  to
    support ML and provide for him while he was growing up. She had set  up
    a care home in 2003 and it was an 'all or nothing' job.  She could  not
    rest.  She believed she was given difficult residents because she was a
    trained nurse.  She currently had a  very  needy  wheelchair  user  who
    suffered from epilepsy and asthma.

29.  SK, the Appellant's mother, gave evidence relying on her  statement  of
    13 February 2019.  There was no cross-examination.



Submissions

30.  Mr Kotas submitted that the issue was straightforward and there was  no
    dispute on the facts. The Appellant had to  demonstrate  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in Zimbabwe. The threshold test was
    a high one and, although I had heard a lot of emotional  evidence,  the
    threshold was not met in this case.  The  Appellant  and  ML  would  be
    starting again as a couple and it would not cause very serious hardship
    should they relocate to  Zimbabwe.  The  Appellant  could  not  satisfy
    paragraph EX.1.

31.  If I found this to be the case then  it  would  be  harder  to  satisfy
    Article 8 because there would be no  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    and the precarious nature of the relationship formed by two adults late
    in the day meant that the Appellant's family life  could  not  outweigh
    the public interest. The principle in Chikwamba  was  not  material  in
    this case. The Appellant could not show that she satisfied all  of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules save for entry clearance and  the
    expert had in some  respect  speculated  in  relation  to  the  use  of
    medication and the effect of any lack of medication.

32.  Mr Hodson submitted that ML had a deep-seated  lifelong  condition  for
    which there was no cure and limited treatment. He had  the  support  of
    his mother who provided emotional security to enable him to function on
    a daily basis.  He also had productive work which suited him and he was
    managing his OCD. ML also supported  his  mother.  On  the  facts,  his
    family  life  with  his  mother  and  his  mental  wellbeing  would  be
    jeopardised if he went to Zimbabwe.

33.  Mr Hodson relied on his skeleton  argument  and  submitted  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles in this case and the Appellant  satisfied
    paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  In any  event,
    the consequences of a return to Zimbabwe would be unjustifiably  harsh.
    ML's mother should be included in the assessment of family life because
    there  were  more  than  normal  emotional  ties  in  this  case.   The
    Appellant's overstaying was outweighed by her family and  private  life
    in the UK. She had been here for nearly twenty years and, while she had
    remained without leave, she had not absconded and  the  Respondent  had
    not attempted to remove her.



Conclusions and reasons

34.  I found the Appellant, ML, RL and SK to be credible  witnesses  and  it
    was rightly conceded by Mr Kotas that  there  was  no  dispute  on  the
    facts. I attach significant weight to Dr Klemperer's evidence.  She  is
    clearly an expert in this field  and  her  opinion  was  based  on  the
    undisputed facts as disclosed by all  of  the  witnesses.  ML  had  not
    exaggerated his condition and Dr Klemperer's opinion  was  based  on  a
    consistent and coherent history of OCD. The Respondent did not  dispute
    that ML suffered from OCD.  The issue was  whether  ML's  OCD  and  his
    separation from his mother would give rise to insurmountable obstacles.



35.  On the totality of the evidence, I  find  that  ML  suffers  from  OCD,
    which is currently manageable because he has a secure job which in  his
    own words 'suits him'. He is able to manage his OCD because his job  as
    a bus driver involves repetition of the same route and a routine  which
    is notified to him well in advance,  therefore  minimising  any  stress
    caused by unknown  factors  or  consequences.  It  is  clear  from  the
    evidence that ML constantly  worries  about  the  consequences  of  his
    actions, is in permanent fear of  making  a  mistake  and  compulsively
    writes down what he had done during the day in order  to  minimise  the
    risk of making a mistake or feeling responsible for the consequences of
    any mistake. His condition is deep routed and he has suffered  with  it
    all of his life.

36.  ML has not taken medication for his condition  because  it  may  affect
    his ability to work. His condition means that he is reluctant  to  take
    medication because of the side effects and his fear that it will affect
    his diving. I find that it is unlikely that ML's OCD can be  controlled
    by medication in any  event.  ML's  condition  is  best  controlled  by
    productive activity. His employment as a bus  driver  has  had  a  very
    positive effect on him and he is able to  manage  his  OCD.  Medication
    would be detrimental to ML's ability to maintain suitable employment.

37.  RL gave very emotional evidence about how she  managed  ML's  condition
    as he was growing up and it is clear that this has led to a very  close
    bond between RL and ML. ML is also providing support  for  RL.  She  is
    currently  receiving  treatment  for  her   heart   and   having   some
    investigations into growths in her lungs. This is very worrying for her
    and ML. RL is closing the care home she has been running for 25  years.
    ML has lived with RL all his life. I find  that  there  are  more  than
    normal emotional ties between RL and ML such  that  family  life  still
    exists  between  them.  The  Appellant's  removal  to  Zimbabwe   would
    interfere with ML's family life with RL because it is likely  he  would
    go to Zimbabwe to be with the Appellant.

38.  I am persuaded by the opinion of Dr Klemperer that ML has  two  pillars
    of support, RL and the Appellant. It would  have  serious  consequences
    for ML's mental health and his ability to manage his OCD if he  had  to
    choose between the two of them. If he  remained  in  the  UK  with  his
    mother, the increased stress level of living without the  Appellant  is
    likely to exacerbate his OCD such that he may well lose his way, as  he
    has done in the past, to the point that he is  unable  to  go  out  and
    remains in his room. If that were the case then he would lose  his  job
    and his OCD  would  escalate  further.  I  accept  the  opinion  of  Dr
    Klemperer that ML's OCD fills the space in his life caused by  lack  of
    activity.

39.  The issue under the  Immigration  Rules  is  whether  family  life  can
    continue outside the UK. I am satisfied  that  the  high  threshold  of
    insurmountable obstacles has been met in this case.  The  situation  in
    Zimbabwe is such that it would be very difficult for the  Appellant  to
    obtain a job which he could maintain because he was able to manage  his
    OCD.  He has found it very difficult in the UK to find a job that  does
    not cause him too much stress so that his OCD becomes out  of  control.
    He has been working as a bus driver since July 2019  and  managing  his
    OCD. He would have very limited job prospects  in  Zimbabwe  given  the
    high rate of unemployment. He would not be able to stay at home if  the
    Appellant went out to work because this too would increase  his  stress
    levels and, as Dr Klemperer  opined,  his  OCD  would  fill  the  space
    created by his inactivity and his condition would worsen.

40.  I am satisfied, on all the evidence before me, that ML's OCD is  likely
    to worsen in Zimbabwe to the extent  that  his  family  life  with  the
    Appellant could not continue.  The Appellant has  shown  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK. She  has  satisfied
    paragraph EX.1 of the Immigration Rules.

41.  I find that the Appellant  satisfies  the  Immigration  Rules  and  her
    removal to  Zimbabwe  would  be  disproportionate.  Alternatively,  the
    Appellant's removal would result in  unduly  harsh  consequences,  such
    that the Appellant's, ML's and RL's family and  private  life  outweigh
    the Appellant's period of overstaying.

42.  Accordingly, I find that there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life continuing outside the UK.  The Appellant has satisfied  paragraph
    EX.1 of the Immigration Rules and the appeal is allowed on human rights
    grounds on that basis. The Appellant's  removal  to  Zimbabwe,  on  the
    particular facts of this case, would breach Article  8.   I  allow  the
    appeal.
