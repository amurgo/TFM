                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms C Bayati, Counsel, instructed by Polpitiya & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I have not made an order pursuant to Rule 14 of The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 restricting reporting in this case. It  does
    not involve issues of international protection and although  there  were
    arguments concerning the welfare of children these  did  not  raise  the
    kind of deeply personal or potentially embarrassing issues that I  think
    should be excluded from the public domain.

 2. As I explained when I gave directions on 10 July 2012, these  appellants
    are represented by the same solicitor and  their  appeals  raise  points
    arising from their contact with the Cambridge College  of  Learning.  In
    simple terms it is the respondent's case that the first three  appellant
    were involved in a scam and got caught.

 3. Stripped  of  the  necessary  legal  niceties,  it  is  essentially  the
    respondent's case that the first, second and third appellants  supported
    an application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant
    with a certificate from Cambridge College of Learning. This purported to
    be proof of success on a course entitled "Post Graduate Qualification in
    Business Management" but it was a false certificate handed  to  them  by
    the college without their doing any work. According  to  the  respondent
    the Cambridge College of Learning had never offered such  a  course  and
    the certificates were false documents raised to show that the appellants
    had attained a certain academic standard when they had  done  noting  of
    the kind.  The appellants did not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245Z(c) of HC 395 because they did not have a relevant qualification and
    the applications were refused,  additionally,  under  paragraph  322(1A)
    because the appellants had used a false document to  pretend  that  they
    were qualified.

 4. The fourth  and  fifth  appellants  are  the  dependants  of  the  third
    appellant.

 5. The first appellant appeals a decision dated  16  January  2009.  On  27
    January 2011 the Court of Appeal remitted his case to the Upper Tribunal
    to conduct a de novo hearing.

 6. Then second appellant appeals a decision  of  the  respondent  dated  22
    January 2009. In his case a decision of the First-tier Tribunal was  set
    aside by the Upper Tribunal after a hearing on  20  July  2011  and  was
    ordered to be re-made. The Tribunal's reasons for finding  an  error  of
    law are set out in an appendix to this decision.

 7. The third and fourth appellants are married to each other and the  fifth
    appellant is their daughter. On 9  January  2012  the  Court  of  Appeal
    remitted their cases to be heard by the Upper Tribunal at the same  time
    as it heard the appeal in the case of the second appellant.

 8.  The  third,  fourth  and  fifth  appellants  appeal  decisions  of  the
    respondent on 12 February 2009.

 9. The fourth appellant appellant's application was refused with  reference
    to paragraph 319C(b) of the HC 395 because she was not the partner of  a
    person being given leave to remain as a Tier 1  migrant  and  the  fifth
    appellant's application was refused because with reference to  paragraph
    319H(b) because she was not the child of such a person.

10. Where the respondent has chosen to rely on paragraph 322(1A) of  HC  395
    the respondent must prove that false documents have  been  submitted  in
    respect of the application. Otherwise the applicant must prove that  his
    or her circumstances satisfied the requirements of the  rules.  Although
    the appeals raise common issues, each appeal has been decided on its own
    merits. These appeals do not raise issues of  international  protection.
    The standard of proof is the  balance  of  probabilities.  Each  of  the
    appellants relies on article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights. Essentially this involves  a  balancing  exercise  where  proper
    purpose of maintaining immigration control has to be weighed against the
    interference with peoples' private and family lies inherent on  removal.
    The respondent must show that any interference is proportionate.

11. Although there are many papers in this case the  appellants'  solicitors
    have organised two bundles, the first comprising three volumes  and  the
    second a single supplementary bundle served close to the hearing.   Most
    of what I needed to read was within these bundles and it has assisted me
    considerably to  be  given  properly  prepared,  indexed  and  paginated
    bundles.

12. When I outline the evidence I do, in places, comment on the  quality  of
    that evidence and indicate my findings. I  confirm  that  I  reached  no
    conclusion without first considering the evidence as  a  whole  and  any
    contrary impression that anyone gets because, for example, of the  order
    in which I consider points, is wrong. This is not an empty, formal self-
    direction. I have, for example, made comments on the  challenge  to  the
    reliability of the evidence of Ms Ullah near to  the  beginning  of  the
    decision because I consider it the best way of  explaining  my  decision
    but I certainly did not  begin  my  analysis  of  facts  by  make  those
    findings.

13. It is, I think, uncontroversial to say that  the  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning came to an undistinguished end. Certainly in the summer of 2008
    the United  Kingdom  Border  Agency  was  concerned  by  the  number  of
    applications received from  people  seeking  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrants  who  supported  their
    applications with certificates from the Cambridge College  of  Learning.
    The Border Agency satisfied itself that the supporting certificates were
    false documents issued  to  misrepresent  the  bearer's  qualifications.
    These concerns eventually resulted in a  test  case  coming  before  the
    Tribunal in June 2009.  Three Senior Immigration  Judges  (Storey,  P  R
    Lane and Pinkerton) sat  on  the  case  and  were  assisted  by  Mr  Ian
    Macdonald QC for the appellants and Mr G Clarke, counsel, instructed  by
    Treasury Solicitors for the respondent.

14. The decision was  reported  as  NA  and  Others  (Cambridge  College  of
    Learning) Pakistan [2009] UKAIT 00031 and the head note of that decision
    is in the following terms:

         "Cambridge College of Learning  (CCoL)  never  ran  a  postgraduate
         diploma in business management course or a postgraduate diploma  on
         IT course. Accordingly for a person applying for  leave  to  remain
         under a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Scheme to rely on a certificate of
         an award of such a diploma following the course will  amount  to  a
         false representation and so will fall foul of paragraph 322(1A)  of
         the Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules   HC  395.   Such  a
         person will also be unable to meet the requirements  of  para  245Z
         because he or she could never have undertaken such a course."

15. Unsurprisingly  that  decision  did  not  end  litigation  arising  from
    alleged students of the Cambridge  College  of  Learning  and  two  more
    decisions of the Tribunal were reported.  In Khan  and  Tabassum  (CCoL:
    postgraduate certificate) Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00249 (IAC)  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Senior Immigration Judge P R Lane) said in the head note:

         "(1) those who assert they were awarded  postgraduate  certificates
         in business management (and IT) by Cambridge College  of  Learning,
         after completing relevant courses they will have  to  surmount  the
         important and obvious problem that, if  such   certificate  courses
         had been run and examined by  CCoL,  and  certificates  awarded  to
         successful candidates, the  witnesses  who  gave  evidence  to  the
         Tribunal in NA and Others (Cambridge College of Learning)  Pakistan
         [2009] UKIAT 00031 and who were found credible, would have said so.
          There was no credible evidence before the  AIT  in  that  case  to
         suggest that any postgraduate courses in business management or  IT
         were taught or examined  by  CCoL.  It  follows  that,  whilst  the
         evidence in each case must be individually assessed, NA and  Others
         is indicative of there being no such thing as  a  genuinely  issued
         CCoL postgraduate certificate in those subjects and it is therefore
         necessary for a claimant seeking to rely on such a  certificate  to
         adduce cogent evidence in support.

         (2) For the correct way to approach the use of the determination in
         NA and Others, see paragraphs 32 to  40  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
         determination in TR (CCoL cases) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 33 (IAC)."

16. In TR (CCoL cases) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 33 (IAC)  the  Tribunal  (Senior
    Immigration Judge Storey, Senior Immigration Judge Perkins) said:

         "(1) Just because findings of fact made by the  Tribunal  in  their
         reported case are not binding does not mean that Immigration Judges
         are free to take account or not to take account of such findings at
         will: (a) the determination may contain an account of the record of
         evidence; (b) the Tribunal may have made findings of  fact  and  if
         these relate to  the  same  factual  matrix  then  they  should  be
         followed unless there  is  good  reason  to  revisit  them:  see  A
         (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 1040.

         (2)  Cases in which the Secretary of State alleges that a  claimant
         falls foul of para 320(1A) of Statement of Changes  in  Immigration
         Rules HC 395 as  amended,  it  will  be  important  to  follow  the
         guidance given by the Court of Appeal in AA (Nigeria)  [2009]  EWCA
         Civ  773  that  knowing  deception  is   needed   to   show   false
         representations.

         (3)  Given the nature and extent  of  the  evidence  found  by  the
         Tribunal in NA and Others (Cambridge College of Learning)  Pakistan
         [2009] UKAIT 00033 to point overwhelmingly  to  a  conclusion  that
         CCoL never ran any postgraduate diploma in business  management  or
         in IT, a claimant who relies solely on documents specific to his or
         her own (claimed) studies in order to maintain the contrary must be
         scrutinised closely."

17. I note, too,  that  the  appellants  asked  for  disclosure  of  certain
    documents in the possession of the Secretary of State.   Eventually  the
    Secretary of State refused  saying disclosure could not be made  without
    an order of the  court and by letter dated 4 August 2010  the  clerk  to
    the First-tier Tribunal wrote  to  the  appellants'  solicitors  on  the
    instructions of Senior Immigration Judge Pinkerton.  The letter said:

         "One of the reasons for reporting NA and Others was for that appeal
         to be a lead case in relation to all  other  Cambridge  College  of
         Learning appeals.  It was a lengthy hearing in which  the  evidence
         was considered in detail and facts were found.   If  any  challenge
         has been made to the reported decision it has not been  successful.
         The findings therefore stand.  You requested disclosure of  various
         items in your letter of 22 April 2010 but  it  is  noted  that  all
         those items were referred  and  considered  in  NA.   There  is  no
         justification for directing disclosure as you  have  requested  and
         the appeal should proceed to a full hearing on 12 August 2010."

18. I was not asked to order any disclosure and I have no  reason  to  think
    that the appellants have been improperly deprived of evidence that might
    have assisted them.

Respondent's Case

19. The respondent wishes to rely on  the  evidence  and  comments  on  that
    evidence in the case of NA.  One of the reasons  for  finding  that  the
    respondent had proved that there never was a postgraduate  qualification
    in  business  management  was  the  evidence  of  Saamia   Ullah.    The
    appellant's solicitors had found a "LinkedIn" profile page of  Ms  Ullah
    in which she appeared to say things that were contrary to things said to
    the Tribunal in NA. As is widely  understood  at  the  time  of  writing
    "LinkedIn" is  a  form  of  internet  based  social  media  favoured  by
    professional people in  which,  typically,  they  outline  their  career
    histories. A letter was sent to her professional address inviting her to
    attend the appeal hearing and to contact the solicitors.  There  was  no
    response to that request.  The Tribunal was asked  to  issue  a  witness
    summons and the application was put before me. I  declined  to  issue  a
    witness summons. The appellants wanted the summons but they did not know
    what the witness was going to say.  They did not want to call her but to
    cross examine her. If the respondent did  not  want  to  call  her  then
    getting her to the hearing  centre  would  not  have  achieved  anything
    useful. The appellants had raised their concerns with the respondent and
    if the respondent chose not to call the  witness  the  appellants  could
    make submissions based on their contentions and the respondent's failure
    to respond.

20. Before me Mr Tarlow confirmed that he did not wish to call Ms Ullah  and
    was not asking for a witness summons.

21. When I came to decide the case I did  not  find  the  challenges  to  Ms
    Ullah's evidence arising from alleged subsequent inconsistent statements
    to be damaging. The appellants' proved Ms Ullah's LinkedIn profile  page
    by a statement from the appellants' solicitors and, in  the  absence  of
    any contrary evidence, I am quite satisfied that the summary produced is
    how Ms Ullah seeks to identify herself on LinkedIn.

22. At paragraph 23 of the decision in NA it is recorded that:

         "Ms Ullah said that she has been employed at CCOL, originally on  a
         part-time basis, since January  2006,  becoming  Head  of  Business
         Management from January 2007 until the college closed."

23. This contrasts with the LinkedIn entry which says that she was  head  of
    business and management at Cambridge College of  Learning  from  January
    2005 until December 2008. I cannot reconcile these two things.   If  she
    started working in January 2005 as claimed on LinkedIn she was wrong  to
    say that she was employed from January 2006 unless she first worked  for
    the college in a self-employed capacity.  If she became head of business
    management from January 2007 she was wrong to say on her  LinkedIn  page
    that she was  head  of  business  management  from  January  2005  until
    December 2008.

24. Again, according to paragraph 23 in NA Ms Ullah had said:

         "I am certain that no  courses  were  and  have  been  running  for
         postgraduate diplomas  of  any  type  at  [CCOL],  nor  are  we  an
         organisation that can award such a qualification".

25. Superficially this does contrast rather with a  claim  on  the  LinkedIn
    page to have delivered lectures for fifteen business modules  "to  Post-
    Graduate and Graduate students". However, Ms Ullah does not identify any
    postgraduate  course  that  she  taught  at  the  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning. I find the use of language interesting.  When Ms  Ullah  wrote
    about her work at the Cecos  London  College  from  January  2004  until
    December 2004, she said expressly that she was "delivering lectures  for
    postgraduate and graduate level business studies students".   Similarly,
    when she was talking  about  her  work  as  the  head  of  business  and
    management at 360 GSP College from January 2009 to December 2009 she was
    "delivering  lectures  at  postgraduate  and  graduate  levels  for  the
    Association of Business Executives".    However,  under  the  entry  for
    Cambridge College  she  refers  to:  "Delivering  lectures  for  fifteen
    business modules  (both  taught  and  researched)  to  postgraduate  and
    graduate students."

26. I do not think this is coincidence.  Ms Ullah is an educated person  who
    can be expected to express herself carefully and accurately. I find that
    she is telling the truth and is contrasting her work  at  the  Cambridge
    College of Learning where some of her students were graduates  with  her
    work at other institutions where she did teach post-graduate course.  It
    may be that she is presenting her history in the most  favourable  light
    but she did not actually claim  to  have  taught  a  postgraduate  level
    course at Cambridge College of Learning. I do not accept that  there  is
    any conflict established between her evidence in NA and  her  claims  in
    LinkedIn on that point.

27. Ms Ullah claims in her LinkedIn page that she was involved in:

         "initiating and maintaining productive contact with the Home Office
         - UK, educational consultants and awarding bodies such as  Edexcel,
         ABE, BAC and universities across Europe to support intelligence  on
         educational   and   curricular   standard   applicable    to    our
         institutions".

28. This is a vague phrase.  The reference to  "initiating  and  maintaining
    productive contact with the Home Office"  could  describe  her  role  in
    exposing some of the failings of the college in NA (Cambridge  College).
    She  does  not  actually  claim  to  have  been  involved   in   college
    communications with the Home Office.  She  may  have  been  involved  in
    initiating contact with the  Home  Office  to  support  intelligence  on
    educational and curricular standards.

29. It is regrettable that she did not  respond  to  the  queries  from  the
    appellants' solicitors. It is also regrettable that the Home Office were
    not more anxious to  assist  the  Tribunal  by  engaging  with  her  and
    possibly calling her as a witness. They did not and  I  find  that  read
    carefully the evidence in LinkedIn is not so very much at variance  with
    the evidence in NA as the appellant suggested.  Indeed  other  than  the
    inconsistencies over dates, which I find to be inconsequential, I do not
    accept any inconsistencies have actually been established.

30. In NA and Others the Tribunal  received  and  analysed  oral  and  other
    evidence from people associated with the college and that evidence,  and
    the Tribunal's findings about that evidence, is  relevant  to  the  case
    before me.  It was  never  the  respondent's  case  that  the  Cambridge
    College of Learning was a bogus college per se.   It  appeared  to  have
    operated legitimately at least until the second half of  2008  and  even
    after that date it continued to run and arrange  genuine  courses.   The
    respondent's concerns were about the claims  that  the  college  offered
    postgraduate diploma courses, particularly  in  business  management  or
    information technology.  The Tribunal set out in  summary  much  of  the
    oral evidence it received on behalf of the Secretary  of  Safe.   It  is
    plain that it found the evidence credible.

31. Two of the witnesses were officials from UKBA.   Their  evidence  showed
    that students at Cambridge College of Learning were expected to have  an
    identity card and were expected to have  a  four  figure  identification
    number.

32. Very detailed evidence was taken from Mr  Muhammad  Faisal  Munir  Malik
    and Miss Saamia Ullah.  Mr Malik was essentially an IT trainer.  He said
    that he knew Ms Ullah as a person who had run business  studies  courses
    at the college.  He was not aware of the  college  having  a  "board  of
    examiners".  It was rare for students not to have an identity card  name
    and he was only familiar with four digit student identity numbers.

33. It was Ms Ullah's evidence that she was  "The  head  of  department  for
    business and management within CCoL. In performance  in  this  role  she
    managed the Entire Association of Business Executives (ABE) Department".
     She had heard rumours about postgraduate diplomas from CCoL being  sold
    outside the campus and stated:

         "I am certain that no  courses  were  and  have  been  running  for
         postgraduate diplomas  of  any  type  at  [CCoL],  nor  are  we  an
         organisation that can award such a qualification".

34. She worked at the college between 9.30 am and  5.00  pm  on  Wednesdays,
    Thursday and Fridays.  She had started work in January 2006 and remained
    at the college until it closed.   She  had  not  seen  any  postgraduate
    diploma courses at all, or heard of them being taught, or seen  students
    purporting to follow them or met any staff members purporting  to  teach
    them.   She was confident that a postgraduate diploma course in business
    management from the Cambridge College of Learning did not exist. She did
    not think it possible for the college to  have  offered  a  postgraduate
    course leading to a diploma  from  the  Cambridge  College  of  Learning
    without her knowledge.

35. She was asked to explain why her name was not  on  the  current  college
    website list of college staff.  She was not able to explain  that.   She
    said she was sure her name was there in early December 2008 because  she
    remembered  showing  it  to  a  police  officer   in   the   course   of
    investigations.

36. According to paragraph 27 of the determination in NA:

         "Ms  Ullah  said  that  she  had  nothing  to   do   with   college
         communications with the Home  Office:  reception  and  the  college
         administration did that".

37. Without in any way suggesting that the decision in NA was wrong  on  the
    evidence before the Tribunal that decided  it,  the  present  appellants
    insist that the Cambridge College of Learning did provide a postgraduate
    diploma course in business management and they studied that  course.   I
    have set out the above summary of the relevant evidence in the  case  of
    NA as it helps identify the issues that I will be expected to resolve.

38. I consider now the oral evidence which is before me.

Appellants' Evidence

First Appellant

39. The first appellant, Charith  Wijesunderara  Weerathna,  gave  evidence.
    He had made a statement dated 23 September 2011.

40. There he said that he was a graduate of the  University  of  Colombo  in
    Sri Lanka with a degree of Bachelor of Arts (Honours)  in  international
    relations.  He also studied law at the Law  College  of  Sri  Lanka  and
    enrolled as an internee in law in Sri Lanka.

41. He entered the United Kingdom as a student  on  18  January  2007.   His
    wife accompanied him and their son was born in the United Kingdom on  28
    May 2008.

42. He claimed to have been awarded the degree of  postgraduate  diploma  in
    business  management  by  the  Cambridge  College  of  Learning   having
    completed his studies in August 2008.  He set out the procedural history
    of his case.

43. He said that before coming to the United Kingdom  he  had  worked  as  a
    marketing executive with a firm  in  Colombo.  He  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom to study for a designee Master of Laws at Cecos College.

44. When he attended a familiarisation course he was told  that  the  course
    he wanted to study was not running because not enough people had applied
    to join it.  He was disappointed.  His employers in Sri Lanka  told  him
    to follow a management course and so in September 2007 he applied to the
    Cambridge College of Learning to  undertake  a  postgraduate  course  in
    business management.

45. He said he had to pay a course fee of �3,400.  He  paid  by  instalments
    and was never given an identity  card.   He  said  how  the  course  was
    assessed and how he was examined.  He did not submit work in  his  first
    term because his wife was pregnant and needed his support.

46. He said there were about 25 to  30  students  following  the  course  of
    studies. He particularly remembered the  second  and  third  appellants.
    They became friendly because they  were  from  Sri  Lanka  with  similar
    backgrounds.  He regarded it as  a  serious  matter  to  be  accused  of
    producing false documents to support an application  for  permission  to
    stay in the United Kingdom.  It is something that could impact adversely
    on his future employment and he did not want to return to Sri Lanka with
    these immigration issues unresolved.

47. In answer to questions in cross-examination  he  repeated  some  of  his
    history in coming to the United Kingdom. He confirmed that he  had  only
    kept one copy of one of the eight assignments that he had completed.  He
    had no copies of lecture notes. The course was completed in 2008 and  he
    "probably binned everything". He identified two lecturers on the course,
    Mr Opoku and Miss Mulikat Omolara  Ojulari.   He  understood  that  Miss
    Mulikat Omolara Ojulari had returned to Nigeria and that  Mr  Opuko  had
    been approached by solicitors but would not speak to them.

48. He expressed his disapproval of the standard of  the  course.   He  said
    the lecture notes were not worth keeping.

Second Appellant

49. The second  appellant,  Mr  Anuruddha  Ratnaweera,  gave  evidence.   He
    adopted statements made on 7 March 2010, 14 April 2010, 13 July 2011 and
    3 October 2011.

50. In his statement of 7 March 2010 he identified himself  as  the  husband
    of Mrs M P Nishamali K C Ratnaweera and the father of  Kulanya  who  was
    born on 2 September 2002.  The  family  lived  together  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

51. He arrived in the United Kingdom  in  February  2003  to  pursue  higher
    studies.  His wife and daughter joined him in February  2004.   He  said
    that since arriving in the United Kingdom he had been a genuine and full-
    time student mostly in the field  of  information  technology.   He  had
    completed  an  MSc  in  September  2007  awarded  by  the  International
    University of America.  Lectures were held  at  the  London  College  of
    Business.  He wanted to gain more knowledge  of  information  technology
    and enrolled at the London College of Business to study for  the  degree
    Master of Philosophy which he hoped he could convert into the degree  of
    Doctor of Philosophy.  He  found  the  course  too  demanding  and  with
    commendable frankness said he "found  it  difficult  to  cope  with  the
    workload".

52. He gave up on that course and enrolled with  the  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning for a postgraduate diploma  in  business  management.   He  was
    admitted to the college on the basis of his previous qualifications.

53. His course fees were �3,400.  He paid �500 but was not  issued  with  an
    identity card until he paid the course fees in full.  He  explained  how
    the course comprised eight modules.

54. He said that his daughter was only 1� years old  when  he  came  to  the
    United Kingdom and had lived for a further six years and  so  had  spent
    most of her life in the country.  She was doing well at  school  and  he
    did not want her disturbed.

55. In his statement of 14 April 2010 he gave more details about  his  links
    with Cambridge College.

56. He said the college gave him a four  digit  identification  number.  The
    number of the certificate is an eleven digit number. It began  with  the
    number 8 (the certificate was issued in October 2008) and  was  followed
    by his date of birth and the four digit  student  number.   He  did  not
    bother with an identity card.  He understood he could not have one until
    he had paid all the fees and by the time he paid all  the  fees  he  saw
    little point. He described the facilities of the college and the  layout
    and the rooms and identified Mr John  Opoku  and  Miss  Mulikat  Omolara
    Ojulari as tutors.  He said he had eight modules to complete.

57. He did not know Miss Saamia Ullah. He had no contact at all with her  at
    the college. Neither did he know Mr  Muhammad  Faisal  Malik.   When  he
    changed course from a M Phil  postgraduate  diploma  he  told  the  Home
    Office  by  letter  of  his  intentions  and  reasons.   He  relied   on
    information on the website that the college was a recognised  body.   He
    did not have  any  receipts  about  his  payment.   He  said  they  were
    misplaced during the time that he moved house.  He  paid  cash  for  his
    final payment as it was close to his final examination.

58. His further statement of 13 July 2011 was in response to  directions  of
    Senior Immigration Judge Storey given on 10 July 2011.

59. He said that on 25 January 2008 he downloaded the Cambridge  College  of
    Learning website article  on  the  Post  Graduate  Diploma  in  Business
    Management course. He printed it on normal white A4 paper so it would be
    almost impossible to distinguish the original from subsequent copies. He
    was unable to find the original downloaded document. He said that he had
    to inform UKBA of his change of studies and that his wife downloaded the
    document.

60. His final statement was dated 3 October 2011.  There he  identified  the
    first appellant  as  a  fellow  student  at  the  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning.  They came to  know  each  other  because  they  attended  the
    Cambridge College of Learning. He had downloaded the website article  on
    25 January 2008 about the Post Graduate Diploma in  Business  Management
    and had given copies to the first and third appellants.  He said how  he
    had already provided to the Tribunal the work sheet for the  first  four
    subjects taught.

61. He was cross-examined.

62. He confirmed he had come to the United Kingdom first  in  February  2003
    as a student intending to study a Masters degree in computer science but
    his command of the English language was not good enough for the course.

63. He did the  course  in  computer  science  at  the  Central  College  of
    Professional Studies which he completed in 2005. He  confirmed  that  on
    that course past papers were  available  and  made  notes.   The  course
    included feedback and timetables.   He  said  that  the  course  at  the
    Cambridge College of Learning cost �3,400 and he paid a �500 deposit for
    which he had no receipt.

64. He did not have an  identity  card  at  his  time  at  the  college.  He
    believed the college kept records because a register of sorts was  taken
    at the start of the session.  He  identified  Mr  John  Opoku  and  Miss
    Mulikat Omolara Ojulari as the course tutors.

65. He confirmed that the course that he said he took at  Cambridge  College
    was his fifth course in the United Kingdom and the standard of  teaching
    was not the same as the other courses he had experienced. He gave rather
    hesitant evidence about the examinations and said  there  were  no  past
    papers available but tutors discussed  past  questions.   He  was  shown
    documents in the bundle purporting to come  from  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning which he confirmed were provided by the college.

66. He was asked if he was aware that it was possible to change text on  the
    website from the observer's computer but he did not think that it was. I
    note at this point that  Mr  Tarlow  asserted  that  such  changes  were
    possible. I would not be surprised if that was correct  but  I  have  no
    evidence before  me  to  substantiate  the  assertion  and  no  personal
    knowledge, still less judicial knowledge, to support the claim.  I  have
    made by decision on the basis that such changes cannot be made.

67. The document at page 38 was a course handout but it  did  not  bear  any
    identifying marks linking it to the Cambridge College of  Learning.   He
    said it was given by tutors.

68. In summary, he was shown documents  that  purported  to  come  from  the
    college and he said they did come from the college.

69. In re-examination he confirmed that although they were not given  formal
    mock examinations he had answered practice questions in tutorials.

Third Appellant

70. The third appellant, Mr Nishantha  Siyambalapitiya,  gave  evidence.  In
    fact he was the first witness to give  evidence  but  nothing  turns  on
    that.

71. He adopted a statement dated 18 May 2010.  There he  explained  that  he
    is the husband of the fourth appellant  and  the  father  of  the  fifth
    appellant who was born on 11 October 2002.   He  and  his  wife  have  a
    second daughter, Vinushi Kumari Siyambalapitiva,  born  on  26  November
    2008.

72. He said that he came to the United Kingdom on  19  February  2004  as  a
    student and his wife and daughter joined him in December of that year.

73. He said that he was a  genuine  student.    He  had  previously  studied
    human resource and management technology and had done a  human  resource
    management course at the University of Luton in 2004.   He  completed  a
    postgraduate diploma in information technology in June 2006 and a Master
    of Science in information technology at the International University  of
    America in August 2007.  He applied to study for a  PhD  in  information
    technology at the London College of Business. The degree would have been
    awarded by the International University of America.  The course was  due
    to begin in October 2007 and last until September 2010.  He was given  a
    student visa extension to study until the end of December 2008  but  the
    course was more than he could  manage at that time in his  life  and  he
    decided to "study a business course where I can gain business exposure".

74. He said that in October 2007 he joined Cambridge College of Learning  to
    gain a qualification in postgraduate diploma in business management.  He
    said  he  was  admitted  to  that  course  because   of   his   previous
    qualifications and he handed  over  the  application  for  his  previous
    education qualifications to  the  college  reception  at  the  start  of
    October 2007.  He was offered a place within a few days to study a  Post
    Graduate Diploma in Business Management.   He  accepted  the  offer  and
    started the course on 15 October 2007.  He missed the two week induction
    that had taken place immediately before that.





75.

76.

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

82.

83. The course fee was �3,000.  He paid �1,000  deposit.   He  asked  for  a
    college identity card and was told he would not have that until the full
    course fee was paid.  He  paid  the  remaining  balance  in  instalments
    during the two terms and  the  final  payment  soon  before  taking  the
    examination.  He had not asked for an identity card.  His  interest  was
    getting a qualification in business management.  He saw no need  for  an
    identity card.  He  used  his  passport  to  identify  himself  when  he
    presented himself for examinations.





84.

85.

86.

87. He said  the  business  management  course  was  assessed  by  means  of
    examinations and  assignments.   He  studied  four  subjects  per  term,
    totalling eight subjects for two terms. Each subject was assessed by one
    examination one assignment.  The  examinations  were  conducted  by  the
    college in the classroom invigilated by lecturers.

88. He completed eight assignments in his course of study.   He  had  copies
    of seven of the assignments having misplaced one.  He also He

89. did informal assessments which did not account  for  the  final  result.
    Those documents have been lost.

90. The first term went from October  2007  to  February  2008  and  he  sat
    examinations in January 2008 in subjects including  financial  appraisal
    of proposed  projects,  making  information  decisions,  developing  the
    executive management and strategic management.  The second term was from
    March 2008 to September 2008. He sat  examinations  in  July  2008.  The
    subjects were "critical thinking and  research  skills  in  management",
    "improving marketing strategies", "leading change in organisations"  and
    "leading project implementation".

91. During the same period he completed assignments  entitled  (a)  "Analyse
    [sic] of current strategies of Amzone.com" (b) "How the  market  can  be
    segmented  in  terms  of  improving  the  marketing  strategies  of  the
    organisation  to  patina  its  final  objectives"  (c)  "Implementing  a
    constructive project on luxury apparent complex", (d)  "Critical  review
    of  organisation  and  its  information  system";  (e)   "Analysing   of
    organisational change programme in health industry"; (f) "How to improve
    executive management performances in relation to executive team approach
    and review of eldership modules".

92. According to the statement, all assignments were discussed  individually
    after they had been marked. The results were  given  in  the  class  and
    posted on a notice board.

93. The classrooms were fitted with tables and chairs and could  accommodate
    25 to 30 students.  He attended lectures  on  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays  and
    Thursday and the teaching was between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm.  The modules
    were taught in the form of lectures and some group discussion.

94. He described the college as a two floor building  with  a  basement  and
    ground floor.  There were six or seven rooms in the basement which  were
    mostly classrooms. Depending on room availability  he  had  lectures  in
    several class rooms but mainly in the basement. The grounds had some six
    or seven rooms and they comprised the principal's office and  the  staff
    room, library and a study room.

95. He said he accessed the  course  syllabus,  curriculum  and  the  course
    outline on line via the college website.  The course reading lists  were
    given during the lectures and the course timetables  were  displayed  on
    the notice board.

96. He said there were about ten academic and  non-academic  staff  in  all.
    He particularly identified Mr John Opoku and a Miss Mulikat  Ojulari  as
    the two lecturers who  taught  his  course  modules.   There  were  also
    visiting lecturers who delivered subject modules.

97. He said the lecturers gave out course hand outs  and  narratives  during
    the lectures to aid the case studies.

98. Mr  John  Opoku  taught  him  developing  executive  management,  making
    information decisions,  strategic  management  and  improving  marketing
    strategies.  Miss  Mulikat  Ojulari  taught  him   leading   change   in
    organisation, critical  thinking  and  research  skills  management  and
    leading project implementation.  The visiting lecturers taught financial
    appraisal, proposed capital projects and others.  Some  of  the  modules
    were taught by either Mr Opoku or Miss Mulikat.

99. He also made a statement dated  3  October  2011  supporting  the  first
    appellant.

100. There he said that he was a fellow student of the  first  appellant  at
    the Cambridge College of Learning. They did not know each  other  before
    attending the Cambridge College but  became  friendly  as  a  result  of
    meeting at the college. He  said  the  "Cambridge  College  of  Learning
    Qualification Hand Out For Post  Graduate  (level  7)  Certificate"  was
    handed over to all the students in our "client"  who  was  in  the  same
    class.

101.  He  said  that  the  two  of  them  and  a  third  friend,   Anuruddha
    Rathnaweera, (the second appellant), applied for post-study  work  visas
    after completing the above course. All the applications were refused for
    the same reasons that they had submitted false documents.  They appealed
    together and to some extent prepared their cases together.

102. He insisted that he did study for a postgraduate  diploma  in  business
    management at Cambridge College of Learning  and  that  even  after  the
    Cambridge College of Learning was  closed  the  details  were  on  their
    website On 31 March 2009 he downloaded from  the  Cambridge  College  of
    Learning website staff details.

103. He said he  had  already  provided  the  Immigration  Tribunal  with  a
    worksheet for the first four subjects taught during the  first  term  as
    part of the strategic management module describing  the  human  resource
    strategy.  He confirmed the documents were given to him  and  the  other
    students in class.

104. He said after his application for a  visa  as  a  post-study  work  was
    refused  his  solicitors  wrote  to  the  Department   for   Innovation,
    University and Skills asking about the status of the  Cambridge  College
    of Learning and was told that it had been included by order of a  listed
    body but was suspended on 4 December 2008.

105. The  bundle  included  additional  papers  supporting  the  appellants'
    cases.

106. In the case of the third appellant there was a letter purportedly  from
    the Cambridge College of Learning  containing  a  multi-digited  student
    reference and identifying the appellant by date of birth and  confirming
    that he was studying for a postgraduate diploma in business  management.
    The letter appears to come from the Cambridge College of Learning but it
    is only in the form of a photocopy,  albeit  overprinted  with  a  stamp
    bearing the name Cambridge College of Learning, and an  address  but  no
    envelope or printed stationery that may have made it more  difficult  to
    obtain.

107. In similar form there is  a  transcript  of  academic  record  dated  8
    September  2008  showing  the  appellant's  marks  in  eight   different
    subjects.  He scored between 57% and 64%.

108. The postgraduate diploma in business management  allegedly  awarded  by
    the Cambridge College of Learning also appears in the bundle.

109. There is also what  purports  to  be  a  printout  from  the  Cambridge
    College of Learning website. The date is shown as 31 March 2009  and  Mr
    John Opoku and Miss Mulikat Omolara Ojulari are identified as members of
    the college staff.  Mr Malik's name appears but Ms Ullah's does not.

110. There is a bundle marked "Qualification Handout" said  to  be  for  the
    postgraduate certificate or diploma  in  business  management  which  is
    identified as a level 7 course.  Behind that  and  separately  there  is
    what appears to be a syllabus or possibly a course outline describing it
    as a level 6 course. The document is entitled "Developing the  Executive
    Manager".

111. There is also a  later  unit  called  "Strategic  Management  of  Human
    Resources" said to be at level 7.   There  is  what  purports  to  be  a
    printout from the Cambridge College of Learning website which refers  to
    a list of available courses  including  a  postgraduate  certificate  in
    business management.   It bears the copyright mark "2007" but  I  cannot
    tell from examining it if that was when the background page was  created
    or whether every item on that page was supposed to have been part of the
    2007 copyright.  The printout before me which is in  photocopy  form  is
    dated 25 January 2008.  It too shows  a  copyright  mark  for  2007  and
    appears to have been printed on 29 January 2008.

112. There is  a  page  from  the  Cambridge  College  of  Learning  website
    referring to a postgraduate diploma in business  management  identifying
    Cambridge College of Learning as the awarding body and there is a scheme
     of work at postgraduate level 7 qualification  in  business  management
    (the certificate/diploma) setting out in considerable  detail  the  work
    required and topics covered.  However I can see nothing on that document
    which links it to the Cambridge College of Learning.

113. The third appellant adopted his statements before  me  and  was  cross-
    examined.

114. He confirmed he had come to the United Kingdom intending to  study  and
    said that he did make his own notes and lectures. He said  that  he  had
    attended courses before he went to the Cambridge College.

115. He accepted that he had accumulated a lot of  paperwork  and  notes  by
    the time he had finished studying  for  his  MSc.   He  applied  to  the
    Cambridge College of Learning in September or October 2007.  He paid the
    fees in instalments by  cash.  He  attended  the  college  on  Tuesdays,
    Wednesdays and Thursdays and sometimes on Friday.

116. He identified Miss Mulikat Omolara Ojulari and Mr  Opoku  as  lecturers
    and said the assignments were intended to be  between  2,000  and  3,000
    words long. He said they were given feedback  individually  but  not  in
    writing on a sheet.  The college compared adversely with other  colleges
    he had experienced.

117. The papers that he said were from  the  course  appear  in  the  bundle
    starting at page 142 and handwritten notes start from  page  209.     He
    said the manuscript writing identified was his own.  HHe  did  not  have
    identity card. He could not have one until he had paid all his fees.

Fourth Appellant

118. The fourth appellant, Dr Prapha Kumari Sivambalapitiya, gave  evidence.
    She adopted her statement of 16 May 2012.

119. Here she identifies herself as the wife  of  the  third  appellant  and
    mother of two  children  Vidarshi  Kumari  Sivambalapitiya  born  on  11
    November 2002 and Vinushi Kumari  Sivambalapitiya  born  on  26  October
    2008.  It follows the children are now nearly 12 and nearly 6  years  of
    age.

120. She arrived in the United Kingdom in  December  2004  with  the  eldest
    daughter who was then aged 2. The youngest  daughter  was  born  in  the
    United Kingdom. She described hers as a "very happy family".

121. The fourth appellant was qualified as a  medical  practitioner  in  Sri
    Lanka but resigned her work as a doctor in government  service  to  join
    her husband, the first appellant, in the United Kingdom.

122. She said she would  not  be  able  to  rejoin  the  Sri  Lankan  health
    service.  It was Sri Lankan government policy that it would not employ a
    person who had been absent for five years or more.

123. She was currently working as a medical notes summariser for  a  medical
    practice  in  Cambridgeshire.   She  said   how   the   daughters   were
    particularly well settled and integrated in their new life in the United
    Kingdom. The eldest daughter was studying at school and the younger  one
    was at pre-school.  The children only spoke the English language and had
    close friends.  The elder girl was particularly keen on the school choir
    but was involved with other activities as well her studies.

124. She said that having to leave  the  United  Kingdom  would  make  their
    lives "very chaotic" and suggested it would have a "huge negative impact
    on our lives".  She was worried about how  her  daughters  would  manage
    because their only experience of education was in  British  culture  and
    they only spoke the English language.  In oral evidence she particularly
    drew my attention to the reports of Diana Jackson on the family.

125. In answer to questions from Mr Tarlow she confirmed that  she  had  not
    been able to pass the exams necessary to practice as a medical  "doctor"
    in the United Kingdom.

Other Evidence

126.  Mrs  Sudeepa  Ruwanmalil  Sunnadeniyage  gave  evidence  adopting  her
    statement of 23 September 2011.

127. There she identified herself as the wife of the first  appellant.   She
    entered the United Kingdom as the dependant  of  a  student  in  January
    2007.  Their son was born in the United Kingdom on 20 May 2008 and so is
    now 6 years old.

128. Her son is settled at school and was studying in the  English  language
    and could not converse in any other language.

129. She is also concerned about his immunisation  courses  being  completed
    although with the passage of time it would appear that  they  have  been
    completed satisfactorily and nothing turns on that.

130. As an illustration of the way they were settled in  the  community  she
    said they regularly attended Elim Pentecostal  Church  in  Nuneaton  and
    take part in church activities there.

131. She confirmed that her husband was  an  honest  person  and  could  not
    believe that he would ever submit false documents for the course.

132. She relied on Diana Jackson's report on her family.

133. She was not cross-examined.

134. Manamendra Patabadige Nishamali Krishathi  Chamindika  Ratnaweera  gave
    evidence. She adopted her statement of  17  May  2012.   She  identified
    herself as the wife of the second appellant.  They married in Sri  Lanka
    in 2001 and have one daughter here, Samali Kulanya Ratnaweera,  who  was
    born on 2 September 2002 and so is now just over 12 years old.

135. She explained that she worked in Sri  Lanka  as  a  medical  laboratory
    technician. Her husband arrived in the United Kingdom in  February  2003
    and she and her daughter joined him in February 2004.

136. She had been gainfully employed in the United  Kingdom,  first  working
    for BP and from April 2010 for a company in Watford.

137. She explained how  her  daughter  started  nursery  in  2005  and  then
    school.  She was a good  student  who  enjoyed  her  studies  and  extra
    curricular activities.  She threw  herself  into  school  life  and  was
    involved in the gardening club, violin lessons, chess club, drawing  and
    swimming. She described her as accustomed to the British  way  of  life.
    She only spoke the English language and all  her  friends  were  in  the
    United Kingdom.

138. She worried about how she would adapt in  the  event  of  return.   She
    could not resume her  career  in  Sri  Lanka  because  she  was  out  of
    practice.

139. She too relied on the report from Diane Jackson and she was not  cross-
    examined.

Diane Jackson's Report

140. In the case of each of the appellants  I  have  an  independent  social
    worker's report dated September  2014  prepared  by  Diane  Jackson  who
    identifies herself as an independent social  worker.   The  report  says
    that her curriculum vitae is appended but in fact it was not appended in
    the bundle but an abbreviated curriculum  vitae  dated  August  2014  is
    before me.

141. Miss Jackson's qualifications include a Bachelor's degree in  sociology
    and psychology awarded in 1972 and a diploma in applied social work  and
    certificate of qualification  in  social  work  awarded  at  Goldsmith's
    College University of London in 1975.  She has worked as a social worker
    for the City of Westminster, the London Borough of Brent, and the London
    Borough of Hackney and as a guardian ad litem panel member for Worcester
    County Council. I have no reason to think she is anything other  than  a
    competent qualified expert witness  who  has  expressed  truthfully  her
    opinions and findings about the families she has considered.

142. The wife and son of the first appellant are dependent  on  the  outcome
    of his appeal.  The son Navida Wijesunara Weearathna, was born on 28 May
    2008.  There are similarities  in  the  report.  This  is  unsurprising.
    Again without being in any way unappreciative of Miss Jackson's efforts,
    nothing that she says about the impact that  removal  would  have  on  a
    child who had spent all his life, or at least all the time that  he  can
    remember, in the United Kingdom surprises me.

143. The first appellant and his family  are  nominally  Christian  and  are
    involved in an Elim Pentecostal Church.  The  first  appellant's  family
    are Buddhist although the first appellant  was  baptised  "a  couple  of
    years ago". The first appellant's parents live in Milan  in  Italy.  His
    father had had to leave Sri Lanka because of  his  political  activities
    and Navida is particularly close to his grandfather.

144. I stress I have read the whole report but I find a quotation  from  the
    family pastor, Pastor Michael Brown, incorporated in the  report  to  be
    particularly illuminating and I set out below part of it.  Pastor  Brown
    said:-

         "Navida is there every Sunday, of  course,  with  his  parents  and
         attends  the  Kingdom  Kids  Sunday  School  class  where  he  also
         socialises with the other attendees.  He is popular with the  older
         folk, in particular.  Navida was  born  in  the  UK  and  has  been
         brought up here  in  our  country.   English  is  the  language  he
         communicates, both in church the other kids and at school, although
         he is picking up a little Sinhalese at home.  So in many  important
         ways, his culture, world view, understanding of life and so on, are
         British.  Sri Lanka is an unknown country for him. For  him  to  be
         extricated from school and forced to repatriate at this stage after
         so many years would be a huge upheaval,  not  simply  a  matter  of
         adjusting.  It would take several years to  adjust  culturally  and
         linguistically as well as educationally.  He would also be uprooted
         painfully from all he has known in his young life,  he  would  lose
         all his friends, and this, as well as the culture  shock  he  would
         undergo if they did return to Sri Lanka, would have a  tremendously
         negative emotional impact upon him."

145. Pastor Brown does not claim any particular expertise  in  dealing  with
    young people and does to explain why he believes it would be a matter of
    "several years" before Navida could adjust but I understand his concerns
    about a young person who has  grown  up  in  the  United  Kingdom  being
    removed to a country with which he has no connections.

146. At paragraph 4.3.2 of the report it is noted that the  first  appellant
    and Navida's mother are concerned at how he  would  cope  in  Sri  Lanka
    because he is not bilingual.  They said he  understands  "about  60%  of
    Sinhala and he does not speak it and when  they  ask  him  something  in
    Sinhala he replies in English.  When [the first  appellant's  mother-in-
    law] communicates by Skype, Navida does not understand that."

147. Ms  Jackson  indicates  that  Navida  has  special  needs  and  I  have
    considered the speech and  language  therapy  department  of  the  South
    Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust initial scans summary  on  Navida.   I
    find that his parents are appropriately concerned about his welfare. The
    report does not support a finding that  Navida  has  significant  speech
    difficulties although the fact that Navida hears Sinhala and English  at
    home shows that he has some contact with the language.

148. In the case of the family of the  second  appellant  Ms  Jackson  noted
    that their daughter, Samali Kulanya Ratnaweera, was  born  in  September
    2002 and so is now 12 years old.  The second  appellant  said  that  his
    mother and sister lived in Sri Lanka. His father and brother-in-law  had
    died in the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004.  Samali had passed her  11  plus
    examination in September 2013 and obtained a place at her  first  choice
    of secondly school.  The second appellant was particularly worried about
    how she would cope.  The family could not  afford  to  send  her  to  an
    international school in Sri Lanka and she could not communicate or  read
    and write in Sinhalese.  Clearly she  is  a  bright  young  woman.   The
    school speaks well of her particularly her ability  in  maths.   I  have
    seen a copy of a letter she sent to the Prime  Minister  expressing  her
    concern about poor conditions for animals kept in marine  parks  in  the
    United State of America. It is not quite  clear  what  she  expects  the
    Prime Minister to do about such things but I accept the sincerity of her
    concern and regard the letter as the work of a confident and aware young
    person who wants to make her mark on the world.

149. A letter from her head teacher is not only very enthusiastic about  her
    personal character and attitude to learning  but  refers  to  her  "huge
    amount of potential for continuing to achieve at very high levels".

150. Miss Jackson is concerned that Samali is of an age when she might  feel
    anger towards her parents in the event of her  having  to  remove.   The
    report says at paragraph 5.4.1:

         "I have written above about the practical difficulties Samali would
         encounter, i.e. her lack of spoken and especially  written  Sinhala
         combined with what I understand is a very different  education  and
         social system.  In my view the major  problem  in  removal  to  Sri
         Lanka would be a matter of Samali being able to adjust to the  loss
         of all that is familiar to her, i.e. her school, her  friends,  her
         teachers, the responsibilities she is beginning to take on and  the
         opportunities to develop herself and her  talents  outside  school.
         The letter from Rachel Kirk [head teacher] indicates a young person
         who has seized the opportunities available in the  United  Kingdom.
         It is my opinion that if Samali is removed to Sri Lanka, her  sense
         of loss will make it impossible for her to regain her footing in  a
         completely different, and to her, an alien environment."

151. In the cases of the third, fourth  appellants  Ms  Jackson  noted  that
    there are two daughters of that family; the fifth appellant who was born
    in November 2002 and the other born in October 2008.

152. I have read all of the information in the reports. I  note  that  there
    is some evidence of community integration on behalf  of  Siyambalapitiya
    family and I have read all nine chapters of "The Golden  Purse"  by  the
    fifth appellant.

153. I do not mean in any way to diminish the achievements of the family  or
    the importance of the evidence by summarising it  as  an  example  of  a
    nuclear family where the children are supported and encouraged  to  take
    part in the life of the school.  Without detracting from other things, I
    set out below parts of the letter from Dr C Marshall, the  head  teacher
    of Wheatfields Primary School.  Dr Marshall says:

         "Vidarshi, in particular, is at a crucial point in  her  education.
         She joined Wheatfields Primary School in her Reception year and has
         therefore spent her entire primary education at the school. She is,
         now, at the point of transfer to St  Ivo  Secondary  School  in  St
         Ives.  Any move to disrupt her education, would, in my opinion,  be
         extremely damaging both socially, emotionally and academically.

         Vidarshi is, in all respects, a model  pupil  at  school.   She  is
         absolutely committed  to  her  learning  and  receives  outstanding
         support from her family.  As a result, she  will  eave  Wheatfields
         attaining standards that are significantly beyond what is  normally
         expected of children at the end of year 6.   This  illustrates  the
         extent to which Vidarshi and her family are fully  integrated  into
         this country's education system, as well as their determination  to
         succeed.  Moreover, Vidarshi is a popular and happy child,  with  a
         wide and secure friendship group.  I have no doubt whatsoever  that
         when Vidarshi moves on to St Ivo School she will continue to  excel
         in all aspects of her learning.  She is a credit to both the school
         and her family.

         Vinushi, too, has settled very well into  the  first  year  of  her
         primary school career at Wheatfields and again, any suggestion that
         her education could be disrupted would be extremely concerning.

         Both children are fully integrated into all aspects of school, life
         and I am sure that this is also the case for them out of school."

154. Dr Marshall did not explain why it would be extremely  damaging  and  I
    do not know if Dr Marshall has any personal knowledge of  the  education
    system in Sri Lanka.  However, the point is that the children  are  well
    settled in the United Kingdom and removing them is  disruptive  is  well
    made and is something that I must bear in mind.

Argument

155. Miss Bayati produced a skeleton argument.  It  points  out,  correctly,
    that I must decide if the Secretary of State has shown on a  balance  of
    probabilities that the first three appellants have used false  documents
    in support of there Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant  applications.   In
    the case of the first, second and third appellants the respondent's case
    could hardly be simpler.  They each supported their application  with  a
    postgraduate diploma in business management from the  Cambridge  College
    of Learning which, the respondent says, was a false certificate  because
    the Cambridge College of Learning never offered such a course.

156. Miss Bayati contended that contrary to the findings  in  MA  there  was
    now evidence  before  the  Tribunal  to  show  there  was  a  legitimate
    postgraduate  qualification  in  business  management  offered  by   the
    Cambridge College of Learning at the material time  and  that  therefore
    the appellants' case is capable of being true and in fact is  true.  She
    argued, correctly, that I must have regard to evidence not available  to
    the AIT in NA and although its findings are a necessary  starting  point
    they do not necessarily indicate how I should decide the case.

157. The evidence of  Ms  Ullah  is  important.   She  appeared  before  the
    Tribunal in NA in answer to a witness summons  and  was  called  by  the
    Secretary of State. She was cross-examined by leading  Counsel  in  what
    was known be a test case.  She insisted that she  was  in  post  at  the
    material time and that no postgraduate course  in  business  management,
    which was her area of particular expertise, was taught at  the  college.
    That remains important evidence and it as not  been  undermined  by  the
    alleged inconsistencies in the LinkedIn page.

158. As explained above when I considered  the  evidence  the  only  clearly
    established inconsistency is in a date about when she started work and I
    can see no basis on which that could be thought material.

159. I accept that there is evidence provided by  the  appellants  appearing
    to show that  details  about  the  post  graduate  course  were  on  the
    Cambridge College of Learning website on 25 January 2008.  As  correctly
    set out in the skeleton argument, the page of the  website  provides  an
    overview of the diploma, details of the modules covered,  the  level  of
    qualification, mode of study (full-time), entry  requirements,  mode  of
    assessment and awarding body.

160. The evidence of that there were reference to the course on the  college
    website is not very good.  The documentary evidence before me is in  the
    form of a photocopy  which  could  very  easily  have  been  mocked  up.
    Certainly it is on a piece of paper dated  25  January  2008.  The  part
    emanating allegedly from the  college  is  copyright  2007  which  might
    suggest it predates the 2008  download  but  does  not  prove  anything.
    Further, I have no way of knowing independently of the appellants if  it
    was in fact downloaded on 25 January 2008 as alleged.

161. I accept that the second appellant wrote to the respondent  in  January
    2008 asserting that he was attending  a  post  graduate  course  at  the
    Cambridge College of Learning (bundle page 878) but it would  have  been
    wholly appropriate for a person to write to the Home Office and  explain
    his absence from the course that he might  be  expected  to  attend  and
    claim to be attending another course. It is the respondent's  case  that
    the first, second and third appellants have been  involved  in  trickery
    and planned deceit. It neither hinders nor assists the respondent's case
    to see evidence suggesting that  the  claim  to  be  attending  a  post-
    graduate course at the Cambridge College of Learning was long standing.

162. Similarly the alleged course work in the bundle is  not  helpful.   The
    appellants have had time to consider their  positions.   The  allegation
    against them is that they had taken  part  in  a  very  blatant  act  of
    deceit.   It  is  consistent  with  that  they   would   have   produced
    documentation tending to show they were on  the  course.   None  of  the
    documents are particularly compelling. Not all of it bears the  name  of
    the college and could have been obtained from another college altogether
    or even from different courses attended by the appellants.  It has  some
    evidential value and assists rather than frustrates the  appellants  but
    it not determinative.

163. Neither am I impressed with the staff list identifying John Opoku as  a
    tutor in 2009.  It does not mean he was working at the college in  2008.
    It does not mean that Ms Ullah was wrong to say  he  was  not  there  in
    2007.  A possible reason for identifying Mr Opoku is that he was part of
    the plan to pretend to run a course.  The  same  can  be  said  of  Miss
    Ojulari.

164. It is difficult to prove negatives by relying on evidence that was  not
    produced but I do find it a relevant omission  in  this  case  that  the
    appellants have not been able to produce a witness prepared to say  that
    he or she actually  taught  the  disputed  course.   I  appreciate  that
    explanations have been offered but they are not persuasive.   I  do  not
    understand why a person returning to Nigeria (if that is what  happened)
    has made him impossible to contact. I have not been told of any attempts
    to use social medial to contact the people concerned. It makes no  sense
    to me that a person involved in teaching a legitimate course would be in
    any way reluctant to come forward and claim that he or  she  had  taught
    it.  They  would  have  nothing  to  lose.   If  they  are  out  of  the
    jurisdiction they can still make statements.

165. None of the appellants who claim to have attended  the  college  had  a
    college membership card.  None of them had persuasive evidence about how
    they paid their fees.  I can accept that a person might have  wanted  to
    stage payments and some people are more trusting  than  others  when  it
    comes to financial transactions. Nevertheless, I regard �500 as a  large
    sum of money to pay in cash. Further, a legitimate business would not be
    anxious to have that kind of sum in cash.   If  all  student  fees  were
    collected like  that  the  cash  sums  would  be  enormous  and  require
    expensive security.  It makes much more sense  to  me  that  a  business
    would encourage payment by cheque or  card.   I  regard  it  as  a  very
    unsatisfactory element of the appellants' cases that they each claim  to
    have paid these large sums by cash and none of them have proper records.
     I also find it significant that none of them have proper evidence  that
    they students at the college.  That surely is what a college  membership
    card is intended to be for and they each deny ever receiving one.

166. In her skeleton argument Miss Bayati contends that  the  fact  that  Ms
    Ullah was ignorant of the course sits uneasily with the  fact  that  the
    course was advertised on the website and  means  that  Ms  Ullah  is  an
    unreliable witness.  I prefer the explanation that the evidence  on  the
    website is unreliable.   I can think of no remotely sensible reason  for
    Ms Ullah to attend the Tribunal and say how she worked  at  the  college
    and knew nothing of a course taking place if that was not the  case.   I
    do not see how she could be mistaken and I cannot see why she  would  be
    dishonest.

167. The Tribunal in NA could not make  any  conclusions  on  the  reference
    number and I can  do  no  better.   I  find  that  point  is  completely
    unilluminating.  It may be that a four figure reference number was  more
    typical but it  may  be  there  were  different  reference  numbers  and
    different circumstances.   It is a point that proves nothing.

168. I have reminded myself that much of  the  evidence  relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State is second hand and the Secretary  of  State  has  not
    assisted by encouraging the attendance of a  person  whose  account  was
    being challenged.  Nevertheless,  I  am  faced  with  evidence  from  an
    apparently credible source that the contested course never existed.

169. I set against  this  the  claims  made  by  the  appellants  that  they
    attended the course.  Certainly if there  was  nothing  in  dispute  the
    entry on the website would  be  of  considerable  significance  and  the
    documents produced by way of course notes and handouts would be of  some
    assistance.  However none of these things is determinative.   I  do  not
    have anywhere a good set of course notes or a  detailed  explanation  of
    what happened on a course.   I do have students who have  no  more  than
    oral evidence that they paid their considerable fees and claim never  to
    have had an identity card.

170. I  remind  myself  that  the  allegation  here  is  that  each  of  the
    appellants who claims to have attended the college  is  being  blatantly
    untruthful.  This is not a matter of mistake or different interpretation
    of the existing  Rules  or  even  exaggeration.   It  is  a  very  clear
    allegation by the Secretary of State that  the  first  three  appellants
    have pretended to have studied a course that never existed.  Whilst  the
    standard of proof on the respondent is the balance  of  probabilities  I
    should not be easily persuaded  that  the  appellants  have  behaved  so
    badly.

171. However the evidence that the course never existed comes from the  very
    clear assertion of a witness who had no identifiable incentive  to  have
    been untruthful and was in a position to give informed evidence.

172. None of  the  evidence  produced  by  the  appellants  is  particularly
    persuasive. Even cumulatively it goes no further than even suggesting or
    supporting the idea that a course took place.  There is no evidence that
    the students concerned ever paid their fees beyond their oral  testimony
    and no evidence that  they  were  part  of  a  college  by  being  given
    membership cards.  Nobody has come forward who claims to have taught the
    course.   Even when I remind myself of the positive things said  in  the
    papers about the appellants,  including  their  education  and  personal
    qualities, I find the most  probable  explanation  for  the  differences
    between their evidence and the respondent's evidence is that the  course
    was never offered and they have gathered together documents to  try  and
    pretend that it did.

173. In the case of the second, third, fourth  and  fifth  appellants  there
    have been applications to  amend  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  rely  on
    paragraph 276B of HC 395.  If successful  this  would  entitle  them  to
    remain on the basis of ten years' lawful residence.  However,  it  is  a
    requirement of that Rule that an applicant  relying  on  paragraph  276B
    does  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the  general  grounds  of  refusal
    (paragraph 276B(iii)).  I find that each of these appellants do fall for
    refusal under the general grounds of refusal  because  paragraph  322(2)
    requires  that  applications  are  normally   refused    when   previous
    application have been refused because the application was  supported  by
    false documents.

174. Before me Miss Bayati submitted that the appellants  who  had  been  in
    the United Kingdom for more than  ten  years satisfied the  requirements
    of paragraph 276A(1).  This is similar  to  276B  but  276B  applies  to
    people seeking indefinite leave to  remain  whereas  as  276(Article  1)
    applies to a person seeking an extension of stay on the grounds of  long
    residence.

175. There has been no application under this Rule and it is  not  something
    on which I intend to make a primary decision.  This is because a  person
    must satisfy 276B(ii) and show that there are "no reasons why  it  would
    be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to remain".  This is
    something that the Secretary of State must decide first in  the  context
    of the specific  application.    For  my  part  there  are  considerable
    reasons for finding it undesirable for the adult male appellants  to  be
    given indefinite leave to remain and, in my judgement,  they  extend  to
    the other appellant who are tainted by them  even  if  innocent  of  the
    deception.

176. It follows that I have no hesitation in dismissing  the  appeals  under
    the rules.

177. I must consider  the  appeals  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

178. Clearly removing the appellants  now  would  be  an  interference  with
    their private and family lives.  It is also clear that removal would  be
    lawful subject to human rights considerations and for the proper purpose
    of enforcing immigration control.  I have considered very carefully  the
    evidence about the degree of integration these appellants have  made  in
    the United Kingdom.  I accept that they are  in  many  ways  industrious
    people with strong family values.  A casual observer in the hearing room
    would have seen them give evidence in  excellent  English,  respectfully
    answering Mr Tarlow's questions and generally presenting  themselves  in
    an attractive and obliging way.

179. I  am  satisfied  that  that  the  first  three  appellants  here  have
    deliberately and dishonestly pretended to have  completed  a  course  of
    study to support an application to extend their stays.   What  they  did
    was very wrong.  Not only were they seeking an advantage to  which  they
    were not entitled under the Rules but they were acquiescing in a cynical
    plot to undermine the Rules by issuing meaningless certificates.  In  so
    doing they strained the whole system  of  immigration  control.   It  is
    wrong that honest businesses have to compete  with  the  antics  of  the
    Cambridge College of Learning and it is  wrong  that  honest  immigrants
    seeking to stay in the United Kingdom attract suspicion or even contempt
    because of the bad behaviour of others.   It is wrong that public  funds
    have to be expended in policing immigration control  because  experience
    has shown that some people will behave very badly if they do  not  think
    they will be called to account.

180. If find that there are compelling reasons for removing the first  three
    appellants.

181. Their dependent wives are in a slightly different  position.   Although
    they presented to me as  intelligent,  able  women  I  cannot  say  with
    certainty that they knew that their husbands were cheating  the  system.
    However their sole basis for being in the United Kingdom is to  be  with
    their husbands. They have not established a right to  remain  under  the
    rules and I see no sensible basis for concluding that their removal with
    their husband's is other than a proportionate  interference  with  their
    private and family lives.

182. The difficulty is the  children.  The  applications  leading  to  these
    appeals predated the introduction of appendix FM on 9 July 2012. However
    I am bound by section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002, as amended although it may be that this adds nothing of  practical
    significance to the binding jurisprudence.

183. I remind my that this is a NOT a deportation case  and  so  the  public
    interest does not require the person's removal where (a) the person  has
    a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child
    (as is clearly the case here) and (b) it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom (see section 117B(6)).

184. None of the children in this case is a British citizen but a child  who
    is not a British citizen is a "qualifying child" if (b) she has lived in
    the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven years or more;  (see
    section 117D). The fifth appellant (the child of the  Third  and  Fourth
    appellants) is a "qualifying child". She was born on  11  November  2002
    and entered the United Kingdom in December 2004 and so has close  to  10
    years residence. Her sister, born in 2008, is not a "qualifying  child".
    The First Appellant's son, Navida, was born on 28 May 2008 and so is not
    a "qualifying" child. The Second appellant's  daughter  was  born  on  2
    September 2002. She entered the United Kingdom in February 2004  and  so
    is a "qualifying child".

185. However, I do not read section 117B(6) as meaning that removal  is  not
    in the public interest. Such an interpretation would nullify much of the
    section 117. Rather the public interest does not insist on removal where
    it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

186. Section 117B(5) requires that "little  weight  should  be  given  to  a
    private life established by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
    immigration status is precarious". I  am  satisfied  that  their  status
    became  precarious,  if  it  was  not  already  precarious,  when  their
    applications for further leave were refused  in  2009  so  much  of  the
    private life relied upon attracts "little weight". I am  bound  by  that
    but I think that I would have reached the same conclusion  even  without
    this statutory obligation.

187. Each of the children whose rights have to be considered  in  this  case
    has either been in the United Kingdom for a very significant  period  of
    time or for all  of  their  lives.  They  are  wholly  innocent  of  the
    shenanigans of their fathers and it is not their fault that the  hearing
    of the appeals was delayed. That said I find that the delay  in  listing
    the appeals is only a small factor in extending  their  stay.  The  real
    reason for their long  stay  is  their  fathers'  dishonest  pursuit  of
    permission.

188. Miss Bayati appropriately referred  to  the  decision  of  the  Supreme
    Court in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC  74.   She  particularly  relied  on
    paragraph 10 of the judgment of Lord Hodge which is  headed  "The  Legal
    Framework".  Lord Hodge said:

         "Those principles are not in doubt and Miss Drummond on  behalf  of
         the Secretary of State did not challenge them. We  paraphrase  them
         as follows:
         (1) The best interests of the child are an  integral  part  of  the
         proportionality assessment under Article 8 ECHR;
         (2) in making that assessment, the best interests of a  child  must
         be a paramount consideration, although  not  always  not  only  the
         primary consideration; and a  child's  best  interests  do  not  of
         themselves have the status of the paramount consideration;
         (3) Although the best interests of the child can be  outweighed  by
         the  cumulative  effect   of   other   considerations,   no   other
         consideration can be treated as inherently and more significant;
         (4) While different judges might approach the question of the  best
         interests of a child in different ways,  it  is  important  to  ask
         oneself the right questions in an orderly manner in order to  avoid
         the risk that the best interests of a child  might  be  undervalued
         when other important considerations were in place;
         (5)   It  is  important  to  have  a  clear  idea  of  the  child's
         circumstances and of what is in a child's best interests before one
         asks oneself whether these interests are outweighed by the force of
         other considerations;
         (6) To that end there is no substitute for a careful examination of
         all relevant factors when the interests of the child  are  involved
         an in Article 8 assessment; and
         (7) A child must not be blamed for matters for which he or  she  is
         not responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."

189. At the risk of being trite, I recognise that the best  interests  of  a
    child should be a primary consideration.

190. It is difficult  to  make  clear  findings  about  the  conditions  the
    children will face in the event of their return.  This  is  because  the
    fathers who gave evidence before me have not been honest  about  crucial
    parts of the case.

191. I do accept that it will be difficult for any of the  adult  appellants
    to resume their careers and I accept the evidence of Dr  Sivambalapitiya
    that she could not take up a place in the health service  in  Sri  Lanka
    that she left more than five years ago.   The evidence of any  remaining
    family links in Sri Lanka for any of them is rather skimpy.

192. I do not accept that they would be  returning  to  destitution  in  Sri
    Lanka and indeed it was not suggested that this was  the  case.   It  is
    self-evident that the appellants are articulate people,  fluent  in  the
    English language, and with more than a little nous.  I am confident that
    they will be able to find gainful employment in Sri Lanka  and  will  be
    able to establish themselves there.

193. The children will be affected by the language change as well as  living
    conditions.   Exactly how much grasp they have of Sinhala  is  difficult
    to tell.  It is  to  the  credit  of  the  parents  that  they  did  not
    exaggerate the difficulties.  I  find  that  the  children  have  little
    understanding of the language and are naturally fluent in English.  I do
    not believe that the  children  could  not  learn  Sinhala.   Experience
    suggests that children can be remarkably adept  in  picking  up  foreign
    languages and in many cases the younger they are the easier they find it
    to do.  It is, from the appellants'  point  of  view,  a  rather  ironic
    feature of this case that because they are members  of  strong  families
    where the support for the  children  is  considerable,  removal  becomes
    easier to justify.  The parents will do well for  the  children  in  Sri
    Lanka just as they have in the United Kingdom.

194. Nevertheless the children will lose much. They  have  no  knowledge  of
    life outside the United  Kingdom  and  have  done  well  in  the  United
    Kingdom. If they remained they could be expected take full advantage  of
    the education system and removing them will unsettle  them.  I  have  no
    difficulty in concluding that the best interests of the children require
    that they remain in the United Kingdom with their parents where they are
    settled.  That, from their point of view, would be an ideal result.

195. However, I am also aware of the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  EV
    (Philippines) and/ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874.   Although  they  have
    lived in the United Kingdom for a considerable time the children are not
    British nationals.  Removing them from the United Kingdom  may  well  be
    removing from the country where they aspire to be nationals but that  is
    not something they have yet achieved. They have not established a  right
    to remain there unless on human rights grounds.

196. In EV Lewison LJ  was  particularly  concerned  with  a  case  where  a
    "parent thus relies on the best interests of  his  or  her  children  in
    order to 'piggy back' on  their  rights"  (paragraph  49).  He  said  at
    paragraph 58:

         "In my judgement, therefore the assessment of the best interests of
         the children must be made on the basis that the facts are  as  they
         are in the real world.  If one parent has no right to  remain,  but
         the other parent does, that is the  background  against  which  the
         assessment is conducted.   If  neither  parent  has  the  right  to
         remain, then that is the background against which the assessment is
         conducted. Thus the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable  to
         expect the child to follow the parent with no right  to  remain  to
         the country of origin?"

197. This clearly is echoed in the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    but  I  remind  myself  that  I  am  making  a  decision  based  on  the
    jurisprudence of which the decision in EV is an important part.

198. I do remind myself that one of the children, particularly, has been  in
    the United Kingdom for more than ten years and that this represents  the
    greater part of a young life by  someone  who  can  be  expected  to  be
    establishing a private and family  life  outside  the  home.   I  remind
    myself, too, that none of the children here have any experience of  life
    outside the United Kingdom and they are  happy  and  settled  and  doing
    well.  The fact is their parents have no right to remain unless  removal
    would contravene their human rights.

199. I remind  myself  of  my  findings  concerning  the  need  to  maintain
    immigration control by removing the first, second and third  appellants.
    Given their behaviour I would consider it  outrageous  for  them  to  be
    permitted to remain in the United Kingdom. They must go and in  all  the
    circumstances I find that the other appellants must go with them.

200. It follows therefore that applying the law as I understand it  and  the
    facts as I found them I dismiss each of these appeals.

                                  APPENDIX

APPELLANT:    Amuruddha Rukmail Ratnaweera



RESPONDENT:   Secretary of State for the Home Department

CASE NO:      IA/03452/2009

DATE OF INITIAL HEARING IN UPPER TRIBUNAL:   20 July 2011

PANEL:        The Hon. Mr Justice Keith

              Senior Immigration Judge P R Lane

Representation:

For the Appellant:         Ms F Allen, Counsel, instructed  by  Polpitiya  &
    Co, Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



    REASONS FOR FINDING THAT TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF LAW, SUCH THAT ITS
                       DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE

1.   The appellant, a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 25 June 1973, arrived  in
    the United Kingdom in February 2003 with leave to enter as  a  student.
    The appellant subsequently obtained from the respondent  variations  of
    that leave, in the same capacity. In February 2004  the  appellant  was
    joined in this country by his wife and his daughter, who had been  born
    in Sri Lanka on 2 September 2002.  The appellant's  wife  and  daughter
    are dependants on his present claim.

2.   On 2 October 2008 the appellant applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier
    1 (Post-Study Work) applicant, pursuant  to  the  respondent's  points-
    based Rules. In support of that  application,  the  appellant  admitted
    evidence to the effect he  had  attended  a  course  at  the  Cambridge
    College of Learning, leading to the award to him in August  2008  of  a
    Postgraduate Diploma in Business Management, issued by CCOL.

3.   On 22 January 2009 the respondent refused the  appellant's  application
    because the respondent was "satisfied that all the  document  submitted
    [by the appellant] from the Cambridge College of  Learning  were  false
    because  the  Cambridge  College  of  Learning  had  never  offered   a
    legitimate postgraduate qualification in business  management"  (letter
    of 22 January).  Accordingly, the respondent awarded  the  appellant  0
    points under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, as opposed to the  75
    points which the appellant had claimed under that  provision.  Further,
    the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant had  satisfied  the
    requirement to have a knowledge of English equivalent to  level  C1  on
    the Council of Europe's Common European Framework for Language Learning
    and to have provided an original English language test certificate from
    an English language test provider.  Nor was  the  respondent  satisfied
    the appellant had a knowledge of English equivalent to level C1 and had
    obtained an academic qualification deemed by the relevant authority  to
    meet or exceed the recognised standard  of  a  bachelor's  or  master's
    degree or a PhD  in  the  UK  and  which  the  relevant  authority  had
    confirmed was taught or researched  in  English  to  that  level.   The
    respondent considered further that the appellant had not shown  he  had
    an academic qualification deemed by the relevant authority to  meet  or
    exceed the recognised standard of a bachelor's or  master's  degree  of
    PhD in the UK from an educational establishment in one of the countries
    listed in paragraph 2(c) of Appendix B.

4.   For these reasons, the respondent  concluded  that  the  appellant  had
    failed to prove compliance  with  paragraph  245Z  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Additionally, because of the appellant's submission of what the
    respondent  considered  to  be  false  documentation,  the  appellant's
    application was refused under paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Rules  since
    "false representations have been made or false document or  information
    have been submitted (whether or not material to  the  application,  and
    whether or not to the applicant's knowledge) or material facts have not
    been disclosed, in relation to the application".

5.   The appellant applied against the respondent's decision refuse to  vary
    his leave. His appeal was heard at Taylor House by an Immigration Judge
    on 12 August 2010.   The Immigration Judge  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal. On 2 December 2010 the Upper  Tribunal  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to it.   The  grounds  upon  which  permission  to
    appeal were granted, and which stand as the notice of appeal, contended
    that the Immigration Judge had erred in  law  in  respect  of  the  two
    matters which had been before him.

6.   The  first  of  those  matters  concerned  the  issue  of  whether  the
    appellant had legitimately studied for, and  obtained,  a  Postgraduate
    Certificate  in  Business  Management  from  CCOL.   In  NA  &   Others
    (Cambridge College of Learning) Pakistan [2009] UKAIT 00031 the  Asylum
    and Immigration Tribunal found  that  CCOL  never  ran  a  Postgraduate
    Diploma in Business Management course or a Postgraduate Diploma  in  IT
    course and that, accordingly, for a person to rely on a certificate  of
    an award of such a diploma following such a course would  amount  to  a
    false representation within the ambit of  paragraph  322(1A).   Such  a
    person would also be able to meet the requirements  of  paragraph  245Z
    because he or she could never have undertaken such a course. Before the
    Immigration Judge  in the present case, it was submitted that the AIT's
    findings in NA & Others needed to be considered in the light of, and by
    reference to, the fact  that  the  present  appellant  had  adduced  in
    evidence what were said to  be  photocopies  of  pages  from  the  CCOL
    website, accessed  on  25  January  2008,  which  listed,  amongst  the
    available courses at  that  college,  a  "Postgraduate  Certificate  in
    Business management", and which also gave an overview  of  the  course,
    together with a list of the modules, the level of  qualification,  mode
    of course, entry requirements, nature of the college's  assessment  and
    the awarding body (CCOL).

7.   The appellant's grounds of appeal contended that the Immigration  Judge
    had failed completely to have regard to  this  evidence.  This  was  of
    significance, given that the AIT in NA and Others recorded that  "there
    was no specific mention of  any  CCOL  PgDip  courses  on  the  college
    website nor among any of the college literature produced the appellants
    " (para 140).  In the grant  of  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Senior Immigration Judge Storey stated that  "whilst  it  may
    have been legitimate for the  [Immigration  Judge]  to  conclude  after
    analysis  that  this  piece  of  evidence  could  not  be  regarded  as
    sufficient to displace the findings made in NA (findings, based on  the
    very considerable and  diverse  body  of  evidence),  the  [Immigration
    Judge] made no  such  analysis  and  I  consider  [the  appellant]  has
    identified an arguable error in this regard".

8.   At the hearing on 20 July, Ms Allen, for the appellant, developed  this
    ground,  by  reference  to  her  skeleton  argument  on  19  July.   In
    particular, she drew attention to the case of TR (CCOL cases)  Pakistan
    [2011] UKUT 33.  At paragraph 33 of the determination in that case  the
    Upper Tribunal said:

         "33.     It follows from our earlier observations on the status  of
             NA and Others that we think  it  would  be  an  error  for  an
             Immigration Judge to dismiss a CCOL-related appeal  solely  on
             the basis that NA & Others made a finding  of  fact  that  the
             college never ran PgDip courses.  A fortiori it would be wrong
             to  base  the  dismissal  on  para  322(1A)  grounds   without
             examining whether the particular individual concerned  did  or
             did not use knowing deception. There is  still  a  fundamental
             duty of individual consideration."

9.   In the present case, the Immigration Judge's findings are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 17 to 23 of the determination.  In these  paragraphs,  there
    is no reference whatsoever to the website documentation,  submitted  by
    the appellant.  At paragraph 19, the  Immigration  Judge  had  specific
    regard to a lever arch file of documents (submitted at the hearing  and
    returned by the Immigration Judge to the appellant at its  conclusion),
    containing course notes and handouts. The pages asserted to be from the
    CCOL website were, however, not included in the  lever  arch  file  but
    were to  be  found  in  a  separate  appeal  bundle  submitted  by  the
    appellants.  The fact that this particular material was  relied  on  at
    the Immigration Judge hearing is  evident  from  paragraph  15  of  the
    determination where, summarising the submissions made on behalf of  the
    appellant by Ms Bayati of Counsel, the Immigration Judge recorded  here
    as saying that "The conclusion that there was no information concerning
    the courses on  the  internet  was  disproved  by  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had downloaded information on courses run by CCOL in  January
    2008 and this course was referred to".

10.  Despite the issue  of  the  website  being  a  narrow  one,  the  Upper
    Tribunal as concluded that  the  Immigration  Judge  erred  in  law  in
    failing to have any  regard  to  it  in  the  course  of  reaching  his
    findings.  As Senior Immigration Judge Storey indicated  when  granting
    permission, it might well have  been  legitimate  for  the  Immigration
    Judge to  have  concluded,  notwithstanding  this  evidence,  that  the
    appellant fell within paras 322(1A).  He might for example, have  taken
    the view that if CCOL was providing certificates for a course which was
    not offered, the  website had to pretend  that  the  course  was  being
    offered.  However, we do not consider it can be said that such a result
    would have been inevitable and that the Immigration Judge was bound  to
    have dismissed the appeal in these circumstances.   We  have  therefore
    concluded that the Immigration Judge's findings in relation to the CCOL
    issue cannot stand. We accordingly set aside under section 12(2)(a)  of
    the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  that  part  of  the
    Immigration Judge's decision.  In accordance with Practice Statement  7
    of February 2010, the re-making of this part of the decision is for the
    Upper Tribunal to undertake, provided in section  12(2)(b)(ii)  of  the
    2007 Act.

11.  Although Article 8 had not been  raised  in  the  original  grounds  of
    appeal to the Tribunal, it  is  apparent  that  the  Immigration  Judge
    permitted those grounds to be advanced,  by  reference  to  a  document
    entitled "Additional grounds of appeal", contained at pages 5 and 6  of
    the appellant's appeal bundle  before  the  Immigration  Judge.   Those
    additional grounds contended that the respondent  had  failed  to  have
    proper regard to the rights of the appellant's family under  Article  8
    of the ECHR; in particular, the rights of the appellant's daughter, who
    was around 1� years old when she arrived in the United Kingdom and  who
    had at that point lived in  the  United  Kingdom  for  over  5�  years.
    Reference was made to the withdrawn policy DP5/96, in  support  of  the
    submission that "where a child had resided in the UK for 7 years  as  a
    starting point it would be unreasonable for her to return to  her  home
    country".  Amongst the  documentary  evidence  before  the  Immigration
    Judge were various educational  reports  on  the  appellant's  daughter
    (consistently named Samali, rather than  Kulanya,  which  is  the  name
    given to her in paragraph 1 of the appellant's  statement  of  7  March
    2010).  The appellant sought to rely on these documents  to  show  that
    his daughter had settled well into education in this country and  would
    suffer in this regard if she were compelled to return with her  parents
    to Sri Lanka.

12.      As Mr Walker for the respondent very properly conceded on 20  July,
    the  Immigration  Judge's  consideration  of  Article  8   was   wholly
    inadequate.  That consideration is set out at paragraphs 22 and  23  of
    the determination and contains no analysis of the human rights position
    of the appellant's daughter.   Shortly  before  the  Immigration  Judge
    hearing, the Upper Tribunal case of LD (Article 8 - best  interests  of
    child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC) had  been  published.  That  case
    emphasised that, in the context of Article 8, the  interests  of  minor
    children and their welfare are required to be a  primary  consideration
    in the balance of competing considerations.  Although, at the  time  of
    the immigration decision in the  present  appeal,  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  (duty  regarding  the
    welfare of children)  had  not  come  into  force,  the  Supreme  Court
    judgments in ZH (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4  make  it  plain  that  the
    Immigration Judge in the representative case should have approached the
    issue of Article 8 by reference to  what  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's daughter  might  be.   Whilst  those  interests  would  not
    necessarily be determinative, particularly since the daughter is not  a
    British citizen, it was not possible for the Immigration Judge properly
    to determine the Article 8 issue without any regard to  the  daughter's
    best interests.

13.      On 20 July the Tribunal  accordingly  found  that  the  Immigration
    Judge's decision on Article 8 was wrong in law and fell to be set aside
    under section 12 of the 2007  Act.   As  a  result  of  the  Tribunal's
    conclusion on the CCOL issue (paragraph 9 above)  the  result  is  that
    that the entirety of the decision in the appellant's appeal falls to be
    re-made by the Upper Tribunal.
