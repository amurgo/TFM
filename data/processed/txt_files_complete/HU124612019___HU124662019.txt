Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Rushforth, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born  on  8
    January  1977.   The  second  appellant  is  also  a  citizen  of   the
    Philippines and was born on 28 November 1999.  The first  appellant  is
    the father of the second appellant.

 2. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom on 4 July  2011  with  a
    Tier 4 visa with leave valid until 27 September 2012.  On 26  September
    2012, the first appellant applied for further leave to  remain  as  the
    spouse of Zuena Lagasi Sahidjuan.  On 22 March 2013, the  Secretary  of
    State  refused  that  application.   That  decision  was   subsequently
    reconsidered and on 3 February 2014, the first  appellant  was  granted
    limited leave to remain as a  spouse  under  the  10-year  route  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) valid until  3
    August 2016.

 3. On 12 July 2016, the first  appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a spouse.  On 31 August 2016, the first appellant was granted
    leave as a spouse under the 5-year route in Appendix FM valid until  22
    March 2019.

 4. On 28 February 2019,  the  first  appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his  marriage.   That
    application was refused on 8 July 2019.

 5. The second appellant, who is the first  appellant's  son,  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 1 August 2015 with a visa to join  his  father.   His
    leave was valid until 3 August 2016.

 6. On 12 July 2016, the second appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a dependant on his father's spouse application.  On 31 August
    2016, in line with his  father's  successful  application,  the  second
    appellant was granted leave until 22 March 2019.

 7. On  1  March  2019,  the  second  appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain as the dependant of his father and  in  line
    with the first appellant's application for leave for ILR which had been
    made the previous day.

 8. On 8 July 2019, the Secretary of State refused the  second  appellant's
    application for indefinite leave to remain.

 9. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
    sent  on  25  February  2020,  Judge  Hussain  dismissed  each  of  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

10. The appellants sought permission to appeal and, on 22 April 2020, Judge
    Easterman granted each of the appellants permission to  appeal  on  the
    basis that it was arguable, that although the first appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules for  ILR,
    he met the requirements for limited  leave  and  that,  therefore,  the
    decision  to  remove  him  (and   the   second   appellant)   was   not
    proportionate.

11. The appeals were listed before me on 5 November 2020.  The hearing  was
    conducted remotely by Skype for Business.  I was based in  the  Cardiff
    Civil Justice Centre and Mr Draycott, who  represented  the  appellants
    and Ms Rushforth who represented the Secretary  of  State,  joined  the
    hearing remotely.

12. At the outset of the hearing, Ms Rushforth conceded that the judge  had
    erred in law in dismissing both appellants' appeals under Art 8 of  the
    ECHR.  She accepted that the first appellant met the  requirements  for
    limited leave as a spouse under Section R-LTRP 1.1(a) - (c).  Those are
    the necessary requirements in order to succeed under the  so-called  5-
    year route and which entitles the  first  appellant  to  the  grant  of
    limited leave for a period not exceeding 30 months under section D-LTRP
    1.1.  Ms Rushforth accepted that the judge had been wrong in failing to
    approach the first appellant's appeal on the  basis  that  he  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.

13. Mr Rushforth further conceded that the first appellant's appeal  should
    succeed under Art 8 of the ECHR as there  was  no  public  interest  in
    removing him given that he met the requirements in Appendix FM  on  the
    five-year route as a spouse.

14. Finally, Ms Rushforth conceded  that  the  second  appellant's  appeal,
    which was dependent on the first appellant's appeal, should be  treated
    in the same way.  The judge's decision should  be  set  aside  and  the
    second appellant's appeal should also be allowed under Art 8.

15. I accept Ms Rushforth's concession that the first appellant  meets  the
    requirements of the Rules in Appendix FM for limited leave as a  spouse
    under the 5-year route.  (Mr Draycott accepts that the first  appellant
    is not entitled to ILR under the Rules.) The second  appellant's  claim
    falls to be decided in line with that.  The  appellants'  appeals  were
    only on the ground that the decisions breached Art 8  as  a  result  of
    ss.82 and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended).  However, in TZ (Pakistan) and Another v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ
    1109, Sir Ernest Ryder, the Senior President of  Tribunals  (with  whom
    Longmore and Moylan LJJ agreed) said at [34]:

         "... where  a  person  satisfies  the  Rules,  whether  or  not  by
         reference to an Article 8 informed requirement, then this  will  be
         positively  determinative  of  that  person's  Article  8   appeal,
         provided their case engages Article 8(1), for the very reason  that
         it would then be disproportionate for that person to be removed."

16. There is no doubt that Art 8.1 is engaged in this appeal because of the
    "family life" between the appellants and the first appellant's  spouse.
    As the first appellant meet the requirements of  the  Rules,  what  was
    said by the court in TZ (Pakistan) applies.  It is accepted the  second
    appellant succeeds on the same basis.  Both appellants were, before the
    First-tier Tribunal, and are, now on  appeal  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    entitled to succeed under Art 8 of the ECHR as Ms Rushforth conceded.

Decision

17. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  each  of  the
    appellants' appeals involved the making  of  an  error  of  law.   That
    decision cannot stand and is set aside.

18. I remake the decision allowing each of the  appellants'  appeals  under
    Art 8 of the ECHR.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                            10 November 2020


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed each of the appellants'  appeals  and,  it  is  clear,  their
appeals should have been allowed by the First-tier Tribunal on the  evidence
before it.  In these circumstances, I make a fee award of any  fee  paid  or
payable in respect of the appellants' applications.


                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                            10 November 2020
