Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Benfield, Counsel, instructed by Imperium Group
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Nigeria aged 45.  He was  granted  entry
    clearance as a visitor for a period 15 March 2005  until  15  September
    2005.  He remained  unlawfully  thereafter.   On  25  October  2010  he
    applied for asylum.  This was refused on 14  September  2012.   Further
    representations were rejected in December 2012.  On  18  February  2015
    the appellant made an application for leave to remain on the  basis  of
    family and private life.  This was refused on  17  April  2015.   In  a
    determination sent  on  July  2016,  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  Judge
    Maxwell dismissed his appeal.  The appellant challenged this dismissal.
    In a decision dated 10 March 2017 Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  (DUTJ)
    Davey found that Judge Maxwell had erred  in  law  and  set  aside  his
    decision.  DUTJ Davey identified the error of law as being the  failure
    of the judge to address the appellant's claimed fear  of  ill-treatment
    on return to  Nigeria  when  assessing  proportionality.   My  task  is
    therefore to re-make the decision.

2.   At the outset of the hearing Ms Barnfield requested an  adjournment  on
    the basis that the  appellant  needed  more  time  to  submit  evidence
    relating to his fear of ill-treatment on return to Nigeria.  I  refused
    that application.

3.   Both the appellant and his representatives were sent  a  copy  of  DUTJ
    Davey's decision and in that decision he made express  Directions  that
    any further evidence be served no later than 10 days before the resumed
    hearing and that the parties were to notify the Tribunal if  any  other
    evidence was to  be  relied  upon.   Ms  Benfield  submitted  that  the
    appellant did nothing in response because his representatives told  him
    he did not need to do anything and that I  should  not  blame  him  for
    their shortcomings.  However, his representatives had not provided  any
    statement explaining why they did nothing and  I  am  not  prepared  to
    accept that the appellant had good reason to make no response to DUTJ's
    Directions.

4.   Both representatives submitted that the only issue before me  concerned
    the Article 8 issue of proportionality.  They both  made  reference  to
    the wording of ss.82 - 85 of the NIAA 2002.  I  am  inclined  to  agree
    with their submissions in that the appellant did not make a  protection
    claim and as regards the human rights claim, he did not  identify  fear
    of ill-treatment on return to Nigeria as part  of  that  claim  and  so
    would have needed the consent of the respondent to raise a  new  matter
    in the form of a separate Article 3 ground of  appeal.   Nonetheless  I
    shall make observations of the appellant's Article 3  circumstances  at
    the end of my decision.

5.   Ms Benfield accepted that the appellant cannot  succeed  on  Article  8
    grounds unless able to persuade me that his  return  to  Nigeria  would
    place him at real risk of serious harm.

6.   The appellant gave evidence.  He said he had not appealed  the  refusal
    of his asylum claim because he was told by someone from the Law Society
    to apply again, although he had in fact collected a number of  relevant
    background notes about Nigeria and the Urhobo  Programme  Union  (UPU).
    He had not challenged the 2012 rejection of his further representations
    because he was depressed and had accommodation problems.

7.   The appellant confirmed that his witness statement dated 11  July  2016
    was true and correct.  He had explained in that witness statement  that
    after his university education he went for National  Youth  Service  in
    Odion  where  he  became  involved  in  a  community   project.    This
    involvement led him in turn to become involved in the activities of the
    UPU which was a social cultural pressure group  that  was  supposed  to
    advocate for the welfare of the people of the  Urhobo  land.   He  soon
    learnt that there was a militant group involved in  the  UPU  who  were
    acting for self-gain for example through stealing oil, and when he made
    known his criticism of them they turned on him.  In August 2004 he  was
    subjected to an attack which he believed was sponsored or  carried  out
    by those persons and he then decided to flee Nigeria.
8.   In reply to questions from Ms Benfield the appellant said that  he  had
    learnt that the man who confirmed to  him  that  these  militants  were
    behind the attack on him (Henry Odin) had died.  He believed that  both
    this man and his younger brother had  been  killed  because  they  knew
    secrets about these members.  He had learnt from a TV channel of  other
    attacks carried out by those persons.  Those persons knew that he  (the
    appellant) also knows their secrets.  Asked  why  those  persons  would
    still have  an adverse interest in him over thirteen years  later,  the
    appellant said "they don't give up" and  the  same  people  were  still
    around.  The appellant said that if he returned to Nigeria he would not
    be able to secure family support; those  family  members  still  living
    there were struggling in already overcrowded accommodation.  Because he
    had been gone for thirteen years  he  had  lost  his  connections  with
    friends and  he  did  not  belong  to  any  networks.   Whilst  he  had
    undertaken several courses in the UK, he did not have  job  experience.
    He did not believe he could relocate to Lagos as it was not a big  city
    and people knew each other.  The UPU would be able to locate  him.   He
    could not obtain protection from the police, as they were  not  willing
    to provide realistic protection.

9.   In cross-examination the appellant was asked why his witness  statement
    did not address all the reasons set out by the respondent when refusing
    his asylum claim and representations.  He was  asked  why  he  had  not
    challenged the respondent's information that he had travelled  back  to
    Nigeria.  He said he had never travelled outside the UK since arriving;
    he believed and had said in his asylum interview the agent who arranged
    the travel was behind the visa application in his name.  He  was  asked
    what his response was to the respondent's position that he  had  failed
    to show adequate knowledge of the UPU.  The appellant said that when he
    had given the name of  its  leader  as  "Esisi  Edward"  he  had  meant
    Frederick Esisi.  He could not remember clearly.  Asked to  comment  on
    the respondent's refusal to accept that his ethnic origin was Urhobo he
    said that his lack of knowledge of the language used reflected the fact
    that   he had not lived there until 2004.  Asked why he had waited over
    five years to claim asylum the appellant said he had made an attempt to
    claim but was frustrated by the fact that the man he had approached  to
    represent him had asked for �500 which he did not have.  He came to the
    UK with �1,700 pounds and he did not work for three  years.   He  never
    knew that there were sources of free legal representation.  Asked again
    why the UPU members who he said had targeted him would still do so  the
    appellant repeated that they did not give up.   He  was  still  without
    work.  His sister's husband and a church member gave him support.

10.  In submissions Mr Tufan asked me to count  against  the  appellant  his
    failure before the hearing to address several key reasons given by  the
    respondent for  refusing  his  asylum  claim,  including  his  lack  of
    knowledge of the UPU and the information that he had travelled back  to
    Nigeria, plus his lengthy  delay  in  claiming  asylum.   Even  if  the
    appellant's account of crossing powerful  UPU  members  was  considered
    credible, they would surely be happy that he was out of the picture and
    would not pursue him elsewhere in Nigeria.

11.  Ms Benfield submitted that I should accept the appellant's  explanation
    for not claiming asylum for five years.  The appellant had  provided  a
    credible witness statement and in his oral evidence had  satisfactorily
    explained all the matters doubted by the  respondent.   The  respondent
    had not substantiated her allegation that  he  had  travelled  back  to
    Nigeria.  The appellant had given a credible account of his involvement
    with the UPU and his educational background provided an explanation for
    why he had taken the view about UPU activities that he did.   In  terms
    of paragraph 276ADE, he had demonstrated very significant obstacles  to
    his (re-)integration into Nigerian society.  The fact that he had had a
    lengthy period without working and had no  professional  qualifications
    and had limited experience  would  make  it  exceedingly  difficult  to
    obtain employment in Nigeria.  Whether considered under  the  Rules  or
    outside the Rules, the appellant should be accepted as someone who  met
    the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  and  who  had  also  established
    compelling circumstances warranting a grant of leave to remain.

My Decision

12.  In assessing the credibility of the  appellant's  account  I  have  had
    regard to the entirety of the written evidence and the appellant's oral
    testimony before me. Although the claim he advances  is  one  based  on
    Article 8 I shall proceed on the basis that, since it raises an asylum-
    related claim, the appellant need only prove that aspect of his case to
    the lower standard of proof of reasonable degree of likelihood.

13.   I do not find that the appellant has given a credible account  of  his
    adverse experience in Nigeria.  Given his claim that he was  an  active
    member of the UPU for four years I do not accept that he could not give
    the correct name of the organisation's leader and did not know that the
    organisation had its own website.  His account of why  certain  members
    of the UPU had targeted him for attacks has been consistently vague and
    lacking in detail.  He said it was because he knows their secrets,  but
    the only secrets  he  described,  that  they  were  pursing  their  own
    interests and carrying out illegal activities such as the theft of oil,
    would have been well-known to the  local  community  and  he  has  been
    unable to provide satisfactory detail of being in a position to  expose
    or embarrass these individuals. I also  observe  that  despite  stating
    that the man who attacked him was a  student  at  his  university,  the
    appellant has never been able to state his name or explain why he  took
    no steps to find out his name.

14.  As regards the appellant's ethnicity, I count against him that  he  was
    unable to supply or state correctly significant information  about  his
    tribal calendar, the location in which his tribe is found  and  any  of
    the names of the tribal kingdoms.  Given that he was able to provide  a
    reasonable account of accurate information about the number of kingdoms
    within Urhoboland I am prepared to  accept  that  he  had  some  ethnic
    connections with the  Urhobo.   However,  the  appellant  has  made  no
    attempt to corroborate his account.  Despite stating that the threat he
    feared from certain members of the UPU was confirmed to  him  by  Henry
    Odini, no statement was forthcoming from this man or  any  evidence  to
    show that the appellant had attempted to obtain such a statement.   The
    appellant has claimed this was not possible because Odin is  dead,  but
    he has not produced any evidence to support this claim.

15.  The  appellant  claims  that  shortly  after  arriving  in  the  UK  he
    attempted to claim asylum and had indeed collected together a  body  of
    material relating to the UPU  and  its  activities,  but  was  told  by
    lawyers he had approached that he needed to pay �500 up front which  he
    did not have.  However, that was in 2007 and he made no mention of  any
    subsequent attempts after 2007 to claim asylum until 2010.   Indeed  it
    was not until he was arrested and jailed  in  late  2010  (for  working
    illegally and possessing a fake NI number and passport) that he applied
    for asylum.  The fact that he was illegally  working  showed  that  his
    excuse for not claiming in 2007 in  terms  of  penury  could  not  have
    continued to apply for the next three years.  In this connection I have
    regard to the fact that the appellant has a  university  education  and
    was someone who cannot have failed to understand the  need  to  make  a
    genuine asylum claim promptly.

16.  The  appellant  received  a  decision  refusing  his  asylum  claim  in
    September 2012.  In the reasons given for that decision the  respondent
    had noted that UKBA visa records showed two applications  made  in  his
    name in December 2005 and April 2006.  The respondent also  noted  that
    this information had been put to him in his asylum  interview  and  his
    response was that the agent used his details without his consent and he
    did not make the application.  He  repeated  that  explanation  in  his
    evidence before me.  Given that the appellant's visa  application  made
    in December 2005 was recorded as being made in person and that it  bore
    the appellant's  photograph,  I  do  not  find  it  credible  that  the
    application was made without his consent.  I find it reasonably  likely
    that the appellant travelled back to Nigeria at least once in 2005/2006
    and that his failure to give a satisfactory explanation  casts  further
    doubt on the credibility of his account in general.

17.  In assessing the credibility of the appellant's account  I  also  treat
    as  a  relevant  factor  that  after  eventually  claiming  asylum  and
    receiving a refusal decision, he did not lodge an  appeal  against  it.
    Moreover, even when he made further representations on 19 November 2012
    (in which he raised new points, namely fear of persecution  because  of
    his religion and his private and family life) he again failed to adduce
    any evidence in support of his claims regarding the 2004 events.   Even
    the evidence he claimed to have collected  in  2007  demonstrating  the
    existence of a militant wing of the UPU has never been forwarded to the
    respondent.

18.  Even if I accepted  the  appellant's  evidence  regarding  his  adverse
    expenses in 2004 as credible, and even if I were persuaded he  did  not
    as a result have access to effective protection in  Ibadan,  I  am  not
    persuaded that he would be at risk  from  his  claimed  persecutors  in
    other parts of Nigeria.  In particular, I do not accept that  he  would
    be unsafe in Lagos.  His own account has failed to establish  that  the
    UPU militants have any significant presence or influence in Lagos,  nor
    has he been able to produce any COI evidence in support  of  the  claim
    that such persons would be able to locate him in Lagos.  I  also  agree
    with Mr Tufan that so long as the appellant did not return to his  home
    area the UPU would have no motivation to seek him out for harm. In  any
    event, there are  many  other  cities  or  areas  in  Nigeria  and  the
    appellant has not demonstrated that the UPU has any presence in any  of
    them save possibly  Kaduna.   The  appellant's  claim  that  the  state
    authorities are systematically unable to  protect  individuals  against
    ill-treatment is not supported by the background evidence viewed  as  a
    whole.

19.  In light of my negative findings on the  appellant's  claimed  fear  of
    ill-treatment on return to Nigeria, I am not persuaded that he was able
    to establish very significant obstacles to (re-)integration.   Even  if
    he cannot turn to  family  members  for  direct  support,  he  will  be
    returning to a country in which he still  has  family  connections  and
    where culture and traditions and language are familiar to  him.   Given
    his university education and the benefit of further  courses  taken  in
    the UK, he will have far better prospects of obtaining employment  than
    many ordinary Nigerians, notwithstanding lack of great job  experience.
    It is not reasonably likely that he  will  face  destitution.   Indeed,
    given my negative findings in relation to  his  claimed  fear  of  ill-
    treatment I see no reason to depart from  the  finding  made  by  Judge
    Maxwell in particular that the appellant has shown  himself  to  be  an
    extremely resourceful person having obtained illegal employment in  the
    UK and to have travelled around the UK without hindrance until  he  was
    apprehended and arrested for committing fraud.  Further, given that  on
    his own account he enjoys  significant  financial  support  in  the  UK
    amounting to �250 a month, I consider Judge Maxwell was  also  entitled
    to  find  that  (despite  claims  to  the  contrary  made  by  his  two
    benefactors) they would continue to  be  able  to  help  the  appellant
    financially, at least for some time until he was able  to  re-establish
    himself.

20.  I would observe that if I had found  that  the  appellant  could  raise
    grounds of appeal reliant on Article 3 ECHR, I would have rejected them
    for the same reason as I have rejected his claim to fear  ill-treatment
    in the context of his Article 8 claim.

21.  For the above reasons I conclude that the appellant's appeal should  be
    dismissed.   He   has  failed  to  show  that  he  meets  the  relevant
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and he has  failed  to  establish
    that there are compelling circumstances such as to warrant a  grant  of
    leave outside the Rules.  Among the many factors weighing against  him,
    he has an appalling immigration history and the length of time  he  has
    spent in the UK has  been  accrued  when  his  immigration  status  was
    precarious.

22.  To conclude:

       - The FtT Judge (Maxwell) erred in law and his decision has been  set
         aside by DUTJ Davey.


       - The decision I re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
