For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
        material error on a point of law in the decision of  Judge  of  the
        First-tier Tribunal O R Williams (the  judge),  promulgated  on  11
        April 2018, in which he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  against
        the respondent's decision dated 8 January 2018  refusing  to  issue
        him with a residence card as the former family  member  of  an  EEA
        national exercising Treaty rights  who  has  a  retained  right  of
        residence under  regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration  (European
        Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations).


     2. In an 'error of law' decision promulgated on 20 July 2018  I  found
        that the judge erred in law by failing to adjourn  the  hearing  in
        order to make an 'Amos Direction' pursuant to Amos  v  SSHD  [2011]
        EWCA Civ 552 to obtain  HMRC  records  relating  to  his  ex-wife's
        employment for the period 1996 to 31 October 2015.  I  additionally
        found that the judge, through no  fault  of  his  own,  misdirected
        himself  in  respect  of  the  application  of  Reg  10(5)  of  the
        Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 following the
        Court of Appeal decision of Baigazieva v Secretary of State for the
        Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1088, promulgated on 20 April 2018,
        after the date of the decision under appeal.

     3. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  issued  an
        Amos  Direction.  In  compliance  with  the  Amos   Direction   the
        respondent provided a witness  statement  from  Wendy  Gilbert,  an
        officer of HMRC, dated 10  October  2018,  setting  out  the  Self-
        Assessment tax return  details  for  the  appellant's  ex-wife  (Ms
        Mirella Favia) covering the years 2016 to 2018,  and  PAYE  details
        covering the years 2003 to 2012. The statement indicated that there
        was no employment recorded for the appellant's ex-wife in the years
        2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012, and no PAYE employment records  were
        held for the tax years 2012 - 2013 to 2015 - 2016.

   Factual Background

     4. The appellant is a national of Jamaica, born in 1972. According  to
        his witness statement dated 26 March  2018  he  met  Ms  Favia,  an
        Italian national, in Jamaica in August 2009 and they got married on
        19 November 2010. She gave birth to  their  child,  a  son,  on  19
        November 2011. The appellant, Ms Favia and their son went to  Italy
        in December 2011 and decided to move to the UK in  2012.  He  first
        entered the United Kingdom on 28 June 2012 as the family member  of
        his wife who was exercising her  EEA  free  movement  rights  as  a
        jobseeker.


     5. On 4 December 2012 the appellant was issued with a  residence  card
        as the family member of his Italian national wife,  valid  until  4
        December 2017. According to Ms Gilbert's witness statement Ms Favia
        had been employed in various jobs in the UK from 2003  to  sometime
        in 2009/2010. It was the appellant's evidence that he met Ms  Favia
        in Jamaica in August 2009. I am satisfied, based on this  evidence,
        that Ms Favia had been exercising EEA treaty rights in the UK  from
        2003 to 2009. She would therefore have attained a  permanent  right
        of residence in the UK. The evidence before  me  however  indicates
        that she left the UK, at the latest, in August 2009,  and  did  not
        return for the purpose  of  residence  until  2012.  Her  right  of
        permanent residence was consequently lost by virtue of Reg 15(3) of
        the 2016 Regulations.


     6. The relationship between the appellant  and  his  wife  soured  and
        divorce proceedings were initiated some time round July 2015. On 24
        October 2017 the appellant applied for a residence card  confirming
        that he retained a right of residence following his divorce.

     7. The respondent refused to issue  the  residence  card  because  the
        appellant only submitted  a  photocopy  of  his  ex-wife's  Italian
        passport. Nor was the respondent satisfied that the  appellant  and
        his ex-wife had both been living in the UK for at  least  one  year
        during the marriage, or that  his  ex-wife  was  exercising  treaty
        rights at the date of the termination of the marriage, or  that  he
        had been a worker, self-employed person or  self-sufficient  person
        since the termination of the marriage.

The evidence

     8. A bundle of documents prepared for the First-tier Tribunal  hearing
        contained, inter alia, a statement from the appellant, a GCID  Case
        record Sheet indicating that the  appellant  was  initially  issued
        with a residence card because his ex-wife was a job-seeker who  had
        previously been employed in the  UK,  an  HMRC  employment  history
        relating to the appellant, issued on 19 January 2018,  showing  the
        appellant's employment for the tax years 2013 to 2018,  the  decree
        absolute (6 October 2015, referring to the decree nisi issued on 21
        August 2015), copies of Ms Favia's passport, and various wage slips
        relating to the appellant.


     9. In his statement the appellant set  out  his  immigration  history,
        described the history of his relationship  with  his  ex-wife,  and
        explained that he maintained a strong relationship with his son. In
        his oral evidence before the Upper Tribunal the appellant  accepted
        the evidence obtained pursuant to the Amos Direction. He  explained
        that his application was made to enable him to  maintain  his  good
        relationship with his son. He  did  not  suggest,  or  provide  any
        evidence that Ms Favia had been exercising Treaty rights in the  UK
        from 2012 to 2016, other  than  as  a  job-seeker  when  she  first
        entered in 2012.

Reasons for decision

    10. I found the appellant an entirely credible witness. He was open and
        forthright  in  his  account  of  his  immigration   history,   his
        relationship with his ex-wife, and his relationship with  his  son.
        The various HMRC documents, in conjunction  with  the  wage  slips,
        confirm that he has been employed in the UK from 2013 to  at  least
        June 2017. I have no reason to doubt the appellant's claim that  he
        enjoys a good relationship with his son.


    11. I explained to the appellant at  the  remade  hearing  that  I  was
        nevertheless bound  to  consider  whether  he  was  entitled  to  a
        residence card as a family member who has  retained  the  right  of
        residence. In order to retain a right of residence under Reg 10  of
        the 2016 Regulations the appellant must  demonstrate  that  he  was
        residing in the UK in accordance with the Regulations at  the  date
        of the  termination  of  the  marriage.  In  Baigazieva,  Singh  LJ
        observed that, in  the  light  of  the  CJEU's  judgment  in  NA  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] QB 109, the  SSHD
        now accepted that, in order to meet  the  condition  in  regulation
        10(2)(a) to have been the  family  member  of  a  qualified  person
        (within the meaning of Reg 6), it was  sufficient  for  the  person
        asserting the retained right of residence  to  show  that  the  EEA
        national spouse/partner was a qualified person as at  the  date  of
        the initiation of divorce proceedings, rather than at the  date  of
        decree absolute.

    12. The divorce proceedings were initiated sometime in July2015.  There
        was  however  no  evidence  that  the  appellant's  ex-wife  was  a
        qualified person at that time. Indeed, there is  no  evidence  that
        she exercised  any  Treaty  rights  as  a  qualified  person  until
        sometime in 2017, other an as a job-seeker when she entered the  UK
        in 2012. There was no evidence that the appellant's ex-wife  sought
        employment or that she had registered as a job-seeker following her
        entry into the UK in 2012. She could not have remained a job-seeker
        from 2012 until 2015. In these circumstances I find  the  appellant
        is not a family member who retained a right of  residence  and  was
        not therefore entitled to a residence card.
