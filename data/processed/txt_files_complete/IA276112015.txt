For the Respondent:    Ms H Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    McDade in which he dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, a citizen  of
    Ghana, against the Secretary of State's decision  to  refuse  to  grant
    leave to remain on the basis of his family  and  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.


 2. The Appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom in April 1995 using a
    false name. He has never had leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom. In 2004 he applied for leave to remain as a parent  exercising
    access to a child resident in the United Kingdom. That application  was
    refused on 17 March 2008 and his appeal against the decision to  refuse
    was dismissed following a hearing on 28 May 2008. On 6  June  2014  the
    Appellant made an application for leave to remain on the basis  of  his
    family and private life. That application  was  refused  on  9  October
    2014. On 31 March 2015 the Appellant made  a  further  application  for
    leave to remain on the basis of  his  family  and  private  life.  This
    application was refused  on  22  July  2015.   The  Appellant  appealed
    against this decision and this is the appeal which  came  before  Judge
    McDade on 11 December 2015 and was dismissed. The Appellant applied for
    permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  application  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne on 10  June  2016  in  the
    following terms

       In a relatively concise decision and reasons, it  is  arguable  that
       the judge having himself briefly mentioned section 117B  Nationality
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 failed to consider the  contents  of
       that section in any substantive manner.  In  particular,  the  judge
       failed to consider section 117B(6) which is arguably relevant to the
       Appellant's appeal and  which  if  considered  adequately  may  have
       resulted in a different decision. It is an arguable error of law for
       the judge to have failed to make adequate findings  in  relation  to
       section 117B(6) which if adequately considered and  adequately  made
       may have produced a different result to the appeal.




Submissions

 3. At the hearing before me Mr Ahmed appeared on behalf of  the  Appellant
    and Ms Aboni represented the Respondent.


 4.  For the Appellant Mr Ahmed referred to the grounds  of  appeal  saying
    that the core of the issue was set out in paragraph 6.  The  Judge  has
    failed to properly consider Article 8, very much more is  required  and
    the Judge should have set matters  out.  The  strongest  point  is  his
    failure to consider section 117B(6) as detailed in paragraph 13 of  the
    grounds. If the Judge had considered  section  117B(6)  he  would  have
    found that the Appellant had a parental relationship with  his  British
    citizen daughter and that the public interest did not require  removal.
    Section 117B(6) is a trump card. Mr Ahmed referred to MA (Pakistan) and
    others [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and to  Ghising  (family  life  -  adults  -
    Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC).


 5. For the Respondent Ms Aboni said that the Judge  had  fully  considered
    the facts and taken into account the previous decision.  The  Appellant
    has an appalling immigration history. There was no good reason to grant
    leave in these circumstances. If section 117B(6)  was  indeed  a  trump
    card it would only have resulted  in  leave  being  granted  until  the
    Appellant's daughter reached the age of 18.

 6. I reserved my decision.


Discussion

 7. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  taken  together  with  the
    grant of permission and Mr Ahmed's submissions are  clear.  It  is  not
    asserted that the Judge erred  in  respect  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    appeal it is asserted that the Judge failed to  properly  consider  the
    Human Rights appeal and, in particular, that if he had done so he would
    have been bound to allow the appeal because section 117B(6) is a  trump
    card there being no public interest in the removal of a person who  has
    a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying  child
    and it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United
    Kingdom.


 8. The facts are not in dispute. The Appellant has a very poor immigration
    history. He entered the UK illegally in 1995. He claimed asylum using a
    false name and false date of birth claiming to be a Liberian  national.
    It is axiomatic that the substance of his asylum claim was false.  When
    his application was refused he appealed continuing to  use  this  false
    identity and on dismissal of his appeal  applied  for  reconsideration.
    This was a pre-meditated and sustained deception. Being  appeal  rights
    exhausted the Appellant, in the words of Judge McDade, "went to ground"
    reappearing some 6 years later and applying for leave to remain as  the
    parent of a child exercising rights of access to a  child  resident  in
    the United Kingdom. This time he used his correct name, date  of  birth
    and nationality and the child concerned was the  Appellant's  daughter,
    Tiegan Natasha Ward, upon whom his current claim to  remain  is  based.
    The application was refused and his appeal  dismissed  with  the  Judge
    making findings that his contact with his daughter, aged 9 at the  date
    of hearing, was limited. At paragraph 26  of  the  decision  the  Judge
    finds


       "Although I am satisfied that the Appellant does  see  his  daughter,
       there is no evidence as to the frequency with which she  stayed  with
       him while he had a flat, and he has not established that he sees  her
       every week. There is no  evidence  as  to  the  importance  that  his
       daughter attaches to the contact beyond her letter of  2006  or  2007
       referring to her wish that he should be able  to  buy  her  presents.
       There was no evidence that  the  Appellant  has  any  involvement  in
       making decisions about his daughter's upbringing."


    Following dismissal of the appeal the Appellant again remained  despite
    having no basis of stay and being appeal rights exhausted.


 9. The application currently under  appeal  was  made  in  2015  when  the
    Appellant's daughter was approaching her 17th birthday. By the time  of
    the appeal hearing before Judge McDade she was  aged  17  years  and  5
    months. Her witness statement submitted  in  support  of  her  father's
    appeal states


       "I see my dad occasionally every now and then. It varies as I'm a 17-
       year-old girl I have my own  life  and  do  my  own  things.  My  dad
       sometimes comes to visit and I won't be in  as  I  may  be  out  with
       friends."

10. In his decision Judge McDade deals with the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and his daughter at  paragraph  5.  In  doing  so  the  Judge
    accepts that there is infrequent contact, notes that nothing appears to
    have changed since the previous judge's findings and goes on to say


       "I had no sense from the evidence of  either  the  Appellant  or  his
       daughter that there was any great bond between them. The Appellant is
       a largely absent figure. There is no evidence when he  last  saw  his
       daughter apart from leaving a Christmas card for her two days  before
       the hearing ... I do not consider that the Appellant takes  what  can
       be described as an active role in his 17ï¿½ year old daughter's life."


    The Judge concludes by finding that the Appellant's  circumstances  are
    fully covered under the Immigration Rules and there are  no  compelling
    or exceptional reasons for any consideration outside of the  rules  and
    that even if there were the appeal would be bound to fail under Article
    8 on the basis of the Appellant's immigration history.


11. This is an application that was made in March 2015 before the right  of
    appeal under the  terms  of  the  Immigration  Rules  was  removed  and
    'deemed' human rights applications were introduced. It  was  an  appeal
    considered on the basis of the Immigration Rules. It  was  asserted  on
    the Appellant's behalf that  the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph E-LTRPT and  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  and  as  such  that  the
    Appellant's circumstances were covered by the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    skeleton argument put forward in support of the appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal submits that the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  the
    parent route (i.e. paragraph E-LTRPT).


12. The decision shows that the Judge carefully considered the facts and in
    particular the depth and quality of the relationship between father and
    daughter. Having done so he found that the Appellant did not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph E-LTRPT.2.4 (b) because  he  could  not  show
    that he has taken an active role in his daughter's upbringing  or  that
    he intended to take an active role in the future. Given the findings of
    the Judge at the first appeal  and  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    daughter in the appeal before him, both referred to above, this was  in
    my judgement an inevitable finding and indeed it is a  factual  finding
    that is not challenged before me.


13. This finding has two pertinent effects. The first is that although  the
    Immigration Rules make  provision  for  a  person  in  the  Appellant's
    claimed situation the Appellant did not meet the requirements of  those
    rules because his relationship with  his  daughter  did  not  meet  the
    qualitative standard  needed.  The  second  is  that  this  failure  to
    demonstrate  the   closeness   of   relationship   required   militates
    conclusively  against  any  finding  of   compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances justifying consideration outside the rules. Although  the
    Judge does not mention it is clear that he had in mind the decisions in
    SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and Sunassee [2015] EWHC  1604  (Admin).
    If there are no "compelling reasons", it is sufficient  to  merely  say
    so, with the result that the assessment  under  the  rules  provides  a
    complete answer in the appeal:

       "The law is that there is  always  a  second  stage,  but  where  all
       relevant considerations have been weighed under the rules  and  there
       are no compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the
       rules it will be enough for the decision maker to  simply  say  that.
       ...  The failure to qualify under the rules will tend to suggest that
       the public interest requires refusal of leave to  vary,  unless  some
       countervailing factors are present which are not already  taken  into
       account under the rules." (Sunassee paragraph 33)


14. The more recent authority of MA (Pakistan) and Others [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    705 gives important guidance on the correct approach where Article 8 is
    considered outside the terms of the Immigration Rules. However, in this
    case it is not asserted that there is any error of law so  far  as  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal under the terms of the Immigration Rules
    is concerned and, there being no  compelling  or  other  reason  to  go
    outside the Immigration Rules that should be the end of the matter.


15. Judge McDade however did go on to say that even if there was reason  to
    look at Article 8 outside the rules the appeal would be bound  to  fail
    taking into account the Appellant's immigration history.  Although  the
    Appellant's immigration history would, if  the  matter  was  considered
    outside the rules be a relevant consideration, it is  in  my  judgement
    the nature of his relationship with his daughter that would  mean  that
    the appeal would be bound to fail. Section 117B(6) is not  a  provision
    that is devoid of reference to the quality of the relationship  between
    parent and child.  It  requires  a  'genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship'; if parliament had intended to simply say a biological or
    casual parental relationship the Act would have been explicit  in  this
    regard. At the time of the appeal the Appellant's daughter was, in  her
    own words, a 17-year-old girl with her own life  who  sees  her  father
    occasionally.  It would be a travesty in  a  case  where  there  is  no
    compelling reason to go outside the Immigration Rules  because  of  the
    qualitative nature of the relationship to find that if there  had  been
    any  reason  to  go  outside  the  rules  for  that   relationship   to
    nevertheless be a trump card.

16. In my judgement there is no error of law in  the  Judge's  decision  to
    dismiss this appeal under the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  and  to
    find  that  there  were  no  compelling  or  exceptional   reason   for
    consideration outside of the rules.

Summary

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law. This appeal is dismissed.
