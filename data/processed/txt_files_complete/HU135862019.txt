                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria date of birth 5th October  1978.
    He appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Siddiqi) to dismiss his appeal on human rights grounds.
    The Appellant seeks further leave to remain in the United Kingdom  with
    his partner.

    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The background facts are as follows. The  Appellant  was  a  long  term
    overstayer when in 2012 he submitted an application for leave to remain
    on human rights grounds.  The Secretary of State granted the  Appellant
    limited leave, in recognition of his Article 8 rights. This  was  valid
    until May 2015 and the Appellant was subsequently the beneficiary of  a
    further grant, valid until June 2018.  The Appellant however failed  to
    make an application for further leave in time. He waited for some seven
    months after the  expiry  of  that  last  grant  before  making  a  new
    application.

 3. So it was that the Secretary of State found  the  Appellant  to  be  an
    overstayer, who could not meet  the  'eligibility'  requirements  under
    Appendix FM. Although it was  accepted  that  the  Appellant  is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with his  partner,  and  that  they
    meet the financial requirements of the rules,  the  Appellant  had  not
    demonstrated that there would be "insurmountable obstacles"  to  family
    life continuing outside  of  the  United  Kingdom:  paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM applied. For good  measure  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
    provide an English language test  certificate.    Leave  was  therefore
    refused under the 'partner' route.  The Secretary of State went  on  to
    consider whether leave should be granted on 'private life' grounds  and
    decided that it should not. Finally she considered whether  there  were
    what she continues to call "exceptional circumstances"  -  ie  was  the
    decision  to  interfere  with  the  Appellant's  Article  8(1)   rights
    disproportionate - and concluded that leave should not be granted.

 4. The Appellant appealed. The matters  in  issue  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were therefore:

    a) Are there insurmountable obstacles to this family life continuing in
       Nigeria or elsewhere?

    b) Does the Appellant qualify for  leave  on  any  of  the  alternative
       'private life' provisions in paragraph 276ADE(1) of the  Immigration
       Rules?

    c) If the answer to either or both of the  above  is  negative  is  the
       decision nonetheless disproportionate?

 5. The First-tier Tribunal decided all three matters against the Appellant
    and the appeal was dismissed.

 6. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal on the 17th  March  2020
    by Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shaerf.  Although  Judge
    Shaerf commented that some  grounds  disclosed  no  arguable  error  in
    themselves, he was prepared to  grant  on  an  unrestricted  basis.   I
    therefore must address all the grounds raised.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 7. Ground 1 is that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  departing  from  a
    concession of fact. The First-tier Tribunal recorded at its [�13]  that
    the Appellant did not meet the financial requirements of the Rules, but
    the Secretary of State had already accepted that he did.

 8. As a matter of fact, this ground is correct. The Secretary  of  State's
    refusal letter is dated the 1st August 2019 and on page 3 the following
    concession  can  be  found:  "you  meet  the  eligibility   requirement
    paragraphs E-LTRP.3.1 to 3.4".  At its [�13]  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    incorrectly states that the Appellant "accepts that the  ...  financial
    requirements of the Rules were not met". This error is however entirely
    immaterial, as it can be seen from [�26(c)] of the Tribunal's  decision
    that when it came to weighing the question of finances in the  balance,
    the Tribunal got it right:

       "Section 117B(3) states that it  is  in  the  public  interest  that
       persons  seeking  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK   are   financially
       independent. The Respondent accepted that the  Appellant  meets  the
       financial requirements of the Rules".

 9. Again at its [�33(f)], it is clear that the Tribunal  appreciated  what
    matters were left in issue under the Rules. Ground 1 is accordingly not
    made out.

10. Ground 2 is that the First-tier Tribunal "erred" in  applying  s117B(5)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to the effect that  only a
    "little weight" could be attached to a private life established when  a
    person's immigration  status  is  precarious.     That  ground  is  not
    particularised. It appears to relate  to  [�26(d)]  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision, where the Tribunal simply  directed  itself  to  the
    terms of the statute.  I can see no error in that.   The  Tribunal  was
    bound to apply the statute.   Ground 2 is not made out.

11. Ground 3 relies on the decision in Rhuppiah v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department  [2018]  UKSC  58  to  submit  that  s117B(4)  only
    mandates "little weight" to be placed  on  a  relationship  where  that
    relationship is established when the person concerned is in the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully.  That is undoubtedly a correct reading of  the  law
    and Rhuppiah, but the grounds do not go on to explain where  the  error
    lies.  The  implication  is  that  perhaps  the   First-tier   Tribunal
    misunderstood that this was a relationship formed when the  Appellant's
    status was precarious rather than unlawful.  On the facts as stated  it
    is not altogether clear whether that is true but  that  is  irrelevant,
    since the First-tier Tribunal  nowhere  directs  itself  to  give  this
    relationship "little weight". Ground 3 is not made out.

12.  Ground 4 is that the First-tier Tribunal erred finding "no reason  why
    the appellant could not retain her indefinite leave  status  by  making
    frequent re-entry to the UK". I assume that this reference is  in  fact
    to the Sponsor. It is asserted that the point which  should  have  been
    considered was that in leaving the United Kingdom the Sponsor would  be
    precluded from acquiring British citizenship as she would not  be  able
    to meet the residence requirement.  I am not persuaded that  there  was
    any arguable error in the  First-tier  Tribunal  failing  to  expressly
    consider whether the  Sponsor  would  be  materially  disadvantaged  by
    moving to Nigeria. Even if it could be established  that  the  loss  of
    opportunity to apply for naturalisation at some point in the  future  -
    it can be put no higher than  that  -  were  material  to  the  overall
    balancing exercise, it is evident from the reasoning set out in respect
    of her ILR at FTT �32 that it is not  a  matter  that  was  capable  of
    attracting any significant weight. Whilst  the  Sponsor  may  lose  the
    benefits that residents of the United Kingdom enjoy - such as access to
    the NHS - she is also a Nigerian national, and enjoys  the  benefit  of
    that status.  In enacting s117B  parliament  expressly  envisaged  that
    spouses of foreign nationals who do not meet the  requirements  of  the
    rules can be expected to live abroad: that is further reflected in  the
    rules at EX.1. It is trite that Article 8 does not confer upon  couples
    a choice of where to set up the family home:  it  cannot  therefore  be
    said that her sacrifice, in giving up what she has here to relocate  to
    Nigeria, would make this decision disproportionate.

13. It is not until paragraph 18 of the grounds that we reach the  crux  of
    the appeal, where three successive grounds all  engage  with  questions
    relating to the Razgar proportionality assessment.  First, the question
    was not simply whether this couple could return  to  Nigeria,  as  they
    unquestionably could, but whether it was proportionate to  expect  them
    to do so. Second,  that in  conducting  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise the Tribunal failed to take  material  matters  into  account,
    including the fact that the pregnant Sponsor had not been to Nigeria in
    over 11 years, no longer had any family connections in that country and
    had stated in evidence that she would not be able to cope with  looking
    after the baby on her own in the event that she remained here after her
    partner was removed to Nigeria. Third, whether the Tribunal should have
    applied the Chikwamba principle to this appeal.

14. I deal with the latter point first. It has no  merit.  In  Chikwamba  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 the Appellate
    Committee considered the case of a woman from Zimbabwe who was required
    by the Home Office to return to the "harsh and unpalatable"  conditions
    in that country in order to make an application for entry clearance  to
    come back and resume family life  with  her  refugee  husband.  It  was
    common grounds that the application would have succeeded, since she was
    able to meet all of the relevant requirements of the rules. What  then,
    the Appellate Committee asked, was the point of making her go  all  the
    way back to Zimbabwe rather  than  simply  allowing  her  to  make  the
    notional application for 'entry' - ie an in-country Article 8  claim  -
    here?   The facts in the present case are not so clear  cut.  As  Judge
    Siddiqi notes, the Appellant had failed to produce an English  language
    certificate evidencing his ability to meet the requirements of Appendix
    FM E-LTRP 4.1.  It could not therefore be  said  that  any  application
    made by the Appellant in Nigeria would be bound to succeed: it was  not
    a Chikwamba case. Before me Mr Tampuri argued that the Tribunal  should
    have exercised common sense:  it  had  heard  the  Appellant  give  his
    evidence in fluent English  and  should  have  been  aware  that  as  a
    Nigerian he would have been educated in that language. I am  unable  to
    accept that  an  individual  claimant's  likely  ability  to  pass  the
    required language test is a matter upon which a  Judge  could  properly
    take judicial notice. The fact that the Appellant can speak English  is
    no guarantee that he will be able, for instance, to  pass  the  written
    component of the test. Were it obvious that as a Nigerian  national  he
    would be able to do so, Nigeria would no doubt appear on  the  list  of
    approved English speaking countries at GEN.1.6 of Appendix FM.

15. Turning to the wider questions about  the  exercise  conducted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I would begin by  noting  that  this  was  not  an
    appeal that every judge would have dismissed. The  Appellant  does  not
    have a good immigration history, but the Respondent had  been  prepared
    to overlook this in the past, having granted him two successive periods
    of leave between 2012 and 2018. He had been here for a  long  time,  on
    his evidence since 2003. He had established a small business, a  bakery
    which had employed other people until it was destroyed by fire in 2018.
    It was in the aftermath of that fire that the Appellant failed to  make
    his application for further leave in time.  There is no doubt  that  he
    and his current partner enjoy a family life together and  that  at  the
    date of the appeal she was pregnant with his child.  That  partner  has
    herself lived in this country a long time  and  is  settled  here;  her
    home, job, family and friends are all in the United Kingdom. She  works
    in the NHS as a nursing assistant.   It would be difficult for  her  to
    give all of that up to return to Nigeria.  She did not want  to  travel
    to Nigeria whilst she was pregnant, particularly since she suffers from
    sickle cell anaemia.   The couple love each  other  and  understandably
    want to remain together  here,  where  they  have  established  a  life
    together. On those facts a judge might well  have  determined  that  it
    would be disproportionate to refuse further leave. That was not however
    the decision of Judge Siddiqi, and I cannot interfere with her decision
    because it could have been otherwise. The question is whether she erred
    in her approach.

16. The Tribunal certainly started in the right place. It sensibly began by
    assessing whether or not this couple could meet the  test  at  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM: whether there were "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  family
    life continuing outside the United Kingdom.  Here  the  decision  notes
    that both Appellant and Sponsor were born and brought  up  in  Nigeria,
    and that they both continue to hold Nigerian citizenship.  They both do
    have some family members in that country, are familiar with the culture
    and there was no reason why they could not work to support  themselves.
    The Tribunal expressly notes that the Sponsor is  pregnant,  but  finds
    there to be a complete absence of any evidence  to  indicate  that  she
    would be unable to  obtain  medical  treatment  there.  None  of  those
    factual findings are challenged in this appeal and I am satisfied  that
    cumulatively they provided a sound foundation for the  conclusion  that
    the Appellant could not meet the "insurmountable obstacles" test as  it
    is elaborated in EX.2 and Agyarko v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 11.  The Appellant therefore  failed  under  the
    rules, and that was an important factor going into its wider assessment
    of proportionality.

17. This assessment fell into two  parts.  First  the  Tribunal  considered
    whether it would be reasonable to expect  the  couple  to  relocate  to
    Nigeria. It notes the Sponsor's reluctance  to  do  so,  but  directing
    itself to the decision in AS (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2008]  EWCA  Civ  1118  finds  this  to  be  a  factor
    attracting limited weight:  she  was  in  effect  a  Nigerian  national
    arguing that it did not matter that her  husband  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the rules because she should not be expected to give up
    her private life.   There was  no  evidence,  found  the  Tribunal,  to
    suggest that the Sponsor, and indeed the Appellant, would not  be  able
    to establish  a  new  private  life  in  Nigeria.   Nor,  the  Tribunal
    reiterated, was there any medical evidence to indicate that  either  of
    them might have any problems in accessing treatment there. This  was  a
    point picked up by Mr Tampuri in submissions before  me,  in  which  he
    stressed that the Sponsor has sickle-cell anaemia.  I accept  that  the
    Tribunal does not make reference to that  matter,  but  this  is  I  am
    afraid hardly surprising, given that the evidence on it was limited  to
    a single line in her medical notes. There was no  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal about whether this diagnosis could cause  her  or  her  unborn
    child any problems in Nigeria, or whether it could cause  complications
    in the pregnancy, or whether she would for instance be taking a risk in
    flying.  In the  absence  of  any  evidence  that  this  would  pose  a
    particular problem for the Sponsor there can have been no error in  the
    First-tier Tribunal failing to identify  it  as  such.   Overall  I  am
    unable to find that there was any error in approach by the Tribunal.  A
    relocation to Nigeria would  undoubtedly  be  challenging  and  perhaps
    distressing for the couple, in particular the Sponsor, but in the final
    analysis these were two adult Nigerian nationals who  have  both  lived
    and worked in that country: there was no real  reason  given  why  they
    could not do so again.  The  argument  boiled  down  to  the  Sponsor's
    reluctance to give up her life in the United Kingdom: I  am  unable  to
    find any error in the Tribunal's decision that this did not render  the
    refusal of leave disproportionate.

18. The First-tier Tribunal alternatively asks itself whether it  would  be
    disproportionate to expect the Appellant to return to Nigeria in  order
    to make a proper application for entry in accordance  with  the  rules.
    As I have set out above this was not a Chikwamba situation, where  such
    a formality amounted to the elevation of policy to dogma.  The question
    was simply whether it would be disproportionate to expect the couple to
    endure a temporary separation until such time as the Appellant obtained
    entry clearance. Again, given the above, and  the  operation  of  s117B
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the  Tribunal  reached  a
    finding properly open to it on the evidence. No evidence  was  produced
    as to why the Sponsor could not be left  alone  during  her  pregnancy.
    Nor does it appear to have been argued  that  the  Appellant  would  be
    unable to meet the requirements of the rules: indeed to the contrary it
    was argued that the English language tests he was required to take were
    simply a formality and that he would easily be able to pass them.

19. The final challenge is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  its
    approach to relevance of the uncontested fact that the Appellant is the
    biological father of a British child.  The child was born of a marriage
    that ended over a decade ago and the evidence was vague about  when  he
    had last seen him. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the Appellant had
    taken no legal steps to try and secure contact with his son.  In  light
    of the admitted fact that there was no  current  contact  the  Tribunal
    concluded that the Appellant did not enjoy  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the child.  Before me Mr Tampuri  criticised
    this finding on  the  basis  that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  give
    sufficient weight to the potential family life that might be resumed in
    the future. I accept that ideally notice should have been taken of  the
    presumption that as a biological parent who was living  in  the  family
    unit the Appellant at one time enjoyed a 'family life' with his son; he
    had in fact been granted limited leave to remain on  this  basis;  this
    might in some circumstances have then informed an enquiry into  whether
    that relationship could be re-established. This is not, however, one of
    those circumstances. The burden lay on the Appellant, who  provided  no
    evidence at all that he had taken any steps to try and  regain  contact
    with his child. His account of his  personal  history  in  the  witness
    statement was rightly described as a vague: on his own  evidence  there
    was no current contact, and there does not  appear  to  have  been  any
    contact for some years. There was in fact no lawful basis upon which  a
    Tribunal could have allowed an Article 8 appeal on the  basis  of  that
    statement.

20. For the sake of completeness I note that a  late  elaboration  of  this
    ground came in oral submissions. It was that the Tribunal had erred  in
    failing to take material matter into account, viz  that  Appellant  had
    been  experiencing  some  mental   health   issues   -   described   as
    "instability" - which had prevented him from seeking access to his son.
      Whilst it is true that the decision does not make  any  reference  to
    this, I am not satisfied that there is any error in that. There was  no
    evidence before the Tribunal that the Appellant was experiencing mental
    instability preventing him from seeking contact with his son:  in  fact
    his witness statement says that it was because he had no money, and his
    partner says it was because he had no leave to remain.

    Decisions

21. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.

22. There is no order for anonymity.
