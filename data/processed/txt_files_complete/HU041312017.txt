Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Sowerby, Counsel (instructed by ATM Law)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  McWilliam
         on 28 November 2018 against the decision to dismiss the Appellant's
         Article 8 ECHR appeal made by First-tier Tribunal Judge Roots in  a
         decision and reasons promulgated on 23 May 2018.


      2. The Appellant is a national of India, who had  entered  the  United
         Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student in  2009.   Subsequently  his
         leave to remain was extended but then it was curtailed to 31 August
         2014.  An appeal was dismissed on 24 June 2016. The Appellant  made
         another application on 7 October  2016  which  was  refused  on  27
         February 2017.  The Appellant relied on his marriage to  a  settled
         British Citizen.  The Respondent had raised an  allegation  of  ETS
         deception.


    3.     Judge Roots found that the Appellant's  family  life  (which  he
         accepted existed) had been formed when the Appellant's family  life
         was precarious.  The Appellant's British Citizen wife could live in
         India with the Appellant.   Some hardship would  be  involved,  but
         not very serious hardship or insurmountable obstacles. Her children
         from a previous relationship were now healthy  young  adults.   The
         Appellant's  family  in  India  would  provide  accommodation   and
         support.  There was no clear evidence that the Appellant could meet
         the  Immigration  Rules  (Appendix  FM)  if  an   entry   clearance
         application were made. There were no exceptional circumstances  and
         there was no Article 8 ECHR disproportionality.  Hence  the  appeal
         was dismissed.


    4.     Permission to appeal was refused by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Lambert on 20 August 2018 but was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         McWilliam because it was considered arguable that the judge had not
         made a finding on the Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 point raised  before
         him.


    5.     Mr Sowerby for the Appellant relied on the grounds submitted and
         the grant of permission  to  appeal.  The  issue  was  narrow.  The
         Chikwamba principle had been approved in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 but
         the judge had not dealt with it as he should  have  done.   It  was
         recorded as argued in submissions and there had been evidence  that
         the Appellant's wife earned ï¿½24,000 per year.   That had been shown
         sufficiently. The Suitability requirement was not  displaced  by  a
         short overstay.  The judge dismissed the ETS deception  allegation.
         There was no reason why entry clearance would not be granted and no
         purpose was served by requiring the Appellant to leave  the  United
         Kingdom to make it.  The appeal should be allowed and the  decision
         remade in the Appellant's favour.


    6.     Mr Bramble for  the  Respondent  submitted  that  there  was  no
         material error of law in the  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination
         and the judge's findings had all been open to  him.   The  skeleton
         argument placed before the judge had made no mention of  Chikwamba.
         It had been conceded on the Appellant's behalf that there had  been
         overstaying from August 2014.  The  record  of  submissions  showed
         that the judge had been  aware  of  the  Chikwamba  point  and  had
         addressed it sufficiently. The appeal should be dismissed.


    7.     In reply, Mr Sowerby submitted that there  had  been  sufficient
         evidence of the Appellant's wife's income for the  appeal  to  have
         been allowed and the appeal should be allowed now.


    8.     The grant of permission to appeal was in the tribunal's  view  a
         generous one which had paid insufficient attention to the  text  of
         the careful determination.  The submissions advanced on  behalf  of
         the Appellant were all fully dealt with  and  disposed  of  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal  Judge.   The  tribunal  accepts  Mr  Bramble's
         submissions.


    9.     The skeleton argument submitted to Judge Roots made no reference
         at all to Chikwamba.  The copy of  the  skeleton  argument  on  the
         appeal  file  shows  that  the  judge  highlighted  the   extensive
         "insurmountable obstacles" arguments there set out,  five  specific
         points, which the judge rejected  on  the  facts  found,  directing
         himself by reference to  the  discussion  of  Jeunesse  in  Agyarko
         [2017] UKSC 11: see [25] and [42] of the determination.


    10.    At [15] of the determination the judge noted the  discussion  of
         Chikwamba in [57] of Agyarko. That indicated plainly  that  he  was
         alive to the point, which was submitted  as  a  secondary  line  of
         argument.  The judge noted at [46] of the determination that he had
         not been presented with clear evidence or fully developed  argument
         that  an  entry  clearance  application  from  India  made  by  the
         Appellant would succeed.  No evidence was  produced  at  the  Upper
         Tribunal hearing to cast the slightest doubt  on  the  accuracy  of
         that statement.  The tribunal accepts its  accuracy.   The  judge's
         plain view was that the Appellant's admitted overstay, nearly  four
         years or more by the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing, was a
         matter of public interest in maintaining immigration control.   The
         Appellant's relationship with his wife  began  in  April  2015,  by
         which time the Appellant had already overstayed by some six months,
         and should have left the United Kingdom. Requiring the Appellant to
         seek entry clearance in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules,
         Appendix FM, was proportionate given the finding that  family  life
         could be continued in India: see [50] of the  determination.   That
         was more than  sufficient  to  deal  with  the  secondary  line  of
         Chikwamba argument.


    11.    The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  produced  a  thorough,  balanced
         determination, which securely resolved the  issues,  some  of  them
         (the ETS allegation) in the  Appellant's  favour.  The  judge  gave
         proper weight to the public interest in  immigration  control.  The
         tribunal finds that there was no  error  of  law  and  the  onwards
         appeal must be dismissed.


    DECISION


    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


    There was no  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision and reasons, which stands unchanged.
