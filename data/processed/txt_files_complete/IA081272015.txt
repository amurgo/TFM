                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

   1. By a decision promulgated on 7  October  2016  ("the  Decision"),  the
      Tribunal (myself and Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey) found there to
      be an error of law  in  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Chamberlain  promulgated  on  17  December  2015  which  allowed   the
      Appellant's  appeal.   We  therefore  set  aside  Judge  Chamberlain's
      decision and gave directions for the re-making of the decision leading
      to a determination on the papers.  Our  Decision  is  included  as  an
      appendix to this decision for ease of reference.

   2. Following further directions made on 23  November  2016,  this  matter
      comes before me to re-make the decision.  In my directions given on 23
      November 2016, I indicated that  if  either  party  required  an  oral
      hearing, they should notify the Tribunal  within  fourteen  days  from
      promulgation of those directions; otherwise the decision would be  re-
      made based on the written submissions on the  papers.   Neither  party
      has requested an oral hearing.

The Issues

   3. The factual background to this appeal appears at [2] of the  Decision.
      As there stated, the Respondent refused  the  Appellant's  application
      for leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant on the basis that he
      was unable to satisfy  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  of  Appendix  J  to  the
      Immigration Rules ("paragraph  14(d)(iii)").   This  was  because  the
      Respondent asserted that the appropriate salary rate was  that  of  an
      "experienced worker" and not a "new entrant" and  the  salary  in  the
      certificate of sponsorship  was  at  a  lower  level  (although  would
      satisfy the "new entrant" rate).

   4.  The  Appellant's  original  grounds  did  not  take  issue  with  the
      Respondent's  interpretation  of  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  but   instead
      contended that, if the basis of that rejection was  only  due  to  the
      period of leave sought (as it was), then the Respondent should  simply
      have granted leave limited to that period rather  than  rejecting  the
      application as a whole (there  being  no  other  basis  on  which  the
      Respondent rejected the  application).   Reference  was  made  in  the
      grounds to [70] of the Tier 2 policy guidance  which  states  that  an
      individual would be granted leave up to five years  depending  on  the
      job start and end dates  in  the  certificate  of  sponsorship.    The
      Appellant  submitted  however  that  the   Respondent   retained   the
      discretion to grant leave for a lesser period.

   5. The appeal came before Judge Chamberlain on 1 December 2015.   By  her
      decision promulgated on 17 December 2015, she allowed the  Appellant's
      appeal on the basis that  the  Respondent  was  wrong  to  refuse  the
      application as she found  that  the  Appellant's  salary  fell  to  be
      considered on the  basis  of  the  "new  entrant"  rate  and  not  the
      "experienced worker" rate  (paragraph  [10]  of  her  decision).   Her
      interpretation appears to be founded on the Appellant's submission set
      out at [8] of the decision that the Appellant's  application  was  not
      one to extend his stay in Tier 2 but rather to switch from Tier  4  to
      Tier 2.

   6. The Respondent appealed on the basis that Judge  Chamberlain  had  not
      considered whether the remainder of  paragraph  14(d)  was  met.   The
      basis on which the Respondent contended  that  Judge  Chamberlain  had
      misdirected herself in relation to interpretation  of  the  Rules  was
      because the Judge had failed to consider the  remainder  of  paragraph
      14(d).  The Respondent went through  each  of  the  sub-paragraphs  of
      paragraph 14(d)(i) of Appendix J ("paragraph 14(d)(i)") and  contended
      that the Appellant could not meet any of those sub-paragraphs. I  note
      at this point that the Respondent's grounds did not directly challenge
      the Judge's interpretation  of  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  other  than  to
      assert that the Judge had erred at [10] of  her  decision  by  finding
      that the application was a new application under Tier 2.  That  though
      has to be read in the context of  what  follows  as  relating  to  the
      Judge's failure to consider paragraph 14(d)(i).

   7. At the error of law hearing, the Appellant  contended  that  he  could
      meet paragraph 14(d)(i) on the basis that he fell under the  route  of
      scoring points from the  Post-Study  Work  provisions  of  Appendix  A
      (14(d)(i)(1)).  That was disputed by the Respondent in her grounds  on
      the basis only of assertion that the Appellant did  not  score  points
      from the Post Study Work provisions and  the  Presenting  Officer  who
      represented the Respondent on that occasion was taken by  surprise  by
      the Appellant's submission (see [9] of the Decision).  We found in any
      event an error of law on the basis  that  Judge  Chamberlain  had  not
      considered whether paragraph 14(d)(i) was met and,  if  so,  how.   We
      invited written submissions from both parties as to how the  Appellant
      met the provisions in paragraph 14(d) or why he did not do so.

   8. The Respondent's submissions received on 20 December 2016 accept  that
      the Appellant is able to meet paragraph 14(d)(i) on the basis that the
      Appellant asserts, namely that he  can  satisfy  the  post-study  work
      provisions of Appendix A (and therefore meets paragraph  14(d)(i)(1)).
      The Respondent submits however that the Appellant  remains  unable  to
      meet paragraph 14(d) as a whole for her original reasons  namely  that
      the Appellant is unable to meet paragraph 14(d)(iii).

   9. Paragraph 14(d) of Appendix J reads so far as relevant as follows:-

           "Appendix J: Paragraph 14(d)
           (d)   Where both 'new entrant' and 'experienced worker' rates
                 are stated in Tables 1 to 5, the 'new entrant' rate will
                 only apply if
           (i)   the applicant:
           (1)   is applying as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and scores
                 points from the Post-Study Work provisions of Appendix A
           ........    or
           (4)   was under the age of 26 on the date the application was
           made;
           and
           (ii)  the applicant is applying for entry clearance or leave to
                 remain (not for indefinite leave to remain); and
           (iii) the applicant is not applying for a grant of leave that
                 would extend his total stay in Tier 2 and/or as a Work
                 Permit Holder beyond 3 years and 1 month".


  10. The other relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules are set out  at
      [7] of the Decision.  Given the narrowness of the issue, however, I do
      not propose to repeat reference to the other provisions there cited.

  11.  There  remains  therefore  only  one   issue   namely   the   correct
      interpretation  of  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  of  Appendix   J   to   the
      Immigration Rules.  That issue too is confined to  what  is  meant  by
      "applying for a grant of leave that would extend  his  total  stay  in
      Tier 2 .... beyond 3 years and 1 month".

  12. On this issue, I note that the parties' respective written submissions
      are surprisingly sparse.   The Appellant focusses on meeting paragraph
      14(d)(i)(1) and although it is said at [9] of the submissions that the
      Appellant meets the  requirement  of  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  "for  the
      following reasons" what follows appears directed to  the  requirements
      of paragraph 14(d)(i)(1) and not to the period of leave sought or  how
      the phrase referred to  at  [11]  above  is  to  be  interpreted.  The
      Respondent for her part submits that, as  the  Appellant  applied  for
      leave for five years, his salary  fell  to  be  assessed  against  the
      "experienced worker" rate.  There is no attempt  to  explain  why  the
      word "extend" is used at paragraph 14(d)(iii) nor is  there  reference
      to any policy or guidance to explain how the Respondent  construes  or
      applies this provision.

   Discussion and conclusions

  13. Paragraph 14(d)(iii) refers to a grant of leave which  would  "extend"
      an applicant's total stay in Tier 2 beyond three years and one  month.
      Whilst that provision is  not  entirely  free  of  ambiguity,  on  its
      meaning in immigration terms, that would normally be read as  applying
      to an "extension" of a grant of leave in the Tier 2 category.   It  is
      common ground that the Appellant applied to switch from Tier 4 to Tier
      2.  That is therefore not an  application  to  extend  leave  in  that
      category but rather an application to  switch  from  being  a  Tier  4
      migrant to the Tier 2 category ie a new  application  in  that  latter
      category.

  14. As I have indicated, however, the phrase is not free  from  ambiguity.
      Without the use of the word "extend", it would be  fairly  clear  that
      the Appellant could  not  meet  the  terms  of  paragraph  14(d)(iii).
      Although the application form does  not  state  the  period  of  leave
      sought, it does state at [L1b] that the Appellant is seeking leave for
      more than three years.  Generally, the period sought is linked to  the
      period of employment in the certificate of  sponsorship  and  in  this
      case that was five years (ending 18 January 2020).

  15. The Immigration Rules are  not  primary  legislation  and  should  not
      necessarily be interpreted as narrowly as a  statute  which  has  been
      subjected to intense scrutiny of successive drafts in  the  course  of
      Parliamentary debates.  The  word  "extend"  is  capable  of  a  wider
      meaning in other contexts.  It can mean not only to enlarge  something
      but also to include something or continue something.  On the basis  of
      that wider meaning, the phrase under consideration might be capable of
      meaning merely a grant of leave which "leads to" or "culminates in"  a
      period exceeding three years and one month.

  16. In light of the potential ambiguity, I have had regard to the guidance
      published by the Respondent when this provision was  first  introduced
      and the explanatory  statement  from  the  Immigration  Rules  in  the
      statement of changes  when  paragraph  14(d)(iii)  of  the  Rules  was
      introduced (6 April  2013).   In  relation  to  the  latter  (HC1039),
      paragraph 7.9 of the explanatory statement which deals with this  rule
      change does not refer to paragraph 14(d)(iii) at all.

  17. It is clear though that the new entrant rate  was  introduced  by  the
      updated  Code  of  Practice  for  sponsors.   Paragraph  9.1  of   the
      explanatory statement refers to a Statement of Intent in  relation  to
      the changes to Codes of Practice in this regard. That  might  tend  to
      support the Respondent's interpretation of this provision as it states
      (following  the  setting  out  of  what  are  now  the  categories  in
      14(d)(i)):-

           "In all cases, applicants will not be  classed  as  new  entrant
           employees if they are applying to extend  their  total  stay  in
           Tier 2 and/or as a work permit holder beyond 3 years and 1 month
           (the maximum grant for initial Tier 2 applications)"

      However, that  does  not  assist  for  three  reasons.   Firstly,  the
      Statement of Intent states  in  terms  that  it  represents  only  the
      Government's current intentions (in March 2013) and is not necessarily
      a definitive account of the  Codes  of  Practice.   Secondly,  in  any
      event, it still uses the same wording as the  provision  in  the  rule
      which does not  explain  what  is  meant  by  "extend".   Thirdly,  it
      suggests that the maximum grant for initial  Tier  2  applications  is
      three years and  one  month  which  might  also  militate  towards  an
      interpretation that any application beyond that  period  would  be  an
      extension application.

  18. Finally, the Code of Practice introducing this change  (which  appears
      to be that dated 1 October 2013 - Version 10/13) does not support  the
      Respondent's interpretation.  As with the explanatory statement to the
      Rules, that sets out the categories which mirror  those  in  paragraph
      14(d)(i) and then continues as follows:-

           "The pay thresholds for experienced workers are set at the  25th
           percentile for full-time employees in each occupation....  These
           pay thresholds apply to all other Tier 2  applicants,  including
           those who were previously classed  as  new  entrants  when  they
           apply to extend their total stay in Tier 2... beyond 3 years and
           1 month (the maximum grant for initial Tier 2  applications)..."
           [my emphasis]

      That then appears to envisage that the maximum period  for  which  the
      "new entrant" rate applies and for which an initial Tier 2 application
      could be  granted  is  the  period  of  three  years  and  one  month.
      Thereafter, those who applied for that maximum period as new  entrants
      would apply to "extend their  ...  stay".   At  that  point,  the  new
      entrant rate could not apply.

  19. That is consistent also with the terminology in paragraph  14(d)(iii).
      The relevance of paragraph 14(d) is to the rate of  salary  which  the
      applicant has to earn in order to satisfy the requirement for leave to
      remain as a Tier 2 migrant.  There are  two  options  for  which  rate
      applies - the "new entrant" rate and the  "experienced  worker"  rate.
      The Appellant is not an "experienced worker".  His  leave  up  to  the
      point of this application has been as a student.  As such, he is a new
      entrant to the Tier 2 category. He has not previously had leave either
      as a work permit holder.  If the question were asked therefore whether
      this applicant is a new entrant or an experienced worker,  the  answer
      would be obvious.

  20. For all of the above reasons, I am persuaded that the better  view  as
      to the interpretation of paragraph 14(d)(iii) is that the new  entrant
      rate applies.  The  Respondent  now  accepts  that  the  remainder  of
      paragraph 14(d) is satisfied.   Accordingly,  the  Appellant's  appeal
      succeeds.

  21. I also observe  that,  even  if  I  were  wrong  in  relation  to  the
      interpretation of paragraph 14(d)(iii),  the  Respondent  would  still
      appear to have the discretion to grant less than the period  specified
      in the certificate of sponsorship.  The Appellant's skeleton  argument
      for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal indicates at  [6]  that
      the Appellant's prospective employer, Pizza & Pizza Ltd, explained  to
      the Appellant that there had been other cases in the past  where  they
      had offered the rate  for  "new  entrants"  to  prospective  employees
      applying for a period longer than three years and one month and  those
      cases were successful.  That is  confirmed  also  in  the  Appellant's
      witness statement at [6].

Upper Tribunal Judge Smith
                                  APPENDIX

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

                            DECISION AND REASONS

      Background

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease  of  reference,
      we refer below to the parties as they were in the First-Tier  Tribunal
      albeit that the Secretary of State is  technically  the  Appellant  in
      this particular appeal.

   2. The Appellant is a  national  of  Pakistan  who  appeals  against  the
      Respondent's decision dated 13 February 2015 to refuse his application
      for leave to remain as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.   Prior  to  his
      application as a Tier 2 migrant, the Appellant was in the UK as a Tier
      4 general student.  The Respondent  refused  his  application  on  the
      basis that he was unable to satisfy paragraph 14(d) of Appendix  J  to
      the Immigration Rules as he was applying for a grant  of  leave  which
      would "extend his total stay in Tier 2" to more than three  years  and
      one month.  If paragraph 14(d) does not apply,  then  the  appropriate
      salary rate is that for "experienced workers" and not  that  for  "new
      entrants".  The new entrant rate at the relevant time and for the code
      which applies in this case was  �18,800  per  annum.  The  experienced
      worker's rate would be �26,000 per annum.  It is common  ground  that,
      since the Appellant's salary in  his  certificate  of  sponsorship  is
      �21,500 per annum, he could not then satisfy the Rules  as  a  Tier  2
      migrant.

   3. By a decision promulgated on 17 December 2015 ("the Decision"), First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Chamberlain allowed the Appellant's  appeal.   She
      did so on the basis that, since the Appellant's previous leave was  as
      a tier 4 student and although the certificate of sponsorship  referred
      to a job offer for more than three years and one month, this  did  not
      amount to an extension of stay in that category but was a  new  grant.
      As such,  the  Respondent  had  been  wrong  to  find  that  paragraph
      14(d)(iii) was not satisfied.  Since that was the only basis  for  the
      Respondent's refusal, she allowed the appeal.

   4. The Judge also made a finding at [11] of the Decision that  the  other
      requirements of paragraph 14(d) were satisfied.   In  her  application
      for permission  to  appeal,  the  Respondent  challenged  the  Judge's
      finding in relation to paragraph 14(d)(iii)  but  also  raised  a  new
      issue, namely that the Appellant could not satisfy paragraph  14(d)(i)
      of Appendix J.  The Respondent pointed out that the Appellant  is  not
      under the age of twenty-six and  therefore  does  not  meet  paragraph
      14(d)(i)(4) and nor, she contended did he meet any of the other  three
      sub-paragraphs of that Rule.

   5. Permission was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pooler on  3  June
      2016 on the basis  that  the  Respondent's  grounds  did  not  provide
      reasons why the Appellant could not satisfy paragraph  14(d)(i)(1)  of
      Appendix J.  Accordingly, the grounds were merely a disagreement  with
      the outcome.  Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul granted permission  however
      on the basis that the Judge  may  have  erred  in  treating  paragraph
      14(d)(iii) as being in the alternative  to  the  other  conditions  in
      paragraph 14(d)(i) to (iv) of Appendix J  rather  than  an  additional
      condition.  As we understand that grant, it is  a  reflection  of  the
      fact that the Judge may not  have  considered  whether  the  Appellant
      could also meet paragraph 14(d)(i) of Appendix J.

   6. The appeal comes before us to decide whether the Decision contains  an
      error of law and if so to either remake  the  decision  or  remit  the
      appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for redetermination.


      The Applicable Immigration Rules

   7. The sections of the Rules relevant  or  potentially  relevant  to  the
      Appellant's case are as follows (as set out in the Decision and so far
      as material to it and the parties' arguments):-

           "Appendix J: Paragraph 14(d)
           (d)   Where both 'new entrant' and 'experienced worker' rates
           are stated in Tables 1 to 5, the 'new entrant' rate will only
           apply if
           (i)   the applicant:
           (1)   is applying as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and scores
                 points from the Post-Study Work provisions of Appendix A
           ........    or
           (4)   was under the age of 26 on the date the application was
      made;
           and
             ii) the applicant is applying for entry clearance or leave to
                 remain (not for indefinite leave to remain); and
            iii) the applicant is not applying for a grant of leave that
                 would extend his total stay in Tier 2 and/or as a Work
                 Permit Holder beyond 3 years and 1 month".

           Appendix A: Post-Study Work
           78B   In order for a Resident Labour Market  Test  exemption  to
           apply for post-study work:
           a) the applicant must be applying for leave to remain
           b) the applicant must have, or have  last  been  granted,  entry
              clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain as:
              ....
              (6)      a Student
              ....
              and
           c) Where (b)(5) to (12)  apply,  the  applicant  must  meet  the
              requirements of paragraph 245HD(d) of these Rules


           Paragraph 245HD: Requirements for leave to remain

Submissions

   8. Ms Ahmad  relied  on  the  Appellant's  inability  to  meet  paragraph
      14(d)(i) of Appendix J on the basis that he was aged twenty-six  years
      at the date of application and was not therefore under twenty-six.

   9. Mr Gajjar submitted  that  paragraph  14(d)(i)  was  met  because  the
      Appellant could meet paragraph 14(d)(i)(1) of Appendix J.  He referred
      us to Appendix J as in force at the relevant time and we have set  out
      the provisions which he says are relevant to this  case  above.   That
      submission appeared to take Ms Ahmad by surprise.  She referred us  to
      the case of EG and  NG  (UT  rule  17:  withdrawal;  rule  24:  scope)
      Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC).  The relevant part of  the  headnote
      reads as follows:-

           "[3]  A party that seeks  to  persuade  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
           replace a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  with  a  decision
           that would make a material difference  to  one  of  the  parties
           needs permission to appeal.  The Upper Tribunal cannot entertain
           an  application  purporting  to  be  made  under  rule  24   for
           permission to appeal until  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  been
           asked in writing for permission to appeal and has either refused
           it or declined to admit the application"

      Having read the decision in that case, the circumstances of this  case
      are very different.  Whilst it is correct to point out that there  was
      no rule 24 notice before us,  the  effect  of  the  Respondent  having
      appealed the Decision is that the outcome would be either that we find
      a material error of law in which case the Decision is set aside and we
      would have to re-make it afresh or we find that there is  no  material
      error of law in which case the Decision stands (and  the  Respondent's
      appeal fails).   We  did  not  understand  Ms  Ahmad  to  dispute  the
      proposition put to her that, in the event of a setting  aside  of  the
      Decision and re-making, it would be open to us to consider what  seems
      to be an alternative basis now posited by  the  Appellant  whereby  he
      could meet paragraph 14(d).

Discussion and conclusions

  10. We start by observing a point which has only occurred to us since  the
      hearing which  concerns  the  version  of  the  Rules,  in  particular
      Appendix J, which applies.  The  archived  immigration  rules  suggest
      that the version of paragraph 14(d) of  Appendix  J  set  out  in  the
      Decision does not appear to be that in force as at  13  February  2015
      (the date of the Respondent's  decision).   The  differences  are  not
      substantial and do not appear to us to be material to the way in which
      either party puts its case.  We have in any event made directions  for
      further submissions to be made to us at the end of this  decision  and
      the parties therefore have the opportunity to respond  to  this  point
      before the final disposal of this appeal.  In order to avoid confusion
      in particular in relation to the numbering within paragraph 14(d),  we
      have continued to refer below to the version of that paragraph as  set
      out in the Decision even though that version may not  be  the  correct
      one.

  11. We start by considering the issue relating to paragraph 14(d)(iii)  of
      Appendix J.  This is dealt with by Judge Chamberlain at  [10]  of  her
      Decision as follows:-

           "I find that the Appellant applied for further leave to  remain.
           I find that he was previously in the United Kingdom with a  Tier
           4 General Student visa, as stated in the notice of decision.   I
           therefore find that he was not applying for a grant of leave  to
           "extend his total stay in Tier 2", as he has never been  granted
           leave before in Tier 2.  The period of the job stated on the CoS
           is in excess of three years and one month, but this  is  not  an
           application to "extend" his stay as a Tier 2  migrant.   He  has
           never been granted leave as a "Work Permit Holder".  I therefore
           find that the Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph
           14(d)(ii) of Appendix J as he did not apply for a grant of leave
           which would "extend" his total stay  in  the  categories  stated
           beyond three years and one month.  I find that  the  wording  of
           paragraph 14(d)(iii) indicates that the new entrant rate is  not
           to be used for applicants who are applying to extend their  Tier
           2 visas beyond the specified time period.  It does not refer  to
           applicants making their first application for a Tier 2 visa"

  12. We are satisfied that if this were the only issue the Respondent would
      not have demonstrated that the Decision  contains  an  error  of  law.
      Whilst paragraph 14(d)(iii) may well be ambiguous, it  is  capable  of
      bearing the meaning which the Judge found for the  reasons  she  gave.
      That  is  perhaps  reinforced  when  one  considers  what   is   under
      consideration in that paragraph, namely whether  a  person  should  be
      treated as a  "new  entrant"  for  Tier  2  purposes  or  "experienced
      worker".  That tends to suggest that a person such  as  the  Appellant
      who has not previously worked but has  been  in  the  UK  for  another
      purpose is a "new  entrant"  and  should  be  treated  accordingly  in
      relation to the salary applicable to him.

  13. We are though satisfied that the Decision contains an error of law  in
      relation to the second of the Respondent's grounds and the  one  which
      found favour with Judge Rintoul.  Having found that the Appellant  met
      paragraph 14(d)(iii), Judge Chamberlain continued as follows  at  [11]
      of the Decision:-

           "I find that the  Appellant  meets  the  other  requirements  of
           paragraph  14(d).   He  was  awarded  points  as  claimed  under
           Appendix A for sponsorship, and he is  not  applying  indefinite
           leave to remain.  Therefore I find that  the  new  entrant  rate
           applies to the Appellant's application"

  14. We have already noted at [4] above, that the Respondent had not  taken
      issue in her reasons for  refusal  letter  in  relation  to  paragraph
      14(d)(i) of Appendix J.  However, neither did she accept it  was  met.
      The finding in the Respondent's decision is that  paragraph  14(d)  is
      not met and  that  therefore  the  "experienced  worker"  salary  rate
      applies.  Although the reason given related to  paragraph  14(d)(iii),
      it was incumbent on the Judge if she rejected that reason to  consider
      whether that paragraph was otherwise met as, if it were not, then  the
      application would still fall to be considered against the "experienced
      worker" rate and would still fail.

  15. We have looked at the Appellant's  grounds  and  evidence  before  the
      Judge.   If that clearly showed that the Appellant argued his case  on
      the basis that paragraph 14(d)(i)(1) was met in the way that Mr Gajjar
      submitted before us and had produced  evidence  to  substantiate  that
      case, we might have found that there was no material error of  law  in
      spite of the lack of reasons given at [11] of the Decision.  As it is,
      we can find no written record of submissions on  this  point  nor  any
      evidence which would enable us to  conclude  that  the  provisions  of
      paragraph  14(d)(i)(1)  of  Appendix  J  read  with  Appendix  A   are
      undoubtedly met.  We therefore find that there is an error of  law  in
      relation to the Judge's finding that paragraph 14(d) of Appendix J  as
      a whole is met.

  16. We canvassed with Ms Ahmad and Mr Gajjar at the  hearing  what  course
      this appeal should take if we found an error of law as we  have  done.
      Both representatives accepted that this is a case  where  remittal  is
      not necessary and that the decision can be re-made in  this  Tribunal.
      We have noted at [9] above, that Ms Ahmad was taken by surprise by  Mr
      Gajjar's submissions which were not pre-empted by any rule 24  notice.
      We have also noted at [15] above, that there does not appear to be any
      evidence before us on  which  we  could  determine  whether  paragraph
      14(d)(i)(1) is met.   We therefore consider that the fairest course to
      both parties is to adjourn the appeal at  this  stage  and  to  permit
      further submissions and evidence to be produced.   We  therefore  make
      directions below to deal with the further progress of this appeal.


   DECISION


   The First-tier Tribunal Decision did involve the making of an error on  a
   point of law.  We set aside the Decision.


   In relation to the re-making of  the  decision,  we  make  the  following
   directions:-

     1. Within 14 days from the date of promulgation of this decision,  the
        Appellant shall file and serve submissions in writing  setting  out
        his position in relation to whether and, if so, how he is  able  to
        meet paragraph 14(d) of Appendix J (so far as  relevant  read  with
        Appendix A) to the Immigration Rules (and  which  version  he  says
        applies).  He shall also, by the same date, submit any evidence  on
        which he relies in support of those submissions.

     2. Within 14 days from receipt  of  the  Appellant's  submissions  and
        evidence (if any) at [1] above, the Respondent shall file and serve
        written submissions in response together with any evidence from the
        Appellant's file on which she relies.

     3. Within 7 days from receipt  of  the  Respondent's  submissions  and
        evidence (if any) at [2] above, the Appellant shall file and  serve
        written submissions in response.

     4. The appeal will thereafter be determined by  the  Tribunal  on  the
        papers  unless  either  party  notifies  the  Tribunal  with  their
        submissions that an oral hearing is required.

     5. The parties may apply to the Tribunal on notice to the other  party
        if they seek a variation of  these  directions  or  any  additional
        directions.
