Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bundock of Counsel, instructed by Elder Rahimi
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction


 1. The Appellant is 20 years old (date of birth 1 January 2000). He  is  a
    national of Afghanistan and his home area is the Nangarhar province.


 2. This is the remaking of the decision in the Appellant's protection  and
    human rights appeal, following the decision at the error of law hearing
    that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  and  that  its  decision
    should be set aside. The Upper Tribunal retained the  factual  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal, insofar as they relate to the rejection  of
    the Appellant's claimed fear of the Taliban (see paragraph  32  of  the
    error of law decision). It not being in issue that the Appellant  would
    face a real risk of serious harm, as defined in Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive, in his home province of Nangarhar,  the  Upper
    Tribunal identified the remaining issues for consideration on  remaking
    as relating to the reasonableness of internal relocation to Kabul.


 3. In summary, it is the Appellant's case that his personal  circumstances
    are such that it would be unreasonable to expect  him  to  relocate  to
    Kabul:


    1) he had lived in the Nangarhar province with his mother,  father  and
       older brother. He is not in touch with his family - his  father  and
       brother are dead and he lost contact with his mother  when  he  left
       Afghanistan;
    2) he has never lived in Kabul and does not know anybody there;
    3) he has  been  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  Post-Traumatic  Stress
       Disorder ["PTSD"], with symptoms of complex  PTSD.  The  nature  and
       extent of his symptoms are such that he will be unable to  fend  for
       himself in Kabul, both in the short and long term;
    4) his social functioning in the United Kingdom ["UK"], limited  as  it
       is, is dependent upon the extensive help he  receives  from  others.
       This help would not be available in Kabul; and
    5) his mental health symptoms are likely to exacerbate  on  return  and
       there is no prospect of him being able to access any  mental  health
       care, partly because of the limitations of such care  in  Kabul  and
       partly because the assistance he would need in order to  access  any
       such care will not be available to him.


 4. In the refusal  decision,  dated  17  September  2019,  the  Respondent
    concluded that it is reasonable to expect the Appellant to relocate  to
    Kabul because:


    1) he is a single adult male, who speaks Pashto and is in good  health.
       He will therefore be able to find lawful employment; and
    2) he has family in Afghanistan, "such as your  mother  who  you  could
       reside with on your return" [54].
 5. At the remaking hearing, Mr Whitwell stated that the Respondent accepts
    the Appellant's mental health  diagnosis  and  did  not  challenge  the
    nature and extent of the associated symptoms.


    Hearing


    Preliminary issues


    Error of law decision


 6. Mr Bundock, who was not Counsel at the error of law hearing, sought  to
    persuade us that we should vary the error of law findings. We indicated
    to the parties that we were minded to hear the argument de bene esse.


 7. Mr Bundock submitted that the conclusion of the  Upper  Tribunal,  that
    the First-tier Tribunal had erred in its  assessment  of  the  evidence
    relating to the Appellant's mental health and the extent of  assistance
    he required in order to function  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  materially
    tainted its conclusions not only in relation to humanitarian protection
    but also in relation to Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention  on
    Human Rights ["ECHR"].

 8. He submitted that, given he was only seeking to extend the ambit of the
    error of law findings rather than challenging the legal basis for those
    findings, this is the sort of very exceptional case  envisaged  in  the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal in AZ (error of law:  jurisdiction;  PTA
    practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC).


 9. This point was first notified to the Respondent and the Tribunal in  Mr
    Bundock's skeleton argument, which was filed and served on the  day  of
    the hearing. Mr Whitwell submitted that  the  point  was  being  raised
    unacceptably late. The argument could, and should, have been raised  by
    Counsel at the error of law hearing. However,  even  allowing  for  the
    change of approach that can occur as a result of a change  of  counsel,
    there was no good reason why it was first being raised on  the  day  of
    the remaking hearing, some nine months after the date  of  promulgation
    of the error of law decision. Given the absence of notice, he submitted
    that he  was  not  in  a  position  to  address  the  Tribunal  on  the
    substantive issues arising in relation to Articles 3 and 8.

10. We  informed  Mr  Whitwell  that,  if  we  were  minded  to  allow  the
    Appellant's application to vary the error of  law  decision,  we  would
    permit the Respondent to make submissions either in  writing  or  at  a
    resumed hearing.

11.  Given  our  findings  in  relation  to  internal  relocation  and  our
    consequent decision in relation to humanitarian protection, it has  not
    been necessary for us to reach a conclusion on the application to  vary
    the error of law decision.

    Application to adduce further evidence

12. Mr Bundock sought a short adjournment in order to prepare  an  addendum
    witness statement for the Appellant. He required the assistance of  the
    court interpreter to draft that statement. Mr Whitwell did  not  object
    and we permitted this course of action. On reviewing  the  contents  of
    the witness statement, we  determined  that  there  was  no  procedural
    unfairness arising out of the use of the court interpreter  to  prepare
    the statement because:


    1) the contents of the statement were  uncontentious  and  addressed  a
       narrow point of clarification;
    2) Mr Whitwell had already indicated that he had no questions  for  the
       Appellant on his previous witness statements; and
    3) there were no other witnesses giving oral evidence.


    Oral evidence and submissions


13. At the start of the hearing, we confirmed that, in light of the medical
    evidence, we would treat the Appellant as a vulnerable witness.


14. The Appellant gave evidence with the assistance of the interpreter.  He
    adopted his witness statements and there was  no  examination-in-chief.
    Mr Whitwell cross-examined him only in relation to the contents of  the
    statement taken on the day of the hearing and the extent of that cross-
    examination was limited to a few questions.

15. In closing, Mr Whitwell relied upon the refusal decision and Mr Bundock
    his  skeleton  argument.  Both  advocates  made  helpful  supplementary
    submissions. We address, during the course of this decision, the issues
    they raised in their closing arguments.


    Evidence


16. In reaching our decision we have taken into account the:


    1) Appellant's bundle (pages 1-340);
    2) Appellant's witness statement, dated 4 December 2020;
    3) Respondent's bundle; and
    4) oral evidence of the Appellant.


    Legal framework


17. Paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules, reflecting Article  8  of  the
    Qualification Directive, provides that the Secretary of State will  not
    make a grant of humanitarian protection if, in part of the  country  of
    return, a person would not face a real risk of suffering serious  harm,
    and the person can reasonably be expected to stay in that part  of  the
    country.


18. In assessing whether a person can reasonably be expected  to  relocate,
    the question to be answered is whether it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect an Appellant, who faces a real risk of serious harm in one  part
    of his country, to move to a less hostile part. If  the  Appellant  can
    live a relatively normal life,  there  judged  by  the  standards  that
    prevail in his country of nationality generally, and if  he  can  reach
    the less hostile part without undue hardship or  undue  difficulty,  it
    will not be unreasonable to expect him to move  there  (Januzi  v  SSHD
    [2006] UKHL 5).

19. Once the Respondent has identified a location for return, it is for the
    Appellant to prove why that location would be unduly harsh  but  within
    that burden, the evaluation exercise should be holistic.

20. In AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020]  UKUT  00130  (IAC),  the
    Upper Tribunal  gave  guidance  as  to  the  factors  relevant  to  the
    assessment of the reasonableness of relocation to Kabul at �  253(iii)-
    (v).

    Findings


21. The finding of the First-tier Tribunal, that the Appellant was born  on
    1 January 2000, was retained. We therefore find that the Appellant  was
    17 years old when he left Afghanistan and was 20 years old at the  date
    of the remaking hearing.


22. In his asylum interview and witness statements, the Appellant  gave  an
    account about  his  life  experience  in  Afghanistan.  We  accept  his
    evidence because:


    1) it was not challenged by the Respondent;
    2) his account contained the level  of  detail  we  would  expect  from
       somebody describing his own personal  experience  as  opposed  to  a
       fabricated or embellished account;
    3) his account was not undermined  by  any  inconsistency  or  inherent
       implausibility;
    4) in our view, the lack of credibility  in  relation  to  his  account
       about his family's interaction with the Taliban does not  taint  his
       account about his life and that of his family in Afghanistan.


23. We therefore make the following findings. He was born in a  village  in
    the Surkh Rod District in the Province of Nangarhar. He lived with  his
    parents and his older brother. His father farmed two fields that he had
    inherited from his own father. His father worked the  land  by  himself
    with the help of his sons. The farm was of a size  that  permitted  the
    family to be self-sufficient with some limited excess produce that they
    sold within the local community.


24. The Appellant speaks Pashto  but  cannot  read  or  write  because  his
    education was limited to occasional attendance at the village Madrassa.
    He spent his  time  either  assisting  his  father  with  the  farm  or
    accompanying his mother when she went  shopping  or  when  she  visited
    friends. He does not have a Tazkera. Prior to  leaving  Afghanistan  to
    come to the UK, he had never left the Nangarhar province. He has  never
    been to Kabul and does not know anybody in Kabul.

25.  The  Appellant's  account  about  his  contact  with  his  family   in
    Afghanistan is interwoven with his account  about  persecution  by  the
    Taliban. Before us, he adopted all his witness statements and  did  not
    resile from his  earlier  accounts.  The  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal being retained, we reject his  account  that  his  father  and
    brother were killed by the Taliban. However, we accept his account that
    he has not been in contact with his family  since  leaving  Afghanistan
    and that he will not be able to resume contact with them if returned to
    Kabul. We reach these conclusions for the following reasons:


    1) his family live in the Nangarhar province. The evidence  before  the
       Upper Tribunal in AS (Kabul) was that  there  is  a  proportionately
       high civilian casualty and death rate in Nangarhar compared  to  the
       rest of Afghanistan (see in particular � 8, 52, 61  and  94)  and  a
       high number of Internally Displaced People (see in particular  �  93
       and 106);
    2) our  findings  in  relation  to  the  living  circumstances  of  the
       Appellant's family are such that it is unlikely that they would have
       ready access to telephone or Wi-Fi communication;
    3) our finding that the Appellant does not have his Tazkera will impede
       his ability to obtain access to a mobile telephone (see the evidence
       before the Upper Tribunal in AS (Kabul), � 128).


26. Even if, contrary to our findings, the Appellant were able to establish
    some form of communication with his family, we find that they would  be
    unable to provide him with any financial  support,  given  our  finding
    that the family business is little more than self-supporting.


27. There is no evidence that  the  Appellant  suffers  from  any  physical
    illness or disability and we therefore conclude that he is  well,  save
    for the physical effects of his mental health impairment. We accept the
    evidence of the witnesses in relation to the Appellant's mental  health
    (his diagnosis, symptoms and the effect of those symptoms on his day-to-
    day functioning) because:


    1) it was not challenged by the Respondent;
    2) the qualifications and/or experience of the witnesses; and
    3) the witnesses' knowledge of the Appellant is derived  from  frequent
       and long-term contact with him and demonstrated by the detail within
       their witness statements and reports.


28. We make the following  findings  based  on  that  evidence.  Given  the
    uncontentious nature of the evidence, we do  not  specify  the  source,
    save where it is necessary to avoid confusion or to place our  findings
    in context.


29. The Appellant has a diagnosis of PTSD, with symptoms of  complex  PTSD.
    The symptoms include disassociation and problems of  recall;  low  mood
    and anxiety; problems with emotional regulation; disturbance  by  noise
    and crowded places; flashbacks; insomnia,  which  leads  to  migraines;
    avoidant  behaviour;  sadness;  negative  self-concept   and   problems
    sustaining relationships. He has a history of suicidal ideation,  which
    fluctuates rather than being ever-present. There are recorded incidents
    of self-harm: he saw his GP in November 2019, having deliberately burnt
    himself with a lighter and in  April  2020,  having  intentionally  cut
    himself on his arms.

30. The effect on the Appellant's day-to-day life is  significant.  He  has
    the benefit of  practical  and  therapeutic  assistance,  described  by
    psychotherapist Mr Bentley as a "combination of therapeutic,  practical
    and social input" (report  dated  25  October  2019).  This  assistance
    commenced in 2018 and continues to date.

31. The nature of the therapy he receives is  in  the  form  of  one-on-one
    sessions. Up to August 2020, this help was provided  by  mental  health
    professionals employed by Freedom from  Torture.  This  help  ended  in
    August  2020,  partly  as  a  consequence  of  the   difficulties   the
    organisation encountered with the  provision  of  services  during  the
    current pandemic and partly because the Appellant himself, as a  result
    of the change in the provision of services and a change in  therapists,
    struggled to engage. His therapy resumed when  The  Children's  Society
    stepped in to take over his care. He  is  currently  receiving  therapy
    from a Qualified Volunteer Therapist working  with  that  organisation.
    The therapy continues to be in the form of one-on-one sessions and  the
    therapist is of the opinion that the Appellant needs to  continue  this
    work in order to enable him to develop the skills necessary to  process
    and adjust his responses  to  physical,  mental  and  emotional  trauma
    (letter dated 5 November 2020). In terms of medication,  the  Appellant
    is currently taking citalopram.

32. The  Appellant  relies  upon  practical  assistance  from  the  Refugee
    Association and the Children's Society in order to carry out basic day-
    to-day tasks. The assistance provided compensates for  the  Appellant's
    inability, as a result of his mental  health  symptoms,  to  cope  with
    minor difficulties and basic  organisational  tasks.  Since  2018,  the
    Appellant  has  had  one-on-one  support  from  volunteers  with  these
    organisations. One of those helpers, in her  letter  dated  21  October
    2019, described the Appellant's  inability  to  cope  with  stress  and
    manage practical tasks. She  stated  that  he  struggles  to  take  the
    initiative and become stressed by the  smallest  of  challenges.  In  a
    letter dated 17 October 2019,  a helper  described  how  the  Appellant
    becomes "withdrawn  and  overwhelmed  into  inaction"  in  response  to
    stress. In a letter dated 29 August 2019, another helper described  how
    the  Appellant  struggles  with  independent  travel,  budgeting,  meal
    planning and cooking. This helper described how she  had  to  accompany
    the Appellant on his journey to his therapy sessions for a period of 10
    months before he was able  to  make  the  journey  on  his  own.  Those
    struggles continue to date. One of  the  workers  with  the  Children's
    Society, in a letter dated 10 November 2020, described how he still has
    to accompany the Appellant to  solicitor's  appointments.  This  worker
    also speaks to the Appellant on the telephone twice a  week,  providing
    emotional support.

33. A volunteer with Freedom from Torture, who provides short holidays  for
    clients of Freedom from Torture,  developed  a  relationship  with  the
    Appellant through this charitable work.  He  is  not  a  mental  health
    professional and so his perception of  the  Appellant  is  that  of  an
    ordinary person coming into contact with the Appellant.  In  a  letter,
    dated 9 November 2020, the author described the Appellant  as  follows:
    "[the Appellant] is a likeable boy, but he is seriously  disabled.  His
    problem seems to be a level of distraction that deprives  them  of  the
    ability  to  act  or  apply  himself,  even  in  simple  matters.  [The
    Appellant] lacks the  level  of  enterprise  necessary  to  look  after
    himself or interact with others. With some effort one can engage him in
    conversation or in a game, but the moment he is left  to  himself  [the
    Appellant] sinks back into a  kind  of  sad  reverie.  His  mind  seems
    somewhere else and he seems completely absorbed."

    Conclusions

34. Applying this factual matrix to the country guidance in AS (Kabul),  we
    conclude that it would be unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
    relocate to Kabul. We reach this conclusion for the following reasons.


35. The Appellant would arrive in Kabul with no established social  network
    nor any connections that could be fostered in order to develop  such  a
    network. His experience of life in Afghanistan was as a  child,  living
    in a remote rural setting, entirely dependent upon his family. He is no
    experience of life as an adult in a city. His family would be unable to
    provide remote assistance, financial or emotional.

36. He would have access  to  the  basic  level  of  support  provided  for
    returnees, in the form of temporary accommodation, which would last two
    weeks. He would be provided with limited funds, which he would need  to
    use to pay for  accommodation  thereafter  and  to  feed  himself.  The
    accommodation would be in a 'tea house'. Whilst this accommodation,  as
    found in AS Kabul, is adequate for most  single  male  returnees,  this
    Appellant - with his mental health difficulties, lack of experience  of
    independent living and lack of  knowledge  of  city  life  -  would  be
    vulnerable to the exploitation and violence described at  �  75  of  AS
    (Kabul). In AS  (Kabul),  the  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  funds
    available to returnees would be capable of lasting between four and six
    weeks, after which the returnee would need to find employment. However,
    the caveat identified, namely that if a person is not astute  or  lacks
    knowledge of local prices, applies in the case of  this  Appellant.  He
    would therefore need to be able to find employment more quickly.

37. We conclude that that there is no real prospect of the Appellant  being
    able to secure employment, whether in the short or long term. As he  is
    without a Tazkera, he would need to compete for work as  a  manual  day
    labourer. His demeanour, as a result of his  mental  health  condition,
    would not be attractive to employers. Moreover, he would  be  competing
    for work with men with experience of labouring work, some of whom would
    have their own tools. Even if he were able to secure  such  employment,
    we conclude that he would not be capable of carrying it out  given  the
    symptoms associated with his mental health difficulties.

38. In the long term, these impediments to securing  employment  would  not
    ameliorate because his mental health difficulties will prevent him from
    establishing a social network that might assist  him  and  he  will  be
    without the therapy required to improve his circumstances. As found  in
    AS (Kabul),  many  inhabitants  of  Kabul  suffer  from  mental  health
    problems and there is a lack of facilities and professionals  available
    to provide treatment.  Further,  even  if  help  were  available,  this
    Appellant is dependent upon others to help him access that help and  he
    will not have that support in Kabul.

39. Given our findings and conclusions, we do not need to go on to consider
    the argument put forward by Mr Bundock that the Appellant would face  a
    serious and individual threat to  his  life  or  person  by  reason  of
    indiscriminate violence on return to Kabul.
