                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and history of appeal

    1. This is the appeal of AS, a citizen of Afghanistan accepted as born [
       ] 2000, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 13 October
       2016 dismissing his appeal against the Home  Office  refusal  of  his
       asylum claim of 27 November 2015.

    2. The Appellant was aged 14 when he arrived in the UK and thus aged  16
       at the date of the appeal hearing below. His claim was summarised  in
       the refusal letter in these terms. He lived with his paternal  uncle,
       JK, in Afghanistan, where he worked as a mechanic. A paternal  uncle,
       QS, was a Taliban commander. QS took him  for  training  on  using  a
       machine gun, alongside his cousin, JK's son. In 2013 QS came  to  his
       house with three members of the Taliban and requested  that  he  help
       them carry guns and ammunition to a madrassa. Shortly thereafter  the
       police came to his home with foreign troops and arrested him and beat
       uncle JK. He was questioned at the police station in Pul-e-Khumri and
       released the same day, and told that he  should  inform  the  police,
       rather than help the Taliban, if he  was  again  requested  to  carry
       guns. He feared that if he returned to Afghanistan he would be forced
       to join the Taliban by QS. Uncle JK arranged for an  agent  to  bring
       him to the UK. He claimed to have arrived hidden  in  a  lorry  on  8
       November 2014; he claimed asylum on 11 December 2014.

    3. His application was rejected because the Secretary of State  did  not
       accept it was  credible,  and  alternatively  because  even  were  he
       telling the truth, he would be able to  relocate  to  Kabul.  He  was
       given the details of the Red Cross if he wished to  contact  them  to
       pursue his family's whereabouts: the refusal letter stated  that  the
       Red Cross would not deal with a request made via the Home Office

First-tier Tribunal decision

    4. On appeal he gave further details of the account  above  although  it
       remained the same in outline. Having heard oral  evidence  from  him,
       the  Judge  found  his  evidence  to  be  coherent,  consistent   and
       plausible, having  regard  to  the  background  country  information.
       Matters  that  had  concerned  the  decision  maker  were,   properly
       analysed, understandable or too minor to count against  him:  it  was
       unsurprising that he did not know his uncle's date of  birth  or  who
       had informed against him to the security forces, or that he would not
       have paid great attention to what QS  said  about  the  Taliban.  The
       First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the  Appellant   had   family   in
       Afghanistan: his uncles QS and JK, his aunt, cousin, and half-sibling
       twins.

    5. Going on to determine  the  reality  of  his  fears,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal accepted, bearing  mind  the  expert  report  of  Mr  Foxley
       relating  to  the  use  of  informers,  the  prevalence   of   forced
       recruitment and the lack of effective state protection, that he had a
       well founded fear of persecution in his home area,  either  from  the
       Taliban who would forcibly recruit him or beat him if he  refused  to
       join them, or from the Afghan police  and  military  authorities  who
       would be likely to punish him in the light of his defiance  of  their
       enjoinder to disassociate with the Taliban.

    6. Moving on to consider whether internal  relocation  would  provide  a
       reasonable solution to  his  difficulties,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       found that, whilst unattached children would face numerous dangers on
       a return to Afghanistan as shown by the Country  Guidelines  decision
       of AK Afghanistan, AS would not face life alone in  Kabul.  JK's  son
       had also faced forcible recruitment, and the expert  evidence  showed
       that JK would not be able to prevent a recurrence given the  failings
       of state  protection.  Accordingly,  given  that  JK  had  previously
       assisted AS himself showing how seriously he took his extended family
       responsibilities having taken in not only AS but also his Appellant's
       mother's twins after she died, it could be  safely  assumed  that  JK
       would have relocated to Kabul in order to protect his  own  son,  and
       that the Appellant could now reside with them there as he had done in
       the past. It was not suggested that the Appellant  had  lost  contact
       with JK or that he would need assistance in tracing him.

    7. It was in the best interests of the Appellant  to  be  reunited  with
       family members in Kabul rather than living in a country where he  had
       been unable to locate his father (and who  there  was  no  reason  to
       think had any interest in  seeing  him  again),  notwithstanding  his
       supportive  foster  family  here,  educational   progress   and   his
       involvement with the local cricket club.

Challenge to the First-tier Tribunal decision

    8. Grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contended,  drawing  out  the
       themes within them, that:

             a) Internal relocation should have been assessed  by  reference
                to the Appellant's own circumstances, not  by  reference  to
                the probabilities of his family's movements;

             b)  In  finding  that  JK  took  his  family   responsibilities
                seriously, the First-tier Tribunal failed to take account of
                relevant evidence that that uncle had required the Appellant
                to stop attending school  and  engage  in  child  labour  to
                support his family financially, working long hours  for  six
                days a week, once sustaining a head injury whilst digging  a
                well; and in finding that JK held sufficient assets to  fund
                relocation to Kabul, made a finding unsupported by  evidence
                given the Appellant's own evidence was  merely  that  family
                assets had been sold to fund his journey to the UK;

             c) In  finding  that  Kabul  would  be  a  reasonable  internal
                relocation solution  because  of  the  likely  residence  of
                family members there, no  account  had  been  taken  of  the
                Appellant's lack of contact  with  JK  since  departing  the
                country and the finding that there was  no  suggestion  that
                family tracing assistance  was  needed  was  unsupported  by
                evidence;

             d) Mr Foxley's expert opinion was that there was  a  risk  that
                the Appellant would face detention and questioning at  Kabul
                airport on return and that it was "possible that an enhanced
                questioning process may  be  initiated  leading  to  further
                disclosures and  possibly  ...  detention":  this  had  been
                overlooked;

             e) There was no  evidence  to  support  the  finding  that  the
                Appellant's father (believed to be resident in the UK) would
                not take an interest in the Appellant were he to be located.



    9. Judge Deans granted permission to appeal for the First-tier  Tribunal
       on 13 December 2016,  expressly  referencing  the  grounds  regarding
       internal relocation and risk on return from the  security  forces  at
       the border, though without placing  any  limitation  on  the  grounds
       considered arguable.

Error of law hearing and decision

   10.  The  Upper  Tribunal  stated,  giving  Country  Guidelines   in   AA
       (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT  16  (IAC)  at  [92]
       that unaccompanied children would generally face "a risk  of  serious
       harm, inter alia from indiscriminate  violence,  forced  recruitment,
       sexual violence, trafficking and a lack of adequate arrangements  for
       child protection." The issue in this appeal is primarily whether  the
       Appellant would indeed be unaccompanied on a return to Afghanistan.

   11. At the error of law hearing I ruled that there were  material  errors
       of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal: in  particular,  I
       accepted that the second to  fourth  grounds  of  appeal  as  I  have
       summarised them above were made out in their entirety.

   12. The first ground of  appeal  was  not  wholly  well  founded.  It  is
       perfectly possible to imagine cases  where  different  considerations
       might arise vis-�-vis the reasonableness of internal relocation for a
       child as opposed to an adult, and where  the  existence  of  a  child
       within a family unit might render relocation that would not be unduly
       harsh into something unreasonable:  for  example  where  the  parents
       could work and subsist but where a child would be  denied  access  to
       education. In such  a  scenario  it  would  be  wrong  to  adjudicate
       internal relocation by the standards of what might be expected of  an
       adult. I accordingly accept the underlying proposition of  the  first
       ground, that what might be reasonable for an adult might  not  be  so
       for a child.

   13. However, I did not accept that such an error  was  made  out  on  the
       facts of this case. On the Appellant's own  account,  his  uncle  and
       uncle's son had indeed  suffered  serious  problems  because  of  the
       Taliban and  it  was  not  irrational  to  infer  that  there  was  a
       likelihood (to the real risk standard) that they would have relocated
       away from their home area.  It  is  not  a  misdirection  of  law  to
       consider the possibility that  the  availability  of  family  support
       decreases the likelihood of relocation being unreasonable.

   14. That said, I do consider that one aspect of the first ground is  made
       good, which is that one cannot proceed from  the  simple  probability
       that the uncle would have left his home area to the  conclusion  that
       he would necessarily have moved to  Kabul,  rather  than  to  another
       urban centre or place where he might have  some  familial  or  ethnic
       link. A finding made without supporting evidence is clearly unlawful.
       Furthermore, even if the uncle is residing  in  Kabul,  there  is  no
       evidence to suggest that an  unaccompanied  seventeen-year  old  with
       minimal knowledge of the capital city and who lacks  contact  details
       for him would have the resources to track  him  down:  at  least  not
       without the very support from the Secretary of State by way of family
       tracing that was in practice ruled out here.  Accordingly,  whilst  I
       accepted the First-tier Tribunal's underlying thesis that a  rational
       prognostication as to the availability of  family  support  in  Kabul
       would be relevant to internal relocation, I do not  accept  that  its
       application of that thinking was lawful.

   15.  The  second  ground  plainly  had  force.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
       considered that it  would  be  reasonable  (on  the  basis  that  the
       Appellant could find  his  uncle  in  Kabul)  for  their  prior  life
       together to resume. The question of internal relocation falls  to  be
       assessed domestically as part of the Immigration  Rules  (Rule  339O)
       though in terms representing a transposition  of  Article  8  of  the
       Qualification Directive. The enquiry thus  primarily  focuses,  as  a
       matter of European Union law, on the question as to whether  internal
       relocation is "reasonable", an open-textured question upon which  the
       section 55 duty of safeguarding and promoting child  welfare  plainly
       bites: indeed Recital (12) to the Directive sets out that "The  'best
       interests of the child' should be a primary consideration  of  Member
       States when implementing this Directive."

   16. UNHCR in Child Asylum Claims (an important resource  referenced  from
       time to time by Home Office Guidance) at �55 make the point that

           "The 'reasonableness test' is  one  that  is  applicant-specific
           and, thus, not related to a  hypothetical  'reasonable  person'.
           Age and the best interests of the child are among the factors to
           be considered in assessing the viability of a proposed place  of
           internal relocation  including  their  treatment  of  the  risks
           facing children in institutional care."

       And at �56

           "What is merely inconvenient for an adult might well  constitute
           undue hardship for a child, particularly in the absence  of  any
           friend or relation. Such relocation may violate the human  right
           to life, survival and development, the  principle  of  the  best
           interests of the child, and the right not  to  be  subjected  to
           inhuman treatment."

   17. Article 19(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  sets  out
       that:

           "1. States  Parties  shall  take  all  appropriate  legislative,
           administrative, social and educational measures to  protect  the
           child from all forms of physical or mental violence,  injury  or
           abuse,  neglect  or   negligent   treatment,   maltreatment   or
           exploitation, including sexual  abuse,  while  in  the  care  of
           parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other  person  who  has  the
           care of the child."

   18.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did   not   take   account   of   whether
       considerations such as the forced labour visited upon  the  Appellant
       by his uncle in assessing whether relocation predicated on the  prior
       arrangements continuing would be reasonable,  having  regard  to  the
       legal matrix identified above.

   19. As to the third ground, I accepted that  there  was  no  evidence  to
       indicate that family tracing support  would  not  have  assisted  the
       Appellant: or to put  it  another  way,  it  was  clear  that  family
       tracing, if viable, would have been an affirmative advantage  to  the
       Appellant. It  might,  for  example,  have  located  his  uncle.  The
       Appellant stated that he had sought to contact  him  using  community
       links, which is often a process which doubtless often offers the best
       prospects of finding a family member via networks within a  diaspora.
       Lord Toulson stated in MA and AA (Afghanistan) [2015]  UKSC  40  �73:
       "If the appellant has identified people who might be able to  confirm
       his account, but the  respondent  has  not  pursued  that  lead,  the
       tribunal might fairly regard the appellant's willingness to  identify
       possible sources of corroboration as a mark of credibility, but  this
       would be an evidential assessment  for  the  tribunal.  There  is  no
       presumption of  credibility."  Given  the  Appellant's  evidence  was
       generally accepted as credible, his unsuccessful attempts  to  locate
       his  family  himself  should  have  been  considered  as   at   least
       potentially corroborative of his inability to do so.

   20. The fourth ground related to the evidence provided from Dr  Giustozzi
       relating to the possibility of interrogation  on  return  that  might
       reveal information regarding the  Appellant's  association  with  the
       Taliban. There is no reference to this  in  the  decision,  and  that
       represented a failure to take account of  a  relevant  consideration,
       given that generally favourable credibility findings were made as  to
       the Appellant having received arms training from them.

   21. The final ground related to the possible presence of the  Appellant's
       father in the United Kingdom. Given that he has not been located, and
       that the First-tier Tribunal's comment as to his possible willingness
       arises in the context of some comments relating  more  to  a  general
       "best interests" assessment than to an enquiry into  his  entitlement
       to international protection, it was difficult to  see  that  anything
       materially turned on that point.

   22. I accordingly found that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  and
       that the appeal was to be re-heard. No challenge having been made  to
       the positive credibility  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I
       considered it appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to retain the matter
       and finally determine  it  in  the  light  of  the  totality  of  the
       evidence.

Continuation hearing and decision

   23. No oral evidence  was  called  before  me.  Some  additional  country
       evidence was provided regarding circumstances in Afghanistan now.  Mr
       Jarvis made submissions with  realistic  brevity,  stating  that  the
       country evidence did not necessarily impel the  conclusion  that  the
       Appellant would be at risk at the airport though  acknowledging  that
       that seemed to be a possibility from the expert report, which  was  a
       balanced and fair review of the available evidence.  The  Appellant's
       relocation to Kabul, risk on return aside, would not reach  the  high
       threshold recognised by the House of Lords in AH  Sudan.  Ms  Chapman
       relied on her skeleton argument, which is available on file,  arguing
       that the expert's conclusions were well-reasoned  and  reliable,  and
       determinative of the appeal. If border risk was  not  accepted,  then
       there was a real chance that the Appellant would face life  in  Kabul
       as an unaccompanied minor, which would be unduly harsh.

   24. The critical aspect  of  the  expert  evidence  is  where  Mr  Foxley
       considers the risk on return at Kabul airport. His opinion is that it
       would be reasonable to  assume  the  Appellant  would  undergo  brief
       questioning at the airport though one could not be  confident  as  to
       the detail, scope, scale or intent of that process. Nevertheless  one
       could  anticipate  that  the  Appellant's  background  including  his
       uncle's Taliban membership and the subsequent police interest in  the
       family that ensued might well be exposed, either because of enquiries
       set off by the  documents  he  carried,  his  own  revelations  under
       questioning, or because his name or  that  of  his  father  had  been
       recorded in a centrally accessible database.  Dissembling  could  put
       him at greater risk of harm. Any such enquiries could be  anticipated
       without formal  due  process  and  arrest,  arbitrary  detention  and
       interrogation was possible.

   25. It seems to me, applying  the  necessary  anxious  scrutiny  to  this
       aspect of the appeal, and having  regard  to  the  appropriate  lower
       standard of proof, that there would be a real chance of the Appellant
       facing persecution for reasons of attributed political opinion  on  a
       return to Kabul. In Sivakumaran [1988] 1 AC 958 the  House  of  Lords
       accepted that the same standard of proof applied for  prognosticating
       future risks of harm in an asylum claim as prevailed  in  extradition
       cases: when deciding whether an applicant's fear of  persecution  was
       well-founded it is sufficient for a decision-maker  to  be  satisfied
       that there was a reasonable degree of likelihood that  the  applicant
       would be persecuted for a Convention reason if returned  to  his  own
       country. In this regard, there is no significant  difference  between
       such expressions as "a reasonable chance", "substantial  grounds  for
       thinking", and "a serious possibility" as  means  of  describing  the
       degree of likelihood. These days the concept is often  summarised  as
       whether  there  is  a  "real  chance"  of  the   feared   persecution
       eventuating.

   26. It seems to me, reading Mr Foxley's opinion in the broader context of
       the established facts  in  this  case  as  found  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, that this relatively low threshold of risk is  established.
       His opinion is consistent with the  country  evidence  generally  and
       seems to me to be balanced and objective; nowhere is it  controverted
       by any positive evidence to the contrary. He does not state  that  he
       is certain that the worse case scenario amongst  those  he  envisages
       will necessarily occur, but he clearly considers  it  to  be  a  real
       possibility.

   27. A person as to whom the Afghan security  forces  hold  suspicions  of
       Taliban associations may well face detention  and  mistreatment:  the
       following extracts, taking an example from recent Home Office Country
       Information and Guidance addressing Afghanistan:  Prison  conditions,
       states that

           "6.1.1 The UN Assistance Mission  in  Afghanistan  (UNAMA)/  The
           Office of the High Commissioner for Human Right  (OHCHR)  report
           of January 2013, 'Treatment  of  Conflict-Related  Detainees  in
           Afghan Custody: One Year On', reported:

                'UNAMA found that multiple credible and  reliable  incidents
                of torture and ill-treatment had occurred particularly in 34
                facilities  of  the  ANP,  ANBP   and   NDS.   UNAMA   found
                sufficiently  credible  and  reliable  evidence   that   NDS
                officials  at   two   facilities   systematically   tortured
                detainees mainly to obtain confessions and information.'"

   28. Given the Appellant's history as a recipient of  arms  training  from
       the insurgents in Afghanistan, and his family associations, the  kind
       of enquiries that can be foreseen as taking place on his return might
       very well place him the category  of  conflict-related  detainee  who
       might be  tortured  in  order  to  obtain  information  or  elicit  a
       confession from him. As he has been detained by the police already in
       his home area,  there  must  be  a  real  risk  that  the  suspicions
       previously held with respect to him will be renewed,  either  because
       of enquiries made  of  his  home  area  in  order  to  establish  his
       identity, or due to his name  or  that  of  his  uncle  appearing  on
       centralised records. At that point there is a  real  risk  that  ill-
       treatment such as that reported above as occurring widely  in  Afghan
       detention centres would be visited upon him, because of political  or
       religious opinions attributed to him by his captors, given  the  view
       taken of the Taliban cause.

   29. I accordingly accept that the Appellant would  face  a  well  founded
       fear of persecution on return to Afghanistan.

ANONYMITY ORDER

The Appellant's claim involves asylum issues and  so,  unless  and  until  a
tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.
No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or
any member of his family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and
to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
