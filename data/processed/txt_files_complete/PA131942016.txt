Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born  in  1975.  He  appeals
    with permission the 3rd  July  2017  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Ransley to dismiss his protection appeal.










    Anonymity Order


 2. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim for international protection is that
    he is a former Muslim who has now converted to Christianity and as such
    would face a real risk of persecution in his home country  for  reasons
    of his religious belief.


 4. The Respondent  did  not  believe  him,  and  nor  did  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. In dismissing his appeal the  Tribunal  states  that  it  has
    considered  all  of  the  material  evidence  [�11]  and  the   country
    background reports, including the Respondent's Country Information  and
    Guidance [�13].  It notes that the main issue  in  the  appeal  is  the
    credibility of the Appellant [�17] and with that in mind embarks  on  a
    summary of his immigration history thus far. He arrived in the  UK  and
    claimed asylum in August 2002. By September 2003 he was 'appeal  rights
    exhausted', having been found to be untruthful by an adjudicator of the
    Immigration Appellate Authority  (now  Judge  Coates).   The  Appellant
    remained in the country. In July 2016 he made a 'fresh claim' which was
    now the subject of this appeal. The Tribunal properly  directed  itself
    that in those  circumstances  its  starting  point,  per  Devaseelan  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 00702, was  the
    findings of Judge Coates [�25-28].


 5. The determination then turns to  consider  the  evidence  of  Christian
    faith. This consisted of the statement of  the  Appellant  himself,   a
    certificate of baptism, a certificate of confirmation (with photographs
    of the ceremony), a letter from Revd Canon Daniel Burton and letters in
    support from friends [�31].  The Tribunal finds  inconsistency  in  the
    Appellant's evidence. At an interview in October 2016 he had said  that
    when he moved to Stoke-on-Trent he had still been a devout Muslim. With
    that in mind the Tribunal did not find it credible that he  would  walk
    into a church "out of curiosity".   Nor did it find it credible that he
    would continue to attend church services in Stoke and  Birmingham  when
    on his own evidence he could not understand what was  being  said.   At
    interview the Appellant had failed to answer questions put to him about
    Christianity correctly [�38].  The Appellant gave inconsistent  answers
    about whether he had a court interpreter at a hearing  in  2003  [�41],
    failed to produce a key witness [�43] and  gave  evasive  answers  when
    asked to denounce the Prophet Mohammed [�44].


 6. Two Dorodian witnesses were produced. The  Revd  Caroline  Hewitt  said
    that she had known the appellant since Autumn 2015. She thought he  had
    been introduced by another member of the congregation but was unable to
    recall who. She had spoken with him about his life but  was  unable  to
    recall any details, for instance whether he had won his appeal before a
    judge in the past or whether he had any  family  in  Afghanistan.  Revd
    Hewitt acknowledged that she did  not  see  the  Appellant  outside  of
    church and so was unable to say whether he  was  leading  "a  Christian
    life"[�46-49]. Revd Burton said that the knowledge that  the  Appellant
    had lied in the past would not change his assessment of whether he is a
    Christian today. His attendance at  church  was  the  'best  test'  and
    people can change.  Revd  Burton  sees  the  Appellant  other  than  at
    services only at social events organised by the Church.  He  said  that
    he does not question the motives of newcomers to the  church,  even  if
    they are failed asylum seekers [�51-54].  Of this evidence the Tribunal
    accepted that both Revd Hewitt and Revd Burton had acted in good  faith
    [�56]. It was not however prepared  to  attach  significant  weight  to
    their evidence.  Revd Hewitt does not know the Appellant well and  does
    not see him outside of church. Their assessments were both based on  no
    more than the fact that he turns up to church.


 7. Taking all of the evidence in the round and applying the lower standard
    of proof the Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim to  be  a  genuine
    Christian  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed  [�58].  It  appears  to  be
    implicitly accepted that the Appellant has  been  attending  church  as
    claimed, and that he has been baptised and confirmed.


 8. The Appellant now appeals on the following grounds:


              i)  The  Tribunal  failed  to  make  findings  on  a  specific
                 submission made, namely that the  Appellant  would  face  a
                 real risk of harm even if he is not a genuine Christian;


             ii) Failure to take  material  evidence  into  account  in  the
                 context of the credibility assessment;


            iii) Failure to apply the guidance in Dorodian (01/TH/1537).


 9. I note that the written grounds were not drafted by Mr Brown, who  made
    helpful and sensible submissions at the hearing before me.


10. I was not provided with a written response from the Secretary of  State
    but at the hearing Mr Bates defended the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on all grounds.




    Discussion and Findings


    Ground (i)


11. The written grounds submit that the First-tier Tribunal  was  asked  to
    consider whether the Appellant would be at risk in  Afghanistan  simply
    by virtue of having attended Church in Stoke and Birmingham and  having
    been baptised and confirmed.   It is submitted that  those  facts  gave
    rise to a real risk of the Appellant being perceived to be a Christian.




12. In pursuing this ground Mr Brown faced a number  of  difficulties.  The
    first was that he could not demonstrate that the  submission  had  been
    made at all, since there was no written evidence of it (for instance in
    the form of a skeleton argument) and he himself had  not  been  counsel
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  It  does   not   feature   in   the
    determination or, as far as I could see,  the  record  of  proceedings.
    Setting that to one side and accepting for the sake of argument that it
    is a Robinson obvious point which should perhaps have  been  considered
    in the global appraisal of risk, I find  that  there  are  other,  more
    significant obstacles for Mr Brown.


13. The argument rests on the Appellant having to  reveal  when  questioned
    that he had  been  attending  church.  The  written  grounds  refer  to
    "country material" confirming that those  who  have  been  absent  from
    Afghanistan a long time being asked about their lives abroad. Mr  Brown
    did not know what country material the writer may have  been  referring
    to. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal refers to having  read  the  country
    background reports including a CIG, there are no documents  at  all  in
    the court file that might answer that description.  I  have  looked  at
    the Respondent's website listing the various 'Country  Information  and
    Guidance' reports. Of the eight listed  the  only  one  with  potential
    relevance was the January 2018  Country  Policy  and  Information  Note
    Afghanistan: Afghans perceived as 'Westernised' (version 1.0). I  could
    find no reference therein to people being questioned about the  details
    of their lives abroad, nor to any perceived Christianity.


14. I can only conclude that there was no evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to the effect that the Appellant would be reasonably likely to
    be examined about the details of his life in the UK.  He has  lived  in
    this country for many years. Presumably he has done other  things  than
    attending church. If asked about what the UK was like there would be no
    compulsion upon him to disclose that he had  attended  church:  he  can
    talk about all the other things he has done.  If  he  is  not  genuine,
    this would not be  a  HJ  (Iran)  situation,  since  he  would  not  be
    compelled to conceal something fundamental to his identity.  Nor is  it
    akin to the position of Iranian returnees, since the evidence in  those
    cases is that on arrival in Tehran they are  specifically  asked  about
    their asylum claim.


15. Ground (i) therefore fails. It has not been shown that the argument was
    put to the Tribunal, but  even  if  it  was  it  was  not  an  argument
    supported by the country material or law.




    Ground (ii)


16.  There are two planks to the second ground advanced.


17. First, it is submitted that in reaching its  finding  that  it  is  not
    credible that this man would enter a church simply "out  of  curiosity"
    the Tribunal failed  to  take  specific  evidence  into  account.  That
    evidence was that the Appellant  had  been  destitute  and  reliant  on
    charity at the time.  Because he had no outstanding claims he  was  not
    being provided with NASS support. He said that he had been invited into
    the church where he had been given new clothes. That was why he went.


18. I have read the evidence on this point. At Q20  of  his  interview  the
    Appellant says:

         "I was in NASS accommodation. Opposite the college was a church. I
         went there one day, I was so welcomed by people in the church I was
         so surprised. People were so kind"

    At Q21-22 the interviewer asks why he chose to go into a church and the
    Appellant replies:

         "I went in there to see what it was like, everyone is curious when
         they see something they don't know anything about"

19. In his witness statement at paragraph 6 the Appellant says this:

         "When I was in Stoke there was a Church opposite my college, and
         one day, I was invited to go in by the people there. It was
         approaching Christmas. I went in, having seen lots of people go in,
         so I was interested to go in"

20. It is quite evident from this evidence that ground  (ii)  is  not  only
    without merit, it is positively misleading. The Appellant did not claim
    that he went into the church in order to receive charity. He  was  not,
    on his evidence,  destitute.  He  was  living  in  NASS  accommodation.
    Moreover his evidence was, just as Judge Ransley characterised it, that
    he went into the church because he was "curious".


21. The second part of ground (ii) is that the Tribunal failed to weigh  in
    the balance any of the Appellant's evidence. It is submitted  that  the
    Tribunal simply adopted the position taken by  the  Respondent  in  her
    'reasons for refusal' letter, and did not appear to consider any of the
    evidence offered by the Appellant to rebut the analysis  therein.    It
    is submitted "there is a clear discrepancy here between the standing of
    the parties which goes to the heart of the determination...the lack  of
    equal consideration  of  the  parties  goes  to  the  fairness  of  the
    outcome".  In terms of particulars the grounds point to the Appellant's
    evidence in his witness statement about  the  problems  he  encountered
    with an interpreter.


22. I assume that the passage to which the grounds refer is paragraph 5  of
    the Appellant's 5th April 2017 witness statement in which  he  explains
    that the interpreter at the asylum interview was of Pashto  origin  and
    so was unfamiliar with  the  terms  used  by  the  Appellant  in  Dari.
    Although the Appellant had left the interview confident that  they  had
    understood each other, when he received the refusal letter he saw  that
    some of the things he said had not been interpreted properly:


         "I think the issues are that there  are  some  religious  talk,  he
         spoke about the Muslim way,  rather  than  the  Christian  way.  He
         didn't understand Bible  terms,  as  these  are  Farsi.  A  lot  of
         Christian terms I know, I am  familiar  with  in  Farsi,  which  is
         similar to Dari"


    At paragraph 15 the Appellant adds:


         "The question on the 10 commandments, is one where there  was  some
         difficulties in  the  translation  of  Bible  terms.   He  couldn't
         understand the 'commandments' aspect, which is a religious term".


23. It is true that this evidence does not feature  in  the  determination.
    Although  paragraphs  33  and  39  make  specific  reference   to   the
    Appellant's rebuttal statement it is not apparent  that  this  specific
    passage was taken into account. I am not  satisfied  that  this  was  a
    material omission, because the Appellant's  difficulties  in  answering
    questions is not a matter that appears to have attracted much weight in
    the  overall  balancing  exercise,  meriting  only  brief  mention   at
    paragraph 38.  The point made there is that after having attended bible
    classes for some time the Appellant was  not  able  to  answer  'basic'
    questions.  No examples are given by the Tribunal but I  see  from  the
    refusal letter that this included the Appellant's suggestion  that  the
    gifts bestowed upon Jesus by the  three  wise  men  may  have  included
    sheep, but he "wasn't sure".   I would further note that the  Appellant
    and  his  Dorodian  witnesses,  in  particular  Revd  Burton,  had  all
    emphasised that 'textbook' knowledge of the Bible was not of particular
    relevance in the assessment of 'true' faith.  It is therefore difficult
    to see how this one omission could have made  much  difference  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.




    Ground (iii)


24. Ground (iii) was, quite sensibly, the only one pursued by any vigour by
    Mr  Brown.    The  point  is  made  that  the  Appellant  produced,  in
    accordance with Dorodian, two  ordained  ministers  who  were  able  to
    speak, without contradiction, to the Appellant's regular attendance  at
    church. What the Tribunal did with this evidence was to accept at  face
    value the honesty of Revd Burton and Revd Hewitt, but to  diminish  the
    weight to be attached to their assessment of the Appellant's  faith  on
    the grounds that neither knew him particularly well. Mr Brown submitted
    this  to  be  an  impermissible  extension  of   Dorodian.   He   asked
    rhetorically whether ministers are expected  to  follow  all  of  their
    congregants home to check that they are living  "Christian"  lives.  In
    his submission it placed an unreasonable burden on Christian ministers.


25. I agree with Mr Brown that it would be wrong if the Tribunal sought  to
    introduce a new test to the effect that Dorodian  witnesses  must  know
    the appellant they support particularly well. Their function is  simply
    to attest to his attendance at Christian worship in Church.  I  am  not
    however satisfied that this was what the First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
    case sought to do.


26. The case of Dorodian is now of some vintage, but it remains  good  law.
    The principles set out in that Iranian conversion case are  simple  and
    well-known. A person who has declared  themselves  to  be  a  Christian
    should be expected to  evidence  this  by  his  regular  attendance  at
    church, and that attendance should be confirmed before the Tribunal  by
    the attendance at court of one or more ordained ministers of  a  church
    of this country.  The reason that this is important is because  in  the
    context of Iran in 2001 it was "church  membership,  rather  than  mere
    belief, which may lead to risk".  As already discussed  in  ground  (i)
    there was no evidence  that  simply  having  attended  church  in  this
    country would place the Appellant at risk of persecution in Afghanistan
    today. In order to succeed he had to demonstrate that he was actually a
    Christian.  The Dorodian 'guidelines' read as follows:

         a)       no-one should be regarded as a committed Christian who is
         not vouched for as such by a minister of some church established in
         this country: as we have said, it is church membership, rather than
         mere belief, which may lead to risk;


         b)       no adjudicator should again be put in the position faced
         by Mr Poole in this case: a statement or letter, giving the full
         designation of the minister, should be sent to the Home Office at
         least a fortnight before the hearing of any appeal, which should
         give them time for at least a basic check on his existence and
         standing;


         c)       unless the Home Office have accepted the appellant as a
         committed church member in writing in advance of the hearing, the
         minister should invariably be called to give oral evidence before
         the adjudicator: while witness summonses are available,
         adjudicators may reasonably expect willingness to do so in a
         genuine case;


         d)       if any doubt remains, there is no objection to
         adjudicators themselves testing the religious knowledge of the
         appellant: judicial notice may be taken of the main beliefs and
         prayers of the Church.

27. These guidelines are frequently misquoted. The suggestion is often made
    that the production of an ordained witness must compel  the  conclusion
    that the appellant in question is in fact a Christian. That is not what
    they say. The effect of (a) is that as  a  minimum  the  appellant  who
    wishes to assert conversion  to  Christianity  should  produce  such  a
    witness. He who fails to do this will not be able to  demonstrate  that
    he is practising Christianity. It is clear from (d) that  the  evidence
    of the witness cannot itself be determinative. It is for the  Judge  to
    make that final analysis.


28. In this case Judge Ransley had before her an appellant who had  already
    been found to be profoundly untruthful by an earlier Tribunal. He  gave
    what she considered to be inconsistent and implausible  evidence  about
    his claimed conversion and when asked to denounce the Prophet  Muhammad
    had "ducked the question".   She did not  doubt  the  evidence  of  the
    Dorodian witnesses that the Appellant had  been  attending  church,  or
    that he had been baptised and confirmed, but  was  not  persuaded  that
    they could speak to any more than that. Had the witnesses been able  to
    say that they had  spent  any  significant  period  of  time  with  the
    Appellant outside of formal services or lessons, she  would  have  been
    able to attach greater weight to their faith in his.


    Decisions


29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.


30. There is an order for anonymity.

24th April 2018
