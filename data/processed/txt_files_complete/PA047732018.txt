                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Burns (the judge)  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 18th May 2018.

 2. The Appellant is a female Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnicity born  30th
    March 1989.

 3. She claimed asylum on 3rd October 2017 on  the  basis  that  she  is  a
    member of a particular social group in that she would  be  at  risk  of
    being the victim of an honour killing if returned  to  Iraq.   This  is
    because she had sex with her boyfriend without being married,  and  the
    Appellant's family refused permission for her to marry him.  After  the
    second request was refused the Appellant was told she had to marry  her
    paternal cousin.  She said that she did not want to and her father said
    he  would  kill  her  if  she  did  not.   The  Appellant   left   Iraq
    approximately one week after her father had threatened to kill her.

 4. The international protection and human rights claim was refused by  the
    Respondent on 28th March 2018.

The First-tier Tribunal Hearing

 5. The appeal was heard on 14th May 2018.  The judge heard  evidence  from
    the Appellant.  The judge considered credibility in accordance with the
    structured approach set out at paragraph 339L of the Immigration rules.
     A finding was made that the Appellant had made her claim for asylum at
    the earliest possible time in the UK, but  the  judge  found  that  the
    Appellant's claim to fear being the victim of  an  honour  killing  ran
    counter to general information, and the Appellant had  not  established
    her general credibility.

 6. As the judge found the Appellant to be an incredible witness it was not
    accepted that she would be at risk from her family if returned to Iraq.
     The judge did not find that the Appellant had a relationship with  her
    boyfriend which culminated in her losing her  virginity.   It  was  not
    accepted that the Appellant had been betrothed to her cousin  and  that
    she had rejected a marriage proposal from her cousin.  The  appeal  was
    dismissed on all grounds.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. It was submitted that the judge had erred in assessing credibility.  At
    paragraphs 45-48 the judge  had  made  findings  that  the  Appellant's
    evidence was counter to background information.  It was submitted  that
    the judge's findings are perverse, as the reasoning would suggest  that
    no woman in the IKR above 18 is unmarried, is able to work rather  than
    marry, be unchaperoned, as a potential victim of honour crime  be  able
    to avoid harm, and be able to overcome strict family restrictions.   It
    was submitted that the judge applied far too rigid a criteria and  held
    the objective evidence to be a script to follow rather than  a  general
    overview.

 8. It was submitted that the judge had erred in considering coherency.  At
    paragraphs 49-50 the judge found it incoherent  for  the  Appellant  to
    contemplate  marrying  her  boyfriend  as  there  was  "a  pre-existing
    promise" for her to marry her cousin.  It was submitted that the  judge
    had misunderstood this, and the evidence contained  in  the  interview,
    and Appellant's witness statement, was  that  it  was  only  after  her
    boyfriend had proposed for a second time, that her father told her that
    she had to marry her paternal cousin.  The Appellant in  oral  evidence
    misunderstood when asked about this at the hearing, and the  judge  had
    accepted at paragraph 38 that no adverse inference should be drawn from
    this potential inconsistency.

 9. It was submitted that it was entirely speculative of the judge to  find
    that there existed "a pre-existing promise" for the Appellant to  marry
    her cousin, and as this  was  the  basis  of  finding  the  Appellant's
    account not coherent, the assessment was flawed.  In addition there was
    a contradictory finding made by the judge at paragraph 53 in  which  it
    was found that the Appellant had not been betrothed to her  cousin  and
    it was not accepted that she had rejected a marriage proposal from  her
    cousin.

10. It was contended that the judge had erred in considering  plausibility.
    The judge found at paragraph 51 that it was difficult  to  accept  that
    the Appellant had US$10,000 to fund her journey to the  United  Kingdom
    and  the  Appellant's  claim  that  she  had  a  lack  of  freedom  and
    controlling family did not "sit well with her claim  that  she  applied
    for a visit visa without her father's permission."

11. It was submitted that the  Appellant  when  interviewed  had  made  her
    position clear in answering question 187 when she was asked how she was
    able to have so much freedom and allowed to apply for a visit  visa  to
    the UK given her claim that her family were  tribal  and  strict.   The
    Appellant replied that education was a part of life and her father  was
    educated to a high level, as was the Appellant, and her family did  not
    mind  education,  but  was  strict  about  other  social  matters  like
    marriage.   It  was  submitted  that  the  plausibility  findings   are
    inadequate.

Permission to Appeal

12. Permission to appeal was granted by  Judge  Simpson  in  the  following
    terms;

         "2.  Permission to appeal is granted for the following reasons:

             (i)  there was  arguable  (sic)  that  the  treatment  of  the
                  background   country   information   in   assessing    the
                  credibility of the Appellant's claim as a  female  Kurdish
                  Iraqi national from Sulamaniyah to face risk on return for
                  the sake of honour, because she had fallen in love with  a
                  man from a different tribe with  whom  she  had  lost  her
                  virginity when betrothed to a  paternal  cousin,  was  not
                  reasonably sustainable, there appearing a  cherry  picking
                  and rigidity of  assessment  of  that  evidence,  arguably
                  devoid of comprehension that the norms of social practices
                  cited may be more fluid depending say on class,  financial
                  need etc., notwithstanding there  further  appearing  that
                  there (sic) was accepted that the  Appellant  was  someone
                  who had been educated to university level,  and  following
                  university had gone on  to  hold  professional  employment
                  (paragraphs 45-48);

             (ii) further arguable that the assessment of the coherence and
                  plausibility of the Appellant's claim, more generally, was
                  not sustainable, consistent or adequately reasoned,  there
                  appearing missing a comprehension of the human  condition,
                  particularly when concerning human relations, the business
                  of falling in love and maternal/parental love  not  always
                  adding up to the  proclaimed  norms  and  practices  in  a
                  society or the laws of rationality (paragraphs 49-53);

             (iii)    all grounds arguable."

13. Following the grant of permission to  appeal,  directions  were  issued
    that there should be an oral  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law such that the decision  must
    set aside.

My Analysis and Conclusions

14. At the oral hearing Mr Azmi relied and expanded upon the  grounds  upon
    which permission to appeal had been granted.

15. Mr Williams submitted that the judge  was  entitled  to  make  findings
    based on the evidence, and adequate and sustainable reasons  for  those
    findings had been given.  Even if the judge was mistaken as to  whether
    there was a pre-existing agreement  for  the  Appellant  to  marry  her
    cousin, this was not material because there  were  a  number  of  other
    credibility findings made, and the grounds amounted to  a  disagreement
    with conclusions properly reached by the judge.

16. Dealing firstly with the  Appellant's  challenge  to  credibility,  the
    judge at paragraphs 45-48 gives reasons  why  the  Appellant's  account
    runs counter to what the judge describes as background  information  or
    evidence.  The judge summarises  at  paragraphs  27-37  the  background
    information contained in section B of the Appellant's bundle.

17. At paragraph 46 the judge finds that the  Appellant's  account  is  not
    consistent with background  information  which  indicates  that  within
    traditional families  in  the  IKR,  the  paternal  cousin  would  have
    expected marriage when the female was between 15  and  18  years.   The
    Appellant's account was that she finished university when aged 24,  and
    her boyfriend made the first proposal when she was 28 years of age.

18.  At  paragraph  47  the  judge  describes  the  background  information
    confirming that women are rarely  seen  out  on  the  streets  and  not
    permitted to have boyfriends which  runs  counter  to  the  Appellant's
    claim that she met her boyfriend on the mountain or in a caf� and  that
    they met frequently.  Although the mountain  was  secluded  they  would
    travel in a car and the judge found her  unchaperoned  journeys  to  be
    counter to the background evidence.

19. At paragraph 48 the judge found  it  was  contrary  to  the  background
    evidence that the Appellant was not harmed and managed to escape  after
    her father had refused permission for her to marry her  boyfriend,  and
    she had not agreed to marry her cousin.  It was counter  to  background
    information that the Appellant's  mother  would  directly  disobey  her
    husband's instructions and let her daughter leave the home.

20. In my view there is force in the submission made by  Mr  Azmi  on  this
    issue.  The judge does  appear  to  have  applied  a  rigid  view  when
    considering the background evidence.  I find  the  description  of  the
    background evidence as "a general overview" in the Grounds of Appeal to
    be a fair description.  It cannot be the case that there are  no  women
    in the IKR who disobey their father or husband, and no  women  who  are
    educated to degree level and work before marrying.

21. It is a correct  approach  to  consider  an  Appellant's  account  with
    reference to background evidence, but in this case I am persuaded  that
    the judge has taken too rigid a view, and not adequately  reasoned  why
    the Appellant's account cannot be accepted simply because it  does  not
    conform to background evidence.  I find this to be an error of law.

22. With reference to coherency, I find that  the  judge  was  mistaken  in
    finding that there was a pre-existing  promise  for  the  Appellant  to
    marry her cousin.   The  Appellant's  evidence  in  interview  and  her
    witness statement was that this was raised after  the  second  proposal
    from her boyfriend was refused. The finding at  paragraphs  49  and  50
    that there was a pre-existing promise for the Appellant  to  marry  her
    cousin does appear to be inconsistent with the conclusion at  paragraph
    53 in which the judge rejects the Appellant's account that she has been
    betrothed to her cousin and that she has rejected a proposal.

23. In conclusion I do not find that the judge has  provided  adequate  and
    sustainable reasons for finding  the  Appellant  to  be  an  incredible
    witness.  The decision is therefore unsafe and must be set aside.

24. Both  representatives  agreed  at  the  hearing,  when  I  reserved  my
    decision, that if a material error of law was found  as  contended,  it
    would be appropriate to remit the appeal back to the FtT  to  be  heard
    afresh.

25. I have considered  paragraph  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements, and find that the appropriate course is to remit the appeal
    back to the FtT, because of the nature and  extent  of  judicial  fact-
    finding that will be necessary in order for this decision to be remade.

26. The appeal will be heard at  the  Birmingham  Hearing  Centre  and  the
    parties will be advised of the time and date in due course.  The appeal
    is to be heard by an FtT Judge other than Judge Burns.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that  it
is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal with no findings of  fact  preserved.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her or any member of

her family.  This direction  applies  both  to  the  Appellant  and  to  the
Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.
