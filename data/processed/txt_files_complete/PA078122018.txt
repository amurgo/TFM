                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant

                                     MS
                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Harper, Counsel instructed by Luqmani Thompson
                    and Partners Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Afghanistan born in 2000. On  the  24th
    August 2018 the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Manyarara)  allowed  his
    appeal  on  humanitarian  protection  and  human  rights  grounds.  The
    Secretary of State now has permission to appeal against that decision.




 2. The Respondent MS arrived in this country in 2014 and  claimed  asylum.
    It is not in dispute that he was then  a  minor.  He  was  subsequently
    refused asylum but granted  'discretionary  leave'  in  line  with  the
    Secretary of State's published policy.   MS appealed  the  decision  to
    refuse protection but  his  appeal  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge O'Garro) in its decision of  the  10th  November  2015.
    On the 22nd June 2017 MS made  an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain. That was refused  on  the  25th  May  2018.    MS  appealed  on
    protection and human rights grounds. So it was that when the case  came
    before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Manyarara) for  the  second  time
    the questions to be addressed by it were:

          i) Whether MS was entitled to refugee status;

         ii) If not whether he was entitled to humanitarian protection;

        iii) Whether in either case his appeal must  be  allowed  on  human
             rights grounds.

 3. It is convenient if I address the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    the grounds, reply and  my  findings  with  reference  to  those  three
    questions.




    Issue (i): is MS a refugee?

 4. In its 2015 decision the First-tier Tribunal  had  decided  not.  Judge
    O'Garro found that the account advanced, that MS was at risk  from  the
    Taliban because his brother Hassanjan had joined the police force,  was
    a fabrication.

 5. In 2018 MS produced further evidence to try and satisfy Judge Manyarara
    that he had now discharged the burden of proof and shown himself to  be
    at risk. This consisted primarily of an expert report by Mr Tim  Foxley
    MBE, but there were also letters, said to have been sent by the Taliban
    to MS's uncle.

 6. Judge Manyarara accepted,  having  properly  directed  himself  to  the
    appropriate tests, that Mr Foxley was an expert on security  issues  in
    Afghanistan [�45].  Having read his report in  its  entirety,  however,
    the Tribunal was not satisfied that it added anything substantially new
    to the analysis undertaken by Judge O'Garro in 2015. Judge O'Garro  had
    expressly accepted that the Taliban were active in MS's home  area  and
    that they would be prepared to target Afghan police officers  or  their
    families. She had however rejected the evidence that MS's  brother  had
    been a policeman, or that he was at risk as a result.  Judge  Manyarara
    did not consider  that  new  evidence  had  been  produced  capable  of
    justifying a departure from that finding, and so dismissed  the  appeal
    on asylum grounds.  In respect of the letters, the  Judge  conducted  a
    Tanveer Ahmed assessment, and having done so,  declined  to  place  any
    weight upon them.

 7. MS has not challenged that finding.  The decision  that  he  is  not  a
    refugee stands.




    Issue (ii): is MS entitled to humanitarian protection?

 8. At the date of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal there  were  two
    country guidance decisions of potential relevance to this appeal.   The
    first was AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT  00163(IAC)  in
    which it was held that the level  of  indiscriminate  violence  in  the
    country, even in the  worst  affected  provinces,  was  not  such  that
    Article 15 (c) of the Qualification Directive  was  generally  engaged.
    The second was AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG  [2018]  UKUT  00118
    (IAC) in which the Tribunal  re-evaluated  the  security  situation  in
    Kabul, and considered the city's reasonableness as a place of potential
    internal relocation. The Tribunal  held  that  although  the  level  of
    violence had increased it had not yet reached Article 15(c) levels; nor
    could it be said that in general,  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  a
    healthy adult male to relocate to Kabul, although  each  case  required
    consideration of the individual's personal circumstances.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal directed  itself  to  consider  both  of  those
    decisions, as well as a number of other authorities relating to Article
    15(c) and Afghanistan. It goes on however, to look beyond  the  general
    guidance given. In  particular  the  Tribunal  directs  itself  to  the
    acknowledgement in AK that travel between Kabul and smaller  towns  and
    villages may be dangerous, with indiscriminate dangers such as pressure
    mines, Taliban presence and/or other insurgents.  In  AK  the  Tribunal
    held that such dangers would have to be  evaluated  on  a  case-by-case
    basis [�73].  Having regard to the  (apparently  uncontested)  evidence
    that the Taliban are active in MS's home area the  First-tier  Tribunal
    concludes [at �71] that it would not be safe for MS to try and make the
    journey from Kabul to his home area.

10. The determination goes on:

         "I find that the appellant however last lived in Afghanistan  as  a
         minor. It is clear that the background  information  shows  that  a
         person's personal circumstances are relevant  to  consideration  of
         whether they would be able to live in Kabul. I therefore find  that
         whilst the Appellant is a healthy young adult  who  has  previously
         suffered from PTSD but does  not  have  any  active  mental  health
         issues, the appellant has last lived in Afghanistan as a child  and
         he  has  no  transferrable  skills  with  which  to  establish   an
         independent  life  for  himself  in  Kabul  without  the  risk   of
         destitution. He does not have a support network in  Kabul  and  his
         mother lives in an area that is known to have Taliban  activity.  I
         find that the appellant would face a risk if  he  were  to  try  to
         travel to his home area from Kabul".

11. Having found that MS  cannot  safely  return  to  his  home,  and  that
    internal flight would  be  unduly  harsh,  the  appeal  is  allowed  on
    humanitarian protection grounds.

12. The Secretary of State submits  that  the  Tribunal's  conclusions  are
    unsupported by reasoning. The Tribunal found no risk in the home  area,
    and therefore any finding as to the reasonableness of  internal  flight
    would be immaterial: "the appellant would be returning  to  his  family
    and therefore not be without familial support or risk of  destitution".
    The Secretary of State further submits that the Tribunal  appears  here
    to have failed to take  material  evidence  into  account,  namely  the
    evidence of MS's elder brother who  has  returned  to  Afghanistan  and
    travelled to see their mother in the village: if he is able to  do  it,
    it is not clear why MS is unable to do so.

13. In reply MS points out that the Tribunal conducted a careful review  of
    the applicable country guidance. In AK the Upper Tribunal  had  advised
    decision-makers to look carefully at the safety of travel between  city
    and country, and this is what the First-tier Tribunal did,  finding  at
    its paragraph 71 that it would not be  safe  to  expect  MS  to  travel
    between Kabul and his home area in Hisarak where, it is  agreed,  there
    remains considerable Taliban  activity.   The  Secretary  of  State  is
    mistaken (as indeed was First-tier Tribunal Judge  Saffer  who  granted
    permission) if he believes that MS's brother  travels  to  Hisarak.  He
    does not. His evidence was that it is too dangerous for him  to  travel
    to Hisarak so he only goes  as  far  as  Jalalabad.   His  mother  then
    travels from the village to see him there.

14. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal was entitled, applying  the
    guidance in AK, to consider the safety of the  roads  leading  to  MS's
    home village. I am further satisfied that there can be no quarrel  with
    its finding that these roads are unsafe and would give rise to  a  risk
    of serious harm for MS: that the Taliban were active in that  area  had
    been accepted by Judge O'Garro, and if further support for her findings
    were needed it was to be found in the detailed report of Mr Foxley.  As
    for the point that the Tribunal  had  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    details of the evidence from MS's elder brother it  would  appear  that
    the drafter of the grounds did the same: his evidence was not  that  he
    travelled to Hisarak, but  rather  to  Jalalabad.    He  had  expressly
    stated [for instance in his witness statement  dated  12th  July  2017]
    that he has never returned to the village because it is too risky.  His
    mother is not targeted because she is an elderly woman, and she travels
    to meet him wherever he is.

15. There being no  challenge  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  finding  on
    internal flight, I am satisfied that its decision in respect of Article
    15(c) is free of material error and I uphold that decision.







    Article 8

16. Given my findings on humanitarian protection  I  can  be  brief.   MS's
    representatives had presented a detailed and voluminous bundle  dealing
    with the Article 8 private and family life that MS has developed  since
    he arrived in this country aged 14.   Although the  determination  does
    not refer in terms to that evidence, the Tribunal allowed the appeal on
    human rights grounds on the basis that there would be 'very significant
    obstacles' to MS's integration in Afghanistan, that finding being  made
    on the basis of the same factual  matrix  pertinent  to  the  issue  of
    humanitarian protection.   There  is  no  discrete  challenge  to  that
    conclusion and for that reason I uphold  the  Tribunal's  reasoning  on
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.

17. I would add that if this decision were to be subject to onward  appeal,
    the matter of Article 8 'outside of the rules' remains  unresolved  and
    would need to be considered in any final disposal.




    Anonymity

18. MS seeks international protection. Having had regard to Rule 14 of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law and it is upheld.

20. There is an order for anonymity.
