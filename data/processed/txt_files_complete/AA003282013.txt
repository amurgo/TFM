Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Cronin, Counsel, instructed by Islington Law
      Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitell (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, claims to be a citizen of Burundi, and claimed to
            have been born on February 12, 1993.  Her  age  and  country  of
            origin are disputed. On August  19,  2007  she  arrived  in  the
            United Kingdom and  in  March  2009  she  presented  herself  at
            Barking police station and sought help. On  April  2,  2009  she
            applied for asylum but on April 29, 2009 she  was  arrested  and
            remanded  into  custody  on  suspicion  of  obtaining  leave  by
            deception and remaining here unlawfully as  the  respondent  had
            evidence to suggest that she had given false details including a
            false name, date of birth and country of origin.

         2. On August 28, 2009 she  was  granted  a  temporary  release  and
            following a judicial review in January 2010 all criminal charges
            were dropped and the  London  Borough  of  Southwark  agreed  to
            provide services for her as a child in  need.  On  December  21,
            2012 the UKBA accepted her as a potential victim of  trafficking
            but refused her application for asylum and on  the  same  day  a
            decision was taken to remove her as  an  illegal  entrant  under
            paragraph 8-10 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971.

         3. On January 11, 2013 the Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended.  The
            matter came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Suchak
            (hereinafter  called  "the  FtTJ")  on  April  4,  2014  and  he
            dismissed the appeal after an oral hearing  in  a  determination
            promulgated on April 24, 2014.

         4.  The  Appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  May  6,  2014.
            Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge of the First-
            tier Tribunal Frankish on May  9,  2014  but  following  renewed
            grounds of appeal Upper Tribunal Judge Storey found there was an
            arguable error in law and gave permission to appeal.

         5. The matter came before me on the date set out above.  Ms  Cronin
            attended on behalf of the appellant There was no  need  for  the
            appellant to attend this hearing.

         6. During her lengthy submissions  as  recorded  in  my  record  of
            proceedings Ms Cronin argued that the FtTJ had  failed  to  have
            regard to large elements  of  the  evidence  that  went  to  the
            credibility of the appellant's age and country of origin. He had
            relied solely on a couple of documents when there  was  evidence
            from three independent and professional witnesses and  a  number
            of reports that supported her claimed age. By  failing  to  have
            regard to these matters or balance them against the evidence, he
            negatively accepted against the appellant, he erred in law.

         7. Mr Whitell had a limited file and was unable to comment  whether
            the FtTJ had considered any of the documents Ms Cronin said were
            before the FtTJ although he accepted the court  index  suggested
            they were even though some of the pages were missing. He  argued
            the FtTJ had given reasons for finding the appellant  to  be  an
            incredible witness. However, he agreed with me that if the  FtTJ
            had not considered the various reports and witness  evidence  in
            deciding her age and where she came from then that would  amount
            to an error in law.

         8. I was satisfied the FtTJ had not had full regard to  significant
            evidential matters and whilst this evidence may not have altered
            his approach he had erred by not dealing  with  them  especially
            when  they  went  to  the  heart  of  the  appellant's  age  and
            nationality.

         9. Other issues were raised by Ms Cronin but I  agreed  that  there
            was an error of law on this issue alone.

        10.  Having  established  there  was  an  error  in  law  I  invited
            submissions on what should happen to the appeal. I  was  advised
            the key issue was credibility and fresh oral evidence  would  be
            necessary requiring a number of  professional  witnesses  to  be
            called. I considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the  Practice
            Statement.

        11. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:�


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        12. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case  should  be
            remitted to the First-tier Tribunal. The  case  previously  took
            all day and Ms Cronin suggested  a  similar  estimate  would  be
            necessary albeit she asked for 1� days. I indicated the case was
            capable of being dealt with  in  one  day  as  long  as  it  was
            properly managed.

        13. I indicated I would issue directions separately  and  I  invited
            the parties to submit to me any directions  they  wanted  me  to
            consider. Due to time restraints we were  unable  to  deal  with
            these at the hearing. It may be useful  for  the  matter  to  be
            listed for a CMR to ensure that everything that  is  needed  for
            the final hearing is available.

        14. I have listed the matter on March  30,  2015  at  Taylor  House.
            Attempts were made to confirm Ms Cronin's availability  on  that
            date via her instructing  solicitors,  her  clerk's  office  and
            direct. It was not possible to speak to her so in the event this
            date is not convenient an application should be made  to  Taylor
            House to vary the date and if such an application is made within
            seven days of today's date I would hope that any change in  date
            could be accommodated as  Counsel  has  been  involved  in  this
            appeal throughout.

        15. The parties should ensure compliance with all directions  issued
            in  light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (First-tier
            Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply
            to this appeal from hereon.

Decision

        16. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        17. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.

        18. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
            2008  (as  amended)  the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity
            throughout these proceedings, unless and  until  a  tribunal  or
            court  directs  otherwise.  An  order  has  been  made  and   no
            application has been made to alter the position.
