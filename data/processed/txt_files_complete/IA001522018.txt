Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms P. Solanki, Counsel instructed by Sky Solicitors
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms S. Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Devittie ('the Judge') issued on 13 March 2019 by which the appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse  to  grant  her
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student was dismissed.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission to appeal on all grounds.





Anonymity

 3. The Judge did not issue an anonymity order and the  appellant  did  not
    seek one before this Tribunal.



Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Nepal and is  currently  aged  34.   She
    entered the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  in
    2009 with her leave originally expiring in May  2011.   Her  leave  was
    subsequently varied to 25 May 2013.  On 26  March  2012  her  leave  to
    remain was curtailed so as to expire on 25 May 2012,  such  curtailment
    being consequent to the sponsor licence  of  her  college  having  been
    revoked.  On 23 May 2012 she applied for further leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and this application  was  refused  by
    the respondent on 4 October  2012.   She  was  awarded  no  points  for
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) as  she  had  provided  no
    evidence to establish that she had been assigned a CAS and no valid CAS
    had been identified as having been issued to her.  She was  awarded  no
    points  as  to  maintenance  because  she  had  provided  printed  bank
    statements which had been established to be false.

 5. The appellant asserts that she was not served with the reasons for this
    decision until it was provided to her by the respondent under cover  of
    a letter dated 19 September 2018.  She appealed this  decision  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal and in her grounds  of  appeal  dated  19  November
    2018, she observed that she had "no clue that the immigration  advisers
    she was using were fraudsters and that they submitted a  fake  document
    on her behalf".  It is appropriate to observe that having made her  May
    2012 application the appellant submitted another application for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  on  3  December  2012.
    She did so, according to her witness statement, because her immigration
    advisers informed her that the May 2012 application would  be  refused.
    This is unsurprising as no CAS had accompanied  the  application.   The
    December 2012 application was eventually refused by way of  a  decision
    dated 14 May 2018.  Importantly the respondent awarded  points  to  the
    appellant for the attribute of possessing a  valid  CAS  and  also  for
    meeting the  maintenance  requirement.   The  application  was  refused
    because it was made over 28 days after her original leave  had  expired
    and further under paragraph 322(2) of  the  Immigration  Rules  because
    false documents had been used with a  previous  application.   The  May
    2018 decision enjoyed no right of appeal. The appeal before  the  Judge
    in this matter was concerned with the October 2012 decision  which  was
    served in September 2018.







Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appeal came before the Judge on 11 February 2019.  By  way  of  her
    witness statement the appellant explained,

         "I can confirm that in April to May 2012 I met Mr S and M who  were
         referred by a friend from the Mile End area of London and who  told
         me that they were immigration advisers and  education  consultants.
         I needed help with  my  extension  application  as  a  student  and
         therefore gave them my papers and they promised to arrange  a  loan
         from the bank in Nepal to meet the bank statement requirements  and
         for this purpose to charge �1,500.  I paid the �1,500 in  cash  for
         arranging a loan and making my application to the Home Office.

         I can confirm that either they met me in their car or in a  college
         in Mile End but through the back entrance.  They were communicating
         through mobile phones.  They provided the bank statements  for  the
         application as agreed however it was later in 2018 confirmed by the
         Home Office that the bank statements they provided were fake.

         I can confirm that I am the victim  of  this  fraud  which  I  only
         became aware of following  (the)  reconsideration  decision  of  my
         application in 2018.  The decision under appeal was never served on
         me.  I can confirm that since I came to know  of  it,  I  tried  to
         locate both fraudsters.  It was very hard, however with the help of
         my mother-in-law and our wider community I  have  obtained  details
         which I have given to the police and the County  Court.   The  firm
         which received my refusal notice on 21 September 2018 was dissolved
         in 2016 (sic) ... and both fraudsters are not listed  as  directors
         of the company.  I can  confirm  that  I  was  not  aware  that  my
         application was being made through the  above  law  firm.   I  only
         became aware of this following the refusal of the notice I received
         in September 2018.  I can confirm that since I came to know I  have
         reported the fraud to the police, OSIC (sic) and to the  court.   I
         enclose evidence.  In the circumstances I request the  Tribunal  to
         find that I am not liable for deception ..."

 7. Ms Solanki represented the appellant at the hearing before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and sought an adjournment  on  her  behalf  in  order  to
    enable further information to be provided to the Tribunal  in  relation
    to the formal complaint that the appellant had lodged with the OISC  as
    to the fraud conducted by  her  previous  representatives.   The  judge
    refused the application at paragraph 6 of his decision observing:

         "I declined the application.  In  my  view  whether  or  not  false
         documents had been submitted by her previous representatives, was a
         separate issue, to the question whether the appellant herself,  was
         a willing participant  to  the  fraudulent  activity.   I  did  not
         consider that any evidence  could  be  forthcoming,  in  which  her
         previous representatives would take sole responsibility and seek to
         absolve the appellant.  And even if such evidence was adduced,  the
         Tribunal would still be seized with the  question  of  whether  the
         appellant was a willing participant to the presentation  of  forged
         documents in her application.  I considered that the question as to
         whether the appellant was aware of the  falsity  of  the  documents
         submitted, is one that this Tribunal can determine, on the basis of
         the evidence of the appellant and responses to questions put to her
         in these proceedings.  I did not consider that the  refusal  of  an
         adjournment would prevent the just disposal of this appeal."

 8. The Judge proceeded to find that the appellant had knowingly  practised
    deception in relation to her application in  2012.   In  reaching  this
    decision the Judge noted the appellant's evidence that she did not know
    the amount of the bank loan that she  was  to  receive  from  the  bank
    observing, "I find  it  difficult  to  accept  that  a  person  in  her
    position, who was studying a degree in management, would not have taken
    the trouble to establish the extent of her liability".  The Judge  also
    found it incredible that the appellant would not have checked documents
    attached to her application to ascertain the amount of  the  loan.   He
    observed that in her evidence before him the  appellant  had  not  been
    able to put a figure to the loan that  had  been  applied  for  on  her
    behalf.  She did not know what, if any, were the  payment  terms.   She
    did not know what rates of interest  was  to  be  levied.   She  simply
    stated that all she was advised was that she had to pay �1,500 interest
    to her representatives and that this amount represented interest on the
    loan.  The Judge determined that the appellant's evidence on this point
    was entirely incoherent and made no sense whatsoever.  He further noted
    that the appellant was unable to explain why if he were to believe that
    the loan had been granted, she had made no efforts to  repay  the  loan
    between the date of the application and the time that she  stated  that
    she first became aware that false bank statements had been presented on
    her behalf to the respondent.



Grounds of Appeal

 9. The grounds of appeal raise two complaints.   The  first  is  that  the
    Judge materially erred in law by refusing to adjourn the hearing so  as
    to await the outcome of the complaint before  the  OISC.   Reliance  is
    placed upon the decision of Nwaigwe (adjournment; fairness) [2014] UKUT
    418 IAC.  The second complaint is that the Judge's conclusion that  the
    appellant was engaged in deception was not one that was open to him  on
    the facts and evidence before the Tribunal.

10. For the purpose of this appeal  it  is  appropriate  to  observe  Upper
    Tribunal Grubb's reasoning when granting permission to appeal:

         "1.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Devittie)  dismissed   the
             appellant's appeal against a decision to refuse her leave as a
             Tier 4 Student.   The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  had
             knowingly submitted  false  bank  documents  with  an  earlier
             application.    He   rejected   the   appellant's    "innocent
             explanation" that this had been done without her knowledge  by
             her previous representatives

         ...

         3.   The appellant  had  made  a  complaint  to  OISC  against  her
             previous representatives whom she  claimed  had  (without  her
             knowledge) submitted  the  fraudulent  documents.   The  judge
             refused  an  adjournment  in   order   to   await   the   OISC
             determination.  The judge took  the  view  that  any  decision
             would not assist in  determining  whether  the  appellant  was
             dishonest, i.e. complicit.  The reasoning was  arguably  wrong
             and the OISC decision might well  be  relevant  to  the  issue
             which was central to the appeal.  Permission is granted."

11. A  Rule  24  response  was  filed  by  the  respondent  observing  that
    notwithstanding the grant of permission, it could not be disputed  that
    at the time of  the  application  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.  She candidly accepted before the Judge that
    she had required the loan to be arranged so as to  meet  the  financial
    elements of the relevant Immigration Rule.



Decision

12. Consequent to Ms Solanki providing a copy  of  her  skeleton  argument,
    which had been placed before the Judge at the hearing in February 2019,
    Ms. Jones appropriately conceded that the Judge's decision in  refusing
    to grant an adjournment  lacked  the  requisite  fairness  and  so  was
    erroneous in law.

13. Under the title 'adjournment request', the skeleton argument details at
    paragraph 7:

         "The  appellant  seeks  an  adjournment  of   this   appeal.    The
         appellant's case is based upon her being a victim  of  fraud.   She
         has reported this to the police, the OISC and issued a claim in the
         County Court  against  her  immigration  advisers.   It  seems  the
         outcome of these matters will be core to the issue  in  the  appeal
         (whether she has practised deception).  It is in the  interests  of
         justice this appeal be adjourned for three months  to  allow  these
         matters to be determined.  The appellant will otherwise be at  risk
         of an extremely damaging finding of deception against her."

14. In Nwaigwe the Tribunal  reminded  itself  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in  SH  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284 and  confirmed  that  when  considering
    whether the First-tier Tribunal ought to have granted  an  adjournment,
    the test is not whether the decision is one which had been open to  the
    Tribunal or was Wednesbury unreasonable or perverse.  The sole test  is
    whether it was unfair.  In practice, in most cases the question will be
    whether the refusal to adjourn deprived the affected party of her right
    to a fair hearing.

15. I observe that awaiting a decision from the OISC is  not  by  itself  a
    matter  that  requires  an  appeal  to  be  adjourned.   However,   the
    overriding objective of the First-tier Tribunal is to deal  with  cases
    fairly and justly and this requires consideration as to  the  positions
    of both parties as to delay.  Therefore, it can be reasonably open to a
    Judge to refuse to grant an adjournment request if satisfied  that  the
    appeal would be extensively delayed, or that there had been a delay  in
    making a complaint to the OISC.  However,  upon  carefully  considering
    the Judge's reasoning in this matter, I find that it was speculative in
    nature.  It was based upon an assumption that the previous  immigration
    advisers would not make adverse admissions and therefore the OISC would
    be unable to progress the  appellant's  complaint.   Such  an  approach
    fails to engage with the investigatory powers possessed by the OISC and
    its ability to consider both the appellant's file and  other  files  in
    possession of the immigration advisers.  The decision was predicated on
    a presumption that the OISC could not make any decision as  whether  or
    not the applicant was engaged in the  deceit,  or  an  innocent  party.
    This is not  so.   Whilst  it  may  eventually  prove  impossible  upon
    considering the relevant files for such an assessment to be  made,  the
    Judge was wrong to simply assume that in  these  circumstances  such  a
    decision could not be made by the OISC.  Such a speculative approach as
    to the  likely  inadequacy  of  the  OISC  investigation  can  only  be
    considered to be erroneous and, in the circumstances of the adjournment
    request, to be  unfair  because  there  was  a  failure  to  adequately
    consider the benefit that could arise not only  to  the  appellant  but
    also to the Tribunal, as the ultimate decision maker, for  time  to  be
    given for the OISC to complete its investigation.

16. I remind myself that Tribunals,  like  courts,  have  to  set  aside  a
    determination reached by the adoption of  an  unfair  procedure  unless
    satisfied that it would be pointless to do so because the results would
    be the same: John v Rees [1970]  CH  345.   I  initially  expressed  my
    concern to Ms Solanki that  neither  the  grounds  of  appeal  nor  the
    submissions recorded by the Judge in his decision address the impact of
    the alleged deceit exercised by the former  immigration  advisers  upon
    the article 8 appeal. However, Ms Solanki kindly drew my  attention  to
    paragraph 24 of her skeleton argument that was before the Judge,  which
    states,

         "The Tribunal will note that in the reconsideration decision  dated
         14 May  2018,  the  appellant  was  awarded  full  points  for  her
         Confirmation  of  Acceptance  of  Studies  and  full   points   for
         maintenance.  Her application was refused  simply  on  the  grounds
         that the appellant had failed to disclose  material  facts,  namely
         that  deception  had  been  used  in   the   previous   application
         (paragraphs 322(1A), (2) and 320(7B) of the Rules).  Of course  the
         evidence  establishes  that  the  appellant  was  unaware  of   the
         allegations of deception and indeed that she herself had  not  been
         dishonest.  This demonstrated that (if) she had not been  a  victim
         of fraud this application would have been granted.   The  appellant
         refers to the decision in Mumu and submits  that  hers  is  a  case
         where 'despite the  public  policy  issues  inherent  in  paragraph
         320(7A),  it  would  nevertheless  be  disproportionate  to  refuse
         leave'.  As per Mansur had it not been for the poor and  fraudulent
         immigration advice received the appellant's most recent application
         would have been granted demonstrating that  her  appeal  should  be
         allowed under Article 8 ECHR."

17. In Mansur v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKUT  274
    (IAC); (2018) Imm AR 1436, the President (Lane J)  confirmed  that  the
    failings of an immigration adviser could constitute a reason to qualify
    the  public  interest  in  firm  and  effective  immigration   control.
    However, that  would  be  the  position  only  rarely.   The  President
    observed that poor legal advice in the immigration field would have  no
    correlation with the relevant public interest.  The weight  that  would
    otherwise need to be given to the maintenance of effective  immigration
    controls was not to be  reduced  just  because  there  happened  to  be
    immigration advisers  who  offered  poor  advice  and  other  services.
    Consequently, a person who took advice  to  do  one  thing  when  doing
    another might have produced a more favourable  outcome  would  normally
    have to live with the consequences.

18. The appellant relies upon the respondent's subsequent decision  whereby
    points were awarded for CAS and also for  maintenance  as  establishing
    that save for the act by the former immigration  advisers  to  serve  a
    false document with the May 2012 application, the appellant would  have
    secured status as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant by this  point  in
    time.  Any consideration of this argument will  require  a  finding  of
    fact as to whether or not the appellant was aware of the  October  2012
    decision, because the refusal of  the  2012  application  in  May  2018
    relies upon the latter application being made over 28  days  after  the
    October 2012 refusal.  I cannot say that an  adverse  finding  of  fact
    would definitely be made and so, as  I  am  considering  the  issue  of
    fairness, I accept that it is arguable that the appellant can  seek  to
    rely upon the approach confirmed in Mansur and that  this  appeal  does
    not admit of only decision, namely the refusal of the appeal.   It  may
    well be that the appellant has significant hurdles to  climb  though  I
    say no more as I have not considered the evidence in detail but this is
    a matter whereby the unfair procedure adopted by the Judge  requires  a
    new hearing so that a fair consideration  can  be  undertaken.   I  set
    aside the decision and do not preserve any of the findings.



Remittal

19. As to remaking the decision, given the nature of the errors,  I  accept
    the submissions by both Ms Solanki and Ms Jones that evidence has to be
    presented and clear findings have to be made.   Both  advocates  submit
    that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  I  have
    given careful consideration to the  Joint  Practice  Statement  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and  Upper  Tribunal  concerning  the  disposal  of
    appeals in this Tribunal.  That reads as follows at paragraph 7.2,

         "7.2     The Upper tribunal is likely  on  each  such  occasion  to
              proceed to remake the decision, instead of remitting the case
              to the First-tier Tribunal,  unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
              satisfied that:

                (a)    the effect of the error has been to deprive  a  party
                   before the First-tier Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or
                   other opportunity for that party's case to  be  put  and
                   considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

                (b)    the nature or extent  of  any  judicial  fact-finding
                   which is necessary in order  for  the  decision  in  the
                   appeal to be remade is such that, having regard  to  the
                   overring objective in Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit
                   the case to the First-tier Tribunal."

20. I have reached the conclusion that it  is  appropriate  to  remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all  matters.
    The appellant has had no adequate consideration of her appeal  to  date
    and has not yet enjoyed a fair hearing.







Notice of Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision  promulgated  on
    13 March 2019 pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

22. It is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing  before
    any Judge other than Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Devittie  at
    Taylor House.  No findings of fact are preserved.

23. No anonymity direction is made.
