                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant whose date of birth is 20 September 1990 is a citizen  of
    India.

2.   This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in the determination before First-tier
    Tribunal Judge N Paul who dismissed the appeal  against  a  refusal  of
    leave to enter the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled  in
    the UK under paragraph 281 HC 395 (as amended).

Background

3.   The appellant and sponsor married on 29  June  2012.   The  sponsor,  a
    British citizen lived in a six bedroomed property owned  by  his  uncle
    and was employed full-time as a packer earning a monthly net income  of
    ï¿½1,012.  In support  of  her  application  the  appellant  submitted  a
    Pearson test score report showing an overall score of 27, a score of 39
    for speaking and a score of 23 for listening.

4.    In  a  notice  of  immigration  decision  dated  3  October  2012  the
    respondent refused the application under paragraph 281(i)(a) and  (ii).
    The reasons were that the appellant failed to achieve a score of 24  or
    above in the listening component of the test which requires a level  of
    A1 to be achieved.

5.   In her grounds of appeal dated 26 October 2012 the  appellant  set  out
    generalised grounds of appeal. At  paragraph  6  stated  that  she  had
    undertaken the Pearson academic exam  again  on  16  October  2012  and
    successfully passed the listening component with a score of 28 and  the
    speaking component with a score of 40.

6.   An Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the decision  on  16  August  2013.
    He upheld the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  made  some  ten
    months previously and attached no weight to the  further  Pearson  test
    completed on 16 October 2012 as it was a post decision evidence.

7.   The appeal was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge N Paul who  heard
    oral  evidence   from   the   sponsor   and   submissions   from   both
    representatives.   He  found  on  the  evidence  before  him  that  the
    appellant  failed  to  show  that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules under  paragraph  281  with  regard  to  the  English
    language test requirements.  At paragraph 17 the judge stated that  the
    Immigration Rule itself makes plain that the English language  test  is
    specific to speaking and listening and not an overall English  language
    ability.  He found that the respondent's  guidance  was  available  and
    would and should have been properly consulted by  an  appellant  before
    taking the test or at least submitting the results of the test.  He did
    not accept the submissions that the  appellant  and  /or  sponsor  were
    reliant on the guidance provided by the Pearson test which  related  to
    an overall English language ability and not the  specific  requirements
    of the Rules as set out in the Home Office guidance.  In  dealing  with
    Article 8 the judge treated the matter as  essentially  a  "near  miss"
    argument.  At paragraph 21 he was satisfied that the right approach was
    one dictated by the Rules.   He  considered  that  the  fact  that  the
    appellant may be confronted with a difficulty in respect  of  financial
    requirements  was  not  a  ground  for  finding  the  decision  to   be
    disproportionate.  He went on  to  consider  the  issue  of  delay  and
    whether or not this amounted to  a  disproportionate  interference  and
    found that it did not.  He then found no other  arguably  good  grounds
    following principles in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640.

8.   Grounds of appeal for permission
         In lengthy grounds of appeal it was submitted that the  judge  made
    material errors of law as follows:

    (1)  The judge elevated what amounted to guidance to be treated akin to
         Immigration Rules, although there was no evidence to show  that  it
         had been subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.  The  judge  failed  to
         follow the correct law and test laid down by the Supreme  Court  in
         Alvi.  The appellant's score  was  short  of  the  policy  guidance
         requirement of 24 by only one mark in the  listening  component  as
         she obtained 23.  The policy ought therefore to have  been  adapted
         in the interests of fairness  and  good  sense  in  favour  of  the
         appellant particularly given that at the time of  the  respondent's
         own review of the case the  appellant  had  retaken  the  test  and
         obtained a score of 28 in listening.


    (2)  The judge  failed  to  make  adequate  findings  of  fact  on  the
         sponsor's evidence with regard to legitimate  expectation  or  with
         reference to the settlement checklist form which indicated that the
         appellant provided evidence of speaking and  understanding  English
         and that the score was 27.


    (3)  The judge failed to follow the two stage process  with  regard  to
         consideration  of  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
         thereafter under Article 8 ECHR following the step-by-step  process
         in Razgar.  The judge appeared to have applied the new  Immigration
         Rules implemented on 9 July 2012  and  further  the  principles  in
         Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 which was not decided as at the  date  of
         the appeal.


9.   In a Rule 24 response the  respondent  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed  himself  appropriately  and  made  sustainable
    findings open to him on the evidence.  It  was  accepted  that  at  the
    relevant time the English language test requirements  for  scores  were
    not contained in the Rules but  in  a  policy  document  to  which  the
    appellant could refer for information as to what score met level A1  of
    the Common European Framework of Reference.  Accordingly the respondent
    was satisfied that the Rule as it was set out  with  reference  to  the
    requirement of level  A1  was  "Alvi-compliant"  because  it  contained
    "information the application of which will determine whether or not the
    applicant will qualify" (see paragraph 57 of Alvi).

10.  As for Article 8 it was submitted that the  reference  to  Gulshan  was
    mere conjecture on the part of the judge regarding the  likely  success
    of a fresh application where financial requirements of  the  new  Rules
    would come into play.  It is accepted that the judge  failed  to  apply
    Razgar but this was not a material error capable of having  a  material
    impact on the outcome of the appeal which was reasonable  and  open  to
    the judge on the facts before him.

Permission to Appeal

11.  The matter came before Designated Judge Garratt who granted  permission
    to appeal on 15 April 2014 on the following grounds;





         "The grounds contend that the judge was wrong to give the Secretary
         of State's policy guidance the force of law by failing to take into
         consideration the findings of the Supreme Court in Alvi [2012] UKSC
         33.  On this basis the decision of the judge should have been  that
         the respondent's decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
         because the policy should, in any event, have been adapted  in  the
         interests of fairness and good  sense  and  the  appellant  granted
         entry clearance because her score was only one point less than that
         required.  The grounds also contend that the judge failed to  adopt
         a "mandatory" two stage  process  to  consideration  of  Article  8
         issues requiring him to apply the five stage Razgar test.  That  is
         because the new Immigration  Rules  set  out  in  HC  194  are  not
         applicable to the present appeal where the application was made  on
         4 July 2012 before the new Rules came into force.


         Paragraph 17 of the determination shows  that  the  judge  arguably
         decided the appeal on the  basis  that  guidance  relevant  to  the
         applicant's English language test results had the same force as the
         Rules themselves when that was wrong.


         The judge's approach to Article 8 issues is  also  arguably  flawed
         because of the apparent failure to consider the  claim  outside  of
         the Immigration Rules, Gulshan having arguably  no  application  to
         the appeal."

The Hearing Before Me

12.  I have decided that there was a material error of law in  the  decision
    made by First Tier Tribunal Judge N M Paul.  His decision  is  premised
    on the basis that the guidance  relevant  to  the  appellant's  English
    language test results had the same force as the Rules themselves,  when
    clearly that was wrong.  The Rules refer to the need to obtain a  score
    of A1 for the listening and speaking component.  I do  not  accept  the
    argument that there was ambiguity  as  to  whether  or  not  the  Rules
    related to the overall score  or  specific  components.   The  guidance
    which appears in the Home Office documentation establishes clearly that
    A1 is a score of 24.  As guidance does not  have  the  same  status  or
    force as the Rules decision makers  can  exercise   discretion  to  the
    extent that the guidance can be applied without rigidity  and  fairness
    and good sense.  (as per Sedley J in Pankina)  I  accept  Mr  Jeshani's
    argument that if a requirement leads to the success or  failure  of  an
    application then that requirement must be specified in the  Rules.   In
    this instance  the  requirement  namely  the  specific  score  was  not
    specified and in my view it ought to have been made clear; there is  no
    reason why the Rule could not have set out the specific scores.   Given
    that the specific score was not set out in the actual Rules and was the
    reason for  the failure of the appellant's application, this  certainly
    comes  within  the  test  in  paragraph  57  of  Alvi.   There  was  no
    consideration of that  argument  or  legal  principles  by  the  judge.
    Further,  I take into  account  that  the  judge  had  before  him  the
    appellant's results for the test retaken on 16 October 2012  (some  two
    weeks after the decision to refuse and prior to the very delayed review
    by the Entry Clearance Manager on 16 August 2013).   Having  regard  to
    the fact that the actual scoring requirements are included in  guidance
    then a flexible and fair approach may be exercised,  and   taking  into
    account that the retest was taken very close to the decision date,  the
    Entry Clearance Manager  and  /or  Tribunal  ought  to  have  exercised
    discretion in favour of the appellant.

13.  I find further  material  errors  of  law  as  regards  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's treatment of Article 8 ECHR.  From reading the determination
    in particular at paragraphs 21 and 22 the judge appears to have applied
    the new Rules (in force post  9  July  2012  )  when  this  application
    predated the implementation of those amendments to the Rules.  This  is
    further supported by his reference to Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  which
    provides guidance on the consideration of Article 8 ECHR outside of the
    Rules and the need to  establish  arguably  good  grounds.   I  find  a
    misdirection on the law.  The correct approach was  for  the  judge  to
    have followed  the  five  stage  process  set  out  in  Razgar,  having
    considered and  dismissed  the  appeal  on  immigration  grounds.   The
    determination assessed proportionality of the  decision  regarding  the
    discrete point concerning the English language  requirement.   However,
    there is no discussion or consideration with reference to  family  life
    in the determination.  The judge did not find the  interference  to  be
    disproportionate notwithstanding that a further application which would
    have to be considered under the new Rules which would lead to a  longer
    delay.

Decision re error of law
14.   I find material errors of law in the determination.   I set aside  the
    determination and I remake the decision. I allow the appeal.

15.  In following the step-by-step Razgar guidance  I  find  that  there  is
    family life as the parties are married.  I find that the decision is of
    sufficient gravity to engage Article 8 , a low threshold.  I find  that
    the decision is an interference with that family life  as  the  parties
    remain separated. The decision was not in accordance with the law.  The
    issue of proportionality necessarily involves some  reflection  on  the
    degree to which the appellant has failed to meet the Rules.  I  do  not
    regard  this  as  a  near  miss  case.   I  have  treated  the  scoring
    requirements  to  be  part  of  guidance  and   in   the   context   of
    proportionality where there are no other grounds relied on for refusing
    the application, the existence of the retaken test some ten days  after
    the reasons for refusal and prior to the reconsideration by  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager and the delay  which  is  significant  prior  to  the
    review, the decision was not proportionate.

Decision

(1)  I allow the appeal on immigration grounds.

(2)  I allow the appeal on human rights grounds.
