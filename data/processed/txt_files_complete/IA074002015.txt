                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Musquit Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mr Ikram Ullah Khan date of birth 5th April 1986,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  No order for anonymity was made in the First-tier
    Tribunal. Having considered all the circumstances  I  do  not  make  an
    anonymity order.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Henderson promulgated on 22nd February 2016, whereby the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  decisions  of  the
    Respondent to refuse the appellant further leave to remain  in  the  UK
    and to remove the appellant from the UK to Pakistan.

 3. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom in or about March 2010  as
    a student with leave valid until February 2012. He was granted  further
    leave to remain as a Post- Student Migrant until 2 August 2014.  During
    the currency of that leave the appellant applied for further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points-based system
    and paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules.

 4. By decision taken on  11  February  2015  the  respondent  refused  the
    appellant's application for further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and determined to remove the appellant from the United Kingdom.
    The appellant appealed against that decision. The appeal was  heard  by
    Judge Henderson on 19 January 2016 and by decision of 22 February  2016
    he dismissed the appellant's appeal. The appellant now seeks to  appeal
    against that decision.

 5. By decision made on the 17th August 2016 leave to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted. Thus the matter appeared before me  to  determine
    in the first instance whether or not there is an error of  law  in  the
    original determination and to re-decide, if appropriate.

 6. In granting leave to appeal Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  gave  the
    following reasons: -

         "In paragraph 4 of its decision the FtT incorrectly directs  itself
         to the issue(s) to be determined, wrongly limiting such  issues  to
         the consideration of whether the  appellant  genuinely  intends  to
         invest �50,000 into his business in the UK. The  SSHD  also  refuse
         the appellant's application on the basis that she was not satisfied
         that he either genuinely intends was able to establish  within  the
         following six months,  or  has  genuinely  establish  continues  to
         operate, a business in the UK. However, this error is not  material
         because it operates in the losing party's favour.

         The FtT goes on to determine this previously  identified  issue  in
         the appellant's favour [22].  Thereafter,  the  FtT  considers  the
         'viability and credibility' of the  'appellant  business  plan  and
         market research' [23] -making adverse credibility findings in  this
         regard. Contrary to the grounds  the  FtT  did  not  stop  at  this
         consideration but concluded in [26]  that  the  appellant  had  not
         demonstrated that his proposed business was "a viable and  credible
         one". This is an overarching finding not limited to  the  'business
         plan and market research'. The submission to the  contrary  in  the
         grounds is not arguable. In concluding that  the  business  is  not
         viable or credible it is clear that the FtT was not satisfied  that
         the appellant is able to establish a business within the  next  six
         months.

         Despite all that is said above I,  nevertheless,  grant  permission
         because it is arguable that the above-mentioned  findings  are  not
         determinative of the appeal. In particular, it is arguable that the
         FtT was required to, but did not, make a specific  finding  on  the
         issue whether  the  appellant  had  established  and  continues  to
         operate a business; the appellant's case being that he set  up  his
         business on, or around, 29 April 2014, i.e. prior to  the  date  of
         application to the SSHD. If it is determined that there is such  an
         error  by  the  FtT  the  appellant  will  nevertheless   have   to
         demonstrate  that  this  error  is  material-  an  issue  that  the
         conclusions in paragraph 25 will bear upon."

 7. The relevant provisions of the rules are found in paragraph 245 DD, the
    material parts of which provide: -

         '245DD Requirements for leave to remain

         (i)  In making the assessment in (h) the Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:

             (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;

             (ii) the viability and credibility of the source of the  money
             referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;

             (iii)  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the   applicant's

             of the business requires mandatory accreditation, registration
             and/or insurance,  whether  that  accreditation,  registration
             and/or insurance has been obtained; and

             (vii) any other relevant information.

         (j)   The  Secretary  of  State  reserves  the  right  to   request
         additional information and evidence to support  the  assessment  in
         (h), and to refuse the application if the information  or  evidence
         is not provided. Any requested documents must be  received  by  the
         Secretary of State at the address specified in the  request  within
         28 calendar days of the date of the request.

         (k)   If  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  with   the
         genuineness of the  application  in  relation  to  a  point-scoring
         requirement in Appendix A, those points will not be awarded.

         (l)  the Secretary of  State  may  decide  not  to  carry  out  the
         assessment in (H) if the application already fails for  refusal  on
         other grounds, but reserves the right to carry out this  assessment
         in any reconsideration of the decision.

         (m)   The  applicant  must,  unless  he   provides   a   reasonable
         explanation, comply with any request made by the Secretary of State
         to attend for interview.

         ...'

 8. The provisions under consideration are  subparagraph  245  DD  (h)  and
    subparagraph 245 DD (i). It is to be noted  that  the  requirements  of
    subparagraph (h) require that the appellant has to show that he  either
    genuinely intends or is able to establish a business  or  that  he  has
    genuinely established a business.

    Submissions

 9. At the commencement of the hearing the representative for the appellant
    submitted that the judge had failed to make all necessary  findings  of
    fact.  It was submitted that evidence had been submitted of  contracts,
    invoices bank statements and a statement from one  of  the  contractors
    with the appellant's  business.  The  appellant  claimed  that  he  had
    established a business in April 2014 and that  therefore  he  satisfied
    the requirements of the rules. In the circumstances  it  was  submitted
    that the judge had failed to make findings as to  whether  or  not  the
    appellant  had  an  established  business  and  that  the  evidence  to
    substantiate that had been submitted.  It  was  argued  that  that  was
    relevant to paragraph 245 DD (h)(i) 2.

10. It is asserted that the point in issue  relates  to  paragraph  245  DD
    (h)(i)(1)  [referred  to  as  subparagraph  1]  and  245  DD(h)(i)  (2)
    [referred to as subparagraph 2]. It is submitted that  the  above  rule
    can be satisfied if the  appellant  can  show  that  he  has  genuinely
    established a business in the United Kingdom and continues  to  operate
    that business in compliance with subparagraph 2.

11. It is submitted that that is the case even if he cannot  satisfactorily
    establish that his intention and ability to do so within six months was
    genuine [see paragraph 3 of the  skeleton  argument  submitted  by  the
    appellant's representative]. The provisions of subparagraphs  1  and  2
    set out are disjunctive, i.e. alternative requirements, and it was only
    necessary for the appellant to meet  one  of  those  two  requirements.
    Provided always  that  the  appellant  establishes  that  he  genuinely
    intends to invest �50,000 in the business.

12. It is submitted as allegedly noted in the grant of leave that the First-
    Tier Tribunal accepted that the appellant satisfied the requirements of
    paragraph 245 DD (h)(ii).

13. In the circumstances the appellant's appeal had been wrongly  dismissed
    on the basis that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    subparagraph 1.  The appellant had established a business in April 2014
    prior to the date of the application and therefore met the requirements
    of subparagraph 2.

14. It was submitted by the appellant's representative that  in  paragraphs
    23 to 25 consideration is given to the viability and credibility of the
    appellant's business plan and market research.  It  is  then  submitted
    that the findings made are only relevant  as  to  whether  or  not  the
    appellant intends or was  able  to  establish  a  business  within  six
    months, the requirements within subparagraph 1. As  the  appellant  had
    already established  a  business  and  was  running  his  business  the
    findings made were not material as to whether or not the appellant  met
    the requirements of subparagraph 2.

15. It was acknowledged in  the  hearing  and  in  the  skeleton  argument,
    paragraph 5, that in paragraph 26 the finding is that the appellant has
    failed to discharge the burden to show that his proposed business was a
    viable and credible business. It is  submitted  that  that  finding  is
    relevant only to the  issues  in  respect  of  subparagraph  1.  It  is
    suggested that the appellant does not seek to go behind the view of the
    Upper Tribunal in granting permission but that was limited to  relevant
    considerations in respect of subparagraph 1.

16. In the circumstances as the appellant met the requirements of paragraph
    245 DD (h)(i)(2) the appeal should have been allowed. The findings made
    by the judge in any event  at  paragraph  25  were  not  sufficient  to
    support the conclusion that the appellant having failed under paragraph
    245DD(h)(i)(1) also failed under paragraph 245 DD(h)(i)(2). In light of
    the evidence presented it was submitted  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of (2) and the appeal should have been allowed.

17. The representative for the respondent submitted  that  the  conclusions
    set out within paragraphs 23 to 26 were such that a  finding  had  been
    made that the business was not  genuine  as  the  appellant's  business
    plans and market research were not credible or viable.  The  judge  had
    considered the existing  documentation  submitted  in  respect  of  the
    business activity of the company and found in paragraph 24 and 25  that
    the evidence of the contract with Lincoln Property Services Limited was
    not credible for a number of reasons.

18. It was submitted that  in  the  circumstances  the  appellant  had  not
    genuinely established a business. That was a finding that the judge was
    entitled to make on the evidence presented.  The  consequence  of  that
    finding was that genuineness of the business,  the  viability  and  the
    credibility of the business, had to  be  assessed  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 245DD(i) of the rules and that that, as was  clearly  evident
    from the rule itself, was relevant not only to subparagraph 1 but  also
    to subparagraph 2. In the circumstances the appellant had not genuinely
    established a business.

    Consideration

19. In respect of paragraph 245 DD (h) the appellant has  to  prove  either
    that he has genuinely established  a  business  or  that  he  genuinely
    intends or is able to establish a business. In determining that  it  is
    clear from paragraph 245 DD (i) consideration has to be  given  to  the
    viability and credibility of the applicant's business plan  and  market
    research and his business experience. The claim that an individual  has
    established a business does not mean  that  an  individual  has  merely
    opened a business as a business cannot be said to have been established
    if it has no realistic prospects  of  trading  and  making  money.  The
    viability and the credibility of the business has  to  be  assessed  in
    order to ascertain whether or not the business  will  prosper  and  has
    genuinely been established in the circumstances.  The  current  trading
    activity of the business is also to be looked at to  see  if  it  is  a
    genuine business.

20. The requirements of the rules require the appellant to show that he has
    genuinely established a business and that inevitably means that it is a
    business that is credible and viable, not a shell with no substance.

21. The conclusions within paragraph 26 of the decision by  the  judge  are
    therefore not only relevant to subparagraph  1  but  also  relevant  to
    subparagraph 2. That is the clear intent of the way the section of  the
    rule is set out. The rule in   245  DD  (i)  specifically  requires  in
    assessing 245 DD(h) that consideration be given to  the  viability  and
    credibility of the applicant's business plan, his market research,  the
    appellant's business experience. Such are all factors to show that  the
    appellant has genuinely established a business. Here  the  findings  by
    the judge are clear the business was  not  viable  and  credible.  That
    finding was not only relevant to subparagraph 1 but  also  relevant  to
    subparagraph 2 to determine the genuineness of the business.

22.  Further to that the judge goes on  to  consider  the  present  trading
    activity  of  the  company,  which  the  appellant   claims   to   have
    established.  It  is  clear  from  paragraph  24  that  the  judge  was
    considering that as an aspect of the  viability  of  the  business  and
    whether the business had genuinely been established.  The  judge  noted
    that the contract submitted on behalf of Lincoln Property Services  Ltd
    did not contain any reference to payment  or  how  payment  was  to  be
    calculated. The judge also noted that that did not specify  the  nature
    of the services to be provided. The judge did not find the  appellant's
    explanation with regard to the contract credible.

23. In the light of that finding the  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  his
    business was viable or credible. It is implicit in  that  finding  that
    the business had not been genuinely established. In making that finding
    the judge was not only  considering  the  requirements  in  respect  of
    subparagraph 1 but also the requirements in respect of subparagraph 2.

24. Paragraph 26 does not limit itself specifically to subparagraph  1.  In
    the circumstances the judge was considering whether or not in assessing
    paragraph 245 DD (h) the appellant had  established  that  he  met  the
    requirements  of  the  paragraph  (h)  and  determined  that   in   the
    circumstances the  appellant  had  neither  proved  that  he  genuinely
    intended nor was able to establish a business nor proved  that  he  had
    genuinely established a business. The  judge  clearly  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to prove he met the requirements of the rule.

25. In the circumstances the judge having made that finding was entitled to
    dismiss the appeal.

Decision

26. There is no material error of  law  in  the  decision.   I  uphold  the
    decision to dismiss this matter on all grounds.
