For the Appellant:        Ms Patel, Counsel instructed by Lex Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is of disputed nationality and identity. He appeals  with
    permission the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Alis)  to
    dismiss his protection appeal.


 2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    Appellant is an undocumented Kuwaiti Bidoon. If  he  could  demonstrate
    that it was reasonably likely that he was, his appeal would be allowed:
      NM (documented/undocumented Bidoon: risk) Kuwait CG [2013]  UKUT  356
    (IAC).


 3. The First-tier Tribunal found that this burden had not been discharged,
    even to the  lower  standard.    In  so  finding  the  Tribunal  placed
    considerable weight on a linguistic  analysis  report  which  concluded
    that the Arabic spoken by the Appellant was of a variety commonly found
    in Iraq.  In light of that  report,  and  other  discrepancies  in  the
    Appellant's  evidence,  Judge  Alis  agreed   with   the   Respondent's
    submission, that the Appellant was in fact an Iraqi.

 4. The Appellant now appeals on the ground that in reaching  that  finding
    the First-tier Tribunal materially erred in that it  overlooked  a  key
    part of the linguist's report, which stated that this  particular  form
    of 'Mesopotamian' Arabic  is  also  spoken  in  parts  of  Kuwait.   In
    granting  permission  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Sheridan  considered   it
    arguable that this was a material error of law, having  regard  to  the
    lower standard of proof.

 5. Ms Patel's second ground was that in reaching its decision the Tribunal
    erred in overlooking the evidence of two important  witnesses,  one  of
    whom had attended and given live evidence. These two witnesses  averred
    that they had  known  the  Appellant  in  Kuwait,  and  that  to  their
    knowledge he is Bidoon. Both men had been recognised  as  refugees.  Ms
    Patel submits that it is a clear error of public law to ignore material
    evidence given by witnesses:  she  relies  on  AK  (Failure  to  assess
    witnesses' evidence) Turkey [2004] UKIAT 00230.



    Discussion and Findings

 6. I deal with the second ground first.   In respect of the witnesses  the
    Tribunal has recorded that Mr  El  A  attended  the  hearing  and  gave
    evidence  [at  �37  and  53].  The  submissions   of   the   respective
    representatives in relation to his evidence are recorded  [at  �42  and
    47]. Its conclusions are then set out [at �66(x)]:


         "Mr El A's evidence, and the  letter  of  support  from  Mr  Al  M,
         supported his claim he came from Kuwait  and  was  an  undocumented
         Bidoon but their evidence has to be considered alongside the  other
         evidence and inconsistencies"


 7. I draw three conclusions from that. First, it  simply  cannot  be  said
    that the evidence of Mr El A was overlooked. Second, the passage that I
    have set out betrays no misdirection or  legal  error:  the  Judge  was
    indeed required to examine Mr El A's evidence in  the  round  alongside
    all of the other evidence. Third, that for those reasons this is not an
    AK case and the ground is no more than a disagreement with the  Judge's
    findings.   As to the second witness, who  was  unable  to  attend  the
    hearing because he was on holiday at the time, the Judge finds [at  his
    �66(ix)] that the gentleman's statement about how he knew the Appellant
    was  inconsistent  with  the  Appellant's  own   evidence.   In   those
    circumstances the Tribunal was plainly entitled to place little  weight
    upon it.


 8. Ms Patel points out that it was the evidence of these  witnesses  which
    satisfied  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the   Appellant's   further
    representations constituted a 'fresh claim' under paragraph  353.    In
    those circumstances, she submits, their evidence could  have  attracted
    more scrutiny that it actually received. That  may  well  be  true.  No
    investigation is for instance made into how Mr El A knew the  Appellant
    to be an undocumented Bidoon simply from the fact that his father  used
    to watch him play football. As the country guidance makes  clear,  many
    of those in the community designated as "Bidoon" - meaning 'without' as
    in 'without documents' - are now in fact documented. It may  have  been
    helpful had it been explored why Mr El A believed the Appellant to fall
    outwith that  group.  Having  had  regard  to  the  Tribunal's  overall
    approach, however, I cannot be satisfied that it was an  error  of  law
    for the evidence to be dealt with in the brief manner that it  is.  The
    Tribunal in effect acknowledges that it was  evidence  which  supported
    the Appellant, but finds it outweighed by the remaining material before
    it. There is no error of law in that.


 9. The expert report on the Appellant's spoken Arabic is not an easy read.
    Whilst it serves as confirmation that linguistics is a serious science,
    it is not a straightforward document for  the  layperson  to  decipher.
    For instance, the writer notes  that  phonological  dialectal  features
    noted are consistent with Kuwaiti Arabic, as  are  syntactic  dialectal
    features.   It  is  also  found,  however,  that  noted   morphological
    dialectal features are partly  inconsistent  with  Kuwaiti  Arabic  (my
    emphasis). This leads  the  analyst  to  the  overall  conclusion  "the
    language analysis somewhat suggests  that  the  results  obtained  more
    likely than not are  inconsistent  with  the  linguistic  community  as
    stated in the hypothesis [that the Appellant speaks  Kuwaiti  Arabic]".
    Conversely the alternative hypothesis, that the Appellant belongs to an
    Arabic linguistic community found in Iraq,  is  resolved  as  found  as
    follows: "the language analysis  somewhat  suggests  that  the  results
    obtained more likely  than  not  are  consistent  with  the  linguistic
    community as stated in the hypothesis". Obviously the Respondent  asked
    the First-tier Tribunal to weigh this in  the  balance  as  indicating,
    more likely than not, that the Appellant is Iraqi.  This the First-tier
    Tribunal duly did [at its �62].


10. The Tribunal then notes that the Appellant had adduced no  evidence  to
    rebut the conclusions of the linguistic  report.  This  was  despite  a
    report having been commissioned from a Professor Newman at  an  earlier
    stage in proceedings: for reasons unknown neither the Appellant nor his
    representatives had considered it  appropriate  to  disclose  Professor
    Newman's conclusions.

11. Having made those observations, the  Tribunal  weighs  in  the  balance
    other findings, including that the Appellant failed to disclose, at the
    earliest  possible  opportunity,  that  he  had  previously   been   in
    possession of an Iraqi passport; he  had  given  inconsistent  evidence
    about his own level of education; documents adduced to corroborate  his
    claim in fact undermined it by raising inconsistencies in the evidence;
    he had been inconsistent about whether  he  was  Sunni  or  Shi'a;  the
    evidence of at least one of the witnesses  was  inconsistent  with  the
    Appellant's own.  Having taken all of those matters into consideration,
    the Tribunal dismissed the appeal.

12. The Appellant in effect now argues that all of that reasoning should be
    set aside because the linguistic report acknowledges that  Mesopotamian
    dialects can "also be found in certain areas of Kuwait". The effect  of
    this submission is that had the Tribunal had regard to that factor,  it
    would have automatically reduced the  significance  of  the  linguistic
    report, and the decision could have been other than it is.

13. I am not satisfied that this ground is made out. The linguistic  report
    was, it is true, not conclusive either way. The analyst quite  properly
    assesses two alternative hypotheses but it is unable to come to a  firm
    view for the simple reason that it is obviously not a binary  question.
    Arabic is spoken across at least 25 different countries and there  will
    obviously be differences in dialect, syntax and  grammar  across  each.
    Sometimes there will  be  similarities.  In  this  case  one  of  those
    similarities was in the use of  the  'Mesopotamian  dialect'  which  is
    prevalently spoken in Iraq, but is also found in south-eastern  Turkey,
    north-eastern Syria, in the Iranian  province  of  Khuzestan  and,  the
    grounds emphasise, in parts of Kuwait [at C25 Respondent's bundle].  At
    its highest, then, the report took the case no further. The Appellant's
    spoken Arabic is prevalently found  in  Iraq,  but  also  in  parts  of
    Kuwait. In those circumstances it cannot rationally be relied  upon  to
    demonstrate that the Tribunal fell into material error  in  failing  to
    record this particular  passage.    It  is  perfectly  clear  from  the
    remainder of the  reasoning  that  the  marked  difficulties  with  the
    Appellant's evidence  overall  outweighed  the  only  evidence  in  his
    favour, that being the testimony of the witnesses.



    Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law and it is upheld.

15. The order for anonymity made by the First-tier Tribunal  has  not  been
    discharged or varied.
