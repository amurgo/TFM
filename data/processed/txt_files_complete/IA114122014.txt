                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup in which he allowed the appeal of Ms
    Zheng, a citizen of China, against the Secretary of State's decision to
    refuse to vary leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student migrant. I
    shall refer to  Ms  Zheng  as  the  Applicant,  although  she  was  the
    Appellant in the proceedings below.
 2. The application under appeal was  made  on  3  February  2014  and  was
    refused by reference to paragraph 245ZX(d)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (HC395) on 18 February 2014.  The  Applicant  exercised  her  right  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.   This  is  the  appeal  which  came
    before Judge Troup on 28 May 2014 and was  allowed.  The  Secretary  of
    State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
    application was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  on  4  November
    2014 in the following terms

       The Respondent's grounds identify an arguable error of law.  As  the
       appellant  could  not  establish  that  she  met   the   maintenance
       requirement on the documentation submitted with her application,  it
       is arguable that it was irrelevant to the issue of whether  she  met
       the requirements of the  Rules  that  this  was  the  fault  of  the
       educational institution. The Judge did not  consider  any  issue  of
       fairness but this would have been a difficult argument to sustain in
       any event (see Rahman v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 11 at [32]).




 3. At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Richards  appeared  to  represent  the
    Secretary of State. The  Applicant  appeared  in  person  and  was  not
    legally represented. As the Applicant was  not  legally  represented  I
    carefully  explained  the  nature  of  these  proceedings  to  her  and
    summarised the reasons given by the Secretary of State for  challenging
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Background

 4. The background  to  the  appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  facts,  not
    challenged, are that the Applicant was born in  China  on  17  February
    1989. She came to the United Kingdom with leave to enter as  a  Tier  4
    (General) student expiring on 24 February 2014. On 3 February 2014  the
    Applicant made an in time application for further leave to remain.  The
    application was made to enable the Applicant to continue her studies at
    Cardiff Metropolitan University where the Applicant was studying for an
    MBA degree. The Applicant was assisted in  making  her  application  by
    Cardiff Metropolitan University and her correspondence address  on  the
    application was shown as 'Attn Laura Evans, Cardiff Met Int Office'.

 5. The application was refused on 18  February  2014.  The  basis  of  the
    refusal was that the Applicant needed to show that she had access to at
    least �7,200 for a consecutive 28 period prior to her application.  The
    bank statement submitted in support  of  her  application  covered  the
    period 1-28 January but on 27 January 2014 the balance  had  fallen  to
    -�11.29.

 6. With her Notice of Appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Applicant
    submitted a letter from Laura Evans the International  Student  welfare
    officer at Cardiff Metropolitan University. The letter was  written  in
    very clear terms. The university takes responsibility for checking that
    a student's documents including their bank  statements  meet  the  UKBA
    requirements and only when these documents have  been  checked  is  the
    application submitted. In this case the university made 'a clear error'
    by failing to submit all of the  documents  which  would  have  clearly
    shown  that  the  Applicant  held  the  necessary  funds.  Indeed   the
    university goes so far as to say that a  letter  from  the  Applicant's
    bank  which  should  have  been  submitted  with  the  application  was
    'misplaced'  by  the  university.  In  short  the  Applicant  held  the
    necessary funds, she had the  bank  statements  to  prove  it  and  the
    failure to submit all of the documents required was entirely the  fault
    of the university and the university takes full responsibility.

 7. It is surprising, to say the very least, that the Secretary of State on
    receiving this Notice of Appeal with full acceptance of  responsibility
    by the university and the evidence to show that the Applicant  met  the
    requirements of the rules did not simply withdraw  the  decision  under
    appeal and re-process the application. Instead the matter proceeded  to
    an appeal hearing on 28 May 2014 where First-tier Tribunal Judge  Troup
    allowed the Applicant's  appeal.  It  is  that  decision  that  is  now
    challenged by the Secretary of State.


Submissions

 8. On behalf the Secretary of State Mr Richards relied on the  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal and referred to the decision in  Rahman  v
    SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 11. This makes it clear  that  the  responsibility
    for ensuring that the application is correctly submitted and meets  the
    requirements of the Rules lies with the applicant and that there is  no
    unfairness in holding applicants to this responsibility. The Judge  was
    clearly wrong in finding that the Applicant met the requirements of the
    rules when the rules required specific evidence and that  evidence  had
    not been submitted.

 9. The Applicant said that it was unfair that  her  application  had  been
    rejected when the university accept that it was their  mistake.  It  is
    unfair to expect her to accept responsibility for  their  mistake.  She
    trusted them. They made a mistake and they  have  apologised  for  that
    mistake. She has the required money. This has caused her a  substantial
    problem. She has been unable to travel for almost a year. It has had  a
    substantial impact on her life in the United Kingdom. This is a problem
    that needs to be sorted out for the future for the sake of others. Most
    of the universities have this problem.  The  university  administrative
    staff are asked to take responsibility for  student's  applications  to
    help students to get things right. Where the university makes  mistakes
    this has a serious impact upon the student.

Error of law

10. I explained to the Applicant that it was regrettable that the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal contained a clear error of law and that  the
    decision would be set  aside  and  remade  dismissing  the  Applicant's
    appeal. I reserved my written reasons.

11. In my judgement the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  discloses  a
    clear  and  material  error  of  law.  The  Immigration  Rules  require
    specified evidence that the maintenance requirements of the  Rules  are
    met to be submitted with the application. The required evidence was not
    submitted with this application. Whether that  was  the  fault  of  the
    university (and I am completely satisfied that it was) or the fault  of
    the Applicant is immaterial. In this case the  specified  evidence  was
    not submitted with the application so the appeal must fail.

12. The Applicant submits that the decision is unfair. In my  judgement  it
    is not. The Respondent is following the rules and it cannot  be  unfair
    to follow the Rules. The fact that I consider, as  stated  above,  that
    the Respondent could and should have withdrawn  the  decision  when  it
    became clear, after the decision had been made, that the Appellant  met
    the requirements of the rules does not make the decision unfair. I have
    no doubt that the effect on the Appellant has been and continues to  be
    unfair but this unfairness is  the  result  of  the  mistake  made  and
    admitted by the university and prolonged by the  Secretary  of  State's
    failure to take a pragmatic approach.

13. It follows that I must allow the appeal of the Secretary of State,  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and re-make the  decision
    and dismiss Applicant's appeal. In doing so I can only express the hope
    that the Secretary of State will look carefully  and  expeditiously  at
    any application that the Applicant now makes with a  view  to  granting
    the appropriate leave if the Applicant currently meet the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.


  Summary

14. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I allow the Respondent's appeal and I set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

15. I remake the decision by dismissing the Applicant's appeal.
