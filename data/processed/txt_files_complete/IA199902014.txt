Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr J Walsh, counsel (instructed by Graceland
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Ghana, born  on  19  August  1993.  Her
      appeal against the respondent's decision dated 22 April 2014 to refuse
      to issue her a residence  under Regulation 26 of the Immigration (EEA)
      Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") as a family member of an EEA
      National exercising Treaty rights in the  UK,  was  dismissed  by  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge in a  decision  promulgated  on  9  February
      2015.


   2. The appellant had failed to discharge the burden  of  proof  that  her
      marriage was not one of convenience. There were  some  inconsistencies
      in the evidence, some of which were not reconciled by the  mere  claim
      that the EEA national's parents were hostile to the relationship [28].
       The Judge found that the  appellant  had  failed  to  show  that  the
      marriage was not one of convenience [34].


   3. On 14 April  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Simpson  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable  that
      the  Judge  had  overlooked  documentary   evidence   supporting   the
      appellant's claim to have lived at  [                       ] with her
      sponsor.


   4. On 3 July 2015, the Upper Tribunal found on error of law in  that  the
      Judge had not properly engaged  with  the  potential  significance  of
      evidence produced which tended to show  that  the  appellant  and  her
      husband had been living together at [                 ]. Nor  did  the
      Judge assess or evaluate the potential significance of their  detailed
      awareness of their day to day activities with each other. The decision
      was set aside. This is the re-hearing.


   5. The appellant had applied  under  Regulation  7(1)  (a)  of  the  2006
      Regulations for the issue of a residence card as the family member  of
      an Italian national, Achina Seth Collins.


   6. It has not been disputed that her husband has  been  employed  at  all
      relevant times and that he  has  been  exercising  Treaty  rights.  He
      produced copies of his payslips from 16  January  2014  until  2  July
      2015. He has also provided a copy of his P60 end of  year  certificate
      for the tax year to 5 April 2015.


   7. It is common ground that the appellant's immigration background is  as
      follows. She entered the UK in July 2013 as a  visitor.   Her  sponsor
      proposed to her during  this  visit.  She  received  advice  from  her
      solicitors and gave notice of intention to  marry  her  sponsor.   She
      then returned to Italy on 13 August 2013 and returned to the UK on  14
      September 2013. She  was  arrested  at  the  wedding  ceremony  on  16
      September 2013.  She was granted temporary release  and  she  and  her
      sponsor subsequently married on 9 October 2013.  She then submitted an
      application under the  Regulations  which  contained  evidence  of  an
      address as their residence [26].


   8. Six months later, Immigration Officers  attended  that  address.  When
      questioned by the officials the sponsor's parents denied knowledge  of
      the marriage and appeared to know little about the appellant,  despite
      her claim in oral evidence  that  she  had  known  her  husband  since
      childhood and that his parents knew her mother [26].


   9. The appellant claimed that at the time  of  the  visit,  she  and  her
      husband had been living together at a different address. There was  no
      suggestion in her evidence that this  information  was  given  to  the
      immigration officers. Instead, his parents said  that  their  son  had
      continued to live at their home. Accordingly,  the  Judge  found  that
      this was 'reasonable evidence' entitling  the  respondent  to  suspect
      that the marriage was not genuine, but one of convenience [26].


  10. Mr Walsh did not dispute that the respondent had been entitled to have
      an initial suspicion concerning the  genuineness  of  their  marriage,
      having regard to the home visit of the officers to the  address  which
      they had for the appellant and her husband. It was  however  contended
      that  the  appellant  met  the  evidential  burden  addressing   those
      concerns.


     The appellant's case


  11. The appellant attended the hearing on the  20  August  2015  and  gave
      evidence. At the outset, Mr Walsh produced the  original  payslips  of
      the appellant's husband copies of which are found at  pages  27-54  of
      the bundle. This he said was to demonstrate that the husband's address
      on those payslips was [               ]. However, it is  evident  from
      the bundle itself that  the  copies  of  the  payslips  do  show  that
      address.


  12. Ms Isherwood  was  given  the  opportunity  to  examine  the  original
      payslips. I also perused them. At the end of  the  hearing  they  were
      handed back to the appellant's husband.


  13. The appellant adopted her witness  statement  dated  14  October  2014
      (pages 1-7).


  14. She is a Ghanaian national. She was born in Ghana on 19  August  1993.
      She was taken to Italy by her parents when she was ten years old where
      she was educated. She  was  granted  indefinite  leave  in  Italy  and
      acquired that status automatically as soon as she "clocked" 18  years.
      She speaks fluent Italian. She  also  speaks  English,  which  is  the
      language she used when giving her evidence. She is completely fluent.


  15. She had known her husband, Mr Seth Achina, from  the  time  they  were
      growing up as children in Italy. They then lost contact in  2009  when
      Seth relocated to the UK.


  16. She met him again in 2011 when he  came  to  Italy  on  holiday.  They
      started a relationship. This flourished and her  husband  returned  to
      the  UK  at  the  end  of  his  holiday.  They   maintained   constant
      communication after that. He visited Italy at every opportunity to see
      her.


  17. It was agreed that she should visit him  in  the  UK  in  2013.  Their
      "union" was very strong and they were really looking to  get  married.
      He had not yet proposed and they continued to date each other.


  18. She submitted an application to visit her husband in the  UK  in  2013
      which was granted from 23  June  2013  until  24  December  2013.  She
      visited him in the UK on 14 July 2013 and departed on 13 August 2013.


  19. During that first visit, her husband proposed to her on 20 July  2013.
      She agreed to marry him. He then sought legal advice  from  solicitors
      on whether or not she could marry him in the UK. He was  advised  that
      it was possible and that she could then apply to  vary  her  leave  to
      enter the UK after their marriage.


  20. Her husband rang Croydon Council and explained the situation.  It  was
      confirmed they could get married in the UK. She claimed that they have
      a record of that conversation  with  the  Council.  During  her  cross
      examination she said that the record of the conversation is  still  on
      her husband's telephone.  When  her  husband  was  cross  examined  Ms
      Isherwood did not require him to produce it.


  21. They then gave notice of marriage at  Croydon  Council  prior  to  her
      departure from the UK.


  22. She came to the UK on 14  September  2013  to  marry  her  husband  at
      Croydon Registry scheduled on 16 September 2013. She was arrested  and
      detained on an allegation of deception which included the  failure  to
      provide information to the UKBA regarding her private and family life.




  23. She was interviewed under PACE and was informed that she was  arrested
      because she had tried to marry "with a visitor's visa".  She  had  not
      informed immigration at the airport that she was coming to  marry  her
      husband. She informed the UKBA that they had sought legal  advice  and
      had checked with the local Council and 'got the  go  ahead'.  She  was
      then taken to a removal centre to be removed to Italy on 21  September
      2013.


  24. Her husband then instructed her current solicitors. A judicial  review
      application challenging the legality of her removal  resulted  in  the
      removal directions being cancelled. She was released to go home to her
      husband.


  25. They then returned to the Croydon marriage registry and  were  married
      on 9 October 2013. They started living together as a family at her  in
      laws' at [            ]. She eventually moved out because they refused
      to consent to the marriage. That was in  November  2013.  Her  husband
      rented a room for her which was about 5  minutes  from  her  in  laws'
      address.


  26. Her husband resided with her for three nights a week and when  he  did
      not sleep in her room he would leave around midnight  and  walk  home.
      That continued until they rented "a better  apartment"  which  is  the
      address at [                                 ].


  27. She submitted her application for a residence card the week after  the
      marriage.


  28. She was also granted a right to work after it was acknowledged by  the
      Home Office  in  October  2013  that  her  application  was  valid.  A
      certificate of application was  issued  to  her.  She  applied  for  a
      national insurance number and  obtained  employment  at  the  Woolwich
      branch of MacDonald's where she has been employed ever since.


  29. She was  told  by  her  solicitors  to  attend  a  scheduled  marriage
      interview with her husband at Liverpool on  12  March  2014.  She  was
      looking forward to attending. However, the Home Office  cancelled  the
      interview as a result of the non-availability of an interpreter.


  30. On 22 April 2014, immigration officers attended the address at her  in
      laws'. Her husband however was with her at their rented accommodation,
      some 5 minutes away. Her in laws did not consent to  the  marriage  as
      they believed that they were too young to enter into a marriage.


  31. They did not receive another interview date from the Home  Office  but
      her application was refused.


  32. The report of the Enforcement Team relating to a  visit  conducted  by
      the South London Immigration Compliance and Enforcement Team dated  22
      April 2014 was produced. The team gained entrance to  her  parents  in
      laws' property at around 6.40am.


  33. The appellant's husband was not present. The  two  occupants  (her  in
      laws) knew of the "subject" but stated that she did not live  at  that
      address. They confirmed that their son "was friends" with  the  female
      and although they stated that the son lived in the house, he  was  not
      home at the time of the visit.


  34. When they stated that they wanted to speak to the appellant and  their
      son about the marriage, they both laughed and indicated that they knew
      nothing of it.


  35. Her mother in law was questioned about the relationship. She said that
      she had known the appellant for around one year and that she  believed
      that the pair might have met in Italy. However, she was  evasive.  She
      stated that she believed that the appellant worked  at  a  MacDonald's
      restaurant but was not sure of its location.


  36. That is the full report.


  37. The appellant said that her husband studied at the University of  East
      London and also works part time at a MacDonald's 'at another address'.




  38. They rented their accommodation at [                    ] on  23  July
      2014 and have resided there.


  39. In her oral evidence, she said that she still lives at  that  address.
      However, they are about to move "in the next few days" to  an  address
      in Rochester. She explained that  the  current  address  is  a  studio
      apartment. There is more ample accommodation in Rochester. She has not
      seen her in laws for about a year.


  40. In cross-examination, she claimed, as noted  above,  that  the  report
      from Croydon Council referred to at paragraph 8 of her  statement  was
      on her husband's phone. She also said that  she  gave  this  to  their
      solicitors.


  41.  She  was  referred  to  a  copy  of  the  tenancy  agreement  for   [
         ]. This is their assured shorthold tenancy agreement dated 11  June
      2014 in respect of [              ]. The term  commenced  on  23  June
      2014 and ends on 3 November 2014.


  42. She said that there is no other written agreement. There is  no  other
      documentary evidence showing that they both live at that address.  The
      bills are in her husband's name only. The utility costs  are  part  of
      the  rental  agreement.  At  paragraphs  23  and  24  of  the  tenancy
      agreement, it is recorded that the landlord is responsible for payment
      of various utilities and other charges. The tenant is responsible  for
      charges regarding internet, cable, telephone and the like.


  43. The rent is paid by cash which is given directly to the landlord. They
      do everything "50-50." She gets half from her wages. Her husband has a
      Barclays account. He has also opened a  Lloyds  account  in  his  name
      which she uses. Her wages are  paid  to  his  Lloyds  account  by  her
      employer. From the evidence produced it appears  that  there  are  two
      Lloyds accounts in her husband's name,  one  of  which  is  a  savings
      account and the  other  a  Classic  account.  There  are  regular  and
      frequent transfers between those two accounts.  The  sponsor  did  not
      produce his Barclays account when he later gave evidence.


  44. The appellant works at the Woolwich  branch  of  MacDonald's  and  her
      husband at another. She was not working during  the  currency  of  her
      visit visa. When she applied for her  residence  card  she  was  given
      written permission to work. I  was  informed  by  Mr  Walsh  that  the
      application was made on 16 October  2013  and  she  began  working  at
      MacDonald's after she made the application.


  45. She has a Lloyds bank card which she uses to access cash. She produced
      the card. She was referred to page 57, which contains  a  Lloyds  bank
      credit card statement dated 1 October 2014. She said she  takes  money
      using the debit card that she produced. The  card  she  produced  when
      giving evidence is a Lloyds visa debit card with  the  account  number
      given. The details of the card are shown at page 73 of the bundle. Her
      husband has an E Savings account with Lloyds. His statements have been
      produced for the period up to and including  June  2015.  The  address
      where  the  account  is  sent  is   their   current   address   at   [
             ].


  46. She was taken to page 67 showing a transfer of �352 from  the  savings
      account to her husband's other Lloyds account. There are a  number  of
      transfers into that account. There are also transfers into the savings
      account from her husband's Classic account. She said that  the  monies
      transferred out of the savings account were used to pay the rent.  She
      was referred to the various  transfers  into  her  husband's  Barclays
      account, said to be "students additions".


  47. She claimed that she funded her husband's driving lessons.


  48. She was cross-examined on the photographs produced. She accepted  that
      most of the photos  are  "selfies."  She  was  questioned  about  what
      celebrations they had for their  first  wedding  anniversary.  Friends
      came to their house. They produced a  cake,  said  to  appear  on  the
      photograph  which  she  identified  at  page  194.  The  friends  took
      photographs of them. That was not  a  selfie.  Her  husband  gave  her
      flowers and a card. She also gave him a card.


  49. She was asked how they celebrated her birthday, which  coincided  with
      the day prior to the hearing on 20 August 2015  -  the  appellant  was
      born on 19 August 1993. She said  they  went  "last  night"  to  their
      friend's  house  to  celebrate  her  birthday.  She  produced   colour
      photographs  of  the  celebration  as  well  as  photographs  of   the
      celebration of her birthday in 2014.


  50. She lives with her husband at  [                       ]  which  is  a
      studio flat. They intend moving to [                      ]. This is a
      larger apartment which has a separate bedroom.


  51. Her family has not been to see them. She speaks to them each day. They
      know her husband. Her mother did not come to the wedding  because  she
      did not have an Italian passport at the time.


  52. Her husband speaks to her family in Italy. That is when she calls  her
      mother. Her parents  however  are  divorced.  She  has  not  seen  her
      husband's parents for almost a year. Her husband speaks to his  family
      about once a week or so.


  53. She was asked when he last saw his family when he had to have the  MOT
      test for his car. He went to his father's house as his  father  stated
      that he knew a place where they could "do it cheaper for him." He  has
      a fairly decent relationship with his family.


  54. She said her husband did tell his parents about the wedding  and  that
      they would be marrying. They said they were too young. Her mother said
      that she would not come to the wedding.


  55. She has a relationship with her husband's sisters and sees  them.  She
      went to the cinema with his 'little sister' last month. She produced a
      photograph of the occasion. They do not attend family gatherings.  Her
      husband has cousins in Bedford.


  56. They celebrated her birthday party in 2014 at her  husband's  parents'
      house as his parents were in Ghana at the time.


  57. When Ms Isherwood put to her that  the  immigration  officer's  report
      stated that his mother did not know about the marriage, she said  that
      she did. She refused to come  to  the  wedding.  She  knew  about  the
      marriage. When asked why she would dispute it, she said it was because
      his mother was against the marriage.


  58. She was referred to paragraph 19 of her  husband's  witness  statement
      where he states that his mother was not supportive. As a result,  they
      chose to keep them in the dark about the marriage. That  is  why  they
      could not confirm that he and the appellant are  married.  He  claimed
      that they told her about their application.


  59. It was put to her that she has entered into a marriage of convenience.
      That is not true. They went against everyone to be together.  This  is
      what they wanted. They remain happily married.


  60. She was asked whether her intention was to study in the UK.  She  said
      if she can stay, she will complete a course. She had not entered  with
      that visa because she wanted to come and see her husband. She did  not
      marry him in order to study. She had completed her education in  Italy
      in 2013.


  61. In re-examination, she was asked whether there  was  any  evidence  of
      payments to the landlord in cash. She  referred  to  page  108,  where
      there are several receipts during 2014 and up to  April  2015  showing
      that the landlord received �700 either from the appellant or from  her
      husband, or on occasion from both (as  shown  in  receipt  number  11,
      dated 23.10.2014).


  62. Her mother has met her husband in Italy. When he  went  there  on  one
      occasion he stayed at her house.


  63. With regard to the conversation with the immigration officer about her
      wish to study, she told him that that they did not have  enough  money
      for a student visa.


  64. She was taken to page  164  which  contains  a  photograph  which  she
      identified of her and her best  friend,  Christabel,  a  witness.  The
      photograph at p207 is of Christabel  and  Jeff,  who  is  Christabel's
      husband.


  65. Mr Seth Collins Achina Techie Menson attended  the  hearing  and  gave
      evidence. He adopted his witness statement  signed  and  dated  on  20
      October 2014.


  66. He is an Italian national who came to the UK with his parents in  June
      2009. He has lived here ever since. He is in  the  second  year  of  a
      three year course at university.


  67. He met the appellant in Italy when they were small. The rest of  their
      common history as set out in the appellant's statement is confirmed by
      him.


  68. When their marriage scheduled for  16  September  2013  started,  UKBA
      officers and police interrupted it. The appellant was arrested. He was
      also interrogated. It was contended that they were engaged in  a  sham
      marriage.


  69. After the appellant's release, they got married on 9 October 2013.  He
      confirms that they had lived together at his parents' address.


  70. They refused to keep his parents involved  or  informed  as  to  their
      relationship and their marriage. They  were  not  impressed  with  the
      relationship. His wife in due course moved out of the  parents'  house
      in about November 2013 and went to live  in  a  shared  apartment.  He
      frequently visited her at that address.


  71. They obtained their own rented apartment  in  July  2014  after  their
      first scheduled  interview  was  cancelled.  They  were  not  given  a
      subsequent date. When the officers came to his  parents'  house,  they
      were not aware of the marriage. His mother  was  not  supportive  when
      they made their intentions to get married known to her. He thus  chose
      to keep them in the dark about their marriage.


  72. In his oral evidence, he said that they would  be  moving  in  on  the
      following Sunday to their apartment in Rochester.


  73. In cross examination he said he had problems with his parents  in  the
      past. Sometimes he talked to them on the phone and  visits  them.  The
      appellant does not talk to them.


  74. He last saw his family a week ago,  on  Monday.  He  went  because  he
      wanted to do his MOT and his father knew a place where it was cheaper,
      so he showed him the address.


  75. He told his family that he wanted to get married  when  the  appellant
      went back to Italy in August 2013.


  76. They do not attend any family gatherings with his parents. He  has  an
      uncle in the UK who lives in Milton Keynes. His wife has not seen him.
      She has not had contact with him.


  77. He was questioned about their wedding anniversary. A friend brought  a
      cake as a surprise at their flat. He gave his wife a card and she gave
      him one as well.


  78. When asked about his wife's birthday in 2014, he said that a  surprise
      party was arranged at his parents' house  where  he  invited  friends,
      Christabel and Jeff.


  79. When the appellant first came to the UK, she intended to visit him. He
      proposed to her on that occasion.


  80. He was asked about his wife's intention to study in the UK. She was in
      Italy in her final year. He asked her to study here. She did not  want
      to leave her family. He did not discuss anything about  the  financing
      of her studying. He was aware she could not afford to get the  student
      visa. That is not why they married.


  81. They pay the rent by cash - �700 a month. They each usually contribute
      �350. In the last few months her shifts have  decreased.  Some  months
      she sends him money to his account and sometimes it is withdrawn  from
      a cash machine. They 'put it together'. He has a Barclays  account  as
      well as two Lloyds accounts.


  82. He opened one of the Lloyds accounts for the appellant. He also has  a
      Barclays credit card account which she uses. She has no account in her
      own name. The actual card is in her name.


  83. It was put to him that there is no evidence of a bank account in  both
      their names. The card shows another address. He said that the bank did
      not agree to change the address to include her. She does not  use  the
      credit card.


  84. Her wages are paid into the Lloyds account.  They  would  not  however
      allow her her own account  as  she  does  not  have  a  passport.  The
      Barclays credit card is in her own name. She transfers money into  his
      Barclays account for bills and shopping.


  85. It was put to him that the documentary evidence is all in his name. He
      accepts that it is in his name. He said it is  difficult  because  she
      needs a passport in order to open a bank account.


  86. In re-examination, he said that  the  credit  card  address  is  at  [
            ]. That is the place he used to live with his wife for  a  short
      period. That is where his parents live. This was for about two months.


  87. Ms Christabel Bray attended the hearing and gave evidence. She adopted
      her witness statement dated 15 July 2015.  She  is  a  friend  of  the
      appellant. She has known her since she was 10 years old. She  met  her
      whilst living in Italy.  She came to the UK in 2009. She  remained  in
      contact with the appellant.


  88. In 2011 the  appellant  told  her  about  her  relationship  with  her
      husband. She was happy for her.


  89. In 2013, the appellant contacted her and she  went  to  see  her.  She
      informed her that her husband had proposed and they were  planning  to
      get married. The plan was that she would attend the  wedding  but  she
      could not as it was her first day at university.


  90. They could not celebrate the wedding after that as the  appellant  was
      arrested. However, she and her husband surprised the appellant and her
      husband on their wedding anniversary with a party at their house.


  91. She knew that the appellant was living with her husband's  family  and
      they celebrated her birthday at his parents' house.  His  parents  had
      travelled to Ghana for a month.


  92. The appellant moved out to shared accommodation "due  to  some  family
      issues". She visited her in that accommodation.


  93. She assisted the appellant in searching  for  suitable  accommodation.
      She finally secured accommodation when she and her  husband  moved  in
      together.


  94. She and her husband have  visited  them  at  their  house  on  several
      occasions. They also celebrated Christmas  together  as  a  couple  at
      their house.


  95. She asserts that their relationship is genuine and  that  they  are  a
      loving couple.  She confirmed that the photograph at  page  164  shows
      her.


  96. In cross examination, she said she became aware of their  relationship
      in roughly 2011. She was in  the  UK  and  was  in  contact  with  the
      appellant. She did not discuss  her coming to the  UK.   Nor  did  she
      discuss the options of her coming to the UK. She said she was about to
      come for a holiday. She came because she wanted to visit Seth and  the
      family and was to stay at her husband's house.


  97. The appellant told her that her husband had proposed to her. She  then
      realised that she would stay. She did not discuss with her 'doing  any
      studying in the UK'.


  98. She sees the appellant every  week.  She  is  currently  on  maternity
      leave. She worked at a care home.


  99. Mr Jeff Okanta attended the hearing and gave evidence. He adopted  his
      witness statement dated 15 July 2015. He knows the  appellant  through
      his friend, Seth, as well as through his wife, Christabel. He met Seth
      in 2010 in the UK. His wife told him that Seth was getting married  to
      her friend, the appellant.


 100. Once he and Christabel got married,  the  appellant  and  Seth  became
      close as couples. They would attend each  others'  house.  They  would
      occasionally go to restaurants and cinemas together.


 101. He and his wife surprised the appellant  and  Seth  on  their  wedding
      anniversary with a party at their house.


 102. He knew that the appellant was living in Seth's family house  as  they
      celebrated her birthday there when his parents travelled to Ghana  for
      a month. They also celebrated Christmas together as couples  at  their
      house.


 103. He attests to the genuineness of their relationship.


 104. There was no cross examination.


     Submissions


 105. Ms Isherwood relied on the reasons for  refusal.  She  submitted  that
      this is a marriage  of  convenience.  The  evidence  shows  legitimate
      suspicions. The burden then shifts.


 106. She submitted that the tenancy agreement ran out; she accepted however
      that it could be 'a rolling one'.


 107. The vast majority of documents bar the invoice sent to  the  appellant
      at [              ] on 2 April 2015 (p122) are in the husband's name.


 108. There was conflicting evidence as to  whether  her  husband's  parents
      were aware of the wedding. The appellant claimed that she did not know
      where all his relatives were in the UK.


 109. There was nothing clear about  the  financial  circumstances  of  this
      couple. Both the Lloyds accounts are in his own name. It  was  claimed
      that the savings account was used for her to pay her  wages.  No  wage
      slips, however, were produced. Her husband also claimed that there was
      a Barclays account in joint  names.  There  was  no  evidence  of  the
      Barclays account. His wages are paid into that account.


 110. The appellant is not shown to be connected to the current address. Nor
      are basic facts clear. It is not  known  whether  his  parents  became
      aware of the marriage or not. This is to be compared with the mother's
      evidence in the report that she knew nothing of it. Their evidence was
      that they did not keep the parents informed.


 111. She submitted that the intention of the  appellant  initially  was  to
      study.


 112. The vast majority of the photos are "selfies." There is  no  statement
      from any of the  appellant's  family  members.  Accordingly  no  clear
      picture relating to the current circumstances is available.


 113. On behalf of the appellant,  Mr  Walsh  referred  to  the  immigration
      officer's report dated 22 April 2014. From that  report  it  is  clear
      that the husband's mother said she had  heard  of  the  appellant  and
      believed she was working at a MacDonald's  restaurant.  She  confirmed
      that she had known the appellant for around a year and  accepted  that
      the pair might have  met  in  Italy.  Accordingly,  there  was  not  a
      complete  denial  from   the   appellant's   parents   regarding   the
      relationship between the appellant and their son. At that  stage,  the
      appellant had moved out to [           ] in July 2014.


 114.  There   is   moreover   evidence   linking   the   appellant   to   [
         ]. With regard to the alleged "inconsistencies" in relation to  the
      relatives in the UK, the appellant did state that he  had  a  relative
      "in Bedford" or Milton Keynes. This was a distant relative.


 115. There were questions put during cross examination  relating  to  their
      knowledge of how anniversaries and birthdays  were  spent.  They  were
      completely consistent in relation to that. The  evidence  relating  to
      the visit to his parents last week with regard to the MOT was  telling
      and  is  a  pointer  to  the  genuineness  and  subsistence   of   the
      relationship.


 116. With regard to the two witnesses called on the appellant's behalf,  it
      was not even put to them whether they knew about the relationship  for
      some time. Christabel stated that it was from 2011. Their evidence  is
      consistent with a genuine relationship. They  were  prepared  to  come
      along to give this evidence and there is weighty corroboration of  the
      appellant's case.


 117. Insofar as the bank statements are concerned, these are  produced  for
      the  purpose  of  showing  that   the   husband   is   linked   to   [
        ]. They do confirm that. The Lloyds bank accounts are addressed to [
                        ] - pages 71 and 79.


 118. The evidence must  be  looked  at  as  a  whole.  It  is  particularly
      significant that two years have elapsed since the  wedding.  They  are
      still living together and intend to  move  to  another  property.  The
      relationship is accordingly genuine.


     Assessment


 119. I found the evidence of both the  appellant  and  her  husband  to  be
      essentially credible. I have had regard to Ms Isherwood's  submissions
      regarding  the  alleged  inconsistencies   revealed   by   her   cross
      examination, particularly relating to the husband's bank statements.


 120. I have also had regard  to  a  substantial  amount  of  agreement  and
      consistency revealed in many  of  the  questions  asked  during  cross
      examination. The appellant gave her evidence during which  no  witness
      remained in court. When her husband and her two witnesses came to give
      evidence, there had been no opportunity for them to speak  or  discuss
      the case. Each witness was called as soon as the evidence  of  one  of
      them was completed. There was no break  following  the  completion  of
      their evidence


 121. I do accept Ms Isherwood's contention that there is an absence of  any
      coherent evidence relating to the payment of her wages into any of her
      husband's accounts. The husband has not produced all of his  accounts.
      There was also evidence from the husband  that  his  wife  has  had  a
      credit card issued by Barclays Bank which she uses.


 122. On the other hand it is evident that there is a substantial amount  of
      transfers between the appellant's husband's Lloyds account.  There  is
      also evidence that the appellant has use of a Lloyds debit card  which
      she produced during the hearing.


 123. I have had regard to the Tribunal's decision in Papajorgji (EEA Spouse
      - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC). There is no
      burden on the claimant in  an  application  for  a  family  permit  to
      establish that she was not party to a marriage of  convenience  unless
      the circumstances known to the decision maker give  reasonable  ground
      for suspecting that this  was  the  case.  Absent  such  a  basis  for
      suspicion,  the  application  should  be  granted  without   more   on
      production of the documents set out in Article 10  of  the  Directive.
      Where  there  is  such  suspicion,   the   matter   requires   further
      investigation and the claimant should be invited  to  respond  to  the
      basis of suspicion by producing evidential material to dispel it.


 124. A marriage of convenience in this context is a marriage contracted for
      the sole or decisive purpose of gaining admission to the host state.


 125. I have assessed the evidence of the appellant and her husband relating
      to the genuineness of their marriage as part  of  the  evidence  as  a
      whole including documentary evidence.


 126.  That  includes  the  tenancy  agreement  (page  109)  relating  to  [
          ]. That agreement was entered into on 11 June  2014.  Although  it
      was stated to end on 23 November 2014. I find  that  the  tenancy  has
      continued since then up until the present. In that respect, I have had
      regard to the numerous receipts for the period 2014 and 2015 to  which
      I have already referred. These are set out at page 108 of  the  bundle
      and show the payment each month of the sum  of  �700  received  either
      from the appellant, her husband or both. There has been  no  challenge
      to the authenticity of those receipts.


 127. I have had regard to other documents including the invoice sent to the
      appellant at     [                        ] on 2  April  2015  from  a
      beauty parlour. There is also reference to a delivery from  Amazon  to
      the appellant at that address, albeit that the date is  not  shown  in
      the copy of the exhibit produced.  There  is  a  letter  sent  to  the
      appellant at that address from the Electoral Registration  Officer  in
      November 2014 and a further letter to  that  address  on  12  December
      2014.  There is a letter from the Senior  Electoral  Administrator  to
      the appellant at that address on 14 November  2014  in  which  she  is
      invited to complete the application form.


 128. I have also had  regard  to  the  evidence  produced  of  letters  and
      statements sent to the appellant's husband at that address during 2014
      and 2015. That includes  his  wage  slips  as  well  as  bank  account
      statements which are enclosed from pages 55 to 107.  There  are  other
      documents confirming his address, including  his  counterpart  driving
      licence (page 120). This constituted a provisional entitlement from  8
      June 2015. There are other letters sent to the appellant's husband  at
      pages 124-132. There is a letter dated 27  September  2014  from  Sky,
      between September 2014 and April 2015 (pages 139-141) at that address.




 129. There are also letters from Wyndham Rewards sent to the  appellant  at
      that address dated 12 September 2014 and copies of an incentive  award
      card for him dated 3 October 2014 (142-144).  There  is  an  enrolment
      notice relating to a pension scheme sent to him at that address on  30
      November 2014 (page 145). There is also a letter from Experian sent to
      him at that address on 18 December 2014.


 130. I have also considered the evidence of the  appellant's  witnesses.  I
      found their evidence to be straightforward and credible. In any event,
      Mr Okanta was not challenged or cross examined at all.


 131. As noted by Mr Walsh during his submissions,  the  appellant  and  her
      husband were very properly tested on matters relating to personal  and
      intimate details which could be expected to be  known  and  shared  by
      persons living together in the marriage.


 132. Apart from the fact that each witness confirmed anniversaries and what
      they did on Christmas, including who attended  the  social  gatherings
      and birthdays, there was also the telling  evidence  relating  to  the
      visit by the appellant's husband to his father's  home  about  a  week
      earlier in connection with his MOT renewal.


 133. There was also the evidence as to what had happened the day before the
      hearing, which happened to be the birth date  of  the  appellant.  The
      nature of the celebration which  took  place  as  well  as  those  who
      attended that social gathering were identified by  the  appellant  and
      her husband. That had not  been  a  part  of  their  written  evidence
      produced.


 134. I have also had regard to the fact that their initial  attempt  to  be
      married was thwarted by the authorities at the marriage ceremony where
      the appellant was in fact arrested  and  detained.  They  nevertheless
      decided to get married shortly after that. I have also had  regard  to
      the fact that the appellant was looking forward to  being  interviewed
      by the Home Office authorities in Liverpool. It is through no fault of
      their own that that meeting was  cancelled.  However,  they  were  not
      afforded an opportunity to attend a further interview.


 135. I direct myself according to  the  approach  endorsed  in  Papajorgji,
      supra. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I am  satisfied  that
      the appellant has shown to the required standard that her marriage was
      not entered into for the sole reason of securing a right to reside  in
      the  UK.  In  particular,  I  find  that  there  has  been  continuous
      cohabitation since their attempt to  marry  at  the  Croydon  Register
      office on 16 September 2013. They have now been together and cohabited
      for over two years.


 136. I am accordingly satisfied that the appellant has shown on the balance
      of probabilities that theirs is a genuine relationship.  The  marriage
      undoubtedly provides her with an immigration advantage. However,  this
      does not result in its characterisation as a marriage of  convenience.
      I  find  that  their  cohabitation  is  quite  inconsistent  with  the
      suggestion that the marriage has  been  contracted  for  the  sole  or
      decisive purpose of gaining admission to the UK.


 137. I accordingly find that the decision  of  the  respondent  is  not  in
      accordance with the law and the 2006 Regulations.






      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law. Having set it aside, I re-make  the  decision
      allowing the appellant's appeal under the 2006 Regulations.


      No anonymity direction is made.
