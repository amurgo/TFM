                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Graham who in a determination dated 19 November
    2013 dismissed their appeals against a decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to issue residence cards under  Regulation  17  of  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  as  family  members  of  an  EEA
    national.

2.   The first appellant is the wife  of  an  EEA  national  and  the  other
    appellants are their children.  They were refused  residence  cards  on
    the basis that it could not be shown that  the  husband  of  the  first
    appellant and the father of the other appellants was exercising  treaty
    rights in Britain.  The only evidence that was before the Secretary  of
    State and before the judge was a letter from S  &  S  Hair  and  Beauty
    Limited dated 22 November 2012 which stated that the sponsor  had  been
    employed since 8 November 2012 as a barber working 24 hours a week  and
    a P45 which stated that he had left that employment on  14  June  2013.
    The sponsor had also produced evidence of two wage slips  for  31  July
    and 31 August  2013  which  appeared  to  have  been  issued  by  India
    Restaurants Limited showing a net pay of ï¿½643.76 per month.

3.   The judge, with regard to the sponsor's claimed employment with S  &  S
    Hair and Beauty Limited, stated that she noted  that  the  company  had
    claimed to be a limited company and yet there was nothing on the letter
    provided to show the company registration number at Companies House and
    there were no contact details.  She wrote:-

         "I have not found it credible that a  commercially  viable  company
         would fail to provide a landline telephone number on  their  letter
         heading.  I am satisfied that the P45 form can be completed by  any
         person, there is no official stamp on the form.   The  sponsor  has
         not submitted a contract of employment or wage slips or  any  other
         documentation relating to this employment.   Taking  all  of  these
         factors into account I find that I am not satisfied to the required
         standard  that  this  documentation  is  reliable.   In   all   the
         circumstances I do not accept that the EEA sponsor was employed  by
         S & S Hair and Beauty Limited."

4.   With regard to the sponsor's claim that he had been employed  by  India
    Restaurants Limited the judge wrote:-

         "The sponsor has not provided any other  documentation  to  support
         this employment such as a contract of employment or  an  employer's
         letter detailing the hours and rates of pay  for  this  employment.
         The wage slips state that the sponsor is paid  in  cash,  therefore
         there is no trace of the salary in the sponsor's bank  account.   I
         consider that these two wage slips taken alone  are  unsatisfactory
         evidence of his employment with this company.  In addition even  if
         I were to accept these two wage slips  as  evidence  of  employment
         there is no indication as to whether this employment  is  temporary
         or a permanent position.  I  have  considered  the  reliability  of
         these wage slips by looking at the matter  in  the  round.   Having
         done  so  and  bearing  in  mind  the  complete  absence  of  other
         documentation such as a contract of employment or  details  of  the
         extent and permanency of this employment I do not accept these wage
         slips as reliable evidence of the sponsor's employment."

5.   The judge concluded that she could not be satisfied  that  the  sponsor
    was exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

6.   The appellants applied for  permission  to  appeal  claiming  that  the
    judge had failed to weigh the documentary evidence, she had  not  taken
    into account the P45 and P60 and that bank statements had been enclosed
    with the index to the bundle of documents which stated that the sponsor
    was receiving money in his bank account.  The judge,  it  was  claimed,
    had failed to "take into authenticity of the same".  It was also stated
    that no weight seemed to have been given to Article 8 as  it  would  be
    disproportionate to remove the family from Britain.

7.   The application was considered by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Osborne who  noted  the  grounds  of  application.   He  described  the
    determination as "otherwise careful and focused" but  stated  that  the
    judge had not considered the appellants' Article 8  rights.   He  noted
    that the initial  grounds  of  appeal  had  referred  to  the  decision
    violating the appellants' rights under "UNHCR" but said that that was a
    typographical error.  He therefore found that "it was arguable that the
    judge should have considered Article 8 rights".

8.   It is not entirely  clear  from  the  grant  of  permission  that  that
    permission was  only  granted  on  the  issue  of  the  rights  of  the
    appellants under Article 8 of the ECHR.

9.   At the hearing of the appeal before me there was no  appearance  by  or
    on behalf of the appellants.  Their solicitors, when contacted, made it
    clear that they wished the appeal dealt with on the basis of the papers
    before me.  This I now do.

10.  I agree with Judge  Osborne  that  the  determination  is  careful  and
    focused and I consider that  the  judge  properly  considered  all  the
    evidence before her and reached conclusions which were clearly open  to
    her on that evidence.  She was entitled to find that  the  sponsor  had
    not shown that he was exercising Treaty rights and therefore to dismiss
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

11.  With regard to the issue of the Article 8 rights of  the  appellants  I
    do not consider that these were argued or indeed were before the  judge
    but the reality is that there is simply no evidence of what family life
    is being exercised by the appellants with the sponsor.  Although  there
    are statements on the file these are in largely identical  terms  where
    each of the appellants states that the sponsor had been  paid  in  cash
    and had used the cash to  buy  food,  cigarettes  and  other  shopping.
    There is no detailed evidence of when the appellants arrived in Britain
    and I do not consider that there would have  been  sufficient  evidence
    before the judge for her to have reached any conclusion other than that
    the appellants have not shown that they are exercising Article 8 rights
    with the sponsor here or that their removal would be an infringement of
    those rights.

12.  In any event I note that they would have been required to pay a fee  if
    they wished to apply for leave to remain on human rights grounds.  They
    have not done so and the Secretary of State stated in  the  letters  of
    refusal that there was not an Article 8 application before her.  It  is
    clearly arguable that there was therefore not only no  application  for
    leave to remain on human rights grounds against  which  the  appellants
    could have appealed but that they indeed did not attempt to  do  so  in
    that Article 8 of the ECHR or indeed any rights under the ECHR were not
    mentioned in -
        the grounds of appeal.  In any event, as I have said,  it  is  clear
    that there was no evidence before the judge that could have led her  to
    find that the removal of the appellants would be disproportionate.

13.  I therefore find that  the  determination  of  the  judge  contains  no
    material error of law and therefore her decision stands.

Decision.
These appeals are dismissed on both immigration and human rights grounds.
