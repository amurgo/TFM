Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr C Bate Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In a decision handed down on 18 July 2017, a copy of which  appears  as
    Annex A to this decision, the Upper Tribunal found that a judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in allowing the appellant's appeal
    against the refusal of his application for leave to remain on the basis
    of his human rights, made following the service of  an  order  for  his
    deportation from the United Kingdom as a result of earlier drug related
    offences.

Background

2.   A summary, taken from the Error of Law finding, shows that  Mr  Anirah,
    a citizen of Nigeria born on 26 May 1960, entered the United Kingdom on
    2 September 1988 and was granted leave to enter as a  visitor.  Further
    periods of leave were granted as a student and on the basis of marriage
    and, on 25 May 1994, a grant of indefinite leave to remain.

3.   Mr Anirah has fathered four children with his wife, being Amber who  at
    the date of the First-tier hearing was 24, Royston who at the  date  of
    hearing was 21, Valerie who at the date  of  the  hearing  was  20  and
    William who at the date of the hearing was 18.

4.   On 19 May 2000, Mr Anirah was arrested and charged with  conspiracy  to
    import a Class A drug (cocaine) for which,  on  2  March  2001  at  the
    Canterbury Crown Court, he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.

5.   Mr Anirah was served with a notice of intention to make  a  deportation
    order on 20 May 2005. The appeal against the decision was dismissed  on
    11 July 2005, reconsideration of that decision granted, but the  appeal
    again dismissed. On 25 March 2007, a deportation  order  was  made  and
    served with removal set for 5 June 2007.

6.   In  November  2009  Mr  Anirah  filed  further  submissions  seeking  a
    revocation of the deportation order on the basis of  a  breach  of  his
    private and family life if removed. The refusal of the application  was
    appealed and on 23 March 2011 the appeal allowed. On 23 September 2011,
    the Secretary  of  State  revoked  the  deportation  order  and  on  26
    September 2011 granted Mr Anirah six months leave to remain in the UK.

7.   On 12 March 2012,  Mr  Anirah  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain
    relying on article  8.  The  application  was  refused  and  a  removal
    direction issued which, the Judge noted, was not a decision to  deport.
    The appeal against this decision was allowed on  22  March  2013  which
    resulted in a further grant of six months discretionary leave to remain
    until 25 January 2014.

8.   On 25 January 2014, Mr Anirah applied for further leave  to  remain  on
    article 8 grounds. On 9 February 2015, a new  decision  to  deport  was
    made based on the conviction in 2001. Mr Anirah was invited  to  submit
    any further representations he wished to make under Article 8 which  he
    did resulting in the refusal of a human rights claim which gave rise to
    the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

Evidence and submissions

9.   There are a number of preserved findings in  relation  to  this  appeal
    which form the starting point for the consideration of  this  tribunal.
    They are identified in the Error of Law finding as being:  The  finding
    of the Judge that Mr Anirah is unable to satisfy  the  requirements  of
    399, 399A and had failed to make out the existence of  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paragraph 399 and  399A
    which is a preserved finding under the Rules.  The  finding  Mr  Anirah
    failed to establish the existence of family life recognised by  article
    8 between him and his adult children shall also be a preserved  finding
    as shall the finding that the relationship with the  children  together
    with the other aspects identified by the Judge form part of Mr Anirah's
    private (incorrectly written as family in the  error  of  law  finding)
    life in the United Kingdom. The finding Mr  Anirah  has  no  family  in
    Nigeria, no accommodation  and  no  employment  shall  be  a  preserved
    finding although it will be necessary to consider  the  impact  of  his
    return and possibility of re-establishing himself if returned. It shall
    also be a preserved finding that Mr Anirah has not  been  convicted  of
    any further offending since the index offence."

10.  An issue arose in relation to the evidence filed for  the  purposes  of
    this appeal by the appellant's representatives which fell  outside  the
    time limit provided by the Upper Tribunal in the error of law  finding.
    The direction at paragraph 41(c) clearly states that evidence not filed
    in compliance with  the  time  limit  shall  not  be  admitted  without
    specific leave the Upper Tribunal, a barring provision.  The  direction
    also set out the method by which such permission was to  be  sought.  A
    full copy of the directions made in paragraph 41 can be seen  in  Annex
    A. No such application was made and the evidence was filed late.

11.  Mr Bates  confirmed  he  was  not  prejudiced  by  the  evidence  being
    admitted and so the Upper Tribunal was able to proceed  without  having
    to consider this matter further; although all representatives  must  be
    aware that failing to comply with a specific direction  of  a  tribunal
    without good  cause  could  result  in  a  referral  to  a  supervisory
    professional body in addition to any sanction that may  be  imposed  by
    the Tribunal itself.

12.  As the effect of the direction is that the evidence is  not  admissible
    until the appellant seeks and is granted relief from that sanction,  it
    is confirmed that such relief is granted and the evidence  provided  in
    the bundle filed under cover of a letter of 4 October 2017 admitted.

13.  That bundle contained a number of witness statements by  the  appellant
    and his children Amber, Royston, Valerie, William  and  the  children's
    mother, the appellant's previous wife, Ann.

14.  A material difference in the situation that existed  previously,  which
    exists in this appeal, is that the children have now attained  the  age
    of 18. The appellant speaks at length in his latest  witness  statement
    of his pride in the children and the ongoing nature of the contact with
    them. The appellant summarises his  position  and  desire  at  [18]  of
    statement of 22 September 2017 in the following terms:

         "18. I would like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  appeal  to  the
             Tribunal and the Home Office that I should be given the chance
             to live a normal life in the United Kingdom. I  came  to  this
             country in 1988 (29 years ago) and  had  never  been  back  to
             Nigeria. I am 57 years old now. Should I be deported, I  would
             have no one to turn to; nowhere to live and being homeless  in
             a strange land would be a death sentence to me. My father died
             in 1962 I was  brought  up  partly  by  well-wishers  and  the
             Catholic Church as my mother could not be  traced.  I  do  not
             have any  title  link  whatsoever  to  Nigeria  any  more.  My
             children are all British and have never been to Nigeria. I  do
             have a very strong bond with my children here  in  the  United
             Kingdom and would like to be part of their lives for the  rest
             of my life. I want to be  at  their  graduation  and  marriage
             ceremonies. I would  also  like  to  see  their  children  (my
             grandchildren). Please give me one last chance to be a  father
             to my children and see them grow up. It is true that they  are
             all over 18 years old now but  that  should  not  be  seen  as
             detrimental to the relationship  and  bond  between  us.  They
             remain my children  and  in  fact  the  older  they  get,  the
             stronger our bond and relationships  become.  Thank  you  very
             much for giving me this opportunity which I  will  forever  be
             grateful."

15.  In accordance with directions, that statement stands as the  appellants
    evidence in chief. In reply to questions put in cross examination,  the
    appellant confirmed that he owns a property in the United Kingdom which
    he has owned since 2012. The appellant was asked why, as  the  children
    live in Liverpool, he chose to buy a property in  Manchester  which  he
    claimed was a short distance from where he works. There is no  mortgage
    on the property in relation to which the appellant claims to have  paid
    �26,000 in cash. The appellant was asked its value and  referred  to  a
    house near him selling for �28,000 although stated his is  a  very  old
    terraced house. When asked whether if deported he could  not  sell  the
    house to raise funds the appellant claimed  the  other  house  that  he
    referred to took three to four years to sell and that his house is  run
    down and would take a long time to sell. He stated he did not think  he
    would get much and was not sure of its value. It was  clear  that  this
    issue had not been addressed by the appellant and there is no  evidence
    from an estate agent confirming its value or any issues relating to the
    sale of the same.

16.  The appellant was asked if he remained in the United Kingdom  what  job
    he would seek to which he claimed he was prepared to  do  anything.  He
    has qualifications and is trained in psychology but could not  work  in
    this field without appropriate qualifications in the UK. The  appellant
    confirmed he has health issues in relation to his chest  for  which  he
    claimed he received herbal medication and that he had been referred  to
    counselling  and  placed  on  antidepressant,  but  that  there  was  a
    considerable waiting list and the place allocated to him was lost as he
    was late for an appointment. The appellant attends church in the United
    Kingdom. It is a Pentecostal church and he confirmed he had attended  a
    Catholic Church in Nigeria.

17.  When asked about family in Nigeria, the appellant  claimed  he  had  no
    family that he knew of.

18.  The appellant has received compensation as a result  of  a  finding  of
    unlawful detention previously and when asked how much  he  received  he
    thought it was about �50,000, but was not  sure.  When  asked  about  a
    source of income, the appellant stated he could  not  work  and  cannot
    claim benefits as they had been stopped. The appellant claimed  he  was
    supported by his church who are providing him  with  welfare  payments.
    The appellant claimed he has spent all his capital.

19.  The appellant confirmed a number of members of the  Pentecostal  church
    were of a Nigerian background and that he changed  to  this  church  as
    they visited him when he was in prison. The appellant thought there was
    a branch of the same church in Nigeria.

20.  The appellant was asked why he  was  willing  to  work  in  the  United
    Kingdom but he would not do so if returned  to  Nigeria,  to  which  he
    claimed he did not want to leave the children, he has no place to  stay
    and no contacts. The appellant also claimed he could not  stay  in  the
    church since 1 May 2017, referring to the issue of the church  becoming
    a charity, but he did not know anything about a place  in  Nigeria  and
    claimed it will be difficult if not impossible for him.

21.  The appellant confirmed his children all work on a full-time  basis  in
    the UK but when asked whether they will be able to  provide  assistance
    he claimed they have needs of their own and he did not think they would
    have sufficient funds to assist him. The appellant's daughter lives  in
    France with the other three children living together in the UK.

22.  In reply to questions put in re-examination,  the  appellant  confirmed
    some of the compensation had been used to purchases his house with  the
    balance being spent to set up the property. The appellant confirmed  he
    only received welfare payments from the church  and  that  although  he
    claimed to have asked if the  church  will  be  able  to  help  him  in
    Nigeria, he had been told it is complicated due to the  charity  issues
    in the UK and that in Nigeria they would not be  compelled  to  provide
    assistance.

23.  The appellant last worked in the United Kingdom in 2000  prior  to  his
    arrest, printing invitations. The appellant claimed to have no means to
    support himself in Nigeria  and  referred  to  his  house  being  worth
    considerably less than the �28,000 received for the other  property  he
    referred to.

24.  When it was put to the appellant in re-examination that  if  his  house
    sold for around �20,000 this would enable him to establish  himself  in
    Nigeria, the appellant's reply was to state that he had not been  there
    for a long time and that he did not want to leave his children. When it
    was put to him again that if he had such financing would have enough to
    support himself in Nigeria the appellant then claimed that he might  be
    attacked and the money taken from him as he could not carry it with him
    and he would be attacked. The appellant also did not think he  had  the
    attitude that would be expected in Nigeria that he had before  he  came
    here and that culturally he would not know how to go  about  things  to
    find things out. The appellant claimed not have any family in Nigeria.

25.  In his submissions Mr Bates referred to the  fact  that  the  appellant
    had succeeded previously on appeal as he had minor children but now the
    children were adults  moving  towards  total  independence  from  their
    mother or father and in employment. It was submitted the children  also
    live in Liverpool with their mother yet the appellant chose  to  buy  a
    property in Manchester rather than in Liverpool near the children.

26.  The appellant had received a substantial prison sentence  of  10  years
    and the question is whether  very  compelling  circumstances  had  been
    established to outweigh the strong public interest in his removal  from
    the United Kingdom. It was also argued there is a very strong deterrent
    element in this case in relation  to  those  involved  in  drug-related
    offences.

27.  Mr Bates accepted the appellant had been assessed as posing a low  risk
    of reoffending but that the only reason why it  was  found  the  public
    interest had been outweigh previously  was  because  there  were  minor
    children and not that there  were  other  countervailing  factors  that
    warranted the earlier appeals being allowed.

28.  Mr Bates submitted the appellant has a house and  has  put  money  into
    the same, and that  although  the  appellant  claimed  this  would  not
    provide sufficient funds to enable him to establish himself he did  not
    demonstrate an ability to satisfy the required test and  the  appellant
    provided no evidence that the property could not be sold. The appellant
    has a capital asset that he can realise which could be used to  support
    him on his return.

29.  Mr Bates submitted the appellant was willing to work and that  although
    health issues have  been  identified,  there  was  no  treatment  being
    received and it was not shown that the appellant could not obtain  work
    in Nigeria, especially as he had obtained qualifications in the  United
    Kingdom. If employment  was  not  available  the  appellant  could  use
    capital to set himself up in self-employment.

30.  It was submitted the appellant's status in the  United  Kingdom  became
    precarious as the moment he offended he was aware that his  status  was
    in doubt and that even though previous appeals have  been  allowed  the
    appellant  had  only  been  granted  limited  periods   of   6   months
    discretionary leave  as  it  has  always  been  the  intention  of  the
    Secretary of State to remove him from the United Kingdom.

31.  The appellant's private life has been disrupted  as  a  result  of  his
    conduct since release from prison but his  situation  has  always  been
    precarious which has to be considered with other matters in  the  round
    including the fact there is no longer anything compelling  to  outweigh
    the public interest. Mr Bates argued that the public interest  had  not
    been wiped out by the passage of time even if it had been  reduced  and
    that the Secretary of State tried to enforce the deportation  order  on
    many previous occasions.

32.  It was submitted it had not been made  out  the  appellant  established
    family life in the United Kingdom or that he would  have  no  money  in
    Nigeria. The appellant could establish a private life with  the  church
    in Nigeria as there are Pentecostal churches in Nigeria  which  is  the
    church he chose to frequent in the United  Kingdom  with  others  of  a
    Nigerian background. It is not made out the appellant has lost ties  to
    Nigerian culture as a result.

33.  It was submitted the evidence indicates periodic  contact  between  the
    appellant and his children when he goes to see  them  in  Liverpool  or
    they see him in Manchester but that contact can be  maintained,  albeit
    non-physical contact, as the appellant will be able to speak  and  make
    other forms of indirect contact with his children as  he  does  at  the
    moment with his daughter in France. It was argued that any interference
    with any private life established will be proportionate.

34.  Miss Warren submitted on the appellant's behalf that  the  family  life
    enjoy by the  appellant  with  his  minor  children  was  found  to  be
    compelling despite the length of sentence, which was a factor that  had
    to be re-argued again. It is also relevant to consider the private life
    impact on the appellant and other family members in the United  Kingdom
    which will be affected by the decision.

35.  It was argued on the appellant's behalf that  public  interest  in  his
    deportation diminishes over time as this was not some abstract  concept
    and it was necessary to say when  that  would  amount  to  a  deterrent
    factor. The appellant  had  been  released  from  prison  in  2012  and
    remained in the UK and it was argued it  was  fanciful  to  claim  that
    there was a strong deterrent factor.

36.  Miss Warren argued on the appellant's behalf that he had been  involved
    in criminality since his release and that  the  impact  of  deportation
    upon both him and the children was not proportionate.

37.  Miss Warren questioned what  deporting  the  appellant  would  achieve.
    Whilst it was accepted it would achieve the  fact  that  the  appellant
    paid the price for what he had done, he had not  reoffended  and  there
    was no expectation the appellant would reoffend in the future.  It  was
    argued the public interest was not  a  fixed  concept  and  had  to  be
    examined in light of all the existing circumstances.

38.  Miss Warren argued the appellant has no ties to  Nigeria  and  that  to
    return him after he had been in the United  Kingdom  for  such  a  long
    period of time would make it culturally difficult for him to return and
    it had not been shown the appellant has finances sufficient to  support
    himself in Nigeria.

39.  In the United Kingdom, the  appellant  relies  upon  support  from  the
    church and has mentioned his children cannot assist  in  rehabilitating
    himself and the pressures on their finances. Whilst it is accepted  the
    appellant has property it is  of  low  value  and  it  was  argued  the
    appellant would have problems selling the same and that due to his  age
    the money from the house would not be enough him to live on.

40.  Miss Warren argued  the  children  in  the  United  Kingdom  could  not
    support the appellant in Nigeria as they do not earn much money and nor
    does the appellant's wife earn much money and so is  not  realistic  to
    make a finding of any financial support.

41.  Compensation paid as a  result  of  a  finding  of  unlawful  detention
    purchased the house but also supported the appellant and although  Miss
    Warren criticised repeated grants of 6 months leave  she  accepted  the
    lawfulness of such had not been challenged by way of judicial review. I
    find there is no finding that such grants of  discretionary  leave  had
    been shown to be arguably unlawful.

Discussion

42.  The fact the appellant has been granted a period of  6  months  limited
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom has not been shown to be arguably
    irrational or unlawful on the facts. The power exists for the Secretary
    of State to make such grants  especially  in  cases  where  it  is  her
    intention to remove the person from the United Kingdom but that country
    for other  circumstances  prohibit  such  action  being  taken  at  the
    relevant time.

43.  The appellant was sentenced to a period of  10  years  imprisonment  on
    account of his involvement in a conspiracy  to  import  Class  A  drugs
    (cocaine) into the UK indicating the serious nature  of  his  offending
    and substantial  prison  sentence  imposed  by  the  Crown  Court.  The
    Secretary of State served notice of her decision to make a  deportation
    order upon the appellant on 20 May 2005  against  which  the  appellant
    appealed although such  appeal  was  dismissed  on  11  July  2005.  An
    application for the decision to be reconsidered was successful although
    the reconsideration decision rejected the appellant's arguments and  on
    25 March 2007  a  deportation  order  was  made  and  served  upon  the
    appellant and removal direction set.

44.  The reason the appellant could not be removed is not as a result  of  a
    change in the approach of the Secretary of State but as a result of  an
    applications for judicial review and an application for the deportation
    order to be revoked before the appellant  had  been  removed  from  the
    United Kingdom, a refusal to revoke the order and an issue  of  whether
    the appellant had an in country right of appeal against  that  decision
    which it is said was contested all the way to the Supreme  Court  which
    ruled in the appellant's favour. As a result, the appellant remained in
    detention until released on  bail  on  6  April  2009  having  been  in
    detention for almost four years which, on  1  October  2009,  the  High
    Court declared had been an unlawful detention since 1  March  2007;  in
    relation to which the compensation referred to above was paid.  Further
    representations seeking revocation of the deportation order relying  on
    the appellants private and family life were made to the  respondent  in
    November 2009 and again in November 2010  but  refused.  The  appellant
    appealed and in an earlier determination promulgated on 23  March  2011
    his appeal was allowed. On 23 September 2011, the deportation order was
    revoked and on 26 September 2011 the appellant granted leave to  remain
    for 6 months. Further applications for leave to remain on 12 March 2012
    relying on article  8  was  refused  and  the  removal  direction  made
    pursuant to section 47 the Immigration,  Asylum  Nationality  Act  2006
    against which  the  appellant  successfully  appealed  resulting  in  a
    further grant of 6 months discretionary leave.  A  further  application
    for leave made in January 2014 resulted in the deportation order.

45.  The respondent  is  entitled  to  issue  a  further  deportation  order
    arising from the index offence provided the appellant  is  given  ample
    opportunity to make representations in relation to the same.  This  has
    occurred during the course of these proceedings.

46.  There is no successful challenge  to  the  lawfulness  of  the  current
    decision. In relation to the  purpose  of  the  deportation  order,  in
    Taylor [2015] EWCA Civ 845 it  was  held  that  although  the  tribunal
    recognised  the  need  to  attach  significant  weight  to  the  public
    interest, it  erred  in  failing  to  identify  clearly  the  different
    purposes served by a deportation: namely, to reflect  public  revulsion
    of serious crime, to protect the public from further offending  and  to
    deter others from acting in a similar way. There was no  discussion  of
    the public interest of a kind that  indicated  that  the  tribunal  was
    aware of the importance of the reasons underlying it.

47.  The finding of the earlier appeals has been  that  notwithstanding  the
    appellants deportation from the United  Kingdom  being  in  the  public
    interest removing the appellant from the United Kingdom would breach  a
    protected right, namely the family life he enjoyed with  his  children.
    The appeal heard on 7 March 2013 was not an appeal against  a  decision
    to deport but an appeal against a refusal to vary leave to  remain  and
    remove the appellant  which  the  Judge  on  that  occasion  found  was
    disproportionate, on the basis the appellants presence as a father  was
    important to his children's lives. The children at that time were still
    dependent minors.

48.  What has changed in relation to this matter is  the  need  to  consider
    the current situation.  Adopting  a  structured  approach,  it  is  not
    disputed that the appellant is a foreign criminal who was sentenced  to
    a considerable period of  imprisonment  as  a  result  of  his  earlier
    criminal conduct which means he is now the subject to an order for  his
    deportation  from  the  United  Kingdom  by  virtue  of  section   5(1)
    Immigration Act 1971 which was maintained when an application  opposing
    it on human rights grounds was made, and served upon the appellant.

49.  The offence committed by the appellant and his conviction predates  the
    introduction  of  automatic  deportation  provisions  contained  in  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

50.  Paragragh A362 of the Rules provides that

         "Where Article 8 is raised in the context of deportation under Part
         13 of these Rules, the claim under  Article  8  will  only  succeed
         where the requirements of these rules as at 28 July 2014  are  met,
         regardless of when  the  notice  of  intention  to  deport  or  the
         deportation order, as appropriate, was served".

51.  Paragraph 363 proved that

         "The circumstances in which  a  person  is  liable  to  deportation
         include:

             (i)   where  the  Secretary  of  State  deems   the   person's
             deportation to be conducive to the public good;

             (ii) where the person is the spouse or civil partner or  child
             under 18 of a person ordered to be deported; and

             (iii)    where a court recommends deportation in the case of a
             person over the age of 17 who has been convicted of an offence
             punishable with imprisonment.

52.  The decision is therefore a lawful decision pursuant to  paragraph  363
    (i).

53.  Other relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules include:

         Deportation and Article 8

         A398. These rules apply where:

             (a)  a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that  his
             deportation  would  be  contrary  to  the   United   Kingdom's
             obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

             (b)  a foreign criminal applies for a deportation  order  made
             against him to be revoked.

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and

             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because  they  have
             been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

             (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public interest because  they  have
             been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but
             at least 12 months; or

             (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
             the public good and in the public  interest  because,  in  the
             view of the Secretary of State,  their  offending  has  caused
             serious harm or they are a persistent  offender  who  shows  a
             particular disregard for the law, the Secretary  of  State  in
             assessing that claim will consider whether  paragraph  399  or
             399A applies and, if it  does  not,  the  public  interest  in
             deportation will only be  outweighed by  other  factors  where
             there are very compelling circumstances over and  above  those
             described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and

                  (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

                  (ii) the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the  date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case

                      (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  live
                      in the country to which the person is to be deported;
                      and

                      (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain
                      in the UK without the person who is to  be  deported;
                      or

             (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and

                  (i)  the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and

                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                  the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                  of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                  in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

                  (iii)    it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                  remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -

             (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for  most
             of his life; and

             (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
             integration into the country to which it  is  proposed  he  is
             deported.

         399B.  Where  an  Article  8  claim  from  a  foreign  criminal  is
         successful:

             (a)  in the case of a person who is in the  UK  unlawfully  or
             whose leave to  enter  or  remain  has  been  cancelled  by  a
             deportation order, limited leave may be  granted  for  periods
             not exceeding 30 months and subject to such conditions as  the
             Secretary of State considers appropriate;

             (b)  in the case of a person who has not been  served  with  a
             deportation order, any limited leave to enter or remain may be
             curtailed to a period not exceeding 30 months  and  conditions
             may be varied to such conditions as  the  Secretary  of  State
             considers appropriate;

             (c)  indefinite leave to enter or remain may be revoked  under
             section 76 of the 2002 Act  and  limited  leave  to  enter  or
             remain granted for a period not exceeding 30 months subject to
             such  conditions  as  the   Secretary   of   State   considers
             appropriate;

             (d)  revocation of a deportation order does not  confer  entry
             clearance or leave  to  enter  or  remain  or  re-instate  any
             previous leave.

         399C. Where a foreign criminal who has previously  been  granted  a
         period of limited leave under this Part applies for further limited
         leave  or  indefinite  leave  to  remain  his  deportation  remains
         conducive  to  the  public  good  and  in   the   public   interest
         notwithstanding the previous grant of leave.

54.  The appellant was sentenced  to  a  period  of  10  years  imprisonment
    making his deportation conducive to the public good. Paragraph 399  and
    399A are of no application per se as a result  of  the  length  of  the
    period of imprisonment. Accordingly, the public interest in deportation
    will  only  be  outweighed  by  other  factors  where  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A.

55.  The appellant bases his claim on the personal impact he  will  face  if
    deported from the United Kingdom.

56.  It is accepted the appellant has been in  the  United  Kingdom  and  is
    integrated based on length of time here and having brought  his  family
    up here. In relation  to  the  question  whether  there  will  be  very
    significant obstacles in relation to the appellant's reintegration into
    Nigeria, this is not arguably made out. Although passage of  time  away
    from an individual's home state is an important factor it  is  not  the
    determinative factor. It is  accepted  that  the  appellant  will  face
    obstacles to reintegration  but  that  is  not  the  required  test  as
    illustrated by the language "very significant obstacles".

57.  The appellant has no employment or support in the United Kingdom  other
    than through his church. This church is  attended  by  members  of  the
    Nigerian community and it is not made out that he has lost contact with
    all aspects of Nigerian culture.

58.  The appellant owns property in the United Kingdom which  is  free  from
    mortgage. The appellant claims not to be aware of  the  true  value  of
    this property or whether it will sell and makes  reference  to  another
    property although no evidence  was  provided  to  support  any  of  the
    contentions he has made. It is in particular  not  made  out  that  the
    appellant will not be able to sell the  property  within  a  reasonable
    period of  time  from  which  the  appellant  is  likely  to  obtain  a
    considerable  capital  sum.  The  Tribunal  has  judicial  notice  that
    properties in  the  appellant's  street,  both  two  and  three-bedroom
    terraces, are currently on the market for between  �55-�85,000.  Whilst
    some properties may be in better condition  than  the  appellants  this
    clearly shows there is a demand and casts doubt  upon  the  appellant's
    assertions in relation to his own house.

59.  The appellant has failed to establish that he will either be unable  to
    sell his property or realise  enough  to  enable  him  to  re-establish
    himself in Nigeria. Whilst it is accepted that the money realised  from
    the sale of the property will be unlikely to be enough to meet  all  of
    the appellants needs it is not made out  that  he  will  be  unable  to
    secure rented accommodation which can form a base and provide  for  his
    basic need of shelter.

60.  The appellant fails to provide  evidence  of  the  cost  of  living  in
    Nigeria or any evidence that he would be unable to  satisfy  his  basic
    needs/requirements.

61.  The assertion by the appellant was not  that  he  could  not  take  his
    funds and re-establish himself in Nigeria but a fear  that  if  he  was
    carrying all that money with him he would be robbed. This claim has  no
    arguable merit as it is not  suggested  he  will  have  to  carry  vast
    amounts of cash. Nigeria is a country with an active banking system  in
    relation to which many  in  the  United  Kingdom  send  remittances  to
    relatives in Nigeria electronically through that  banking  system.  The
    appellant, like any other Nigerian national,  will  be  able  to  lodge
    monies in a bank account and withdraw the same according to his needs.

62.  The appellant has received support from the Pentecostal church  in  the
    United Kingdom and it is clear that similar churches exist in  Nigeria.
    It is  not  made  out  the  appellant  will  not  be  able  to  join  a
    congregation in such a church and  re-establish  his  private  life  in
    relation to that aspect, in addition to having  the  benefit  of  those
    attending church services or members of the church itself who  he  will
    be able to turn to for advice in relation to how to deal with the  day-
    to-day reality of life in Nigeria  if  he  encounters  problems  he  is
    unable to deal with. When  the  appellant  was  asked  about  financial
    support from the church he tried to explain this away by claiming  that
    as the church in the United Kingdom is a registered charity they had to
    provide him with support whereas  the  church  in  Nigeria  was  not  a
    charity and therefore would have no such obligation. Even if the church
    in the United Kingdom is a registered charity  with  stated  charitable
    aims this does not mean they are mandated  to  help  the  appellant  or
    anybody who comes to them for assistance. Discretion is always retained
    by trustees of a charity and those administering  charitable  funds  in
    relation to how they are distributed in the absence of the terms of the
    charity mandating donations have to be made to anybody who asks for the
    same. This was not established by the appellant's evidence.

63.   Whilst  it  is  accepted  that  many  churches  are   dependent   upon
    contributions from the congregation  it  is  also  the  fact  that  the
    churches, as part of their Christian duties, help those  in  need.  The
    appellant fails to establish what is needed or  that  assistance  could
    not be obtained from the church in Nigeria, if required. It is not made
    out by that  the  Pentecostal  church  attended  by  the  appellant  in
    Manchester would not be able to liaise with a similar church in Nigeria
    to advise them of the appellants return and ensure he has  a  point  of
    contact in his home state.

64.  In relation to employment, the comments regarding assistance  from  the
    church or the church congregation also apply.  The  appellant  will  be
    able to liaise with those in his home state who have lived  in  Nigeria
    and continue to do so in relation to  advice  on  securing  appropriate
    employment. The appellant has qualifications and has declared a  desire
    to work in the United Kingdom which must be  equally  applicable  to  a
    desire to work if returned  to  Nigeria.  Whilst  it  is  accepted  the
    appellant is 57 years of age it was not  made  out,  on  the  basis  of
    country or other evidence, that this will prevent him  obtaining  work.
    Mr Bates raised the issue of self-employment using part of the  capital
    available to the appellant and it  has  not  been  made  out  that  the
    appellant would not be able to secure a future in the employment market
    one way or the other. Although the appellant's statement  that  he  has
    lost his understanding of the reality  of  life  in  Nigeria  may  have
    merit, this does not mean that he will be unable  to  re-establish  the
    same with local assistance from the church, if required.

65.  The children no longer provide the family life line of argument  relied
    upon by the appellant previously as they are now adults  in  employment
    themselves and the appellant's daughter is in France. It was  not  made
    out that no member of the family would unable to provide  some  support
    or assistance to the appellant, as apart from generalised statements to
    this effect no hard evidence was shown to establish this was so. It was
    not suggested that individual family members, or  cumulatively,  should
    provide substantial sums but it must be remembered  that  the  argument
    throughout the appeal processes that occurred before was based upon the
    very strong bond between the appellant and his children,  an  issue  to
    which the appellant refers in relation to this appeal. If such  a  bond
    exists it appears highly unlikely that the children will  be  unwilling
    to support their father if he was returned to Nigeria and  sought  such
    support, even if only to the very limited extent that they  were  able,
    the  value  of  any  financial  input  in   Nigeria   possibly   having
    considerably more in terms of purchasing power then  it  would  in  the
    United Kingdom.

66.  It has not been made out the appellant  would  be  unable  to  maintain
    contact with his  children  who  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
    appellant is used to such indirect contact with his daughter in  France
    and it has not been made out that he will not be to  unable  to  secure
    either telephone or Skype services to enable contact to  continue  with
    all his children. It has not been made out that even  if  the  children
    would be unable to afford the cost of a holiday to visit  their  father
    in Nigeria at this time, this will always be the position. The children
    are in employment and it is reasonable to assume that their  income  in
    such employment will increase or they will have  the  ability  to  save
    over time.

67.  Whilst it is accepted that re-establishing himself in Nigeria  will  be
    difficult it is not made out that any problems the appellant will  face
    cannot be overcome.

68.  Whilst it is accepted the appellant has  made  out  that  it  could  be
    argued there are compelling circumstances it is not made out that  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A exist in relation to this appeal.

69.  I find the appellant has failed to establish an entitlement  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Rules.  This  is,  however,
    not the end of  the  matter.  This  is  a  post  Immigration  Act  2014
    decision.  In NE-A (Nigeria) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ  239  it  was  held
    that there was no inconsistency between the analysis  in  Rhuppiah  and
    what was said in Hesham Ali. The focus in Hesham Ali was on  the  rules
    and it had not been necessary to consider the provisions of s117.  Part
    5A of the 2002 Act was primary legislation directed  to  tribunals  and
    governing their decision making. Sections 117A to D  were  intended  to
    provide for a structured approach to the application of Article 8 which
    produced in all cases a final result compatible with Article 8. Section
    117B(6) was more than a statement of policy to which regard was  to  be
    had as a relevant  consideration.  Parliament's  assessment  that  "the
    public interest requires deportation unless there are  very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and  2"
    was one to which the tribunal was bound by law to  give  effect.  There
    was no room for any additional element in the  proportionality  balance
    under Article 8. Observations in Akinyemi were not to the contrary.

70.  It is necessary to consider the merits of the appeal  by  reference  to
    article 8 ECHR as that  is  the  nature  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the
    Tribunal and the Rules have not been found to be a complete code by the
    Supreme Court.

71.  The protective right relied upon by the appellant is the  private  life
    formed in the  United  Kingdom  which  includes  that  with  his  adult
    children. The appellant does not live with those children  and  it  has
    not been established that the ties between them are any more than those
    that exist between a parent and their adult children. In particular  it
    has not been established that the required degree of dependency  exists
    sufficient to support a finding that family life recognised by  article
    8 has been made out.

72.  It is accepted, based on  the  evidence,  that  the  bond  between  the
    appellant and  the  children  forms  a  very  strong  aspect  of  their
    respective private lives. It is accepted the  decision  to  deport  the
    appellant from the United Kingdom would  interfere  with  that  private
    life, and other aspects of his private life the appellant has formed in
    the United Kingdom, sufficient to engage article 8.

73.  It is not disputed that the respondent's  decision  is  lawful  meaning
    the issue in the appeal is that of the proportionality of the decision.

74.  The  arguments  presented  on  the  appellant's  behalf  regarding  the
    purpose of deporting the appellant at  this  point  in  time,  recorded
    above, are noted but not determinative. In this appeal, there is a very
    strong deterrent element which is not arguably reduced by  the  passage
    of time since the commission of the index  offence  and  the  appellant
    sentence, such that it carries no considerable weight.

75.  It is accepted the appellant has not offended since he  was  imprisoned
    but his deportation from the United Kingdom is, according  to  relevant
    legal provisions, conducive to the public good.

76.   Against  the  appellants  side  it  is  necessary  to   consider   the
    respondents position. This is partially reflected  in  the  submissions
    that have been set out above but it is necessary to set out  in  detail
    the  comments   of   the   sentencing   judge   which   explains   why,
    notwithstanding there being no evidence of  previous  convictions,  the
    appellant received a period of 10 years  imprisonment.  The  sentencing
    remarks of His Honour Judge Webb sitting at the Canterbury Crown  Court
    on 2 March 2001 the following terms:

         "... All 3 of you have now been convicted of  conspiracy  to  evade
         the prohibition of the importation of cocaine.

         The evidence has shown that you were all  involved  importation  of
         cocaine  coming  into  this  country  from  Jamaica.  There  was  a
         sophisticated method employed in order to obtain the objective: the
         cocaine was concealed in  tins  of  Stamina  Juice  and  Supplegen,
         Caribbean drinks which are popular over here, also in shampoo;  the
         tins and containers were air freighted to Amsterdam, or to  Zurich,
         where you, Gilbert Anderson, arranged for their collection by hired
         van and their transport into this country. The  evidence  discloses
         the very many importations: there were at least... at  least...  35
         journeys of a similar nature; although I accept the point, made  by
         Mr Clegg, that a very limited number of those  may  have  been  dry
         runs. This conspiracy ran over a period of time,  set  out  in  the
         indictment and amounting to 2 years.

         The van which  carried  the  drugs  on  the  last  importation  was
         intercepted on 19th May, and it was found there were  117  tins  of
         Supplegen in that consignment, which were found to contain  viscous
         liquids, or scurry, which contained cocaine. The liquid and  powder
         contained the equivalent of 21.4 kg of cocaine at 100% purity.  The
         street level value  of  that  consignment  was  said  to  be  about
         �2,000,000.

         The evidence has shown that you, Gilbert Anderson, to have acquired
         many properties in London, you  purchased  expensive  motorcars,  a
         month before your arrest you purchased a Mercedes for  �83,500  and
         you are paying �800 per month in hire charges for rented cars.

         This cocaine would have been distributed on the streets of  London.
         It would have caused the sort  of  problems  the  courts  are  well
         familiar with; people would have become addicted, they would resort
         to dishonesty in order to feed their habits, and courts  are  aware
         of the fact that offences  of  violence  are  committed  under  the
         influence of drugs.

         The scale of the activity in which you, Gilbert Anderson, have been
         involved is enormous; the drugs offence which I'm dealing with here
         comes within the category of abnormal crime. There is no mitigation
         what so ever that can be put forward on your behalf;  you  were  an
         organiser, you had people working for  you,  you  enjoyed  handsome
         profits during the time this conspiracy was  carried  on.  You  now
         have to pay the penalty for your criminal activity I  can  give  no
         discount in respect of any plea, this matter  was  fully  contested
         throughout. The  sentence  I  pass  on  you  is  one  of  25  years
         imprisonment.

         Derek  Wright,  you  played  a  less  significant  role   in   this
         conspiracy.  You  were  working  for  Gilbert  Anderson,  you  were
         intimately involved, however, in the organisation. The evidence has
         shown that you took a part in making sure these consignments got to
         where they were meant to be going. You  had  a  close  relationship
         with Gilbert Anderson.

         I accept what is said on your behalf, that you were not a member of
         this conspiracy at the outset that you did join it  when  you  came
         here from Jamaica. You remained here beyond a period  of  time  you
         are allowed by  your  Visa  to  remain  and  you  engaged  in  this
         conspiracy.

         The sentence I pass on you is one of 15 years imprisonment. I  will
         consider, in a  moment,  whether  I  should  in  addition,  make  a
         recommendation for your deportation.

         Anselm Anirah, you have been convicted by the jury of participation
         in this conspiracy as well. You also took  part  in  a  subordinate
         role. The jury have found that you knew what you were doing on  all
         those occasions when you went to Schipol, when you involve yourself
         with the flat hired for the purposes of aiding the importation from
         Amsterdam, you drove the van over  from  Amsterdam  and  over  from
         Switzerland with these consignments.

         I accept that having got yourselves involved with Gilbert Anderson,
         you are subject to some pressure to remain  a  participant  in  the
         enterprise that you have got yourself involved in. I am  told  that
         there is no assistance that I can gather from the  authorities  the
         Court of Appeal has looked at previously, as to the way in which  I
         should deal with someone who has taken the course that you have, of
         cooperating with Customs from the outset when you were stopped,  of
         giving a great deal of information to the  Customs  officials,  and
         giving a great deal of information, not  only  in  the  cooperation
         conversations, but also in the very extensive interviews. Not  only
         that, but you volunteered your services, in the sense that you were
         wired up and  went  on  to  continue  the  journey  that  had  been
         interrupted at Dover, and thereby enabled  Customs  to  arrest  the
         other 2 who appear in the dock beside you.

         It seems to me that although you have contested  this  matter,  I'm
         entitled to take into account what you did in  the  assistance  you
         undoubtedly provided thereby. Your role was subordinate, as I  have
         said. You have not profited, other than to a limited  extent,  from
         the role you played, and I make a significant  distinction  between
         you and Anderson.  The least sentence I feel it able to  impose  on
         you is one of 10 years imprisonment.

77.  Notwithstanding giving the appellant the maximum benefit he could,  for
    the reasons stated in sentencing remarks, the appellant still  received
    a period of 10 years imprisonment.

78.  The position of Secretary of State has always been  that  drug  related
    offences pose a threat to the United Kingdom. It has not been shown  to
    be an irrational conclusion that drugs cause considerable harm. Even if
    it is the case that the appellant has  not  offended  since  the  index
    offence the Secretary of State has always made clear her  intention  to
    remove the appellant from the United Kingdom when able to do so.

79.  Having considered all aspects of this case very  carefully  and  having
    taken into account all relevant legal provisions and submissions  made,
    and taking into account the very strong deterrent  element  present  in
    this case, I find that the Secretary of State has discharged the burden
    of proof upon her to the required standard that to establish  that  the
    appellants deportation from the United Kingdom,  as  a  result  of  the
    commission of the index offence, is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
    aim.

80.  Ms Warren posed the question during her submissions  of  what  was  the
    purpose of deportation at this stage and what  would  it  achieve.  The
    answer is that it achieves the removal from the  United  Kingdom  of  a
    person whose deportation is in  the  public  interest  in  addition  to
    sending a very strong and clear message to anybody believing that there
    will be no consequence of being involved in drug related offending.

Decision

81.  The First-tier Tribunal had been found to have materially erred in  law
    and the decision of that tribunal set aside. I remake the  decision  as
    follows. This appeal is dismissed.

    Anonymity.

82.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
    45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.



    I make no such order pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen ('the Judge') who allowed Mr Anirah's
    appeal against the refusal of his application for leave  to  remain  on
    the basis of his human rights, made following the service of  an  order
    seeking Mr Anirah's deportation from the United Kingdom as a result  of
    earlier drug-related offences

Background

2.   Mr Anirah, a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  26  May  1960,  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 2 September 1988 and was granted leave to enter as  a
    visitor. Further periods of leave were granted as a student and on  the
    basis of marriage and, on 25 May 1994, a grant of indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

3.   Mr Anirah has fathered four children with his wife, Amber  who  at  the
    date of the First-tier hearing was 24,  Royston  who  at  the  date  of
    hearing was 21, Valerie who at the date  of  the  hearing  was  20  and
    William who at the date of the hearing was 18.

4.   On 19 May 2000, Mr Anirah was arrested and charged with  conspiracy  to
    import a Class A drug (cocaine) for which,  on  2  March  2001  at  the
    Canterbury Crown Court, he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.

5.   Mr Anirah was served with a notice of intention to make  a  deportation
    order on 20 May 2005. The appeal against the decision was dismissed  on
    11 July 2005, reconsideration of that decision granted, but the  appeal
    again dismissed. On 25 March 2007, a deportation  order  was  made  and
    served with removal set for 5 June 2007.

6.   In  November  2009  Mr  Anirah  filed  further  submissions  seeking  a
    revocation of the deportation order on the basis of  a  breach  of  his
    private and family life if removed. The refusal of the application  was
    appealed and on 23 March 2011 the appeal allowed. On 23 September 2011,
    the Secretary  of  State  revoked  the  deportation  order  and  on  26
    September 2011 granted Mr Anirah six months leave to remain in the UK.

7.   On 12 March 2012,  Mr  Anirah  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain
    relying on article  8.  The  application  was  refused  and  a  removal
    direction issued which, the Judge noted, was not a decision to  deport.
    The appeal against this decision was allowed on  22  March  2013  which
    resulted in a further grant of six months discretionary leave to remain
    until 25 January 2014.

8.   On 25 January 2014, Mr Anirah applied for further leave  to  remain  on
    article 8 grounds. On 9 February 2015, a new  decision  to  deport  was
    made based on the conviction in 2001. Mr Anirah was invited  to  submit
    any further representations he wished to make under Article 8 which  he
    did resulting in the refusal of a human rights claim which gave rise to
    the appeal before the Judge.

9.   The Judge considered the basis of  the  appeal  and  evidence  provided
    before setting out findings of fact from [49]  to  [64]  which  can  be
    summarised in the following terms:

    i.   Pursuant to paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules, and given  the
         length of the prison sentence, the public interest  in  deportation
         will only be outweighed by  other  factors  where  there  are  very
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those   described   in
         paragraphs 399 and 399A [49].

    ii.  In NA(Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662 the Court of Appeal  explained
         how this test should be approached and applied.  The  appellant  is
         what is called a "serious offender" [50].

    iii. Paragraph 399(a) is concerned with the parental relationship  with
         a child under the age of 18 but all the  appellant's  children  are
         over 18. Notwithstanding, the  appellant  places  reliance  on  his
         relationship with his children and them with him. Guidance is given
         by the Court of Appeal in Singh [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630  as  to  the
         correct approach to such relationships [51].

    iv.  Amber is living as an independent adult in Paris and no longer has
         a family life with either of  her  parents.  Royston,  Valerie  and
         William still live at home with their mother and have a  continuing
         family life with her and each other.  However,  none  of  them  has
         lived with the appellant since he was arrested in 2000 and they  do
         not have a family life with him. Notwithstanding the lack of family
         life, it is found the  relationships  that  do  exist  between  the
         appellant and his children form part of  their  private  lives  and
         that the relationships are significant and  important  to  each  of
         them. Direct contact between them would  be  exceedingly  difficult
         and rare if the appellant were in Nigeria. None of the children  or
         the appellant has, or is likely, to be able to obtain the necessary
         financial means to pay for visits [52].

    v.   Paragraph 399 (b)  is  concerned  with  the  relationship  with  a
         partner in the UK but the appellant has no partner and nothing else
         arises from this paragraph [53].

    vi.  Paragraph 399A applies where someone has been lawfully resident in
         the United Kingdom for "most of  his  life"  and  is  socially  and
         culturally integrated and there will be very significant  obstacles
         to his integration in the country to which it is proposed to should
         be deported. At the date of hearing the  appellant  was  56  having
         lived in the UK for 28 years and one month. The appellant  was  not
         lawfully in the UK during that period when he was  subject  to  the
         deportation order as the  making  of  that  order  invalidated  any
         previous leave to remain. The deportation order was made on 25th of
         March 2007 meaning the appellant was without leave to remain  until
         granted discretionary leave on 26 March 2012 [54].

    vii. The appellant can say he socially and culturally  integrated  into
         the UK as a result of length of time, together with involvement  in
         his church, and contact with his children [55].

    viii.    The appellant has no family or other social  ties  to  Nigeria
         and would arrive as a  56-year-old  man  with  no  social  support,
         accommodation, or employment.  The  applicable  test  sets  a  high
         threshold which the appellant circumstances would not  cross.  Even
         if he would not face very significant obstacles he would  certainly
         face very real difficulties [56].

    ix.  The appellant's crime merited 10  years'  imprisonment  and  gives
         rise to a very strong public interest in his  deportation.  Section
         117C (2) says the more serious the offence the greater  the  public
         interest in deportation. The offence was a long way beyond the four-
         year dividing line between serious and medium offences. The  public
         interest in deportation is not dependent on the risk of reoffending
         [57].

    x.   The issue  is  whether  the  public  interest  in  deportation  is
         outweighed by very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
         described in paragraph 399 and 399A [58].

    xi.  Such circumstances appear to be  (1)  the  offence  was  committed
         around 2000 and the appellant has committed no further offences  in
         the 7.5 years since he was released from custody in April 2009, the
         public interest in deportation can recede with the passage of  time
         [59], (2) had the appellant not been  kept  in  custody  unlawfully
         over two years his crime free period at  liberty  would  have  been
         correspondingly longer [60], (3) when the appellant applied for his
         first grant of six months discretionary leave  to  be  extended  in
         2012 the respondent did not make a fresh deportation  order  merely
         decided to refuse his leave and remove him. It was  reasonable  for
         him and his children to believe at that stage that  the  threat  of
         deportation was behind him, meaning  they  could  be  forgiven  for
         being shocked when his further application for leave to  remain  in
         January 2014 was met by the deportation decision made  in  February
         2015 [61], (4) the appellant's relationship with his  children  did
         not qualify under 399(a) but is nevertheless important and precious
         to him and him to them. Although the respondent  could  argue  with
         the passage of time and ages of the children the relationships  are
         less  important  than  when  previous  appeals  were  allowed   the
         appellant may argue that time has enabled relationships which  were
         more  tenuous  following   imprisonment   and   detention   to   be
         strengthened and consolidated [62], (5) aside from his relationship
         with his children the appellant is socially integrated into the  UK
         and would face real difficulty re-establishing himself  in  Nigeria
         [63].

    xii. The Judge concludes that for the reasons set out  at  [59  -  63],
         taken cumulatively, they amount to  compelling  circumstances  over
         and above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A  leading  to  a
         finding the appeal should be allowed [64].

10.  The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was  initially
    refused by another judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  thereafter
    renewed to the Upper Tribunal following which permission to appeal  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 5  May  2017.  The  operative
    part of the grant is in the following terms:

         "... there is arguable merit in the assertion in the  grounds  that
         the  judge  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for   why   the
         appellant's circumstances, as set out at [59] to  [63],  were  very
         compelling,  in  particular  where  he  was  unable  to  meet   the
         requirements of the immigration rules. The grounds are arguable and
         I therefore grant permission."

Error of law

11.  It is not disputed that the offence committed by the Mr Anirah is  very
    serious as evidenced by the substantial period of imprisonment and  the
    nature of the offending which related  to  drug  offences.  It  is  not
    disputed that attempts by the Secretary of State to  remove  Mr  Anirah
    have previously failed as a result of findings by the Tribunal that his
    removal from the United Kingdom at that time would  be  an  unwarranted
    interference with protected rights pursuant to Article 8 ECHR.

12.  It is also not disputed that Mr Anirah is a foreign  criminal  who  has
    remained liable to be deported from the United Kingdom and  that,  even
    if in March 2012 an  application  was  made  for  further  leave  on  a
    discretionary basis which was refused without  a  deportation  decision
    being made but thereafter allowed on appeal on article 8  grounds,  the
    Secretary of State was still lawfully entitled to  make  a  deportation
    order on 9 February 2015.

13.  The Judge identifies  within  the  decision  under  challenge  that  Mr
    Anirah is unable to succeed under the Immigration Rules. The Rules  now
    simply assert at paragraph 397 that a deport order will not be made  if
    it would  be  contrary  to  the  UK's  obligations  under  the  Refugee
    Convention or the ECHR or if  not  contrary  to  those  obligations  in
    exceptional circumstances. Paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A  then  set  out
    the requirements to consider when assessing the Article 8 position.

14.  The legal landscape has been recently clarified by  the  Supreme  Court
    in Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] UKSC 60 (which was concerned with the  law  pre-the  Immigration
    Act 2014) in which Lord Reed noted that in MF (Nigeria)  [2014]  1  WLR
    544 "... the Court of Appeal described the new rules set out in para 23
    above as "a complete code" for article 8 claims (para  44).  Lord  Reed
    noted that that expression reflected the view that the concluding words
    of rule 398 required the  application  of  a  proportionality  test  in
    accordance with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, taking into  account  all
    the article 8 criteria and all other factors  which  were  relevant  to
    proportionality (para 39). On that basis, the court commented that  the
    result should be the same whether the  proportionality  assessment  was
    carried out within or outside the new rules: it was a sterile  question
    whether it was required by the rules or by the general law (para  45)".
    Lord Reed then went on to  say  that  "The  idea  that  the  new  rules
    comprise a complete code appears to have been mistakenly interpreted in
    some later cases as meaning that the Rules, and the Rules alone, govern
    appellate decision-making. Dicta seemingly to that effect can be found,
    for example, in LC (China) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1310; [2015] Imm AR 227, para 17,  and  AJ  (Angola)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1636" albeit
    that Lord Reed reiterated the weight to be given to the public interest
    in deport cases. Lord Wilson, however, said  that  "Provided  that  the
    phrase (in the Rules) is not misunderstood, there is nothing wrong with
    an analysis in certain contexts that "exceptional  circumstances"  will
    be necessary for a claim under article 8 to prevail". Lord Wilson  said
    that  where  the  appellant's  family  life  with  another  person  was
    developed at a time when, to  his  knowledge,  his  immigration  status
    rendered his ability to remain living in the UK precarious, " his claim
    to respect for his family life is  inherently  weak.  It  is  therefore
    legitimate to describe it as likely  to  prevail  only  in  exceptional
    circumstances. The court in Strasbourg has said so. Thus  in  Rodrigues
    Da Silva, Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44  EHRR  34,  the  Strasbourg
    court said: "39. ... where this is the case it is likely only to be  in
    the most exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national
    family member will constitute a violation of article  8."  Lord  Wilson
    added: "In  the  MF  (Nigeria)  case,  however,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    proceeded to make an insignificant but unfortunate error.  It  held  at
    para 44 that the new rules were "a complete  code"  which  fell  to  be
    applied not only by the Secretary of State's case-workers but on appeal
    by the First-tier Tribunal.  It  is  one  thing  to  suggest  that  the
    Secretary of State's rule 398 is  relevant  to  the  weight  which  the
    tribunal should give to the public interest. By doing so, the  tribunal
    would do no more than, in the words of Lord Bingham in the Huang  case,
    para 16, to accord "appropriate weight to the judgment of a person with
    responsibility for a given subject matter and access to special sources
    of knowledge and advice". But it is another thing altogether to suggest
    that the rules provide the legal framework within  which  the  tribunal
    should determine the appeal. Lord Reed at paragraphs 47 to 50  endorsed
    the structured approach to  proportionality  and  said  "what  has  now
    become the established method of analysis can therefore continue to  be
    followed in this context ... The critical issue for the  tribunal  will
    generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of  the  public
    interest in the deportation of the offender in the case before it,  the
    article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general, only
    a claim which is very strong indeed - very compelling, as it was put in
    MF (Nigeria) - will succeed".

15.  In a more recent decision of in NE-A (Nigeria) v SSHD [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    239 it was held that there was no inconsistency between the analysis in
    Rhuppiah and what was said in Hesham Ali. The focus in Hesham  Ali  was
    on the rules and it had not been necessary to consider  the  provisions
    of s117. Part 5A of the 2002 Act was primary  legislation  directed  to
    tribunals and governing their decision making. Sections 117A to D  were
    intended to provide for a structured approach  to  the  application  of
    Article 8 which produced in all cases a final  result  compatible  with
    Article 8. Section 117B(6) was more than a statement of policy to which
    regard  was  to  be  had  as  a  relevant  consideration.  Parliament's
    assessment that "the public interest requires deportation unless  there
    are very compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2" was one to which the tribunal was bound by  law  to
    give effect. There was no  room  for  any  additional  element  in  the
    proportionality balance under Article 8. Observations in Akinyemi  were
    not to the contrary.

16.  The Judge considered  whether  Mr  Anirah  is  a  foreign  criminal  as
    defined by s117D (2) (a), (b) or (c); (b) and, correctly, found he was.
    The Judge then considered whether Mr Anirah fell within  paragraph  399
    or 399A of the Immigration Rules and found he did not. As a result, the
    Judge was required to  consider  whether  there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances over and beyond those falling within 399 and 399A  relied
    upon, and found there were.

17.  The basis on which this finding was made relates to  the  private  life
    enjoyed by Mr Anirah in the United Kingdom  primarily  between  himself
    and his children.

18.  It is submitted by Mr Bates on behalf the Secretary of State  that  the
    difficulty with the Judge's findings is that as it was found there  was
    no family life between the children, who are adults, and Mr Anirah, and
    no element of emotional dependency, the  Judge  does  not  set  out  in
    relation to the private life that  exists  why  the  same  reaches  the
    significant level required to outweigh the public interest.

19.  Mr Anirah has spent a considerable period of his  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom but for some of that he was imprisoned which would have  had  a
    detrimental impact upon any period of integration. In this case, it  is
    accepted Mr Anirah has not demonstrated that  he  has  been  integrated
    into  the  United  Kingdom  for  most  of  his  life.  In  relation  to
    integration into Nigeria, this imports a high  threshold  referring  to
    the existence of insurmountable obstacles. The Judge found there  would
    be obstacles to integration in Nigeria but does not make a finding that
    Mr Anirah would face very significant obstacles, even if he faced  real
    difficulties.

20.  In relation to the children, the Judge sets  out  at  [52]  the  living
    arrangements for the children, now adults, and finds "they  will  value
    the time they spend together, the contact they have by telephone or  by
    other electronic means and the advice and support  are  able  to  offer
    each other. There could be no doubt that direct  contact  between  them
    would be exceedingly difficult  and  rare  if  the  Appellant  were  in
    Nigeria. None of the children, nor the appellant has or is likely to be
    able to obtain the financial means to pay for  visits".  The  Judge  is
    attacked in the grounds for speculating upon  what  may  occur  in  the
    future as there is no evidence what resources Mr Anirah may be able  to
    obtain at some later  date  nor  of  the  financial  prospects  of  the
    children. The conclusion that the members of the family would not  earn
    sufficient resources to fund a visit to Nigeria is not  made  out.  The
    Judge has given inadequate reasons  for  concluding  why  the  children
    would not be able to visit their father if they wished to do so at some
    point in the future.

21.  The determination and the challenge fails to  adequately  set  out  the
    nature and frequency of any direct contact. The Judge noted  Amber  was
    living an independent adult life in Paris indicating any direct contact
    would be infrequent and it is not known how often Royston, Valerie  and
    William actually see their father or the nature and quality of any such
    contact.

22.  The Judge also fails to make findings upon whether  the  contact  which
    is likely to occur by indirect means,  such  as  telephone  contact  or
    through electronic means could continue if  Mr  Anirah  is  removed  to
    Nigeria and whether there is any impact upon the nature of the  private
    life enjoyed through such an avenue if Mr Anirah is not in  the  United
    Kingdom.

23.  The decision refers to Mr Anirah arriving in Nigeria as  a  56-year-old
    man with no social support or accommodation or employment but fails  to
    adequately  analyse  whether  the  same  could  be  achieved  within  a
    reasonable period of time. If the relationship between  Mr  Anirah  and
    his children is as close as the  Judge  finds,  there  was  a  need  to
    analyse whether there could be any financial support from  this  avenue
    or whether Mr Anirah has resources of his own  that  he  could  use  to
    support himself whilst he became properly established. The Judge refers
    to a period of unlawful detention by the Secretary of State  which  may
    have given rise to a claim for damages paid  to  Mr  Anirah,  of  which
    there is no reference in the decision. It is  also  the  case  that  an
    element of Mr Anirah's private life appears to be his involvement  with
    his local church, but the Judge fails to  analyse  the  nature  of  any
    assistance that could be provided through the church network in Nigeria
    to, again, help during any period in which Mr Anirah was required to re-
    establish himself.

24.  The wording of  the  Rules  is  very  specific,  more  than  he  issues
    identified in 399  and  399A  are  required,  which  imports  a  higher
    threshold into the assessment process.

25.  The Judge notes the existence  of  the  previous  appeals  but  is  was
    incumbent upon the Judge to consider within the body  of  the  decision
    what weight could be placed upon those earlier findings in light of the
    substantial changes that have occurred in relation to  the  Immigration
    Rules and statutory provisions to be found in section 117 of  the  2002
    Act, and to analyse whether those changes are material  to  the  weight
    the Judge was able to place upon the earlier  findings.  This  exercise
    has not been shown to have occurred.

26.  On behalf of Mr Anirah, Mr Markus asserted this was an attempt  by  the
    Secretary of State to relitigate the  appeal  but  such  claim  has  no
    arguable merit as at this stage the assertion is that an error  of  law
    material to the earlier decision has  been  made,  and  no  more.  Mere
    disagreement with findings made or desire for a different outcome  does
    not amount to arguable legal error as both advocates will be aware.  An
    arguable  genuine  legal  error  material  to  the  decision  must   be
    established. If so, the Secretary State is arguably entitled to reargue
    the merits of the appeal.

27.  It is accepted by  the  Secretary  a  State  that  Mr  Anirah  has  not
    offended since 2000 and Mr Markus referred to the decision of the Court
    of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662.

28.  It was accepted by the Court of Appeal in NA  (Pakistan)  that  serious
    offenders, defined as those sentenced to a period  in  excess  of  four
    years,  could  only  escape  deportation  on  Article  8  grounds   "in
    exceptional circumstances [16]".

         (ii) The position under the 2002 Act, as amended by the  2014  Act,
         and the 2014 rules

         22.  Section 117C(1) of the 2002 Act, as inserted by the 2014  Act,
             re-states that the deportation of foreign criminals is in  the
             public interest. The observations of Laws LJ in  SS  (Nigeria)
             concerning the significance of the 2007 Act, as a particularly
             strong statement of public policy, are equally  applicable  to
             the new provisions inserted into the 2002 Act by the 2014 Act.
             Both the courts and the tribunals are obliged to  respect  the
             high level of importance which the legislature attaches to the
             deportation of foreign criminals.

         23.  Section 117C(2) to (7) of the  2002  Act  deals  with  foreign
             criminals who resist deportation on  Article  8  grounds.  The
             general scheme is similar to that set out in the  2014  rules.
             Medium offenders can escape deportation if  they  come  within
             the safety net of Exception 1 (long residence  provisions)  or
             Exception 2  (parent/partner  provisions).  Serious  offenders
             cannot make use of those  safety  nets,  but  section  117C(6)
             provides that they can resist deportation if "there  are  very
             compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2".

         24.  A curious feature of section 117C(3) is that it does not  make
             any provision for medium offenders who fall outside Exceptions
             1 and 2. One would have expected that sub-section to say  that
             they too can escape deportation if "there are very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above Exceptions 1 and 2". It would be
             bizarre in the extreme if  the  statute  gave  this  right  to
             serious offenders, but not to medium  offenders.  Furthermore,
             the new rule 398 (which came into force on  the  same  day  as
             section 117C) proceeds on the basis that medium  offenders  do
             have this right.

         25.  Something has  obviously  gone  amiss  with  the  drafting  of
             section  117C(3).  In  Inco  Europe   Ltd   v   First   Choice
             Distribution [2000] 1 WLR 586, HL, at 592-593,  Lord  Nicholls
             (with whom  the  other  members  of  the  Appellate  Committee
             agreed) explained the circumstances in  which  the  courts  in
             interpreting statutes can correct obvious drafting errors.  In
             our view the lacuna in section 117C(3) is an obvious  drafting
             error. Parliament must have intended medium offenders to  have
             the same fall back protection as  serious  offenders.  Mr  Tam
             invited us so to rule.

         26.  In reaching this conclusion it is important to  bear  in  mind
             that the new Part 5A of the 2002 Act is framed in such  a  way
             as to provide  a  structured  basis  for  application  of  and
             compliance with Article 8, rather than to disapply it: see the
             title of Part 5A, the general scheme of the provisions in that
             Part and, in particular,  section  117A(1).  If  section  117C
             barred medium offenders from asserting  any  Article  8  claim
             other than provided for in subsections (4) and (5), that would
             plainly be incompatible with Article 8  rights  (either  their
             own or Convention rights of individuals in  their  family)  in
             some cases. Equally plainly, it was not Parliament's intention
             in enacting Part  5A  to  disapply  or  require  violation  of
             Article 8 in any case. We also place reliance on section  3(1)
             of the Human Rights Act 1998. That provision  requires  courts
             to construe legislation in a  way  which  is  compatible  with
             Convention rights, if it is possible to do so. It is  possible
             to do so here. In accordance with the guidance given  by  Lord
             Nicholls, the words which need to be read into section 117C(3)
             so as properly to reflect Parliament's true meaning are clear,
             namely the same words as appear  in  sub-section  (6)  and  in
             para. 398 of the 2014 rules, which came  into  effect  at  the
             same time as part  of  an  integrated  and  coherent  code  in
             primary legislation and the Immigration Rules for dealing with
             deportation cases.

         27.  For all these reasons we shall proceed on the basis that  fall
             back protection of the kind stated in section  117C(6)  avails
             both (a) serious offenders and (b) medium offenders  who  fall
             outside Exceptions 1  and  2.  On  a  proper  construction  of
             section 117C(3), it provides that for  medium  offenders  "the
             public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
             Exception 2  applies  or  unless  there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2."

         28.  The next question which arises concerns the meaning  of  "very
             compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2". The new para. 398 uses the same  language
             as  section   117C(6).   It   refers   to   "very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those  described  in  paragraphs
             399 and 399A." Paragraphs 399 and 399A of the 2014 rules refer
             to the same subject matter as Exceptions 1 and  2  in  section
             117C, but they do so in greater detail.

         29.  In our view, the reasoning  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  JZ
             (Zambia) applies to  those  provisions.  The  phrase  used  in
             section 117C(6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and  which  we
             have held is to be read into section  117C(3)  does  not  mean
             that a  foreign  criminal  facing  deportation  is  altogether
             disentitled from seeking to rely on matters falling within the
             scope of the circumstances described in  Exceptions  1  and  2
             when seeking  to  contend  that  "there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2". As we have indicated  above,  a  foreign  criminal  is
             entitled to rely upon such matters, but he would  need  to  be
             able to point to features of his case of a kind  mentioned  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399  or  399A  of  the  2014
             rules),  or  features  falling   outside   the   circumstances
             described in those Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made
             his claim based on Article 8 especially strong.

         30.  In  the  case  of  a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
             circumstances  in  his  own  case  which  could  be  said   to
             correspond to the circumstances described in Exceptions 1  and
             2, but where he could only just succeed in such  an  argument,
             it  would  not  be  possible  to  describe  his  situation  as
             involving very compelling circumstances, over and above  those
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2. One might describe that as  a
             bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 or 2.  On  the
             other hand, if he could point to  factors  identified  in  the
             descriptions of Exceptions 1 and 2 of an especially compelling
             kind in support of an Article 8 claim, going well beyond  what
             would be necessary to  make  out  a  bare  case  of  the  kind
             described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  they  could  in  principle
             constitute "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above
             those described in Exceptions  1  and  2",  whether  taken  by
             themselves or in conjunction with other  factors  relevant  to
             application of Article 8.

         31.  An interpretation of  the  relevant  phrase  to  exclude  this
             possibility would lead to  violation  of  Article  8  in  some
             cases, which plainly was not Parliament's intention. In  terms
             of relevance and weight for a proportionality  analysis  under
             Article  8,  the  factors  singled  out  for  description   in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 will apply with  greater  or  lesser  force
             depending on the specific facts of a particular case. To  take
             a simple example in relation to  the  requirement  in  section
             117C(4)(a) for Exception 1, the offender in  question  may  be
             someone aged 37 who came to the UK aged 18 and hence satisfies
             that requirement; but his claim under Article 8 is  likely  to
             be very much weaker than the claim of an offender now aged  80
             who came to the UK aged 6 months, who by dint of  those  facts
             satisfies that requirement. The circumstances  in  the  latter
             case might well be highly relevant  to  whether  it  would  be
             disproportionate and a breach  of  Article  8  to  deport  the
             offender, having regard to the guidance given by the ECtHR  in
             Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, and hence highly relevant  to
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2."

         32.  Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, if all  he  could
             advance in support of his Article 8 claim was  a  "near  miss"
             case in which he fell short of bringing himself within  either
             Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be  possible  to  say
             that  he  had  shown  that   there   were   "very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2". He would need to have a far stronger case than that by
             reference to the interests protected by  Article  8  to  bring
             himself within  that  fall  back  protection.  But  again,  in
             principle there may be cases in which such an offender can say
             that features of his case of a kind described in Exceptions  1
             and 2 have such great force for Article 8 purposes  that  they
             do constitute  such  very  compelling  circumstances,  whether
             taken by themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
             relevant to Article 8  but  not  falling  within  the  factors
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2. The decision maker, be it the
             Secretary of State or a tribunal, must look at all the matters
             relied upon collectively, in order to determine  whether  they
             are  sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh  the  high  public
             interest in deportation.

         33.   Although  there  is  no  'exceptionality'   requirement,   it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in  deportation  will  be  rare.  The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient.

         34.  The best interests of children certainly carry  great  weight,
             as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy  Prosecutor  of  the
             Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1  AC  338  at  [145].
             Nevertheless, it is a consequence  of  criminal  conduct  that
             offenders may be separated from their children for many years,
             contrary  to  the  best  interests  of  those  children.   The
             desirability  of  children  being  with  both  parents  is   a
             commonplace of family life. That is not usually a sufficiently
             compelling circumstance to outweigh the high  public  interest
             in deporting foreign criminals. As  Rafferty  LJ  observed  in
             Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  CT  (Vietnam)
             [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:

                  "Neither  the  British  nationality  of  the  respondent's
                  children nor their likely separation from their father for
                  a long time are exceptional circumstances  which  outweigh
                  the public interest in his deportation."

         35.  The Court of Appeal said in MF (Nigeria) that  paras.  398  to
             399A of the 2012 rules constituted a complete code.  The  same
             is true of the sections 117A-117D of the  2002  Act,  read  in
             conjunction with paras. 398 to 399A of  the  2014  rules.  The
             scheme of the Act and the rules together provide the following
             structure for deciding whether a foreign criminal  can  resist
             deportation on Article 8 grounds.

         36.  In relation to a medium offender, first see whether  he  falls
             within Exception 1 or  Exception  2.  If  he  does,  then  the
             Article 8 claim succeeds. If he does not, then the next  stage
             is to consider  whether  there  are  "sufficiently  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2". If there are, then the Article 8  claim  succeeds.  If
             there are not, then the Article 8 claim fails. As was the case
             under the 2012 rules (as explained in MF (Nigeria)), there  is
             no room for a general Article 8 evaluation  outside  the  2014
             rules, read with sections 117A-117D of the 2002 Act.

         37.  In relation to a serious offender, it will often  be  sensible
             first to see whether his case involves  circumstances  of  the
             kind described  in  Exceptions  1  and  2,  both  because  the
             circumstances so described set  out  particularly  significant
             factors bearing upon respect for private  life  (Exception  1)
             and respect for family life (Exception 2) and because that may
             provide a helpful basis on which an  assessment  can  be  made
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"  as  is  required
             under section 117C(6). It will then be necessary  to  look  to
             see whether any of the factors falling within Exceptions 1 and
             2 are of  such  force,  whether  by  themselves  or  taken  in
             conjunction with any other relevant factors not covered by the
             circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, as  to  satisfy
             the test in section 117C(6).

         38.  Against that background, one may ask what is the role  of  the
             Strasbourg jurisprudence? In particular,  how  does  one  take
             into  account  important  decisions  such   as   &UUML;ner   v
             Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 14 and Maslov v Austria? Mr Southey
             QC, who  represents  KJ  and  WM,  rightly  submits  that  the
             Strasbourg authorities have an important role to play. Mr  Tam
             rightly accepted that this is correct. The answer is that  the
             Secretary of State and the  tribunals  and  courts  will  have
             regard to the Strasbourg jurisprudence when applying the tests
             set out in our domestic legislation. For example,  a  tribunal
             may be considering whether it would be "unduly  harsh"  for  a
             child to remain in England without the deportee; or it may  be
             considering whether  certain  circumstances  are  sufficiently
             "compelling"  to  outweigh  the  high   public   interest   in
             deportation of foreign criminals. Anyone applying these  tests
             (as required by our own rules and legislation) should heed the
             guidance contained in the Strasbourg authorities. As  we  have
             stated above, the scheme of Part 5A of the 2002 Act and paras.
             398-399A of the 2014 rules is to ensure  compliance  with  the
             requirements of Article 8 through a structured approach, which
             is intended to ensure that  proper  weight  is  given  to  the
             public interest in deportation whilst also  having  regard  to
             other relevant factors as identified  in  the  Strasbourg  and
             domestic caselaw. The new regime is not  intended  to  produce
             violations of Article 8.

         39.  Even then it must be borne  in  mind  that  assessments  under
             Article 8 may not lead to  identical  results  in  every  ECHR
             contracting state. To the degree allowed under the  margin  of
             appreciation and bearing in mind that the ECHR is intended  to
             reflect a fair  balance  between  individual  rights  and  the
             interests of the general community,  an  individual  state  is
             entitled to assess the public interest which may be  in  issue
             when it comes to  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  and  to
             decide  what  weight  to  attach  to  it  in  the   particular
             circumstances  of  its  society.  Different  states  may  make
             different assessments of what weight should be attached to the
             public  interest  in  deportation  of  foreign  offenders.  In
             England and Wales, the weight to be  attached  to  the  public
             interest  in  deportation  of  foreign  offenders   has   been
             underlined by successive specific  legislative  interventions:
             first by enactment of the 2007 Act, then  by  promulgation  of
             the code in the 2012 rules and  now  by  the  introduction  of
             further primary legislation in the form of Part 5A of the 2002
             Act and the new code in the 2014 rules. Statute requires  that
             in carrying out Article 8 assessments in relation  to  foreign
             criminals  the  decision-maker   must   recognise   that   the
             deportation of foreign criminals is "conducive to  the  public
             good" (per section 32(4) of the 2007 Act) and "in  the  public
             interest" (per section 117C(1) of the 2014 Act).

         40.  Mr Tam submits that tribunal judges are sometimes losing sight
             of the  principles  discussed  above.  On  the  basis  of  the
             material which we have seen in the present group  of  appeals,
             that does appear to be the case. We now turn  to  examine  the
             detail of the four appeals before us.

29.  In relation to the period between the offence and  the  making  of  the
    deportation order, this is not a case in which the Secretary  of  State
    has delayed until the order leading to the  impugned  decision  as  the
    immigration history  clearly  shows  that  attempts  at  deporting  the
    appellant have not been successful as a result of appeals being allowed

30.  In Yousuf (Somalia) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2008] EWCA Civ 394 the Court of Appeal said that the  amount  of  time
    the Home Office allowed to pass before serving a deportation order  did
    not create any kind of legitimate expectation that the  claimant  would
    not be deported, but it did mean that the Home Office,  and,  in  turn,
    the Tribunal, had to consider a period in which, unlike most  deportees
    who had offended, the claimant had been able to show himself capable of
    living a law abiding life.

31.  It is therefore a factor, as the Judge noted, that  the  appellant  had
    not offended since 2000 although, for 10 years of that period he  would
    have been subject to imprisonment and a period of  release  on  licence
    when he had a very strong motive for not reoffending as it  would  have
    resulted in his being returned to prison to serve the remainder of  his
    sentence.

32.  In relation to the integration issue, Mr  Markus  refers  to  the  2013
    decision in which it is said it was found that Mr Anirah was integrated
    into life in the UK although the reason that  appeal  was  allowed  was
    solely on the  finding  that  Mr  Anirah's  removal  to  Nigeria  would
    constitute a disproportionate interference with his right to family and
    private life based upon his involvement with his minor children.

33.  It is accepted that in 2013 it was found Mr Anirah  had  no  family  or
    social ties to Nigeria but this, per se, is not the determinative test.

34.  Although Mr Markus made submissions  regarding  the  interpretation  of
    article 8 family life, there is no cross-appeal against the finding  of
    the Judge that family life  recognised  by  Article  8  did  not  exist
    between Mr Anirah and the adult children.

35.   I  find,  having  considered  the  evidence  and  the  decision  under
    challenge in considerable detail, that the Secretary State has made out
    that this challenge is more than a mere disagreement with  findings  of
    the Judge.

36.  I find it has been established that  several  legal  errors  have  been
    made as identified in the  ground  seeking  permission  to  appeal  and
    submissions made. It is arguable the Judge failed to adequately explain
    why the private life relied upon was  strong  enough  to  displace  the
    public interest in Mr Anirah's deportation in a case in which Mr Anirah
    could not meet the requirements of paragraph 399 let alone  the  higher
    level he was required to  demonstrate  as  a  result  of  his  ten-year
    sentence. When considering  whether  there  were  any  very  compelling
    circumstances in the case which would lead to the conclusion Mr  Anirah
    should not be deported,  is  arguable  the  Judge  erred  in  a  manner
    material to the decision to allow the appeal.

37.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall therefore be  set  aside.
    The finding of the Judge that  Mr  Anirah  is  unable  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of 399, 399A and had failed to make out the  existence  of
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraph 399 and 399A shall be preserved findings under the Rules. The
    finding Mr Anirah failed to establish  the  existence  of  family  life
    recognised by article 8 between him and his adult children  shall  also
    be a preserved finding as shall the finding that the relationship  with
    the children together with the other aspects identified  by  the  Judge
    form part of Mr Anirah's family life in the United Kingdom.

38.  The finding Mr Anirah has no family in Nigeria,  no  accommodation  and
    no employment  shall  be  a  preserved  finding  although  it  will  be
    necessary to consider the impact of his return and possibility  of  re-
    establishing himself if returned.

39.  It shall also be a preserved  finding  that  Mr  Anirah  has  not  been
    convicted of any further offending since the index offence.

40.  Reference to the previous appeals can be made  in  the  course  of  the
    Resumed hearing although the party  seeking  to  rely  upon  any  early
    decision will have to prepare a detailed analysis of the relevant legal
    provisions applicable at  that  time,  the  relationship  between  such
    provisions and the conclusions of  the  earlier  tribunal's,  how  such
    provisions   have   been   supplemented    or    amended    by    later
    decisions/revisions and  what  impact,  if  any,  that  may  have  upon
    conclusions previously reached.

41.  The following directions shall apply to the future management  of  this
    appeal:

    a.   List for a Resumed hearing  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Hanson
         sitting at Manchester on the first available date after 1 September
         2017, taking into account  the  availability  of  Mr  Markus,  time
         estimate three hours.

    b.   No interpreter is required

    c.   Mr Anirah shall, no later than 4 PM 25 August 2017, file with  the
         Upper Tribunal and send to the Secretary of State's  representative
         a consolidated, indexed and paginated bundle setting  out  all  the
         evidence upon which he intends to rely. Witness statements  in  the
         bundles shall  be  signed  by  the  maker,  dated,  and  contain  a
         declaration  of  truth.  Witness  statements  shall  stand  as  the
         evidence in chief of the maker who  shall  be  tendered  for  cross
         examination  and  re-examination  only.  Evidence  not   filed   in
         compliance with the above time limit shall not be admitted  without
         specific leave of the Upper Tribunal which  must  be  sought  on  a
         written application filed before the expiry of the permitted period
         explaining (a) who is responsible for the failure  to  comply  with
         directions, (b) why  there  has  been  a  failure  to  comply  with
         directions (c) the evidence it is not possible to file  within  the
         specified period and when such evidence will  be  available  to  be
         filed and served (d) the relevance of that evidence to  the  issues
         in the appeal (e) what efforts are being made to file the  evidence
         in time (f) whether the other party consents to the evidence  being
         admitted late (g) the impact upon either party of allowing  or  not
         allowing the evidence to be filed out of time, and (h)  the  impact
         of allowing the evidence upon the hearing date.

Decision

42.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set aside  the
    decision of the original Judge.  The  appeal  shall  be  listed  for  a
    resumed hearing in accordance with the directions  made  above  with  a
    view to the Upper Tribunal substituting a decision to either  allow  or
    dismiss the appeal.

   Anonymity.

43.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
    45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

        I do not make that order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
