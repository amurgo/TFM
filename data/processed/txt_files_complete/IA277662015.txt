Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms A Miah, instructed by Jalalabad Law Associates
For the respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Salma Begum, date of birth 31.12.77,  is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    James promulgated 7.7.16, dismissing her appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State to refuse her application for leave to remain in
    the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled in  the  UK.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 21.6.16.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Safer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    27.10.16, but gave no reasons for doing so.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.16 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was an error of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    decision of Judge James should be set aside and decision in the  appeal
    remade by allowing the appeal.

 6. Having made an application for entry clearance on 8.9.11 the  appellant
    first came to the UK on  22.12.12  with  limited  leave  as  a  spouse,
    pursuant to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules. On 4.2.15 she  made
    application for indefinite leave to remain as  a  spouse,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules.

 7. It is common ground that the appellant and her British citizen  sponsor
    and spouse were and are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.

 8. However, the application was refused because the Secretary of State was
    not satisfied that the appellant could meet  the  adequate  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules. The  application  was  additionally  refused
    under the alternative considerations of Appendix FM.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal had to deal with a raft of documents purporting
    to evidence the appellant and the sponsor's financial circumstances.

10. At [23] of the  decision,  Judge  James  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    payslips produced  were  genuine,  giving  reasons,  and  reaching  the
    conclusion at ï¿½24 "I am not persuaded that the  appellant  is  lawfully
    employed and earns the sums referred to in the documents before me  due
    to these concerns and apparent discrepancies. I therefore do not accept
    the claimed income of the appellant."

11. The grounds of appeal assert that  in  considering  the  documents  the
    judge made a series of errors of both interpretation and calculation of
    the income of the appellant and her  sponsor.  It  was  also  submitted
    before me that although the judge found as a  fact  that  the  payslips
    were not genuine, the judge failed to appreciate and apply the  correct
    standard of proof for allegations of dishonesty and  referred  only  to
    the balance of probabilities.

12. A further ground was that because the appellant applied before  9.7.12,
    she should benefit from the 'transitional provisions' and did not  need
    to meet the maintenance requirements. First, the attention  of  neither
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  nor  I  has  been  drawn  to  the  so-called
    transitional provisions. Mr Miah could not identify them.  But  in  any
    event, as is clear from the history set out above, the  appellant  came
    to the UK with leave under paragraph 281 and the application  which  is
    the subject matter of this appeal was considered under  paragraph  287,
    both of which apply  the  'adequate  maintenance  without  recourse  to
    public funds' test for income. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  pointed
    this out at [16] of the decision. In the  circumstances,  there  is  no
    merit in this ground of appeal.

13. However, there is merit in the principle grounds of appeal.  Mr  Walker
    conceded that the judge had misunderstood or  misread  the  documentary
    evidence  which  corroborates  the  claimed  income.  He   specifically
    conceded that the HMRC documents match the P60s and that  there  is  no
    discrepancy between the documents as the First-tier Tribunal  purported
    to find. It is not necessary to set out the detail and it  suffices  to
    state that the judge was in error of fact in  the  assessment  of  this
    evidence.

14. It follows that the income of the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  is  as
    claimed, or at the least above the income support benefit threshold for
    a couple and thus the appellant has demonstrated that  she  meets  that
    requirement of the Immigration Rules. In the circumstances, the  appeal
    should have been allowed.

15. It is not necessary to consider Appendix FM or article 8 ECHR.



Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The documentation was inadequately presented and the appellant  did
not assist herself or the Tribunal to understand the evidence.
