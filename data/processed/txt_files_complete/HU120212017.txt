                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Waheed Iqbal Chaudhary, born on 2 January 1981 is a male
    citizen of Pakistan.  On 25 April 2017,  the  appellant  made  a  human
    rights application to remain in the United Kingdom under Appendix FM of
    HC 395 (as amended) on the basis of his family  life  with  Mrs  Renita
    Chaudhary.  By a decision dated 2 October 2017, the Secretary of  State
    refused the appellant leave to remain.  The appellant appealed on human
    rights grounds to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Herwald) which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 29 January 2018,  dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The grant of permission by Judge Nightingale dated 22 May 2018  is  not
    entirely clear.   It was the subject of a further  direction  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Hanson which is dated 12 July 2018.   Judge  Hanson  has
    confirmed that the grant of permission concerns the judge's findings as
    to the language test purportedly undertaken by the appellant ("the  ETS
    element").  Consideration of whether the appellant  and  his  wife  can
    continue their family life in Pakistan shall not be revisited.

 3. The appellant challenges the contents of [20(b)] of the  decision.   In
    this lengthy sub-paragraph, the judge considered  whether  or  not  the
    respondent had discharged the burden of proving that the appellant  had
    used deception in obtaining his TOEI certificate from ETS.  In reaching
    that decision, the judge considered the witness  statement  of  Rebecca
    Collings.  He also had before him a witness statement of  Sarah  Marsh,
    the witness statement of Peter Millington  and  the  expert  report  of
    Professor French.  The judge refers specifically to  the  statement  of
    Sarah Marsh but does not  refer  in  the  decision  to  the  report  of
    Professor French.  The judge recorded that "In his evidence before  me,
    [the appellant] was asked  questions  about  why  he  had  chosen  that
    particular college (Elizabeth College) he denied any form of  cheating.
    He said he had not undertaken the two separate modules of the  test  on
    the same day and he had not used a proxy.  His wife could not have been
    able to confirm this as she had not been present and "did not know  him
    at the time, it seems."  The judge recorded that the "application  must
    fail, as noted above" but went on to consider what had been said in the
    refusal regarding the ETS issue insofar as it might affect the  overall
    human rights claim (under  Article  8  ECHR).   Having  summarised  the
    evidence of Peter Millington and Sarah Marsh, the  judge  concluded  as
    follows:

         In my view, the respondent has discharged the burden of proof.  The
         specific  data  in  relation  to  the  appellant,  concerning   his
         speaking, writing and correspondence tests  utilising  the  look-up
         tool persuade me that it is more likely than not that the appellant
         used a proxy at his test on 18 July 2012.

 4. Mr Swain, who appeared for the appellant, submitted that the judge  had
    not specifically considered the appellant's explanation regarding  what
    had happened at the test centre.  He submitted that, only if the  judge
    had given reasons for rejecting the appellant's "innocent explanation",
    would the judge be in a position to conclude that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the burden of proof.  Mr Tan, for the  Secretary  of  State,
    submitted that the judge had not erred as pleaded in the grounds or  at
    all.  The judge had before him two accounts of what may  have  occurred
    and he had, by application of the standard of proof of the  balance  of
    probabilities, preferred the  account  provided  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.

 5. I agree with Mr Tan.  The judge has recorded what the appellant said in
    evidence regarding the examination at Elizabeth  College  (see  above).
    Mr Swain complains that the judge did not refer to what  the  appellant
    had said in his witness statement.  The  appellant  said  this  in  the
    witness statement:

         16.      I chose this college as it was  a  suitable  venue  in  my
             location and was the closest college to attend in  undertaking
             the relevant course as  it  was  referred  to  me  by  Lincoln
             College.

         17.  I paid ï¿½270 for sitting the exam.

         18.  As it had been some time doing this exam (sic) I  recall  some
             questions that were asked in the exam which I answered.  I was
             asked about my daily routine,  place  of  study,  hobbies  and
             interests.

         19.  In the examination hall there  were  around  other  25  people
             doing the test.  (sic)

 6. I find that there was no need for the judge to examine that part of the
    appellant's statement in detail.  I am also satisfied  that  the  judge
    has read the statement before reaching  his  decision.   I  reject  the
    submission that it was vitally important for the judge to consider that
    explanation and to give reasons for rejecting it.  Mr Tan is right,  in
    my opinion, when he  submits  that  there  are  two  accounts  of  what
    happened at Elizabeth College and, at the end of the day, the judge was
    required to prefer one account over another.  In a case such  as  this,
    that is what the proper application of the standard  of  proof  of  the
    balance of probabilities involves.  By analogy, if a judge is hearing a
    case involving a traffic accident he or  she  may  have  two  differing
    accounts of what happened.  In such a case, the judge does not need  to
    give specific reasons for rejecting an account  before  giving  reasons
    for preferring one account over the other.  There is a burden of  proof
    and the judge has correctly reminded himself that in this  appeal  that
    burden falls on the respondent.  The  appellant  has  claimed  that  he
    undertook the exam and the  respondent  says  that  another  individual
    undertook it on the appellant's behalf.  The judge  has  preferred  the
    latter account to the former.  The evidence adduced by  the  respondent
    was capable of leading to that result so  the  judge's  finding  cannot
    arguably be described as perverse.  Certainly, the judge is required to
    give reasons for preferring one account to  another  but  he  has  done
    exactly that in his decision.  In the circumstances, I cannot find  any
    error of law in his analysis.
