For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Singh of One Immigration


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Mouelhi's  appeal
against the decision to deport him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
Regulation 19(3)(b) and Regulation 21 of the Immigration (European  Economic
Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as the  respondent  and  Mr  Mouelhi  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of France, born on 18 December  1996.  He  claims
to have entered the UK on 1 June 2009 with his mother and siblings,  at  the
age of 12 years, and to have remained here since that time.  He  first  came
to the attention of the UK authorities on  12  November  2014  when  he  was
arrested for robbery. On 7 September 2015 he was convicted  of  robbery  and
on 14 October 2015 he was sentenced  to  two  years  detention  in  a  young
offenders institution.

On 26 October 2015 the appellant was served with a notice  of  liability  to
deportation and was asked to give reasons why he  should  not  be  deported.
The appellant responded by way of written representations in December  2015.
On 10 October 2016 the respondent made a decision to  deport  the  appellant
on grounds of public policy in accordance with regulations 19(3)(b)  and  21
of the EEA Regulations and  issued  a  deportation  order.  A  supplementary
decision was made on 1 December  2016  on  the  basis  of  further  evidence
produced by the appellant as to his length of residence in the UK.


 In her first decision, the respondent considered  that  the  appellant  had
not acquired a permanent right of residence under the 2006  Regulations  and
therefore considered whether his deportation was  justified  on  grounds  of
public policy or public security.  The  respondent  referred  to  the  index
offence which involved the appellant and  two  co-defendants  robbing  their
victim of two mobile telephones, ï¿½100 cash and a bus pass,  at  the  college
which they attended. The appellant had told his Offender  Manager  that  the
robbery occurred during a fight  and  that  he  admitted  to  searching  the
victim's pockets but denied taking any items or assaulting the  victim.  The
respondent noted that the Offender  Manager  had  concluded,  in  the  OASys
assessment that the appellant posed a low risk of re-offending but a  medium
risk of harm to a known adult and  prisoners,  in  particular  known  adults
that he felt were disrespectful to him and  individuals  that  he  disliked.
The Offender Manager had also noted  in  the  OASys  assessment  that  on  9
November 2015 the appellant and  two  other  inmates  were  involved  in  an
assault on a detainee at the young offenders unit, which  included  the  use
of a flask as a weapon, and that the appellant had received an  adjudication
as a result. The respondent had regard to the  comments  of  the  sentencing
judge in regard to the index offence, where it was noted  that  the  assault
was a  joint  enterprise.  The  respondent  noted  that  the  appellant  had
provided no evidence of having  completed  any  victim  awareness  or  other
courses that could reduce the  risk  of  re-offending  in  the  future.  The
respondent therefore concluded that the appellant had a  propensity  to  re-
offend and that he represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious
threat to the  public  justifying  his  deportation  on  grounds  of  public
policy. It was concluded further that his deportation to  France  would  not
prejudice the prospects of  his  rehabilitation  and  that  his  deportation
would be proportionate and justified. The respondent  went  on  to  consider
Article 8, noting that the appellant did not have partner  or  children  for
the purposes of paragraph 399(a)  and  (b)  of  the  immigration  rules  and
considering that he could not meet the requirements of paragraph 399A as  he
had not been lawfully resident in the UK for half his life, that he was  not
socially and culturally integrated in the UK and that  there  were  no  very
significant obstacles to his integration into France. It was not  considered
that there were any  very  compelling  circumstances  for  the  purposes  of
paragraph 398. The respondent accordingly  concluded  that  the  appellant's
deportation would not breach his human rights.

In her supplementary decision of 1 December  2016  the  respondent  accepted
that the appellant had been resident in the UK in accordance with  the  2006
regulations for a continuous period of five years and that he  had  acquired
a permanent right of residence in the UK. However  the  decision  to  deport
him was maintained on the basis that it was considered that his  deportation
was justified on serious grounds of public policy owing to  the  seriousness
of the offence.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was heard on  21
March 2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi.  Judge  Obhi  heard  from  the
appellant and his mother and sister.  She  found  that  the  appellant  came
within Regulation 21(3) and  that  there  were  serious  grounds  of  public
policy in his case. She then went on to consider Regulation  21(5)  and  (6)
and the prospect of rehabilitation, in line with  the  guidance  in  Essa  v
Secretary     of     State     for     the     Home     Department     (EEA:
rehabilitation/integration) Netherlands [2013] UKUT 316, and concluded  that
it was not proportionate to deport the appellant.  She  accordingly  allowed
the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on
the  grounds  of  failure  to  take  account  of  the  seriousness  of   the
appellant's offence and inadequate reasoning as to why his  deportation  was
not justified.

Permission to appeal was initially refused, but was subsequently granted  in
the Upper Tribunal on 25 May 2017.

Appeal hearing and submissions

At the hearing before me, Mr  Mills  clarified  the  grounds  of  challenge,
submitting that the  judge  had  erred  by  taking  integration  and  better
prospects  of  rehabilitation  in  the  UK   as   being   determinative   of
proportionality, contrary  to  the  guidance  in  case  law.  He  relied  in
particular upon the decisions in Bossade  (ss.117A-D-interrelationship  with
Rules) [2015] UKUT 415, MC (Essa principles  recast)  Portugal  [2015]  UKUT
520 and Essa. Mr Mills submitted that the judge's  findings  were  that  the
appellant was not well-advanced in  rehabilitation  and  that  he  was  only
partially integrated into the UK, and therefore those matters could  not  be
determinative of the proportionality assessment.

Mr Singh  submitted  that  the  judge  had  undertaken  a  full  and  proper
proportionality  balancing  exercise  and  that   her   decision   was   not
inconsistent with the guidance in the cases relied on by Mr Mills.

Consideration and findings

Mr Mills accepted that, in so far as the respondent's grounds  of  challenge
appeared  to  suggest  that  the  judge  went  straight  on  to  considering
proportionality without first considering  the  seriousness  of  the  threat
posed by the appellant, the grounds were  misconceived.  Clearly  the  judge
did not proceed straight to a  consideration  of  proportionality,  but  she
commenced by considering the nature and seriousness of the threat  posed  by
the appellant and concluded, at [37], that he posed a serious risk  of  harm
and that he fell within Regulation 21(3). It was only after  having  reached
that  conclusion  that  she  then  went  on  to  consider   proportionality.
Accordingly there was no error of law in her approach in  that  respect,  as
Mr Mills conceded.

The challenge pursued by Mr Mills was in regard to the judge's  findings  on
proportionality. His submission was that the judge accorded too much  weight
to the appellant's rehabilitation and integration,  when  her  findings  had
otherwise been to the effect that he was only partially integrated and  that
he was not well-advanced in rehabilitation. However I cannot agree  with  Mr
Mills. Rather than treating the appellant's integration  and  rehabilitation
as determinative of the proportionality assessment, as  Mr  Mills  submitted
that she did, it seems to me that the judge did  no  more  than  take  these
matters into account as part of her overall proportionality  assessment,  as
she  was  required  to  do.  The  judge  accorded  limited  weight  to   the
appellant's integration, as she considered that there was  only  an  element
of social and cultural integration due to his  offending.  When  considering
rehabilitation the judge had regard to the guidance in Essa  and,  far  from
according too much weight to the prospects of rehabilitation,  her  findings
were if anything neutral, taking account of the lack of rehabilitative  work
undertaken by the appellant in the UK but also giving consideration  to  his
family ties and responsibilities in the UK and his lack of ties  in  France.
The judge's findings, and the weight that  she  attached  to  such  matters,
appears to me to have been entirely appropriate in the circumstances and  on
the evidence available.

At [39] and [40] the  judge  plainly  considered  all  factors  relevant  to
proportionality, having already given full and careful consideration to  the
level  of  risk  the  appellant  posed.  She  considered  the   nature   and
seriousness  of  the  offence  and  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks,   the
appellant's age at the time of offending, his level of  involvement  in  the
offending, his lack of offending history and his family and  other  ties  to
the  UK  and  France,  as  well  as  the  questions   of   integration   and
rehabilitation. It seems to me that she was entitled to  accord  the  weight
that she did to the relevant factors and  that  there  was  nothing  in  her
approach to these  factors  that  was  inconsistent  with  the  guidance  in
Bossade, MC and Essa.

Accordingly it seems to me that there was nothing erroneous in  the  judge's
approach, that she gave  full  and  proper  consideration  to  all  relevant
matters and provided full and cogent reasons for making  the  findings  that
she did. It was entirely open to her on the evidence before her to  conclude
that the appellant's deportation would not be proportionate. The judge  made
no errors of law requiring the decision to be set aside.

DECISION

The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly dismissed. The making of  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a  point  of
law, such that the decision has to be set aside. I  do  not  set  aside  the
decision. The decision to allow Mr Mouelhi's  deportation  appeal  therefore
stands.
