                                   RULING

       This was an appeal, by the , against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Michael Goldmeier and a lay member), sitting at  Taylor
    House on 22 July, to  a deportation appeal  by  a  citizen  of  Uganda.
    There is no need for us to go into the grounds, for reasons which  will
    become clear.

 2. This appellant, following a sentence of two years' imprisonment in 2006
    for possession of class 'A' drugs with intent to supply, had once again
    been convicted of a similar offence on 31 July 2008, and  sentenced  to
    imprisonment for four years. This should have attracted the  provisions
    of the UK Borders Act 2007 s.  32,  which  replaced  the  discretionary
    procedure, requiring service  of  a  notice  of  intention  to  deport,
    against which an appeal lay, by the automatic  deportation  order  laid
    down in that section. For detailed reasons given by Nicol J  in  Rashid
    Hussein  [2009] EWHC (Admin) 2492, and approved by the Court of  Appeal
    in AT & JK (Pakistan)  [2010] EWCA Civ 567, the  automatic  deportation
    provisions do apply to those convicted, as  this  appellant  had  been,
    between 1 November 2007 and 31 July 2008. What is more, s. 32 of the UK
    Borders Act 2007 is in mandatory terms: see s. 32 (5)

       The Secretary of State must make a deportation order in respect of a
       foreign criminal ...

 3. What actually happened is  that  the  Home  Office  went  in  a  rather
    leisurely way through the old discretionary procedure, resulting in the
    signing of a deportation order on 23 August 2012. However the appellant
    pointed out that he had never  received  the  notice  of  intention  to
    deport; and so the order was revoked, and a fresh notice  of  intention
    to deport served on 26 February 2013, against which the present  appeal
    was brought.

 4. However, as Mr Wilding pointed out, the fresh  deportation  notice  was
    not in accordance with the mandatory procedure laid down by s. 32,  and
    should never have been treated as an appealable decision in  the  first
    place. Mr Costello acknowledged that Mr Wilding had done what he  could
    to alert him to this point before the hearing began; but understandably
    he had been somewhat taken aback by it, and asked for us to adjourn  to
    another day. We were not prepared to do that, since  it  seemed  to  us
    that the  combined  effect  of  the  statute  itself,  taken  with  the
    authorities cited, was quite clear. Though we offered to put this  case
    back to the end of our list to allow Mr Costello to satisfy himself  of
    this too, he did not see any useful purpose in that;  nor  had  he  any
    further submissions to make to us.

 5. The result is that the decision of 26 February 2013  was  not  a  valid
    immigration decision against which any appeal could lie to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal or us.

No valid appeal
