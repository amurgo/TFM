                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 6 August  1980  and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Nigeria. He entered the United Kingdom as a student in September  2007.
    On 24 June  2019,  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  City  of  London
    Magistrates Court of stealing and using a credit card and sentenced  to
    a total of 24  weeks  imprisonment.  The  Secretary  of  State  made  a
    deportation order against the appellant.  On  16  September  2019,  the
    Secretary of State refuse  the  appellant's  human  rights  claim.  The
    appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which, in a decision promulgated on  25  October  2019,  dismissed  the
    appeal. The appellant  now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. Section 117C of the 2002 Act (as amended) provides as follows:

         Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign
         criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
             period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
             into account where  a  court  or  tribunal  is  considering  a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that
             the reason for the decision was the offence  or  offences  for
             which the criminal has been convicted.

    Section 117D provides:

         ...

         (2)  In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-

             (a)  who is not a British citizen,

             (b)  who has been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
                  offence, and

             (c)  who-

                  (i)  has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                      least 12 months,

                  (ii) has been convicted of  an  offence  that  has  caused
                      serious harm, or

                  (iii)    is a persistent offender.

    Paragraphs 399 and 399A of HC 395 (as amended) provide:

         Deportation and Article 8

         A398. These rules apply where:

         (a)  a foreign criminal  liable  to  deportation  claims  that  his
         deportation would be contrary to the United  Kingdom's  obligations
         under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

         (b)  a foreign  criminal  applies  for  a  deportation  order  made
         against him to be revoked.

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and

         (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or

         (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law, the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

             (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least
             the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration
             decision; and in either case

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and

             (i)  the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the  person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

             (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in  the
             country to which the person is  to  be  deported,  because  of
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner  to  remain
             in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
         his life; and

         (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

 3. Contrary to the view adopted by the Secretary of State in the  decision
    letter, the judge found that  the  appellant's  partner  is  a  British
    citizen [33]. Consequently, the judge noted that the appellant was  not
    required to show the existence of very  compelling  circumstances  over
    and above those contained in paragraph 399 and 399A. However, the judge
    observed that the appellant does 'need to show  that  the  decision  is
    unduly harsh and that there are exceptional circumstances  and  weighty
    compassionate reasons. He is said not to be integrated because  he  had
    provided no evidence of exceptional contribution to community or  wider
    society. That is not what integration requires. He is integrated.' [33]

 4. At [36], the judge noted that the appellant had committed  one  offence
    of finding and using a contactless credit card ï¿½135 of  purchases.  The
    judge noted that the appellant said that he had 'found the credit  card
    when working as a cleaner and then used it [the judge fails  to  record
    that the appellant stole the card]. The sentence seems  very  harsh  if
    so. However, taking the appellant's case at its highest  and  assessing
    deportation as a consequence (sic), I  do  not  consider  these  to  be
    crimes which make it conducive  to  the  public  good  for  him  to  be
    deported...the difficulty is of that as a the stand-alone human  rights
    claim it is very hard for the appellant to succeed.'

 5. The grounds of appeal brief. The appellant asserts  that  he  does  not
    meet the definition of foreign criminal in the  light  of  the  judge's
    findings. Further, applying the leading decision in Razgar [2004]  UKHL
    27 , the appellant contends that there was no need  for  the  judge  to
    consider proportionality as a decision to deport him  was,  because  he
    did not fall within the definition of a foreign criminal,  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

 6. The appellant acknowledges that he does not  have  a  right  of  appeal
    against the decision to deport him. As the  judge  observed,  the  only
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was that in respect of Article  8
    ECHR.

 7. The Tribunal is not bound to accept the Secretary of  State's  view  of
    what offences may cause serious harm  any  more  than  it  must  attach
    weight to the Secretary of State's assessment of persistent  offending.
    In SC (Zimbabwe) [2018] EWCA Civ 929, the Court  of  Appeal  considered
    persistent offending in the context of section 117 of and held:

         "I would, therefore, reject Mr Pilgerstorfer's submission that  the
         status of "persistent offender" once acquired can never be lost and
         I would also reject his submission  that  s.117D(2)(c)  requires  a
         court  or  tribunal,  in  applying  that  provision,  to  attribute
         "significant weight" to the Secretary of State's anterior view that
         paragraph 398(c) of the Rules had been satisfied for  the  purposes
         of her own decision to  make  a  deportation  order  in  the  first
         place."

    It is possible, therefore, for a Tribunal to find, contrary to the view
    of the Secretary of State,  that  an  appellant  is  not  a  persistent
    offender and, by analogous reasoning, that  offending  has  not  caused
    serious harm, However, in the present appeal, it is not entirely  clear
    what the judge is seeking to say at [36].  He  speaks  of  'taking  the
    appellant's  case  at  its  highest  and  assessing  deportation  as  a
    consequence ' but does not state unequivocally that he has  'taken  the
    case at its highest' or, if he has, why he should do so whilst I am not
    sure what is meant by the  second  part  of  his  sentence  ('assessing
    deportation as a consequence') What is clear is that the judge has  not
    made an unequivocal finding that the offending of the appellant has not
    caused significant harm. Indeed, in his conclusions at [33] et seq,  he
    has not used the words of the statute ('significant harm') at all. What
    the judge is very clear about is that he is  required  to  determine  a
    human rights appeal. That was the correct approach. I find  that  there
    is no finding in the decision to support the appellant's  assertion  in
    the grounds of appeal that the appellant does not meet  the  definition
    of a foreign  criminal.  I  acknowledge  that  the  judge  has  serious
    misgivings about the public interest  concerned  with  the  appellant's
    deportation in the light of the relatively minor nature of his crime. I
    also accept that the judge disagrees with the Secretary of  State  that
    the appellant's partner is not of British citizen. Otherwise, it  seems
    to me that the judge has had regard to all  relevant  circumstances  in
    determining the Article 8 appeal. He notes that the appellant  and  his
    partner are not legally married and have  not  been  together  for  two
    years. He finds that the appellant  would  not  face  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into  Nigerian  society  [39];  these  are
    findings which the appellant does not dispute. He finds  at  [41]  that
    the  appellant  is  'outwith  all  of  the  negative  public   interest
    considerations of paragraph 398 as his sentence was short' but he  does
    not in terms go on to make a finding that the appellant's behaviour has
    not caused serious harm. Indeed, my reading of that  paragraph  in  the
    context of the whole decision is that the judge  is  referring  to  the
    provisions for those foreign criminals who have been sentenced to  more
    than 12 months' imprisonment.

 8. At [43], the appellant finds that  'the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
    conviction is not great has was a first offence, and a small amount and
    did not involve violence the dishonest use of a credit  card  he  found
    rather than stole. There is no possibility  of  his  partner  going  to
    Nigeria so deportation will end the  relationship.'  The  reasoning  is
    inaccurate (the appellant did  steal  the  credit  card)  confused  and
    nonsequential. I assume that the judge here is applying section 117C(2)
    ('The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,  the
    greater is the public interest in deportation of  the  criminal.').  At
    [44], judge observes that the appellant only met his  partner  in  2018
    and that they have no children. He observes that 'the  appellant  never
    had a legitimate expectation of being  able  to  stay  [in  the  United
    Kingdom], as he came as a student.' He notes the appellant's  partner's
    difficulties with OCD, panic attacks  and  low  self-esteem.  She  also
    suffers from epilepsy. However, the judge observes that  there  is  'no
    evidence of severe impact on her of  that  separation  [caused  by  the
    appellant's  imprisonment].  He  concludes  by  saying   [47/48]   'the
    relationship was  recently  formed  in  the  full  knowledge  that  the
    appellant has no right to be in the UK... apart from  the  relationship
    there is no other reason  of  any  weight  to  allow  the  appeal.  The
    relationship alone would not suffice.  The  needs  of  the  appellant's
    partner are not such as to make this a compelling  Article  8  claim...
    with the additional factor of the conviction and sentence the Article 8
    assessment has to be in favour of the Secretary of State.'

 9. Whilst the judge's analysis is rather jumbled I consider  that  he  has
    addressed  all  the  relevant  evidence  in  reaching  his  conclusion.
    Although he has  found  that  the  appellant's  partner  is  a  British
    citizen, contrary to the view adopted by the Secretary of State, he has
    given cogent reasons for concluding  that  that  relationship  and  the
    effect of  deportation upon the  relationship  does  not  outweigh  the
    public interest concerned with the  appellant's  deportation.  Although
    occasionally lacking in structure, I can identify no error  of  law  in
    the decision which would justify setting it  aside.  Consequently,  the
    appeal is dismissed
