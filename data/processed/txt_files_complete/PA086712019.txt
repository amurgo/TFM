                                 DIRECTIONS

      1.  Having  considered  the  representations  made  by  the  appellant
         following the setting aside  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal in his appeal, and having had regard to the fact  that  no
         findings were preserved, I make the following directions.

      2. The appeal shall be remitted for a fresh hearing to the  First-tier
         Tribunal. Directions shall  be  issued  by  that  Tribunal  in  due
         course.

      3. These directions supersede those contained in my determination of 8
         July 2020 (promulgated on 14 July 2020).




         Signed
