                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Rizwana Batool, born on 19 November 1979 and is a female
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant is the mother of B who was born  in
    December 2006 and who is now (as from December 2015) a British citizen.
     The appellant had applied in September 2014 for leave to remain as the
    spouse of Mr Gulljit a Pakistani citizen who now has  indefinite  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  In a decision dated 2 March 2015, the
    appellant's application was refused.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Saffer) which, in a decision promulgated  on
    24 August 2015 dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Judge Saffer set out details of the appellant's claim at [6-15]:

         6. The Respondent's  immigration  history  notes  that  Mrs  Batool
         arrived here on 29/09/05 on a spouse visa.  That  was  extended  on
         numerous occasions and in various forms until 21/09/14.  Basil  was
         born here on 23/12/06 and was granted  leave  to  stay  on  various
         dates as a dependent child.

         7. Mrs Batool said in the application (19/09/14)  that  the  family
         live in rented accommodation. Mr Gul works earning �1,000 per month
         after income tax and other deductions. They do not  receive  public
         funds. They have no  property  or  business  interest  outside  the
         United Kingdom. They have lived here for 7 years  continuously.  It
         is not reasonable to expect them to leave  and  reapply  for  entry
         clearance. Mr Gul applied  on  30/08/14  for  indefinite  leave  to
         remain on the basis of his continuous legal 10 year long  residency
         and is going to be a settled person.  They  began  living  together
         when they married on 10/09/04. They have no family in  Pakistan  as
         their parents have all died. She and Basil have  been  to  Pakistan
         (as evidenced  by  their  passports)  from  11/05/07  to  12/11/07,
         28/09/08 to 27/12/08, 15/03/11 to 15/06/11, 27/09/11  to  04/12/11,
         and 01/02/13 to 27/02/13). He is at school and it would not  be  in
         his best interest to refuse  the  application.  He  is  emotionally
         dependent on her and she helps  with  his  studies,  entertainment,
         home work, and health issues. She was in France  and  Holland  from
         08/09/06 to 12/09/06. She speaks  English  and  Urdu.  She  has  no
         special family or friends in Pakistan. She  only  has  some  remote
         friends living there. She cannot live without Mr Gul or her son.

         8. Her representative wrote  (19/09/14)  that  the  application  is
         based on the 10 year route of family life as a partner and  parent,
         private life, and due to the  most  exceptional  and  compassionate
         circumstances, Basil living here  continuously  for  7  years,  and
         article 8 ECHR. It is in Basil's best interest to remain here  with
         Mrs Batool and it would be  disproportionate  to  require  them  to
         leave and separate the family given the strength of their ties here
         and lack of ties in Pakistan.

         9. In the grounds of appeal it is said that  Mr  Gul's  application
         for indefinite leave to remain has not been considered. Their child
         (Abyan) is eligible for British nationality.

         10. In her statement (17/08/15) Mrs Batool said  that  Mr  Gul  was
         granted settlement on 12/01/15.  Abyan  has  been  granted  British
         citizenship.  Basil  has  applied  for  British  citizenship.   The
         children are doing well at school. She is an integral part of their
         education, upbringing, and family. She  has  no  family  living  in
         Pakistan and no relative there who can support them.

         11. In evidence she said that she has not been  to  Pakistan  since
         2013. She went for family funerals. She has 1 married and 1  single
         sister in Pakistan, and 1 sister in Canada.

         12. The married sister lives  with  her  husband  and  children  in
         Abbotabad. She cannot stay with that sister  as  she  has  her  own
         family. She has no letters from them to say she  cannot  live  with
         them. Every 2 or 3 weeks she speaks to her. She is a primary school
         teacher and her (i.e. that  sister's)  husband  is  a  high  school
         principle. Their children are 15 and 13. She speaks English.

         13. Her aunt's husband is deceased. She has a pension and does  not
         work. She has a live in maid and lives in a 2  bedroom  house.  She
         cannot stay with her aunt as she is married. The single  sister  in
         Pakistan normally lives with her aunt but is currently at a student
         hostel in Islamabad. Her married sister and  aunt  live  20  to  25
         minutes apart by car.

         14. Mr Gul could not send her money to pay rent or  maintenance  as
         he has expenses of the house and children and cannot look after the
         boys and work. The boys speak a bit of Urdu but their main language
         is English which they use at home. They sold her parents  house  to
         pay for her sister's education. All of Mr  Gul's  family  are  from
         Abbotabad. He has been a self employed taxi driver for 5 or 6 years
         and earns �15,000 to �16,000  per  year.  The  boys  are  at  state
         school. They all use the NHS. They started to receive  working  tax
         credit 1 week ago. Mrs Batool is a member of community groups.

         15. Janet Smith, Business  Manager  at  Margaret  McMillan  Primary
         School wrote (15/09/14) that Basil has  been  on  the  school  roll
         since 04/01/12. I have seen Abyan's British passport and  Mr  Gul's
         indefinite leave to remain residence permit and Pakistani passport,
         the council tax and electricity bill, Mr Gul's bank statement,  and
         a letter from HMRC.

    Judge Saffer went on to make the following findings at [16-23]:

         16. Mrs Batool has lived here for less than 20 years  and  is  over
         25. Basil has lived here all his life and is  a  child.  He  is  at
         school. Abyan has lived all his life here and is  British.  Mr  Gul
         has lived here for over  10  years  and  has  indefinite  leave  to
         remain. They all speak English. There are however no insurmountable
         obstacles that can not reasonably or realistically be  overcome  to
         them resettling in Pakistan, and it would not  be  disproportionate
         to require the whole family to do  so  for  all  the  reasons  that
         follow.

         17. Mrs Batool has siblings and other relatives living in  Pakistan
         who she is in very regular contact with every 2  or  3  weeks.  She
         spent the first 26 years of her life living there. She  speaks  the
         language and understands the culture in Pakistan and has visited on
         5 occasions in the last 8 years for a total of over 1  year  and  3
         months. The  suggestion  that  she  had  no  family  there  in  her
         application was patently untrue. I do not accept that  her  married
         sister who is a school teacher or her  brother  in  law  who  is  a
         school principle would not assist the  children  go  to  school  or
         would not assist with accommodating the family at least temporarily
         as there is no cogent reason they would not help immediate  family.
         They have produced no evidence from the family in Pakistan. This in
         not a case of a lack of evidence from a persecutory home country as
         in asylum cases, but evidence from a country  where  she  has  very
         close family she is in regular contact with and where she is safe.

         18. Basil is a Pakistani citizen. He has made  an  application  for
         British citizenship. That may or may not be granted. He  remains  a
         Pakistani national. Abyan is British.  His  nationality  is  not  a
         trump card. He is also Pakistani. Both boys are  being  denied  the
         opportunity of being brought up in their  parent's  homeland  where
         they form part of the majority culture and  their  extended  family
         live. I accept that they both speak some Urdu. That  is  inevitable
         given their background and family  in  Pakistan.  Basil  has  spent
         extensive periods of time there. I have not seen Abyan's  Pakistani
         passport but note Mr Gul's inability to provide for the family  and
         care  for  the  children  in  Mrs  Batool's   absence.   In   those
         circumstances it is likely Abyan has had similar extensive  periods
         of time in Pakistan. Whilst leaving school and  the  school  system
         here may be initially difficult, I  am  satisfied  that  both  boys
         could  integrate  into  school  and  life  in  Pakistan  given  the
         extensive time they have spent there, the ability of their  parents
         to assist them, and the support they would get from extended family
         who are education professionals.

         19. Mrs Batool has produced  no  cogent  evidence  to  support  the
         assertion that she is a member of community groups or to  establish
         what her private life is outside of the family. Her limited private
         life has always been precarious here given  the  temporary  status.
         Given Basil's tender years  the  precarious  private  life  he  has
         developed is even more limited.

         20. There are  no  compelling  circumstances  that  require  me  to
         consider article 8 outside the rules as despite the length of  time
         the boys have been here and Abyan's British nationality, they  have
         family to return  to,  can  go  back  together,  and  there  is  no
         suggestion that they lack the ability to learn the language.

         21. Even if there were compelling circumstances such as to  mean  I
         should consider the application outside  the  rules  I  would  have
         dismissed the application for the following reason.

         22. They can go to Pakistan as a family.  It  is  proportionate  to
         require them to leave for the  following  reasons  in  addition  to
         those already given. It is in  the  child's  best  interest  to  be
         together with their mother where  she  can  lawfully  live.  It  is
         reasonable to expect them to go with her. In  Pakistan  where  they
         can all live lawfully and have extensive family support. Abyan  can
         come back whenever he wishes or stay with Mr Gul while  Mrs  Batool
         and Basil make an application for entry clearance. Mr Gul  and  Mrs
         Batool can work in Pakistan. In Pakistan there is no  evidence  the
         boys would be neglected or abused, or that they  have  unmet  needs
         that could not be catered for, and there  are  stable  arrangements
         for their physical care that can be put in place.

         23. There would of course be  problems  regarding  the  maintenance
         requirement for any entry  clearance  application  given  Mr  Gul's
         limited income which makes their removal even more appropriate. The
         family are a significant burden on the public purse given the  fact
         the boys are at state school, the family use the NHS, and they  now
         receive working tax credit. I bear in  mind  that  they  all  speak
         English. Even if it is thought that the boy's best interests are to
         remain here, that is not  a  trump  card  and  neither  is  British
         nationality, given the burden on the state and  need  to  keep  the
         family together where their mother can  lawfully  reside  which  is
         Pakistan.

 3. The appellant's initial grounds of appeal were  refused  permission  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.  Those original grounds, together with renewal
    grounds were submitted to the Upper Tribunal and permission granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge King.  He wrote:

         It is accepted that the appellant's husband has indefinite leave to
         remain.  One child is a British citizen and the  other  is  in  the
         process of becoming one.  All, including the appellant, had resided
         with leave.  It was arguable that such  practice  could  constitute
         compelling circumstances outside the Rules.  It is unclear  why  in
         those  circumstances  it  would  be  proportionate  to  expect  the
         appellant to return to make an application for entry clearance.

 4. The grounds of appeal argue that the judge made "speculative  findings"
    as regards the "drain on public funds" and about the  presence  of  the
    appellant  in  the  United  Kingdom.   I  disagree  that  the   judge's
    assessment was "speculative".  The grounds complain that there  was  no
    evidence to show that the appellant was "accessing NHS treatment".  The
    judge has not suggested that the appellant is currently  receiving  any
    treatment from the NHS; his point is that her presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom is sufficient to show that,  if  she  did  become  ill  or  was
    injured, she would receive such treatment.  The judge points  out  that
    the family is receiving working tax credit and that the children are at
    state schools; but those are both factors which may justify the judge's
    assessment of the family's presence as a  "significant  burden  on  the
    public purse."  To argue otherwise is nothing more than a  disagreement
    with the assessment of the judge.

 5. It is also argued that the judge has failed to  carry  out  a  discreet
    analysis under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009.  However, I agree  with  the  respondent  (see  the  Rule  24
    response dated 8 April 2016) that the judge's analysis at [18] and [23]
    does constitute a Section 55 assessment  although  the  judge  did  not
    refer to that provision in terms.  I am satisfied that  the  judge  has
    dealt with the interests of the children as a primary consideration but
    he has, indeed,  considered  all  relevant  evidence  in  reaching  his
    decision.  The judge has achieved an outcome which was available to him
    on the factual matrix before the Tribunal but he has given reasons  for
    making the findings that he has  set  out  in  his  decision.   Another
    Tribunal may have reached a different decision; however,  that  is  not
    the point.  The judge has not erred  in  his  application  of  the  law
    whilst his reasoning is clear and cogent.  The grounds of appeal either
    raise matters which do not constitute an error  of  law  (for  example,
    failing to refer to Section 55 whilst carrying  out  entirely  adequate
    discussion of the children's best interests) or amount to nothing  more
    than a disagreement with findings made by the  judge.   The  appeal  is
    dismissed.
