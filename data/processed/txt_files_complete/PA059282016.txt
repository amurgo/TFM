                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, she arrived in the UK in August
    2015 and claimed asylum on the 1st of December  2015.  The  application
    was on the basis that as a single woman who had  had  a  child  outside
    marriage she would be at risk in Pakistan. The application was rejected
    for the reasons given in the Refusal Letter of the 26th  of  May  2016.
    The Appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull  at
    Birmingham on the 16th of March 2017  and  dismissed  for  the  reasons
    given in the decision promulgated on the 12th of April 2017.

 2. The Judge found that the Appellant's claim to have had  a  relationship
    outside marriage was not credible. The Judge set  out  her  reasons  at
    paragraphs19  to  35  of  the  decision.  The  Judge  found  that   the
    Appellant's claim to have had a child out of wedlock was not  credible,
    there were a number of inconsistencies in the Appellant's evidence, the
    evidence did not show that  any  action  had  been  taken  against  the
    Appellant even though the family and her fiancï¿½ apparently knew of  the
    relationship. The lack of action by the  family  was  contrary  to  the
    evidence on honour killings.

 3. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  from
    the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier Tribunal Judge Pooler decided  that
    the grounds did not disclose an arguable error of law. The reference to
    a reasonable likelihood in paragraph 34 had  to  be  seen  against  the
    correct self-direction in paragraph 4 and in paragraph 22 expressed her
    findings appropriately. The high threshold for  irrationality  was  not
    crossed.

 4. The grounds were renewed to the Upper Tribunal arguing  that  paragraph
    34 was a material misdirection  of  law,  there  was  no  contradiction
    between the method of entry interview and  the  asylum  interview,  the
    lack of action against Aziz did not mean the Appellant was not at risk,
    if the child was not born out of wedlock why would the  Appellant  come
    to the UK and had not considered the welfare of the Appellant's child -
    primary consideration. Permission was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Plimmer who stated it was arguable that the standard of proof had  been
    inverted in paragraph 34 and all the grounds were arguable.

 5. At the hearing Mr Pipe submitted that the complaint was about  how  the
    standard of proof had been applied, referring to paragraphs 32 and  29.
    Reliance was placed on footnote 5 of page 22 of Asylum Law and Practice
    (2nd ed) and the case of Demirakaya. This was not a  single  usage  and
    was not peripheral. The lack of  action  taken  against  Aziz  did  not
    assist with assessing the risk to the Appellant  which  would  manifest
    itself on return. The approach to the method of entry questionnaire and
    the asylum interview was flawed. If the findings were correct why claim
    in the UK if the child was not born out of wedlock? Article 8  had  not
    been raised and section 55 would be considered within that framework.

 6. For the Home Office Mr Mills observed that there was an obvious problem
    with paragraphs 32 and 34. All he  could  say  was  that  the  decision
    should be read as a whole, paragraphs 4 and 36 stated the burden in the
    correct terms and did not suggest an inversion. He went  on  to  submit
    that the remaining grounds had little weight in  them.  The  method  of
    entry findings did not stand alone as  a  single  point,  the  lack  of
    action against Aziz was part of the assessment of the consistency  with
    background evidence and the Judge was entitled to find that  the  claim
    was not consistent. The 4th ground invited speculation, the simple fact
    was that the Judge found that the claim was not proved  to  go  further
    would have involved speculation and would have been an error. Given the
    findings there would be no basis for finding that they could not return
    to Pakistan and there was nothing in the best interests point.

 7. Guidance on the approach to the assessment of  decision  was  given  by
    Burnett LJ in EA v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 10 at  paragraph  27  where  he
    made the following observations: "Decisions  of  tribunals  should  not
    become formulaic and rarely benefit from copious citation of authority.
    Arguments that reduce to the proposition that the F-tT  has  failed  to
    mention dicta from a  series  of  cases  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  or
    elsewhere will rarely prosper. Similarly,  as  Lord  Hoffmann  said  in
    Piglowska v Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360, 1372, "reasons should be  read
    on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated  the  contrary,  the
    judge knew how he should perform his functions  and  which  matters  he
    should take into account". He added that  an  "appellate  court  should
    resist the temptation to subvert the principle  that  they  should  not
    substitute their own discretion for that  of  the  judge  by  a  narrow
    textual analysis which  enables  them  to  claim  that  he  misdirected
    himself". Moreover, some principles are so firmly embedded in  judicial
    thinking that they do not need to be recited. For example, it would  be
    surprising to see in every civil judgment a paragraph dealing with  the
    burden and standard of  proof;  or  in  every  running  down  action  a
    treatise, however short, on the  law  of  negligence.  That  said,  the
    reader of any judicial decision must be reassured from its content that
    the court or tribunal  has  applied  the  correct  legal  test  to  any
    question it is deciding."

 8. The Judge correctly referred to the lower standard of proof in her self-
    directions at paragraph 4 and in the brief summary of the rejection  of
    the Appellant's claim in paragraph 36 of the decision. The  section  of
    the decision setting out the Judge's findings starts  at  paragraph  17
    with the main findings set out from paragraph 23 onwards. The  findings
    start with the answers  given  in  interview  and  then  focus  on  the
    background evidence relating to honour based violence in Pakistan.

 9. The discussion in paragraphs 25 to 32  included  consideration  of  the
    background evidence  relating  to  honour  killings,  the  attitude  of
    families that perceived that they had been dishonoured and  the  danger
    to those suspected of bringing dishonour on a family. The danger was to
    the family's daughter and the man involved in the suspected  or  actual
    relationship. The Judge considered the evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    interview and the evidence given at the hearing. Given  the  background
    evidence showing that the man would be in real danger  the  absence  of
    any evidence to show action had been taken against Aziz  was  something
    which the Judge attached significant weight to.

10. The parts of the decision which have  attracted  the  most  significant
    concern are to be found at the end of paragraph 32  and  paragraph  34.
    Paragraph 32 having noted the lack of adverse action against Aziz  ends
    with these words "which I find suggests  that  there  is  a  reasonable
    likelihood that this is because the child was not born out of  wedlock,
    as claimed."

11. Paragraph 33 is a further discussion of the attitude of the Appellant's
    family and the situation of Aziz and the lack of  action  against  him.
    That was followed by paragraph 34 which states "I find this is  because
    there is a reasonable likelihood that the  appellant  did  not  have  a
    relationship with Aziz outside or (sic) marriage or  give  birth  to  a
    child out of wedlock."

12. The sentences in paragraphs 32 and 34 are to the same effect, paragraph
    34 repeating the earlier statement, summarising  the  conclusion  drawn
    from the preceding analysis.  Not  happily  worded  paragraph  34  adds
    nothing to paragraph 32. There is nothing in the preceding  discussions
    that shows that the Judge was applying  an  inappropriate  standard  of
    proof in the manner that the evidence was being considered.  The  Judge
    correctly set out the burden and standard and summarised  her  findings
    in paragraph 36 appropriately.

13. The decision has to be read as a whole without taking  matters  out  of
    context or applying "narrow textual analysis".  Having  regard  to  the
    guidance set out above and in taking a holistic view of the decision  I
    am satisfied that, although not happily worded, the decision shows that
    the Judge was applying the correct standard of proof and that there  is
    no error of law within the decision made. Paragraphs 32 and 34 are  the
    same point repeated and against the discussion conducted by  the  Judge
    cannot be said to be material.

14. The subsidiary grounds  of  application  are  without  foundation.  The
    complaint about the weight placed on the method of entry interview  and
    the Appellant's main interview  are  not  a  significant  part  of  the
    reasoning of Judge Phull and the Judge was entitled to have  regard  to
    the differences. The lack of action  taken  against  Aziz  was  clearly
    relevant as, according to background evidence, he too would  have  been
    at risk - the lack of interest in him was an indication of the attitude
    of the family which raised the issue for the  Judge  to  consider.  The
    welfare of the Appellant's child  stood  or  fell  with  the  principal
    findings of the Judge.

15. Having found that the Appellant was not at risk any other  findings  on
    motivation would  have  been  unnecessary  and  unjustified,  had  such
    findings been made then the complaint would have been  that  the  Judge
    had speculated without foundation. The principal function of the  Judge
    was to find whether the claim  was  credible  to  the  lower  standard,
    having found it was not it was not then necessary for the Judge  to  go
    further. The findings of the Judge in this regard were open to her  for
    the reasons given and do not demonstrate any errors.

16. For the reasons given above I find that the decision of Judge Phull was
    not affected by any material error of law and it stands as the disposal
    of the Appellant's appeal.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.
