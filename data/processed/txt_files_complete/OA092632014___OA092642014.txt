Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr P Richardson, Counsel instructed by Lewis Kennedy
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Moore sitting at Taylor  House  on  16  June
    2015) dismissing on financial grounds their appeal against the decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer (Chennai  post)  to  refuse  them  entry
    clearance for the purposes of settlement as respectively the  wife  and
    daughter of a person present and settled here.  The First-tier Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction in favour of the appellants, and  I
    do not consider the appellants require anonymity for these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The background to this case is that the appellants are  both  nationals
    of India.  The first appellant was born  on  10  March  1969,  and  the
    second appellant was born on 21 June 1995.  As the first  appellant  is
    the main appellant in this appeal I shall hereafter refer to her simply
    as the appellant, save where the context otherwise requires.

 3. On 19 June 2013, two days before their daughter's  18th  birthday,  the
    appellant applied to join her husband, Mr Rafiq, in the United Kingdom,
    and Ms Rafiq made a parallel application.

 4. On 13 September 2013 an Entry Clearance Officer wrote to the  appellant
    in India stating that her application fell to be refused solely because
    she did not meet the income threshold requirement under Appendix FM and
    the related evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE.  The  letters
    from her sponsors' (two) employers did not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE because neither letter  confirmed  the  sponsor's  gross
    income or the period over which his current level of  income  had  been
    paid.  The letter from Merit  Recruitment  also  did  not  confirm  his
    employment type.  In addition, one payslip was missing  in  respect  of
    the sponsor's employment with TC Facilities Management, and two of  the
    sponsor's Barclays bank statements for the period 19 October 2012 to 17
    May 2013 were photocopies, not originals, (namely the  statements  from
    19 October 2012 to 18 December 2012) and so were not acceptable.

 5. The decision on the application had been put on hold until  the  courts
    have decided the outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal in a  legal
    challenge to the income threshold requirement.  In the meantime if by 4
    October 2013 she submitted any further information or documents, it had
    to relate directly to the reasons given above as to  why  she  did  not
    meet the income threshold requirement.  It must also relate only to her
    circumstances and/or those of the sponsor as they were at the  date  of
    application, or in the relevant periods prior to that date.  If on  the
    basis of further information or documents, her application met all  the
    requirements of the Rules, a decision would be taken on her application
    and it would be granted.

 6. The appellant's application was eventually refused on  5  August  2014.
    To meet the financial requirements of the Rules for the entry clearance
    of herself and her daughter, her sponsor needed a gross  income  of  at
    least �22,400 per annum.   She  had  failed  to  provide  the  required
    specified documents to evidence this.  She provided  two  letters  from
    Merit Recruitment, but neither of them confirmed her  sponsor's  salary
    or the period of time he had been paid it.  She provided a letter  from
    T C Facilities Management.  But it did not confirm her sponsor's salary
    or the period of time he had been paid it.

 7. On a separate decision of the same date, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    gave identical reasons for refusing the second appellant's application.

 8. The grounds of appeal were settled by the appellant's solicitors.  They
    argued the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  Rules,  or  was
    otherwise not in accordance with the law, or discretion ought  to  have
    been exercised in a different way as to how it was "legally"  exercised
    by the initial  decision  maker.   The  application  had  been  refused
    without considering the P60, twelve months' payslips, corroborated bank
    statements, letter from  the  employer  and  the  employment  contract.
    Exact reasons for the refusal was not detailed anywhere in EC-P.1.1  of
    Appendix FM of the Rules.

 9. On 2 December 2014 an Entry Clearance  Manager  gave  his  reasons  for
    upholding the refusal decisions, notwithstanding the grounds of appeal.
     While there appeared to be, on face  value,  significant  evidence  to
    support the fact the UK  sponsor  met  the  minimum  income  threshold,
    Appendix FM-SE required certain key pieces of documentary  evidence  to
    prove that employment and income was as claimed by  the  appellant  and
    not contrived for the purposes of the application.  In  this  instance,
    the appellants have failed to provide two pieces of specified  evidence
    in support of their applications and had,  in  the  intervening  period
    since, still failed to provide the two documents despite being notified
    of despatch on two separate occasions.  He had  to  question  why  such
    basic documents could not be procured to support the applications.

10. He noted the assertion that the ECO should  have  exercised  discretion
    differently.  This in itself appeared  to  imply  that  the  appellants
    could not meet the requirements of the relevant Rule, as  reliance  has
    been placed on the exercise of discretion.  In any event, there was  no
    explanation, supported by evidence, as to why the  appellants  believed
    that discretion ought to  have  been  exercised  differently.   He  was
    satisfied that in this specific  area  the  ECO  had  no  discretionary
    powers, "given the documents as specified under Appendix FM-SE".

The Hearing Before, The Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. Both parties were legally represented  before  Judge  Moore.   For  the
    purposes of the appeal, the appellants' solicitors  compiled  a  bundle
    running to 167 pages which contained a further,  but  unsigned,  letter
    from Merit Recruitment dated 3 August 2014.  Mr  Colin  Champion,  site
    manager, confirmed that the sponsor was employed on a  permanent  full-
    time basis by Merit Hygiene Services, a division of  Merit  Recruitment
    Ltd.  His  role  was  that  of  a  warehouse  hygiene  assistant.   His
    employment with MHS had commenced on 15 January 2008 and,  "his  annual
    salary is circa �17,721.60 (O.T.E.)".

12. In his  subsequent  decision,  the  Judge  set  out  the  case  of  the
    respondent at paragraphs [9] to [10].  Mr  Kandola  on  behalf  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer submitted that the appellant could not  satisfy
    the Rules.  Even though this might be a technicality, the appeal  could
    not be allowed because there were  no  near  exceptional  circumstances
    which would justify it being allowed.  The  appellant  had  been  given
    ample opportunity on at least two occasions  to  provide  the  relevant
    documentation, but had failed to do so.

13. The Judge set out the appellant's case at paragraphs [11] to  [17].  Mr
    Davidson, Counsel for the appellants, submitted that this was a  narrow
    issue case and that the letter from Merit Recruitment  which  had  been
    provided after the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer appeared  to
    address all of the concerns of the Entry Clearance Officer with  regard
    to employment, sponsor's salary and the period over which  that  salary
    had been paid.  Clearly this was not a case where either the sponsor or
    the lead appellant had contrived in any way to give a false picture, as
    could be seen by consideration of all the evidence  provided.   So  the
    appeal should be allowed outside the Rules.

14. The Judge set out his findings of fact and conclusions  from  paragraph
    [18] onwards.  He found that the appellant could not satisfy the  Rules
    since the required specified documents had not been provided  from  the
    two employers, Merit Recruitment and TC Facilities Management.  In  the
    circumstances, he had to consider the facts  and  the  evidence  before
    reaching any decision outside the Rules.

15. In paragraph [20], he observed that on two separate occasions the Entry
    Clearance Officer had afforded  an  opportunity  to  the  appellant  to
    provide  the  relevant  documentary  evidence  required.   These   were
    evidential requirements  under  the  Rules  and  the  appellant  and/or
    sponsor failed to provide specified evidence to the respondent not only
    at the time of application but also  on  occasions  subsequent  to  the
    application being submitted.  Where the failure to  satisfy  the  Rules
    was a technicality was neither here nor there,  since  the  Rules  were
    not.  He was not satisfied he could allow  either  appeal  outside  the
    Rules.  His reasoning was that there were not circumstances which could
    be considered to be anything near exceptional since the  appellant  was
    provided adequate opportunity to provide specified evidence and  failed
    to do so at the time of application or even within a reasonable  period
    thereafter.

16. The  Judge  went  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compassionate
    circumstances which justified the appeal being allowed by reference  to
    Article 8 ECHR.  He noted that since the marriage in 2005, the wife and
    daughter had been living together in India.  The sponsor  had  acquired
    British citizenship, and in those circumstances  he  had  a  degree  of
    freedom of movement.  He had effectively lived apart from his wife  and
    daughter for  the  past  eight  years,  and  he  did  not  consider  it
    unreasonable for the sponsor either to live in India, or to  visit  the
    appellants  there.   He   was   satisfied   that   the   decision   was
    proportionate, having regard to Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

17. Mr Davidson settled the application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  He quoted from the first part of paragraph [19] of the
    decision as follows:

         "It would now appear to the respondent that there would  appear  to
         be  significant  evidence  supporting  key  pieces  of  documentary
         evidence demonstrating that employment and income is as claimed  by
         the appellant and not contrived."

18. In  the  circumstances,  Mr  Davidson  submitted  that  the  evidential
    flexibility provisions at the beginning of Appendix FM-SE were engaged.
     The evidence was clearly verifiable  from  other  documents  submitted
    with the application, and the Judge should have considered the exercise
    of discretion  himself  or  referred  the  matter  back  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  To undertake neither course of action, and to  make
    no  reference  to  reference  to  paragraph  D(d)  of  Appendix  FM-SE,
    disclosed an arguable error of law.

19.  The  Judge  had  also  wrongly  referred  at  paragraph  [23]  to  the
    prospective removal of the appellants, when what was in issue was their
    exclusion.

20. The Judge had  failed  to  give  reasons  in  paragraph  [24]  why  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control was in the public interest
    in the light of his primary findings of fact.  Having  found  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had significant  evidence  to  demonstrate  the
    sponsor  earned  more  than  was  required  to   meet   the   financial
    requirements of the Rules, Mr Davidson asked rhetorically how it  could
    be in the pursuance of effect immigration control to prevent  his  wife
    and child joining him in the UK?

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

21. On 22 October 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley granted permission
    to appeal on all grounds raised for the following reasons:

         "It is arguable, as submitted in the grounds, that  the  Judge  may
         have erred in law due to (a)  failure  to  take  into  account  the
         appellant did not receive the respondent's request  for  additional
         documents until after the option  achieved  to  address  the  issue
         would close; and (b) the finding [at 23] that the proposed  removal
         would not interfere with the appellant's Article 8 right  when  the
         appeal relates to an entry clearance application."

22. Judge Ransley continued that the decision had  been  shown  to  involve
    arguable errors of law that might have made a  material  difference  to
    the outcome of the appeal.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

23. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Richardson developed the  grounds  of  appeal  settled  by  his
    colleague Mr Davidson.  In reply, Mr Melvin  adhered  to  the  Rule  24
    response opposing the appeal.  He submitted that the Judge had directed
    himself appropriately, and had given adequate  reasons  for  dismissing
    the appeal under the Rules, and also outside the Rules.

Discussion

24. The Judge made two errors, neither of which is  material.   He  wrongly
    referred to the appellants' removal, as  opposed  to  their  exclusion,
    when addressing the alternative claim under  Article  8  ECHR.   It  is
    apparent from the context that this was merely a slip,  and  the  Judge
    did in fact appreciate that the prospective  interference  was  one  of
    exclusion, not removal.  The Judge gave adequate  reasons  for  finding
    that the interference  consequential  upon  the  refusal  decision  was
    proportionate, and the challenge to the finding under Article 8  is  no
    more than  expression  of  disagreement  with  a  conclusion  that  was
    reasonably open to the Judge for the reasons which she gave.

25. The Judge also erred in failing to acknowledge the existence of a third
    letter from Merit Recruitment which, unlike the  previous  two  letters
    which  had  been  shown  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  contained
    information about the appellant's current gross salary.

26. However, the Judge's error is not material for two  reasons.   Firstly,
    contrary to Mr Richardson's submission, the third letter still did  not
    fully comply with paragraph 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE.   The  letter  from
    the employer needed to confirm, inter alia, the period over  which  the
    sponsor  had  been  paid  the  level  of  salary  relied  upon  in  the
    application.  The letter in the appellant's bundle  did  not  discharge
    this function.  It  merely  confirmed  the  appellant's  current  basic
    salary.

27. Secondly, as Mr Richardson acknowledged, even at the appeal  stage  the
    appellant had not provided a letter from the sponsor's  other  employer
    specifying either his current gross annual salary, or the  period  over
    which he had  been  paid  the  level  of  salary  relied  upon  in  the
    application.

28. It was not part of the case advanced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that the decision appealed against was not in accordance with  the  law
    as the Entry Clearance Officer/Entry Clearance Manager  had  failed  to
    exercise discretion pursuant to paragraph D of Appendix  FM-SE  or  had
    wrongly exercised his discretion.  Mr Davidson also does not appear  to
    have put the case on the basis that the Judge  ought  now  to  exercise
    discretion in the appellant's favour under paragraph D of Appendix  FM-
    SE on the ground that the employment letters did not contain all of the
    specified information, but the missing information was verifiable  from
    other documents submitted with the application.

29. This line of attack only emerges for the first time in the  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, apparently triggered by  the  finding  of
    the Judge at the beginning of paragraph [19].

30. In effect, it is argued that, because of the  Judge's  finding  at  the
    beginning of paragraph [19], the Judge should have, of his own  motion,
    found that the decision appealed against was not in accordance with the
    law.

31. But this case does not stand up  to  scrutiny.   At  the  beginning  of
    paragraph [19] the Judge  is  merely  summarising  one  aspect  of  the
    respondent's case rehearsed in the ECM appeal review.  The error of law
    challenge ignores  the  remaining  aspects  of  the  respondent's  case
    rehearsed in the ECM appeal review, which was that, notwithstanding the
    concession that the minimum income  threshold  was  probably  met,  the
    appellant had without good excuse failed to provide all  the  specified
    evidence under Appendix FM-SE despite being given ample opportunity  to
    do so, and therefore discretion was not going to be  exercised  in  her
    favour.

32. Mr Richardson submitted that the Entry Clearance  Manager  had  wrongly
    fettered  his  discretion  under  paragraph  D  of  Appendix  FM-SE  by
    asserting that the ECO had no  discretionary  powers,  given  that  the
    documents were specified under Appendix FM-SE.

33. In support of this submission, Mr Richardson  relied  on  sub-paragraph
    (d) of paragraph D as follows:

         'If the applicant has submitted:

         (iii)    a document that does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
             information, but the missing information is  verifiable  from:
             (1) other documents submitted with  the  application  ...  the
             application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing   the
             decision maker is satisfied that the  document(s)  is  genuine
             and that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to  which  the
             document relates.'

34. However, it is necessary to read on.  The same sub-paragraph goes on to
    state as follows:

         'The decision maker reserves the right  to  request  the  specified
         original document(s) in the correct format in all cases where  sub-
         paragraph (b) applies, and to refuse applications if this  material
         is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).'

35. It is also necessary to consider sub-paragraph (e)  which  provides  as
    follows:

         'Where the decision maker is satisfied there is a valid reason  why
         a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because it is  not
         issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or
         she may exercise discretion not to apply the  requirement  for  the
         document(s) or to request alternative or additional information  or
         document(s) be submitted by the applicant.'

36. It is clear from the ECM appeal review the Entry Clearance Manager  was
    not satisfied that the appellant  met  the  requirement  to  which  the
    deficient employment letters related.  The failure by the appellant  to
    provide compliant employment letters, when specifically requested to do
    so, was a legitimate cause of concern.  Moreover, the appellant had not
    provided a valid reason why compliant employment letters could  not  be
    supplied.  So, on the face of it, the exercise  of  discretion  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager was lawful and in accordance with  paragraph  D
    of Appendix FM-SE.  At the beginning of paragraph D, the decision maker
    is defined as being either the Entry Clearance Officer or the Secretary
    of State, and so the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  could  not  exercise
    discretion differently in the light of new  documentary  evidence  that
    had been produced after the ECM appeal review.

37. Permission to appeal was granted on the premise that the appellant  may
    have been a victim of unfairness in that she was not given enough  time
    to respond  to  the  initial  request  for  the  provision  of  missing
    documents, and that the Judge  may  thus  have  wrongly  excluded  from
    consideration the employment letters which had been provided after  the
    short cut off date.  This premise is incorrect.  It is clear  that  the
    Entry Clearance Manager  made  his  assessment  on  the  basis  of  the
    position as it stood on 2 December 2014, which was  more  than  a  year
    after the appellant had  been  requested  in  writing  to  provide  the
    missing specified documents. So neither he nor the Judge excluded  from
    consideration documents which had been provided after the original cut-
    off date.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
