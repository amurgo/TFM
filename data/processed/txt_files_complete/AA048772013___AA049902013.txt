                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellants are both citizens of Sri Lanka.  They  are  husband  and
    wife born respectively on 23rd October 1987 and 10th  May  1984.   They
    were individually granted leave to enter as students  and  subsequently
    applied for asylum.  Those applications were refused and the Appellants
    appealed.  Their appeals were heard together by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Rose (the Judge) sitting at Hatton Cross on  25th  June  2013.
    He allowed both appeals on asylum and  human  rights  grounds  for  the
    reasons given in his Determination.  The  Respondent  sought  leave  to
    appeal that decision,  and  on  19th  July  2013  such  permission  was
    granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.  The Judge  allowed  the
    appeals because he found the Appellants to be credible and  that  their
    circumstances came within sufficient of the risk factors identified  in
    TK (Tamils - LP updated) Sri Lanka CG [2009] UKAIT 00049 to satisfy him
    that the Appellants were at risk on return.

 3. The  sole  ground  relied  upon  by  the  Respondent,  and  upon  which
    permission to appeal was granted, is that the Judge  erred  in  law  in
    applying the country guidance case of TK whereas he should have applied
    the later country guidance case  of  GJ  and  Others  (Post-civil  war:
    returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).  However,  during  the
    course of the hearing it transpired that the Judge decided  the  appeal
    and wrote his Determination on or before 3rd July 2013, that being  the
    date of the Determination.  The Determination in GJ is dated  5th  July
    2013 and could not have been promulgated prior to that date.  Therefore
    I have to find that the Judge could not have been aware of the decision
    in GJ at the time that he  wrote  and  signed  his  Determination,  and
    therefore it cannot be an error of law for him not to have relied  upon
    it.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005.   I  continue  that
order pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008.
