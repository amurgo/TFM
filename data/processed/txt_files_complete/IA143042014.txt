                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1.  This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against   the
         determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Trevaskis  in  which  he
         allowed the appeal of Mr Williamson, a citizen of Jamaica,  against
         the Secretary of State's  decision  to  refuse  to  vary  leave  to
         remain. I shall refer to Mr Williamson as the  Applicant,  although
         he was the Appellant in the proceedings below.

      2. The application under appeal was made on 14 January  2013  and  was
         refused by reference to paragraphs 248D (ii),  (iii),  (iv),  (vii)
         and 248F of the Immigration Rules (HC395) on 25 February 2014.  The
         Applicant exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.
          This is the  appeal  which  came  before  Judge  Trevaskis  on  29
         September 2014 and was allowed. The Secretary of State applied  for
         permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  application  was
         granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  P  J  M  Hollingworth  on  27
         November 2014 in the following terms

             An arguable error of law has arisen in relation to  the  issue
             of whether all the requirements of the Immigration Rules  have
             been met and whether  the  Judge  has  set  out  a  sufficient
             analysis of the financial aspect of the Rule in question.

      3. At the hearing before me Mr  Richards  appeared  to  represent  the
         Secretary of  State  and  the  Applicant  appeared  in  person.  No
         additional documents were submitted.

    Background

      4. The history of this  appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  facts,  not
         challenged, are that the  Applicant  was  born  in  Jamaica  on  27
         September 1972. He came to the United Kingdom with leave  to  enter
         as a person exercising rights of access to a child  on  27  January
         2012.  The  child  in  question  was  the  Applicant's  son  Harvey
         Williamson who was born on 16 November 2002. On 14 January 2013 the
         Applicant made an in  time  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
         remain on the basis of his access rights to the child.  In  reusing
         the application the Respondent stated that she  was  not  satisfied
         that the Applicant met the requirements  of  paragraph  248D  (ii),
         (iii), (iv), and (vii) of HC395. Specifically  the  Respondent  was
         not satisfied that the Applicant was taking an active role  in  the
         child's upbringing, that the  child  visited  or  stayed  with  the
         Applicant  on  a  regular  basis,  that  there  would  be  adequate
         accommodation for the Applicant without recourse to public funds or
         that the Applicant had sufficient knowledge of the English language
         and life in the UK.

      5. At the appeal hearing on 29 September 2014 the  Applicant  was  not
         represented. After hearing evidence from the  Applicant  the  Judge
         found that he met the requirements of the Immigration Rules and  in
         particular that he took an active role in the  child's  upbringing,
         saw the child regularly, had adequate  accommodation  and  met  the
         English language and knowledge of the UK requirements of the rules.
         These findings are not challenged before the  Upper  Tribunal.  The
         Judge also found, although this was not challenged by the Secretary
         of State in the refusal letter, that the Applicant  had  maintained
         himself adequately without recourse to public funds (paragraph 41).
         In making this finding the Judge  noted  that  this  fact  was  not
         challenged.

    Submissions

      6. On behalf the Secretary of State Mr Richards relied on the  grounds
         of appeal to the Upper Tribunal. He said that the issue was  narrow
         and confined to whether  the  Applicant  met  the  requirements  of
         paragraph 248D (v). The Judge makes it plain that he  is  satisfied
         that the Applicant is able to maintain himself  adequately  without
         recourse to public funds but does not give clear reasons  for  this
         finding. The grounds of appeal highlight that at the  date  of  the
         hearing the Applicant was working three hours a day for three  days
         a week with a gross wage of �58.50 whereas income support level for
         a single person in his position would have been �72.40.

      7. Responding to Mr Richards the  Applicant  said  that  he  had  been
         unable to seek other employment because the  Home  Office  retained
         his passport. At the time of the hearing he was getting �58.50  per
         week and was also getting help from his family. However at the date
         of the Respondent's decision he was working four days a  week  from
         08:00 to 13:00 and sometimes worked longer hours.

      8. In response Mr Richards fairly pointed out  that  the  Respondent's
         refusal had not  challenged  the  Applicants  ability  to  maintain
         himself. He said that the First-tier Judge  had  erred  in  law  by
         failing to give adequate reasons for  his  finding  in  respect  of
         maintenance but added  that  the  Tribunal  would  need  to  decide
         whether such error was material.

    Error of law

      9. In my judgement the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
         disclose a material error of law. The facts are simple and are  not
         disputed. The Applicant is, and at all  times  has  been,  lawfully
         present  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  made  his  application  for
         variation of leave  to  remain  in  January  2013  submitting  full
         details with his application. The application (section  5.3)  shows
         that at the time of his application he was earning  a  net  pay  of
         �320 per month. When the  Respondent  refused  the  application  in
         February 2014 neither  the  refusal  notice  nor  the  accompanying
         letter challenged  the  Applicant's  ability  to  maintain  himself
         without recourse to public funds either in terms or by reference to
         paragraph 248D (v) of HC 395.

     10. Further the Respondent was represented at the  First-tier  Tribunal
         hearing. In making his finding that the  Applicant  has  maintained
         himself adequately without recourse to public funds the Judge notes
         'because he has  given  evidence  of  that  fact  to  me  which  is
         unchallenged'. It is clear from this that  if  the  Respondent  had
         considered that at the time of her decision the Applicant  did  not
         meet the maintenance requirements of the rules  a  challenge  could
         have been made. It was not.  No  doubt  this  is  because,  as  the
         Applicant said in his submissions to the  Upper  Tribunal,  he  was
         working four days a week for a minimum of five hours  a  day  which
         would have given him a net income of about �130  per  week  at  the
         time of the Respondent's decision.

     11. In my judgement the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  by
         making a positive finding on an unchallenged  fact.  My  conclusion
         from all of the above  is  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal contains no error of law material to the decision to allow
         the appeal. The appeal of  the  Secretary  of  State  is  therefore
         dismissed.

    Summary

     12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making
         of a material error of law. I  dismiss  the  Secretary  of  State's
         appeal.
