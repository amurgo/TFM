For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. No anonymity order is made.

 2. The appellants are nationals of Pakistan.  The  second-named  appellant
    entered the United Kingdom as a student on April 8, 2007 and his  leave
    to remain as a student was subsequently extended until January 1, 2010.
    The appellant lodged an application, in time, to remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Migrant on November 30, 2009  and  this  was  granted  and
    extended until July 10, 2016. The  first-named  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom as a the second-named appellant's Tier  1  dependant  on
    October 14, 2011.

 3. The appellant lodged an application for indefinite leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant on July 10, 2016 which he subsequently  varied
    to an application under paragraph 276B HC 395 of March  14,  2017.  The
    first-named appellant applied at the same time to remain as the second-
    named appellant's dependant. Their applications  were  refused  by  the
    respondent on December 6, 2017.

 4. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on December 20, 2017.  The
    grounds  argued  the  respondent  had  erred   in   considering   their
    applications.

 5. Their appeals came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  A  Davies
    (hereinafter called "the Judge") on May 15,  2018  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on May 25, 2018 the Judge  dismissed  their  appeals  under
    article 8 ECHR.

 6. The appellants appealed the decision on June 8, 2018 on the ground that
    the Judge had erred in his approach to paragraph 322(5) HC 395.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on August 21, 2018  by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Swaney who found it arguable  the  Judge  erred  by
    failing to consider whether or not the second-named appellant's conduct
    in failing to declare a portion of his income was conduct that rendered
    his presence in the United Kingdom undesirable particularly in light of
    the fact HMRC, having been made aware, took no further action.

 8. No Rule 24 response has been filed and Mr Tan conceded that the central
    issue was whether an adverse finding was appropriate under para  322(5)
    HC 395.

    SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr McIndoe adopted his grounds of appeal. He accepted that the  Judge's
    finding on dishonesty at  paragraph  23  could  not  be  challenged  as
    permission to appeal had not been  given  on  this  point.  He  however
    submitted the Judge should have continued  to  give  reasons  why  that
    dishonesty merited a refusal under  paragraph  322(5)  HC  395.  Whilst
    noting what the  Upper  Tribunal  had  stated  in  The  Queen  (on  the
    application of) Muhammad Shoban Abbasi and The Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department he submitted that there was a difference between  a
    judicial review hearing and a human rights appeal as they were  looking
    at different issues. He submitted the Judge had  erred  by  failing  to
    take into account that the tax  had  been  repaid  before  the  current
    application had been lodged and the amount of understated tax was  only
    ï¿½3,687. He submitted the conduct was not sufficiently serious to engage
    paragraph 322(5) HC 395 especially in circumstances where the HMRC  had
    not imposed any additional penalty to the interest payment.

10. Mr Tan submitted that there was a clear finding the appellant had  used
    deception. He drew the Tribunal's attention to paragraphs 73 to  75  of
    the Abbasi decision. The appellant had to take responsibility  for  his
    own tax affairs in circumstances  where  he  would  have  provided  the
    figures to his accountant. He then had the responsibility  of  checking
    his tax return to make sure it reflected his  financial  circumstances.
    The fact no penalty notice had been issued was not relevant as HMRC has
    leeway to decide whether to issue penalty  or  not.  Accordingly,  even
    where there was no clear finding on character or conduct the Judge  was
    entitled to conclude the Rule was not met.

11. Mr McIndoe  responded  to  these  submissions.  He  accepted  that  the
    appellants would not succeed on a freestanding  article  8  application
    but he argued that they had been here lawfully throughout and that  the
    finding on dishonesty was not sufficient to engage paragraph 322(5)  HC
    395.

    FINDINGS

12. Paragraph 322(5) states that that  applications  for leave  to  remain
    should normally be refused where it would be undesirable for  a  person
    to  remain  in  the  UK  in  light  of  their  conduct,  character   or
    associations. There  have  been  many  reports  of  applications  being
    refused  because  of  discrepancies  between  the  income  declared to
    UKVI and information provided to HMRC. In some cases, this appears  to
    be due to applicants (or their representatives) having committed  minor
    errors on their tax returns, which were subsequently corrected  without
    incurring any penalty from HMRC.

13.  The  Government  has  said  that  it  is  not  its  policy  to  refuse
    applications solely due to minor tax errors, and  that  applicants  are
    given an opportunity to explain any discrepancies.

14. What is important in this particular appeal is that the Judge concluded
    the appellant did not approach his tax returns over three years  in  an
    honest manner. In reaching that finding the Judge took into account the
    explanation provided namely that reliance was placed on his  accountant
    and in applying paragraph 322(5) HC 395  the  Judge  provided  detailed
    reasons for finding the second-named appellant had  acted  dishonestly.
    The Judge noted there had been no complaint made about his professional
    advisers and as Mr McIndoe conceded he  was  unable  to  challenge  the
    dishonesty finding as permission to appeal had not been given  on  that
    issue.

15.  When  the  Judge  considered  the  appellants'  appeals  he  was   not
    considering an appeal based on  the  fact  the  appellant  had  made  a
    mistake or his accountants had made a mistake but he was considering an
    appeal based on a finding that  the  second-named  appellant  had  been
    dishonest over a three year period and whilst the amounts involved were
    not substantial the period of dishonesty was extensive.

16. The respondent's own guidance makes it clear a person does not need  to
    have been convicted of a criminal offence for this provision to  apply.
    When deciding whether to refuse under this category, the key  thing  to
    consider is if there is reliable evidence to support  a  decision  that
    the person's behaviour  calls  into  question  their  character  and/or
    conduct and/or their associations to the extent that it is  undesirable
    to allow them to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.

17. Whilst I accept there has been no additional penalty  imposed  by  HMRC
    that in itself does not mean  the  Judge  should  have  overlooked  the
    dishonest behaviour.

18. I am satisfied that as there was dishonesty the Judge was  entitled  to
    make the finding he did when considering article 8 ECHR. His assessment
    of article 8  issues  can  be  found  from  paragraph  28  onwards  and
    ultimately the Judge had to consider whether the  length  of  time  the
    family had spent in the United Kingdom was outweighed by the  paragraph
    322(5) HC 395 finding.

19. I find that the Judge's conclusion was one that was open to him and  in
    such circumstances, I find no error of law.

    DECISION

20. There was no error of law and I uphold the original decision.
