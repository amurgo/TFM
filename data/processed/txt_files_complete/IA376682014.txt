                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference, we shall refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Clapham (the judge), promulgated on 5 February 2015,  in
    which he allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal.  That  appeal  was  against
    decisions of the Respondent, dated 5 September 2014, to refuse to  vary
    his leave to remain and to remove him from  the  United  Kingdom  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    13 April 2015.



Background

 4. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 1 January  1988.  There
    has never been any dispute that he arrived in the United Kingdom on  26
    January 2005 with entry clearance as a student and that he has remained
    here lawfully ever since. His last grant of leave expired on  3  August
    2014. On 31 May 2014 the Appellant married Ms  Liana  Wake,  a  British
    citizen. An application to vary his leave on the basis of his  marriage
    was made on 31 July 2014.




 5. The Respondent refused the  application  under  the  five-year  Partner
    Route of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration  Rules  because  specified
    evidence relating to the financial requirements had not been submitted.
    In respect of the ten-year Partner Route, the Respondent asserted  that
    the Appellant's wife could accompany him back to Nigeria, and  so  EX.1
    was not satisfied. Paragraph 267ADE(vi) of the  Rules  was  considered,
    but there were said to be no  significant  obstacles  to  a  return  to
    Nigeria. There were no exceptional circumstances in this case.



 6. The Appellant appealed, but for reasons of his own elected to have  the
    matter dealt with on the papers alone.



The decision of the judge

 7. The judge found that the Appellant's case failed under the Rules.  This
    was because specified evidence on the financial  requirements  had  not
    been submitted with  the  application.  Additional  evidence  had  been
    submitted with the appeal, but it was stated that this was inadmissible
    (paragraph 6). It was found that in fact the  combined  income  of  the
    Appellant and his wife exceeded the relevant threshold of ï¿½18,600 gross
    per annum (paragraphs 6-7).




 8. The judge went on and considered the case  outside  of  the  Rules.  In
    paragraph 7 he took account of the following matters: the  couple  were
    expecting a baby soon after his decision was being made; the length  of
    time spent by the Appellant in the United Kingdom; his wife's  lifelong
    residence here; and the satisfaction of the relevant income  threshold.
    Having done this, the judge proceeded to allow the appeal on Article  8
    grounds.



The grounds of appeal

 9. In essence the Respondent's grounds assert that  the  judge  failed  to
    take account of mandatory factors in section 117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and  failed  to  take  other  relevant
    matters into account such as whether the family life could  be  enjoyed
    in Nigeria.



The hearing before us

10. Although it is of course the Respondent's appeal, we initially asked Mr
    Habtemariam whether or not he accepted that the judge had erred in  his
    approach to Article 8 outside of the Rules. In  particular,  we  raised
    the issue of whether the possibility of the Appellant making  an  entry
    clearance application from Nigeria should  have  been  expressly  dealt
    with by the judge. After some reflection, he accepted that  there  were
    errors in the decision. However,  he  submitted  that  these  were  not
    material to the outcome, given the factors considered in paragraph 7 of
    the decision. There was no suggestion  from  Mr  Habtemariam  that  the
    judge was wrong to have dismissed the appeal under the Rules.




11. Mr Nath submitted that the relevant factors of the public  interest  in
    section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act, the possibility of the wife  returning
    to Nigeria, and whether an entry clearance application should  be  made
    were all overlooked by the judge.



Decision on error of law


12. We find that the judge has materially erred in law in his  approach  to
    and consideration of the Article 8 claim.



13. First and foremost, the judge failed to make any  findings  in  respect
    of, or give any consideration to the issue of whether,  given  that  he
    did not meet the Rules, the Appellant should have returned  to  Nigeria
    and make an  entry  clearance  application  from  there.  This  was  an
    obviously relevant matter to have  dealt  with  in  a  case  concerning
    Article 8 outside of the Rules. The fact that it  is  not  one  of  the
    mandatory factors set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act is beside the
    point: those factors do not represent an exhaustive list.

14. Second, the relevant matter of whether the Appellant's wife could  have
    returned to Nigeria is not dealt with at all by the judge. Again,  this
    is a factor that should, in all but a few cases, be considered  by  the
    Tribunal, particularly when it is expressly raised by the Respondent.



15. Both of these failures are material to the outcome of  the  appeal.  It
    simply cannot be said that  the  appeal  was  bound  to  succeed  under
    Article 8 on any view of the facts.



16. We therefore set aside the decision of the judge.



The re-make decision

17. We considered it entirely appropriate to go on and re-make the decision
    in light of the evidence before us. There was no  dispute  from  either
    representative as to this course of action.




18. The essential factual background to  this  appeal  has  never  been  in
    dispute. With this in mind, we raised  the  issue  that  the  Appellant
    appeared to have acquired in excess of ten years  lawful  residence  in
    the United Kingdom since arriving here in January 2005. Thus, Paragraph
    276B(i) of the Rules would be applicable to his case.



19. Mr Nath confirmed that there was no  suggestion  of  any  gaps  in  the
    Appellant's leave over the years.



20. On the evidence before us, and in light of the  Respondent's  position,
    we find as a fact that the Appellant arrived in the United  Kingdom  on
    26 January 2005 and has remained  here  ever  since  with  leave  as  a
    student. His last application to the Respondent was made in-time and so
    his leave has been statutorily extended since 3 August 2014.



21. There is no suggestion that the Appellant's residence in  this  country
    has been anything other than continuous, and we find  that  it  has  in
    fact been so.



22. It follows that the Appellant acquired ten  years  continuous  lawfully
    residence in the United Kingdom as at 26 January  2015,  and  that  his
    residence thereafter has remained lawful. In turn, Paragraph 276B(i) of
    the Rules has been satisfied.



23. The Respondent has not at  any  stage  considered  the  application  of
    Paragraph 276B(i) to the Appellant's circumstances. On this  basis,  we
    conclude that the Respondent's decision is not otherwise in  accordance
    with the law. Mr Nath accepted this to be the case.



24. Having found that Paragraph 276B(i) is  satisfied,  there  remains  the
    exercise of discretion under Paragraph 276B(ii). As this  has  not  yet
    been considered by the Respondent,  we  are  unable  to  undertake  the
    operation ourselves.



25. In reaching a decision on the 'public interest proviso', the Respondent
    will no doubt take into account the unchallenged evidence of a  genuine
    and subsisting marriage to a British citizen, the  presence  now  of  a
    British citizen child (born  in  late  February  this  year),  and  the
    absence (as far as we can detect) of any misconduct  by  the  Appellant
    whilst in this country.



26. The Appellant would be well-advised  to  submit  any  further  relevant
    evidence to the  Respondent  as  quickly  as  possible,  including  any
    information relating to sub-paragraph (iv) of Paragraph 276B.


Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We re-make the decision by  allowing  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
Respondent's decision was not otherwise in  accordance  with  the  law,  and
that the Appellant's application therefore remains  outstanding  before  the
Respondent awaiting a lawful decision.


Signed                                       Date: 13 July 2015

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  no
fee award. The basis upon which the appeal has  been  allowed  is  different
from that put forward in the initial application. The First-tier  Judge  was
not assisted by the fact that the appeal was to be  decided  on  the  papers
alone. The matter has had to come to an oral hearing before us in order  for
the Appellant to succeed.


Signed                                       Date: 13 July 2015
