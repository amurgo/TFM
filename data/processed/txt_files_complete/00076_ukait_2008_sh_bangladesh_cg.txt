Representation
For the appellant: Mr S Jaisri of Counsel instructed by  Dexter  Montague  &
    Partners
For the respondent: Ms R Brown, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. Prison conditions in Bangladesh, at least for ordinary prisoners, do  not
violate Article 3 ECHR.

 2. This conclusion does not mean that an individual  who  faces  prison  on
return to Bangladesh can never succeed in showing a violation of  Article  3
in the particular circumstances of his case. The individual  facts  of  each
case should be considered  to  determine  whether  detention  will  cause  a
particular individual in his particular circumstances  to  suffer  treatment
contrary to Article 3.

3. In view of the significant  changes  in  Bangladesh  politics  in  recent
years, AA(Bihari-Camps) Bangladesh CG [2002] UKIAT  01995,  H  (Fair  Trial)
Bangladesh CG [2002] UKIAT 05410 and GA (Risk-Bihari) Bangladesh  CG  [2002]
UKIAT 05810 are now removed from the list of AIT country guidance cases.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on  19  October  1977.  He
entered the United Kingdom illegally on 14  May  1998  and  claimed  asylum.
The basis of his claim was that he feared return to  Bangladesh  because  of
his involvement with the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) which  had  led  to
members of the rival Awami League  laying  false  charges  against  him  and
other BNP members. One set of charges related to a  fight  between  BNP  and
Awami League supporters which had taken place in June  1996.   He  had  left
Bangladesh in April 1998 but in August 1998 had been convicted  in  absentia
and sentenced to seven years imprisonment in respect of these  charges.  The
second set of charges related to a similar fracas in  September  or  October
of 1997; however these had been dismissed or  discontinued  before  he  left
Bangladesh. The appellant said that the police had been  searching  for  him
in order to arrest him, that he considered the charges against him had  been
politically motivated and that upon return he would be arrested  and  forced
to serve his seven years jail sentence even though the charges  against  him
were false.

 2. On 9 April 2000 the respondent decided to remove  the  appellant  as  an
illegal entrant and certified his claim. On 28 January 2003 an  Adjudicator,
Mr Blandy (hereafter "the first  Adjudicator"),  dismissed  his  appeal  and
upheld the certificate. There was no further  appeal.   The  appellant  then
made a human rights claim. On 12 March 2004 the respondent  issued  a  human
rights refusal letter. The  appellant's  appeal  against  that  refusal  was
dismissed by  an  Adjudicator,  Mrs  F  M  Kempton  (hereafter  "the  second
Adjudicator"), on 14 September 2004. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by
the Immigration Appeal Tribunal on  25  February  2005.  By  reason  of  the
changes in the appellate regime, the  matter  came  before  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal as a reconsideration. In a  determination  notified  on
22 June 2006 a panel comprising Immigration Judge Grimmett, Mr M E  A  Innes
and Mrs A J F Cross de Chavannes decided that  the  second  Adjudicator  had
not materially erred in law. Subsequently,  however,  a  Senior  Immigration
Judge granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. That resulted  in
a Consent Order dated 2 January 2007. The accompanying Statement of  Reasons
accepted that the second Adjudicator (Mrs Kempton) had failed  to  give  any
reasons for her conclusion that the appellant would  not  be  imprisoned  in
Bangladesh and that the Tribunal was "obliged to consider prison  conditions
in Bangladesh in the context of Article 3 of the ECHR and determine  whether
it would be a breach of the United Kingdom's obligations under that  article
to return the appellant" (para 4). At para 5 of this Statement it  was  said
that:

    "...it is agreed that...the AIT will have  to  conduct  an  assessment,
    including a consideration of any relevant country  guidance  decisions,
    of whether the prison conditions in which the Appellant would be placed
    would give rise to a risk of Article 3 ill-treatment, should it find on
    reconsideration that there  is  a  relevant  risk  of  the  Appellant's
    imprisonment on return to Bangladesh."

3. Although there is a tension between para 4 and the  conditional  form  of
paragraph 5 of this Statement, the parties agreed with us  that  essentially
we were to conduct a second-stage reconsideration confined  to  two  issues:
(1) whether there was a  real  risk  that  upon  return  to  Bangladesh  the
appellant would be imprisoned as someone  who  had  been  convicted  in  his
absence and sentenced to seven  years  imprisonment;  and  (2)  whether  his
imprisonment would expose him to conditions contrary to  Article  3  of  the
ECHR. (Strictly speaking we also need to consider whether  his  imprisonment
would expose him to conditions which would amount to  serious  harm  and  so
qualify the appellant for humanitarian protection under para 339C  of  HC395
as amended; but, even leaving aside the issue of whether if  accepted  as  a
mere fugitive from justice he would be subject to the  exclusion  provisions
of para 339D in any event,  para 339C(iii) is based directly  on  Article  3
of the ECHR and we consider that our answer, at least  to  the  question  of
whether the appellant meets the requirements of  this  subparagraph,  stands
or falls with our answer to the Article 3 question. )

4. The parties also agreed with us that we  should  take  as  our  starting-
point the findings of fact of the  first  Adjudicator,  in  accordance  with
Devaseelan  [2003]  Imm  AR  1  principles.  The  first  Adjudicator  (whose
decision was not the subject of an appeal) accepted that the  appellant  was
a member of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP),  was  involved  in  student
politics and was against the Awami League. He was  not  satisfied  that  the
appellant had been persecuted by the Awami League  and  considered  that  in
any event there would be no risk to the appellant from  that  group  now  as
the BNP were (at the point in time of his hearing of the case) in  power  in
Bangladesh. He did not accept that the police investigation or the  criminal
court  proceedings  against  the  Appellant  were   politically   motivated.
However, he did accept that the  documents  in  the  appellant's  case  were
genuine. At para 6.4 he stated:

    "I accept that the documents relating to the Applicant's involvement in
    the first case are genuine. It is quite clear that  evidence  has  been
    considered by the court in Bangladesh and I am not prepared  to  accept
    the Applicant's account of what happened at face value. I do  not  find
    it credible that if he had genuinely being the victim of an  attack  by
    the Awami League supporters that  he  would  have  been  convicted  and
    sentenced to seven years imprisonment. It appears to me  to  be  likely
    that the Applicant left Bangladesh when it became clear to him that the
    outcome of the case was going to result in a term of  imprisonment.  He
    is quite clearly simply fleeing justice. He conceded at the  conclusion
    of his cross-examination that the only reason he  had  left  Bangladesh
    was to avoid serving the sentence of imprisonment."

5. As was noted in previous proceedings, the above passage  is  not  crystal
clear. The second sentence taken on its own could be read as a rejection  of
the appellant's claim that he had been  convicted  and  sentenced  to  seven
years'  imprisonment.  However,  the  parties  are  agreed  (the  respondent
crucially) that read as a whole the  Adjudicator's  determination  shows  an
acceptance of the fact that the appellant was  convicted  and  sentenced  to
seven years' imprisonment on the basis of the particulars  set  out  in  the
documents he submitted. Both parties were also agreed that  whether  or  not
either or both the first and second  Adjudicator  should  be  considered  as
having addressed the issue of  prison  conditions  correctly  in  law,  that
issue was now entirely one for us, applying the law correctly and  examining
the facts relating to prison conditions in Bangladesh currently.

The background evidence
6. We list the background materials  that  were  before  us  in  a  separate
Appendix, but note that these included the COIS Report of  31  August  2007,
the OGN for December 2007, the Human Rights Watch report for  January  2008,
the Amnesty International Report  for  2008  and  the  US  State  Department
Report dated 11 March 2008.

The expert's reports
7. The evidence for this case also included  two  reports  from  an  expert,
Professor Andrew Coyle dated May 2007 and June 2008 respectively.  Mr  Coyle
is Professor of Prison  Studies  in  the  International  Centre  for  Prison
Studies, King's College, University of London. A former prison governor,  he
acts frequently as an adviser on prison issues to  intergovernmental  bodies
such as the UN and the Council of Europe. He  has  visited  and  advised  on
prison systems in over 50 countries in all regions  of  the  world.  He  has
published widely on prison and criminal  justice  issues.  Although  he  has
visited prison systems in  several  countries  in  South  Asia  he  has  not
visited any prisons in Bangladesh; his reports, he explains,  are  based  on
published  documents  from  official  and  other  sources   describing   and
commenting on prison conditions in Bangladesh. His 2007 report  states  that
conditions of detention in Bangladesh have been  a  cause  of  national  and
international concern for some time. According to  the  World  Prison  Brief
Online its prison system is the seventh most overcrowded in the  world.   As
at February or March 2007 the total  prison  population  was  79,000  spread
across 66 prisons. The existing prison population as of November 1 2007  was
82,254, between 15 and 20 percent higher than at the same time in 2006.

8. Professor Coyle describes a  report  from  Bangladesh  News  published  1
February 2008 as stating that as few as 16 doctors were  on  hand  to  treat
about 86,000 inmates in the country's 67 jails. The  majority  of  prisoners
(55% overall) were  "undertrials"  (persons  awaiting  trial).  Recreational
opportunities were extremely limited and  the  Munim  Commission  Report  on
Jails 1980 had described the regime  as  one  of  "enforced  idleness".  The
mission sponsored by the United Nations Development Project  (UNDP)  in  its
unpublished 2005 report found that medical services  provided  to  prisoners
were inadequate and the prison system  had  a  shortage  of  medical  staff.
Deficiencies had been found in provisions for hygiene  and  sanitation.  The
US State Department report vouchsafed that in  general  the  government  did
not permit prison visits by independent human rights  monitors;  government-
appointed committees of prominent private citizens in each  prison  locality
monitored prisons monthly but did not release their findings.  Prison  staff
lacked motivation and professionalism. Access to legal assistance  was  very
limited. The conclusion of  Professor  Coyle's  May  2007  report  was  that
conditions in prisons in Bangladesh  fell  far  short  of  the  UN  Standard
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (UN Standard Minimum Rules  for
the Treatment of Prisoners (663/c(XXIV) 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII)  of  13
May 1977)). They also violated Article 10 of the International  Covenant  on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) ("All persons deprived of  their  liberty
shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity  of
the human person") and also breached Article 3  of  the  ECHR  in  terms  of
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

9. Professor's Coyle June 2008 update notes  that  the  World  Prison  Brief
Online now listed the  total  prison  population  of  Bangladesh  as  86,000
spread across 66 jails, with an occupancy level of  315.6%  (which  compared
with 277% in 2005). His update cites the  March  2008  US  State  Department
report as describing prison conditions in Bangladesh as  remaining  "abysmal
due to overcrowding and lack of proper sanitation".   His  update  concluded
that there was no  indication  that  prison  conditions  in  Bangladesh  had
improved in the last year: "Based on the  new  information  provided  above,
one might conclude that they have continued to deteriorate".

The Home Office Operational Guidance Note December 2007
10. Counterposed to Professor Coyle's assessment, the OGN on Bangladesh  for
December 2007 states that:

    "While prison conditions in Bangladesh are poor  with  overcrowding  in
    some establishments being a particular problem, conditions are unlikely
    to reach the Article 3 threshold. Therefore, even where applicants  can
    demonstrate a real risk of imprisonment on return to Bangladesh a grant
    of Humanitarian Protection will not generally be appropriate.  However,
    the individual facts of each case should  be  considered  to  determine
    whether detention will cause a particular individual in his  particular
    circumstances to suffer  treatment  contrary  to  Article  3,  relevant
    factors being the likely  length  of  detention,  the  likely  type  of
    detention facility and the individual's age and state of health.  Where
    in an individual case treatment does reach the Article  3  threshold  a
    grant of Humanitarian Protection will be appropriate."

Submissions
11. Before us Mr Jaisri submitted  on  the  first  issue  that  it  remained
reasonably likely that the appellant  would  be  arrested  and  required  to
serve his sentence on return. That was supported by  the  2004  letter  from
the appellant's advocate which confirmed that  the  arrest  warrant  against
the appellant was still outstanding. Further, the  evidence  indicated  that
under Bangladesh law it was not possible for the  appellant  to  take  legal
steps to quash his convictions until he arrived back in the  country.  Given
that  he  had  absconded,  any  kind  of  bail  pending  an  appeal  against
conviction  and/or  sentence  would  be  unlikely.  Ms  Brown  referred   to
Bangladesh penal provisions  showing  that  appeal  against  conviction  and
sentence was possible and pointed out that as the appellant already  had  an
advocate acting for him he would have access to appeal processes.  Ms  Brown
submitted that although  there  was  little  assistance  in  the  background
evidence as to whether the appellant's sentence would  be  carried  out,  it
was important to note that the incident was now over 12 years ago, it  arose
from a dispute between rival political factions  who  were  now  in  a  very
different position in terms of power and office in Bangladesh.  There  would
be no continuing state interest in enforcing a  punishment  arising  out  of
charges pressed by Awami League supporters years ago.

12. As regards the second issue, which only arose  on  the  assumption  that
the Tribunal was satisfied the appellant would  face  having  to  serve  his
sentence, Mr Jaisri submitted  that  the  prison  conditions  the  appellant
would face whilst serving  his  sentence  would  violate  his  rights  under
Article 3 ECHR not to be subjected to a real risk of torture or  inhuman  or
degrading  treatment  or  punishment.  In  assessing  these  conditions  the
Tribunal should apply the law as set out in Iqbal  [2002]  UKIAT  02239,  TV
(Ukraine Prison conditions) [2004] UKAIT 00222, Harari [2003] EWCA Civ  807,
Batayav [2003]  EWCA  Civ  1489,  ZB  (Russian  prison  conditions)  Russian
Federation CG [2004] UKIAT  00239,  Batayav  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  366  and  PS
(prison conditions; military service) Ukraine CG  [2006]  UKAIT  00016.  The
expert's reports, which drew on primary research conducted by the  UNDP  and
the EU Commission, detailed numerous respects in which prison conditions  in
Bangladesh failed to comply with the UN Standard Minimum Rules.  The  levels
of overcrowding were contrary to Rules 9(1) and  10.  The  levels  currently
stood at over three times the acceptable level (315.6%). Contrary  to  Rules
16, 21, 71, 72 and 77, there were no provisions for prisoners  to  work  and
be actively employed during the day; on the  contrary  there  was  "enforced
idleness" and a "warehousing" approach. Contrary to Rule 77,  education  and
recreation were not afforded. Contrary to  Rule  20,  food  was  not  up  to
standard.  Sanitary  and  sewage  facilities  did   not   conform   to   the
requirements  at  Rule  134  relating  to  health,  personal   hygiene   and
sanitation. Rules relating  to  medical  facilities  and  qualified  medical
officers (Rules 16(6), 22 and 66) were not met. Nor were rules  relating  to
prison  staff  (Rules  121,123,139).  The  use  of  handcuffs  as  "fetters"
violated Rules 33 and 136. Breaches of these Rules could only  be  described
as both "consistent", "gross" and "systematic". A  recent  increase  in  the
number  of  detention  facilities  in  no  way  obviated   the   levels   of
overcrowding. There was a lack of independent monitoring.  Further,  Amnesty
International had found that the use of torture was  "routine".   Conditions
of detention are inhumane and degrading regardless of a country's  level  of
development (an earlier written submission had referred in  this  regard  to
the    Human    Rights    Committee    case    of    Mukong    v    Cameroon
(CPPR/C/51/d/458/1991),  the  case  of   Neptune   v   Trinidad   &   Tobago
(CCPR.C.57.D.523.1992) (which found that cramped and  unsanitary  conditions
contravened Article 10 of  the  ICCPR)  and  the  same  Committee's  General
Comment  21).  Taking  a  line  through  ECtHR  cases  dealing  with  prison
conditions,  in  particular  Kalashnikov  v  Russia   [2002]  ECHR  596  and
Valasinas v Lithuania (2001) 12 BHRC  266,  it  was  plain  that  Bangladesh
prison conditions also violated Article 3. It had also to be borne in  mind,
when assessing the severity of the harm, that the appellant faced  a  likely
period of up to seven years imprisonment.

13. Ms Brown's position on the second issue was that the  UN  Minimum  Rules
were  aspirational  and  did  not  seek  to  establish  basic  legal  norms.
Kalashnikov was not an expulsion case and the Russian Government had  indeed
accepted that its prisons breached Article 3 ECHR standards at the  relevant
time. The prison conditions which had led the Court  to  find  a  breach  of
Article 3 in the Kalashnikov case were plainly worse  than  those  obtaining
in Bangladesh in a number of  respects:  in  Kalashnikov  prisoners  had  to
sleep in shifts, their cells were infested by pests, smoking  was  permitted
despite there being no ventilation; they  were  made  to  share  cells  with
persons suffering from diseases such as TB and syphilis. Not  only  was  the
legal test as set out  in  cases  such  as  Harari  and  Batayav  one  which
required a "consistent pattern" of gross and systematic violations of  basic
human rights to be shown, but it had to be shown that such  conditions  "are
universal, or very likely to  be  encountered  by  anyone  who  enters  that
system" (Batayav [2005],  para 5).  So far as the expert's reports  prepared
for this case were concerned, it had to be borne in mind  that  he  had  not
visited prisons in Bangladesh and the sources he  relied  on  were  in  some
respects unclear: he referred to "unpublished reports" from the UNDP and  EU
Commission. Neither report appears to have involved visits to  more  than  a
handful of prisons (two or four  out  of  67).  There  was  clearly  serious
overcrowding  but  in  the  2002  case  of  Chowdhury  [2002]  UKIAT  00054,
Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  Vice  President  Drabu   had   not   regarded
overcrowding as being contrary to Article  3  and  the  latest  COIS  report
referred to the prison population as having dropped  somewhat  (to  86,000).
The  latest  US  State  Department  Report   referred   to   several   major
improvements. Going by the news  article  dated  February  2008  there  were
sufficient qualified medical staff on hand  in  prison,  indeed  there  were
more per prisoner than there were doctors in the general  population.  There
was evidence of a firm government commitment to  improve  prison  conditions
by building new prisons with modern facilities.  The  number  of  deaths  in
prison had fallen and was significantly lower than  figures  for  deaths  in
police custody. Comparison with the situation with Russian  prisons  at  the
time of the Kalashnikov case was instructive: there the rate  of  deaths  in
prison was around 11 in every thousand (10,000-11,000 deaths per year  in  a
prison population of 1 million) whereas in Bangladesh it was less  than  one
in a 1, 000 (87 deaths per year in a prison population of 86,000).  Even  in
the UK almost 600  persons  died  in  custody  per  year  out  of  a  prison
population of 83, 243.  The COIS at para 15.03  referred  to  the  calorific
content of  prison  food  as  being  satisfactory.  Although  there  was  no
provision for international (e.g.  ICRC)  monitoring  of  Bangladesh  prison
conditions,  there  was  evidence  of   monitoring   undertaken   by   local
organisations. By contrast to the Ukraine prison  cases  before  the  ECtHR,
the use of violence  and  torture  in  detention  was  largely  confined  to
police, not prison, custody.


The first issue
14. We have not found it easy to resolve the  first  issue,  namely  whether
there is a real risk that upon return to Bangladesh the appellant  would  be
imprisoned as someone who had been convicted in his  absence  and  sentenced
to  seven  years  imprisonment.  Had  we  been  tasked  with  deciding   the
appellant's appeal at first instance we would have had to consider a  number
of matters for ourselves including whether we accepted that the  appellant's
documentation was genuine  and  whether  he  had  in  fact  been  tried  and
convicted in absentia. We are surprised that  if  the  appellant's  advocate
was able to write to him in 2004 with some information, he  could  not  have
furnished documentary evidence to verify that the appellant had  been  tried
and convicted in absentia. Be that as it may, we are not so  tasked  and  we
accept that in accordance with Devaseelan  principles  we  should  take  the
first Adjudicator's findings of fact  as  our  starting-point.  Further,  we
accept that we have very little in terms of fresh  evidence  before  us  and
insufficient basis, therefore, for declining to accept as genuine  the  2004
letter from the appellant's advocate.

15. Basing ourselves on the first Adjudicator's  findings  seems  to  us  to
remove one of the possible reasons to doubt that the appellant would face  a
real risk of imprisonment on return. Had it been accepted that  the  charges
against him were politically motivated, that would have made  it  much  more
likely, given that the BNP is no longer purely an opposition party  and  the
Bangladesh courts  are  clearly  experienced  in  dealing  with  politically
motivated charges, that on return he would be able  in  a  relatively  short
time to have his conviction quashed and his sentence suspended or  at  least
reduced. But that was not accepted by the first Adjudicator. So far  as  the
first Adjudicator was concerned (and so far as we  too  are  concerned)  the
appellant is a mere fugitive from justice.

16. But as a mere fugitive from justice the appellant is reasonably  likely,
in our judgement, to face the ordinary course  of  the  law  of  Bangladesh,
namely that he is someone who upon return would face arrest and  would  then
be required to serve at most a period of  seven years imprisonment to  which
he had been sentenced in absentia. We hold significant doubts that he  would
in fact have to serve seven years. An article from ABC News  dated  16  June
2008 quoted National Prisons Chief Brigadier Zakir Hassan  as  stating  that
"We  have  made  a  list  of  criminals  who  have  served  half  of   their
terms...They would be freed after their cases  are  scrutinised  by  police,
magistrates and prison officials". The article goes on to explain that  this
move "comes as the country's National Police Chief Nur Mohammad  said  about
25,000 people had been detained  since  28  May  as  part  of  a  nationwide
crackdown on criminals ahead of elections scheduled for December."  However,
as the reason given at this point in time for  freeing  criminals  who  have
served half their terms is one  of  political  contingency,  taken  together
with the absence  of  evidence  from  either  party  regarding  patterns  of
remission of sentence in Bangladesh  provided  for  in  Bangladesh  law  and
practice, we are prepared to accept that  the  period  of  imprisonment  the
appellant would serve would be up to  seven  years.  Given  that  the  first
Adjudicator did not accept the appellant's claims that  his  conviction  and
sentencing had a political dimension, we must  exercise  caution  in  taking
into account his own  evidence  that  his  co-defendants  had  earlier  been
convicted and sentenced and had served their  sentence.  Nonetheless,  since
the first Adjudicator appears to have accepted at least the  fact  that  his
co-defendants had been convicted and  undergone  imprisonment,  we  consider
that this is a further indication that the  Bangladesh  legal  system  would
have an interest in making sure the appellant was not treated differently.

The second issue

The general background situation
17. Before turning to consider directly the  second  issue  (namely  whether
the appellant's imprisonment would expose  him  to  conditions  contrary  to
Article  3  of  the  ECHR),  we  remind  ourselves  of  course  that  prison
conditions in a country do not exist in a socio-political  vacuum.  In  that
regard it is important to bear in mind that the situation in  Bangladesh  as
a whole in the past two years has become a cause for concern from the  point
of view of human rights monitors.  Drawing  on  the  major  country  reports
placed before us, matters can be summarised  thus.  In  2006,  Khaleda  Zia,
head of the BNP, stepped down as prime minister when her five-year  term  of
office expired and transferred power to  a  caretaker  government  ahead  of
scheduled elections. However, President Iajuddin Ahmed, the  head  of  state
and then head of the caretaker government, declared  a  state  of  emergency
and postponed the elections. As part of its "minus two" policy  of  removing
the leaders of  the  two  main  parties  from  the  political  process,  the
government arrested former prime  ministers  Khaleda  Zia  of  the  BNP  and
Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League. With the support of the  military
President Ahmed then appointed a new caretaker government led by  Fakhruddin
Ahmed. In July 2007 he announced that elections would be held by the end  of
2008,  after  the  implementation  of  electoral,  political  and   judicial
reforms. The Emergency Powers Rules of 2007 (EPR) imposed by the  government
in January 2007 has led to the suspension of many fundamental human  rights.
In  2007  the  government  detained  around  200  high-ranking  politicians,
businessmen and officials  as  part  of  its  anticorruption  campaign.  The
government formed the  Joint  Forces,  composed  of  police,  the  RAB  -  a
paramilitary group composed of  personnel  from  different  law  enforcement
agencies - and military and other security agencies  and  gave  the  special
new team responsibility for enforcing the state  of  emergency.  Whilst  the
government is  acknowledged  to  have  taken  significant  steps  to  combat
corruption  amongst  the  police,   preventive  and   arbitrary   detentions
increased after the declaration of the state of  emergency.  The  government
was reported to have arrested more than 300,000 persons between January  and
August 2007 and a further 12,000 since May 28, 2008. Overall around  500,000
persons are said to have been arrested since January 2007.

18.  In cases not affiliated with the state of emergency  or  anticorruption
drive, arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detention  remained  a  problem.  Fair
trial safeguards have been weakened by  the  use  of  Special  Courts  which
impose tight restrictions on  defendants'  access  to  lawyers  and  by  the
denial of bail to defendants charged under emergency regulations.  For  most
of  2007  the  government  banned  political  activities.  Although  figures
dropped, extra-judicial killings have continued, with  the  security  forces
accused of custodial deaths, arbitrary arrests and detention and  harassment
of journalists. In  2007  the  RAB  was  said  to  have  killed  94  people.
Government enforcement officials overall were said  to  be  responsible  for
some 184 deaths.  79 deaths were said  to  be  politically  motivated.   The
RAB, military and police frequently  inflicted  ill  treatment  as  well  as
psychological abuse during arrests and interrogations.  Human  Rights  Watch
states  that  torture  in  custody  continues  to  be   "routine".   Amnesty
International's report notes that the government  took  steps  to  implement
the Supreme Court's 1999 ruling requiring separation of the  judiciary  from
the executive, with effect from 1 November 2007; however, reports  indicated
that executive magistrates retained some judicial powers.

The expert evidence
19. Before proceeding to give our view on  the  second  issue,  it  is  also
salient that we set out our evaluation  of  the  expert  witness,  Professor
Coyle. We agree with Ms Brown that the fact that he does not have any first-
hand observational knowledge of conditions in Bangladesh prisons means  that
his assessment does  not  carry  as  much  weight  as  might,  for  example,
assessment based  on  first-hand  monitoring  undertaken  by  a  UN  Special
Rapporteur or the ICRC. That said, the  fact  that  he  is  an  acknowledged
expert on prison conditions who has visited prisons in over 50 countries  in
all regions of the world lends weight to his opinion, since  he  is  plainly
aware of the different  dimensions  to  the  problem  of  evaluating  prison
conditions in foreign countries.

20. Nevertheless, certain features of his reports troubled  us.   It  seemed
odd that in making his point about lack of recreation provisions in present-
day Bangladesh, he should cite without comment  from  what  was  said  by  a
senior Bangladesh judge  in  a  report  as  long  ago  as  1980  (the  Munim
Commission Report 1980). Like Ms Brown we were also troubled by the  failure
of his reports to either append or clarify the precise scope  and  remit  of
the two reports to which he makes reference, that by the UNDP  and  that  by
the EU Commission. Further, going by his own accounts  of  them  it  appears
that neither was based on visits to more than two to four prisons out of  67
in the country. Further, neither of these  reports  was  up  to  date:  both
appear to have been written in 2005. As we have seen, Professor Coyle's  May
2007 report concluded  that  prison  conditions  in  Bangladesh  contravened
Article 3 of the ECHR. Whilst in reaching that conclusion he made  reference
to the case law  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  (the  case  of
Kalashnikov) he does not provide any analysis or  reasoning  as  to  how  he
reached that conclusion, nor does he appear to be aware that in no  case  in
which Strasbourg has found  prison  conditions  to  violate  Article  3  has
overcrowding been  seen  as  sufficient  on  its  own  to  give  rise  to  a
violation; rather it has been the co-existence of  overcrowding  with  other
significant exacerbating circumstances: see  below,  paras  32,  52.  To  be
fair, Professor Coyle does not purport to have any legal  expertise  in  how
Article 3 of the ECHR is to be applied in  relation  to  prison  conditions,
whether in a domestic or a refoulement  context.  But  his  assessment  that
prison conditions in Bangladesh violate  Article  3  norms,  albeit  heavily
relied on by Mr Jaisri, is difficult to square with the criteria he in  fact
utilises. Despite his reference to Article 3 EHCR standards not  being  met,
it seems to us that in practice the benchmarks he  applies  in  his  reports
are not Article 3 benchmarks but rather those of  the  UN  Standard  Minimum
Rules and the UN General Assembly Body of Principles for the  Protection  of
All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment  and  several  other
non-treaty international  instruments.  We  explain  below  why  we  do  not
consider the UN benchmarks can be equated with Article  3  ECHR  norms:  see
below para  52.

 21. In the light of these considerations it seems  to  us  that  whilst  we
should attach significant weight to Professor Coyle's two reports we  should
take care to read them in the light of what we can glean  from  more  recent
country reports, in particular the  US  State  Department  Report  of  March
2008. We remind ourselves also that the issue of whether returning a  person
to prison conditions in Bangladesh would be contrary to Article  3  ECHR  is
one which is a matter for this Tribunal  basing  itself  on  relevant  legal
principles and considering the evidence as a whole.

Tribunal country guidance
22. As already noted, the Statement  of  Reasons  sealed  by  the  Court  of
Appeal Consent Order envisaged that our assessment of prison  conditions  in
Bangladesh would cover, inter alia, "consideration of any  relevant  country
guidance decisions". However, in point of  fact  there  are  only  three  CG
cases on Bangladesh: AA (Bihari-Camps) Bangladesh CG [2002] UKIAT  01995,  H
(Fair  Trial)  Bangladesh  CG  [2002]  UKIAT  05410  and  GA   (Risk-Bihari)
Bangladesh CG [2002] UKIAT 05810. None of these has any real bearing on  the
subject of prison conditions.  It is also fair to say, in the light  of  the
numerous political changes that have taken place in Bangladesh in  the  last
few  years,  that  none  of  them  has  any  continuing  real   utility   in
interpreting current conditions. There  is  a  previous  reported  case,  of
Chowdhury [2002] UKIAT 00054, to which reference has already been  made.  It
is helpful as an historical  assessment,  but  plainly  cannot  assist  with
assessment of current-day prison conditions.

23 . So far as the facts  are  concerned,  it  is  important  to  note  that
although the second issue the Court of Appeal has asked us to decide   is  a
general one  -  whether  there  is  evidence  of  a  consistent  pattern  of
violations of the human rights of prisoners in Bangladesh, such that  anyone
facing prison in Bangladesh would face a  real  risk  of  being  exposed  to
conditions contrary to Article 3 ECHR -  this appeal is about the  appellant
only and so there are some significant specific features  of  his  situation
which we shall need in due course to  consider  also.  We  mention  at  this
stage, however, that it was agreed by Mr Jaisri that the  appellant  has  no
special circumstances relating to his age,  health  or  physical  or  mental
abilities that require us to differentiate his likely  situation  from  that
faced by the generality of prisoners in Bangladesh. He  also  accepted  that
it is part of  the  agreed  facts  that  this  appellant  has  no  political
profile. That is to say, he faces return in order to serve a  punishment  as
a convicted prisoner; he is not (unlike the majority of those in  prison  in
Bangladesh currently) someone awaiting  trial.  This  latter  feature  means
that in this case we are not principally concerned with the  evidence  noted
in the background evidence about the treatment of political prisoners  (e.g.
Professor Coyle's note at  para  23  of  his  2007  report  that  opposition
parties and human rights  monitors  claimed  the  government  arrested  many
political activists and convicted them on  unfounded  criminal  charges  and
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International references to  torture  against
such persons being routine or systematic). Nor are  we  concerned  with  the
treatment of those held in police or security forces' custody. And the  fact
that, as Professor Coyle notes a large percentage of  those  awaiting  trial
do not have access to legal assistance, is not relevant to  the  appellant's
case, since he is a convicted prisoner and also one who  has  been  able  to
obtain access to legal assistance,  before  and  after  his  departure  from
Bangladesh. On the other side of the scale, there is  one  specific  feature
of the appellant's case that might be said to make his position  worse  than
an ordinary member of the class of prisoners in Bangladesh. In his case,  we
have to take into account that  what  he  faces  is  not  a  short  term  of
imprisonment but a term in jail of up to seven years.

24. So far as the law is concerned, whilst the representatives  appeared  in
agreement as to what the correct approach is (for  deciding  the  extent  of
risk to a broad class of persons, namely ordinary prisoners  in  Bangladesh)
we need to emphasise that the test as set out in Harari has to  be  read  in
the light of subsequent Court of Appeal authority, that of Batayav [2003]  ,
Batayav [2005] and the "generally or consistently  happening"  test  set  as
approved in AA (Zimbabwe) [2007] EWCA Civ 149,  paras  21-23.  In  our  view
this test is broadly similar to that applied by the  Strasbourg  Court:  see
NA v UK, App.No. 25904/07, judgment, 17 July 2008 paras 116-117.

25. It is also important to bear in mind that it is  well-settled  that  the
Article 3 threshold is a high one. The fact that there is a  high  threshold
is of particular importance when it comes to  evaluating  the  relevance  of
the extent to which prison conditions in any particular country  measure  up
to the yardstick established by the UN Standard  Minimum  Rules  or  by  the
Body of Principles for the Protection of  All  Persons  under  Any  Form  of
Detention or Imprisonment (adopted  by  the  General  Assembly  in  December
1988). These Rules and principles do not contain a set of  peremptory  norms
(indeed some concern not what  is  expected  of  governments,  but  what  is
expected of prisoners, see for example Rule 15 of the  UN  Standard  Minimum
Rules which requires every prisoner to "keep  their  persons  clean").  They
are described in the preamble as a set of "good  principles  and  practice".
Professor Coyle himself described them  as  among  a  number  of  non-Treaty
instruments that represent "statements of value shared by  the  major  legal
systems and cultures"... whose "moral  persuasiveness  is  beyond  dispute".
They are, as Ms Brown  highlighted,  aspirational  and  programmatic  rather
than obligatory. Further they encompass many aspects of  prison  conditions,
only some of which can be said to impinge in any important way on the  issue
of torture or inhuman or degrading  treatment.  Hence  the  strong  reliance
placed on  them  by  the  expert  and  by  Mr  Jaisri  gives  rise  to  some
difficulty. We  agree  with  Mr  Jaisri  that  by  furnishing  an  objective
framework of standards which have been the subject of UN  and  international
agreement, the UN Standard Minimum Rules and Body  of  Principles  documents
afford useful tools to help us in our assessment. At the same time, we  must
be wary of conflating  them  with  the  peremptory  norms  contained  within
Article 3 of the ECHR. It is only if prisons conditions in  Bangladesh  give
rise to a violation of the latter, that this appellant can succeed.

Strasbourg case law on prison conditions
26. Turning to consider case law on Article 3 of the ECHR  in  more  detail,
the approach taken by the ECtHR to applications from persons  alleging  that
prison conditions in High Contracting States violate Article 3 are  usefully
summarised in Ramirez Sanchez v France  App.no.  59450/00  4  July  2006  as
follows:

    "General principles
    115. Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most  fundamental
    values  of  democratic  societies.  Even  in  the  most  difficult   of
    circumstances, such as  the  fight  against  terrorism  or  crime,  the
    Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or  degrading
    treatment or punishment.
    116. In  the  modern  world  States  face  very  real  difficulties  in
    protecting their populations from terrorist violence.  However,  unlike
    most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos.
    1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no  derogation
    from it is permissible under Article 15 � 2 even  in  the  event  of  a
    public emergency threatening the life of  the  nation  (see  Labita  v.
    Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, � 119, ECHR 2000-IV; Selmouni v. France [GC],
    no. 25803/94, � 95, ECHR 1999 V; and Assenov and  Others  v.  Bulgaria,
    judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p.  3288,  �  93).  The
    Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading
    treatment or punishment, irrespective of  the  conduct  of  the  person
    concerned (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment  cited  above,  �
    79). The nature of the offence allegedly committed by the applicant  is
    therefore irrelevant for the  purposes  of  Article  3  (Indelicato  v.
    Italy, no. 31143/96, � 30, 18 October 2001).
    117. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is  to
    fall within the scope of Article 3.  The  assessment  of  this  minimum
    depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the  duration  of
    the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some  cases,  the
    sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, for instance,  Ireland
    v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, � 162).
    In assessing the evidence on which to base the decision  whether  there
    has been a violation of Article 3, the Court  adopts  the  standard  of
    proof "beyond reasonable doubt". However, such proof  may  follow  from
    the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences
    or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.
    118. The Court has considered treatment to be "inhuman" because,  inter
    alia, it was premeditated, was applied  for  hours  at  a  stretch  and
    caused either actual  bodily  injury  or  intense  physical  or  mental
    suffering. It has deemed treatment to be  "degrading"  because  it  was
    such as to  arouse  in  the  victims  feelings  of  fear,  anguish  and
    inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, among  other
    authorities, Kud?a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, � 92,  ECHR  2000-XI).
    In considering whether a punishment or treatment is "degrading"  within
    the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have  regard  to  whether  its
    object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether,  as
    far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her
    personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see,  among  other
    authorities, Raninen v. Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997,  Reports
    1997-VIII, pp. 2821-2822, � 55).  However,  the  absence  of  any  such
    purpose cannot conclusively rule  out  a  finding  of  a  violation  of
    Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95,
    � 74, ECHR 2001-III).
    119. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with  it  to  be
    "inhuman" or "degrading", the suffering or humiliation involved must in
    any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation
    connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see,
    among other authorities, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, �
    71, ECHR 1999-IX; Indelicato, cited above, � 32; Ila?cu and  Others  v.
    Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, � 428, ECHR 2004-VII; and  Lors�
    and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, � 62, 4 February 2003).
    In that connection, the Court notes that measures depriving a person of
    his liberty may often involve such an element. Nevertheless, Article  3
    requires the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in  conditions
    that are compatible with respect for  their  human  dignity,  that  the
    manner and method of the execution of the measure do not  subject  them
    to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level
    of suffering inherent  in  detention  and  that,  given  the  practical
    demands of imprisonment, their health  and  well-being  are  adequately
    secured (see Kud?a v. Poland cited above,  �  94;  and  Kalashnikov  v.
    Russia no. 47095/99, � 95, ECHR 2001-XI). The Court would add that  the
    measures taken must also be necessary  to  attain  the  legitimate  aim
    pursued.
    Further, when assessing conditions of  detention,  account  has  to  be
    taken of the cumulative effects of those conditions,  as  well  as  the
    specific allegations made by  the  applicant  (Dougoz  v.  Greece,  no.
    40907/98, � 46, ECHR 2001-II)."


27. In Khoklich v Ukraine   App.no.41709/98, judgement  of  29  April  2003,
which concerned a prisoner facing a death sentence locked up in is cell  for
24 hours with no natural light, the Court noted, inter alia, that:
    "181. The Court has also borne in mind, when considering  the  material
    conditions in which the  applicant  was  detained  and  the  activities
    offered  to  him,  that  Ukraine  encountered  serious   socio-economic
    problems in the course of its systemic transition and that prior to the
    summer of 1998  the  prison  authorities  were  both  struggling  under
    difficult economic conditions and occupied with the  implementation  of
    new national legislation and related regulations.  However,  the  Court
    observes that lack of resources  cannot  in  principle  justify  prison
    conditions which are so poor as to reach  the  threshold  of  treatment
    contrary to  Article  3  of  the  Convention.  Moreover,  the  economic
    problems faced by Ukraine cannot in any event  explain  or  excuse  the
    particular conditions of detention which it has found in paragraph  178
    to be unacceptable in the present case."
28. It must be borne in mind that above summary relates to the  ECtHR  cases
dealing with prison conditions in Contracting States  brought  by  prisoners
in jails inside those Contracting States, e.g. Kalashnikov and  Valasinas  v
Lithuania, and they do not address the  extraterritorial  issue  of  whether
expulsion to a country where a person will be imprisoned will result in  ill
treatment contrary to Article 3, an issue which requires  having  regard  to
the likely future, not the ascertainable past.
29. One other observation is pertinent, based on  the  Strasbourg  cases  on
prison conditions which we were made aware by way of the various  references
and cross-references in the bundles placed before  us,  which  included,  in
addition to Kalashnikov, Valasinas, Ramariz Sanchez and  the  Ukraine  cases
(see below):  Weeks v UK App No 9787/82 (1987) 10 EHRR 293, Kudla  v  Poland
App No 30210/96 (2000) 10 BHRC 269, Dougoz v Greece App.No. 40907/98  (2002)
34 EHRR 61, Peers v Greece App.No.28524/95 (2001) 33 EHRR 1192, Keenan v  UK
27229/95 [2001] ECHR 242 (3 April 2001, Novoselov,  judgment  2  June  2005,
Ilascu and ors v Moldova and Russia App no.  48787/99  [2004]  ECHR  318  (8
July 2004) and Popov v Russia 26853/04 [2006] ECHR 771 (13  July  2006).  We
do not understand the cases just mentioned to be a list of all  cases  dealt
with by Strasbourg on prison conditions, although as  far  as  we  can  tell
they are representative.
30. So far as the Ukraine cases are  concerned  (to  which  Mr  Jaisri  made
reference)  we know from the summary provided by the Tribunal in PS  (prison
conditions; military service) Ukraine  CG  [2006]  UKAIT  00016  that  those
cases in which a violation of Article  3  by  Ukraine  was  found  concerned
prison conditions in which there were aggravating circumstances. In Salov  v
Ukraine (2005) Application No: 00065518/01 6/9/2005, a decision  promulgated
on 6 September 2005 and which was a case concerning  violations  of  Article
5(3) and Article 6(1) of the ECHR, it  was  the  applicant's  detention  for
over seven days without any judicial control which was seen to fall  outside
the strict constraints of time laid down by  the  Convention  and  that  the
criminal proceedings instituted against him were unfair. In Nevnerzhitsky  v
Ukraine (2005) Application No: 00054825/00  05/04/2005,  promulgated  on  12
October 2005, the Court found there  to  be  violations  of  Article  3  and
Article 5  of  the  ECHR  in  circumstances  where  the  conditions  of  the
applicant's pre-trial detention and his treatment whilst  detained  included
force-feeding  and   prolonged  pre-trial  detention.  In  Aliev  v  Ukraine
(41220/98 judgement of 29 April 2003, Khoklich  v  Ukraine  41707/98  [2003]
ECHR 207 (29 April  2003),  Poltoratskiy  v  Ukraine  (38812/97)  (2004)  39
EHRR43 2003 WL 23508990, promulgated on 29 July  and   Dankevich  v  Ukraine
(40679/98) (2004) 38 EHRR 25 2003 WL 23192423, promulgated on 29 July  2003,
what the Court found violated Article 3 were in  each  of  these  cases  the
abusive conditions of the  detention, along with the mental anguish,  caused
by being held on death row. In Aliev, for example, the Court stated at  para
148 that it viewed:
   "with particular concern that, until at earliest May 1998, the applicant,
   in common with other prisoners detained  in  the  prison  under  a  death
   sentence, was locked up for 24 hours a day in cells which offered only  a
   very restricted living space, that the windows of the cells were  covered
   with the consequence that that was no  access  to  natural   light,  that
   there was no provisions for any  outdoor  exercise  and  that  there  was
   little or no opportunity  for activities to occupy himself or  for  human
   contact".
31. In Afanasyev v Ukraine  (2005)  Application  No:  00038722/02  5/4/2005,
promulgated on 5 April 2005 the Court held that there  had  been  violations
of Article 3 and Article 13 of the ECHR in relation to  circumstances  where
the applicant had been a victim of violence during his detention  in  police
custody (not prison detention) and had  not  had  effective  recourse  to  a
domestic remedy in the form of an adequate investigation.
32. Put shortly, although in these cases overcrowding has  very  often  been
an important consideration, it is only  when  it  has  been  accompanied  by
other serious abuses of prisoners'  rights,  that  Strasbourg  has  found  a
breach of Article 3.
33. Given that Mr Jaisri referred us to it, we should also note that in  the
case of Valasinas v Lithuania, the  Court  was  faced  with  an  application
concerning the conditions  of  the  applicant's  detention  in  Pravieniskes
Prison and his treatment  there  from  April  1998  until  April  2000.  The
applicant's  complaints  cited,  inter  alia,   the  general  conditions  of
detention including  serious  overcrowding,  lack  of  windows,  light   and
ventilation, toilets which  lacked  partitions  and  lacked  windows  and  a
ventilation  system  (for  most  of   the   period),   deplorable   sanitary
conditions, restricted shower  facilities,  rare  visits  from  doctors,  no
work, recreation or other  meaningful  activities,  unhygienically  prepared
food, a sixteen hour a day "standing regime", interference with visits  from
relatives, a 15 day period in solitary confinement,  abusive  prison  staff,
arbitrary disciplining and  unpublished prison rules. Albeit accepting  that
many  of  the  applicant's  complaints  had  a  factual  content  the  Court
concluded that either taken singly or cumulatively the shortcomings  in  the
applicant's general conditions of detention when considered objectively  did
not breach Article 3 ECHR.

Our assessment
34. In conducting our assessment we must first of all note  that  we  accept
that overcrowding in Bangladesh is at serious  levels  and  we  accept  that
Professor Coyle is right to point to overcrowding  as  having  significantly
worsened from 2005 levels. It may be , as the latest  COIS  report  at  para
15.02 notes, that the population has dropped  from  the  earlier  figure  of
87,000 , at least if  one  takes  the  figures  given  by   the  Bangladeshi
Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights (BSEHR) which  states  that  the
existing prison population as of November 2007 was 82,254.  However,  it  is
not the prison population per se that is relevant but the prison  population
in relation to  the  available  prison  places.  And  it  remains  that  the
overcrowding levels are still extremely high. It may also be, in  the  light
of the ABC News report dated 16 June 2008 regarding the  statement  made  by
National Prisons Chief Brigadier Zakir  Hassan  concerning  the  freeing  of
prisoners who have served half of their terms after their  cases  have  been
the subject of  scrutiny,  that  a  very  significant  reduction  in  prison
numbers will occur soon, but bearing  in  mind  the  politically  contingent
context, that of making room for persons  who  have  been  detained  by  the
caretaker government as part of its so-called crackdown  on  corruption,  we
think it prudent not to factor in any such reduction. We  will  continue  to
proceed on the assumption, therefore,  that  overcrowding  remains  a  major
problem and that the levels are running at or  around  the  300%  of  normal
capacity level.

35. That said, as regards overcrowding we lack information to show  that  it
results in conditions or practices that  are  humiliating  or  degrading  or
inhuman generally. For example, we know from  the  background  evidence  and
Professor Coyle's two reports  that  prisoners  spend  some  time  each  day
outdoors and that they are not locked up all the time, but we  do  not  know
how much time is normally spent outside cells.  Nor  do  we  know    whether
prison dormitories routinely lack lighting or ventilation,  how  in  general
overcrowding affects personal privacy in going to the toilet, whether  there
is an adequate supply of toilet paper, whether (at least from 2005  onwards)
bedding is adequate and whether sanitation and  laundry  arrangements,  even
if deficient, are tolerable.

36. We remind ourselves that whilst the Strasbourg  case  law  reveals  that
poor  prison  conditions  can  result  in  a  situation  where  a  country's
prisoners generally can be described as living  in  conditions  contrary  to
Article 3, the cases in which that has been done are ones where there are  a
number of special exacerbating features.

37. Having considered the evidence  as  a  whole,  our  conclusion  is  that
prison conditions in Bangladesh do not in general violate Article 3  of  the
ECHR. Our principal reasons are as follows.

38. First, there is no evidence to suggest that the  Bangladesh  authorities
deliberately seek to impose poor prison conditions on prisoners per  se.  Of
course, Professor Coyle is right to remind us that good  intentions  on  the
part of the state concerned are not a sufficient answer to an allegation  of
ill treatment contrary to Article 3: thus in Kalashnikov the Court  found  a
violation of Article 3 despite accepting that the  Russian  authorities  had
no actual intention to humiliate or debase the  applicant.  Further,  as  we
have noted, the prohibition on ill treatment contained in Article 3  of  the
ECHR  is  absolute  and  the  shortage  of  resources  or  facilities  in  a
particular country cannot be used as a justification for  failure  to  avoid
ill treatment. At the same time, the fact that we are  not  dealing  with  a
country where the state deliberately seeks to impose poor prison  conditions
is a consideration which the Strasbourg Court has also seen to be relevant.

39.  Second,  the  evidence  read  as  a  whole   indicates   that   despite
overcrowding being as bad as, if not worse than ever, there have  been  some
significant improvements in  prison  conditions  in  Bangladesh  prisons  in
other respects since 2000-2005.

40. Where matters stood in 2000  is  summarised  in  the  website  document,
"Crime and Society: a comparative criminology  tour  of  the  world"  (circa
2001), which stated:

    "...In general, prisons and jails have low  standards  of  hygiene  and
    sanitation and are seriously overcrowded. Rehabilitation programs  with
    trained social workers were rudimentary or nonexistent through the late
    1980s. Prison conditions are extremely poor for  the  majority  of  the
    prison population. Rape of female detainees in prison or other official
    custody has been a problem.  Most  prisons  are  overcrowded  and  lack
    adequate facilities. Government  figures  indicate  that  the  existing
    prison populations of roughly 66, 5000 is 278 percent of  the  official
    prison capacity. Of those, approximately 25 percent of  those  detained
    had been convicted and 971 percent were awaiting trial or under  trial.
    In some cases, cells are so crowded that prisoners sleep in shifts. The
    Dhaka Central Jail reportedly houses more than  9,775  prisoners  in  a
    facility designed for fewer than 3,000 persons. A 1998 judicial  report
    noted that the physical  condition  of  jails  is  poor,  and  food  is
    unhygienically prepared. Drugs are abused widely  inside  the  prisons.
    The treatment of prisoners in the jails is not equal. There  are  three
    classes of cells: A, B and C. Common criminals and low-level  political
    workers generally are held in C cells, which often have dirt floors, no
    furnishings, and poor quality food. The use of restraining  devices  on
    prisoners in these cells is common. Conditions in A  and  B  cells  are
    markedly better; A cells are reserved for prominent  prisoners.  A  new
    prison facility in Kashimpur, north of Dhaka, opened in September.  Few
    facilities exist for children whose parents are  incarcerated.  Prisons
    conditions are extremely poor for  most  prisoners.  One  human  rights
    organisation reported that 72 persons died in prison or police  custody
    during the year 2000. According to credible  sources,  poor  conditions
    were at least a contributing factor in many of these deaths. "

41. The position in 2002 is set out succinctly in the UNDP  2002  report  as
summarised by the COIS report for August 2007 at para 15.03:

    "The UNDP report specified that there  were  then  80  prisons  in  the
    country; however, 16 of these 80 were thana jails, otherwise  known  as
    "detention houses",  which  were  not  functioning  at  the  time.  The
    Ministry of Home  Affairs,  through  the  directorate  of  prisons,  is
    responsible for their management.  Overcrowding  had  already  worsened
    significantly by 2002, due mainly to  the  large  number  of  prisoners
    awaiting  trial.  Prisoners/detainees  were  accommodated   either   in
    separate  cells  or  in  association  wards,  which   are   dormitories
    accommodating about 100 to 150 individuals. Under dormitory rules, each
    prisoner  was  entitled  to  36  sq.ft.  of   floor   space;   however,
    overcrowding has reduced the space available per prisoner to 15  sq.ft.
    In certain wards prisoners had to sleep in  shifts  owing  to  lack  of
    space. Ordinary prisoners received 2,800 to 3,000 calories of food  per
    day,  considered  satisfactory  by  the  Institute  of  Public   Health
    Nutrition; so-called 'classified  prisoners'  received  more.  However,
    prisoners were often required to eat their meals sitting on the  ground
    under the open sky, in all weathers. The striped, coarse  uniform  worn
    by ordinary prisoners was considered demoralising. Bedding,  consisting
    of only two blankets, was  inadequate,  degrading  and  detrimental  to
    physical and mental health. Prison authorities still followed  statutes
    framed by the British colonial authorities in the  nineteenth  century,
    the main objective of which was the confinement  and  safe  custody  of
    prisoners through suppressive  and  punitive  measures.  There  was  an
    absence of training programmes for the  reform  and  rehabilitation  of
    offenders and vocational training programmes  did  not  cater  for  all
    classes of prisoners. The recruitment and training procedures of prison
    officers was inadequate to facilitate  the  reform  of  prisoners.  The
    number of medical doctors was  disproportionate  to  the  size  of  the
    prison population,  and  women  prisoners  were  attended  to  by  male
    doctors. There were  no  paid  nurses  in  prison  hospitals;  literate
    convicts worked as hospital attendants, without training. There were no
    trained social welfare officers or psychologists. Handcuffs and fetters
    were used as punishment for breaches of prison rules".

42. We have already noted that in his  first  report  Professor  Coyle  drew
heavily on reports written by the UNDP and the EU Commission in  2005  which
described prison conditions as being scarcely better. However, we  now  have
before us the US State Department report of March  2008.  In  the  light  of
that report we  find  ourselves  unable  to  agree  with  Professor  Coyle's
assessment in his 2008 update that the latest evidence (which  includes  the
US State Department report for March 2008) shows that  "one  might  conclude
that [prison conditions] ...have continued to deteriorate".

43. The overall position as set out in the US State Department report  March
2008 (on which Professor Coyle relies as one of his main  sources)  is  that
although the system "remain[s] abysmal" nevertheless  "the  government  took
several major steps to improve prison conditions, such as cracking  down  on
corruption and improving morale of prison employees". The same  report  also
notes that:

    "The inspector general of prisons  sought  to  improve  conditions.  He
    introduced several training  programs  and  literacy  classes  to  help
    rehabilitate prisoners, cracked down on corruption in the  system,  and
    improved inmate food and other services
    ...
    The government undertook reforms aimed at improving the situation.  The
    inspector general of prisons took several steps to improve  the  prison
    system, including updating the jail code, reducing corruption and  drug
    trafficking in prisons, limiting the use of full shackles on  prisoners
    for reasons other  than  discipline,  improving  the  quality  of  food
    service, creating more prisoner vocational training  opportunities  and
    literacy classes, and improving morale of prison staff..."


44. Third, as for Mr Jaisri's reliance on  the  evidence  as  to  deaths  in
custody, he is right to point out that Professor Coyle's  view  that  prison
conditions are a contributing factor to custodial deaths is  based  squarely
on the US State Department  Report.  However,  we  do  not  think  that  the
figures relating to custodial deaths, when examined more  closely,  do  very
much at all to strengthen the argument that prison conditions in  Bangladesh
are contrary to Article 3.  The position as set out in the latest  US  State
Department report is that:

    "According to Odhikar [a local human rights NGO], 87  persons  died  in
    prison and 67 died while in the custody of police  and  other  security
    forces, among them a ten-year old boy who was  found  with  his  throat
    slit in the Juvenile Detention Centre. Of the 87 persons who  died,  77
    died of natural causes; four died of unnatural causes; and six died  of
    unknown or unspecified causes".

45. Given that what we are considering in this case is someone who  will  be
returning to jail as a convicted prisoner, the figures for persons who  died
in the custody of police and security forces are only relevant  as  part  of
the overall background evidence. Similarly, while the  US  State  Department
report (along  with  the  Amnesty  International  and  Human  Rights  Watch)
reports) chronicles the use of ill treatment by security  forces  (the  RAB,
police and the military), that is not part of the picture so far as  members
of the ordinary prison population are concerned. Further, we are  told  that
of the 87 persons who died [in 2007] 77  were  from  natural  causes.   Such
figures are far from showing that there are a significant number  of  deaths
in custody caused directly by adverse prison  conditions  or  the  treatment
facing ordinary prisoners. By comparison, we note that  in  Russia  (on  the
evidence in the Kalashnikov case) there were around  10-11  thousand  deaths
per year in a prison population of  around  1  million.   Put  another  way,
whereas in  Russia  deaths  in  prison  were  11  out  of  every  1,000,  in
Bangladesh they were only one out of every 1,000. (In the UK,  if  one  goes
by  a BBC News report of 29 June 2008  - which noted  that  out  of   83,243
prisoners (83,716 according to 27 June 2008 figures from  National  Offender
Management Service (NOMS)) almost 600 died in  custody  every  year  -   the
figure would appear to be around 7 out of every 1,000.)

46.  Fourth,  in  relation  to  health,  hygiene,  sanitation  and   medical
services, the evidence as a whole does not demonstrate a  state  of  affairs
contrary to  Article  3  ECHR  standards.  The  UNDP  report  for  2005  (as
summarised by Professor Coyle) found that medical services  were  inadequate
and that problems arose when prisoners suffered from serious  diseases.   It
also noted that prevalent ailments were diarrhoea, fever and skin  diseases.
Diarrhoea was said to be caused by a number  of  factors,  including  unsafe
drinking water. The conditions in which food was prepared were also said  to
be a major factor  and  the  kitchen  areas  were  said  to  be  inadequate.
However, it was not said that these inadequacies gave rise  to  a  situation
in which prisoners generally experienced inhuman or degrading treatment.  As
regards the number of doctors, we cannot  agree  with  Mr  Jaisri  that  the
position is correctly summarised  by  the  Bangladesh  News  headline  of  1
February 2008 as "[o]nly 16 doctors treat 86,000 jail  inmates".   The  body
of the report (as described by Professor Coyle in his update report) is  far
from clear as to the exact  situation.  The  reference  to  the  16  doctors
appears to be a reference to those who man prison hospitals. Further  on  it
states that there are "77 posts of doctors at  jails  for  27,000  prisoners
[this refers to the official capacity]. But since the  number  of  prisoners
is always such [sic] high, there should be more than 230 doctors for  them".
It also quotes Deputy Inspector General (DIG-Prisons) Major  Shamsul  Hassan
as saying that "The hospitals without doctors  have  paramedics,  while  the
jails which have no hospitals have single rooms for sick  prisoners."   But,
pointing the other way, the newspaper report also states that "[a]s many  as
53 jails have no doctors at all, leave [sic] alone hospitals".

47. The  above  evidence  certainly  makes  clear  that  there  are  serious
shortages of doctors. It also chimes with the reference  to  the  number  of
doctors in the UNDP reports of 2002 and 2005 (the latter  as  summarised  by
Professor Coyle). However, the Bangladesh News item of 1 February 2008  also
appears to confirm that there are paramedics in jail hospitals. Taking  this
news item report together with other evidence before us, we do not  find  it
has been demonstrated that the effect of a shortage  of  prison  doctors  is
that prisoners routinely lack essential  equipment,  drugs  or  professional
personnel to ensure the protection of  their  essential  health  needs  when
they fall ill. We lack information about, for example, how  often  prisoners
receive a medical check-up or to what extent medical assistance  when  given
is  carried  out  (whether  by  doctors  or  paramedics)  to   a   competent
professional  standard.  Some  glimpse  into  how  the  prison   authorities
approach medical issues currently is provided by a  website  entry  relating
to a study funded by Improved Health for  the  Poor:  Health  Nutrition  and
Population Research Project (HP; HNPRP)  of  the  Government  of  Bangladesh
relating to "Detection and Control of Tuberculosis in  Dhaka  Central  Jail,
medical release of 22 April 2008, which refers to TB patients in  this  Jail
being  "isolated  and  given  necessary  treatments".  It  noted  that   the
Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  gave   his   approval   for
implementing all of the recommendations made by the  researchers  to  reduce
the chance of transmission of TB to other healthy inmates. He  was  reported
as requesting  this  same  research  body  to  consider  conducting  similar
studies in other central jails.   Representatives  present  at  the  seminar
called on this question included a  representative  from  the  World  Health
Organisation. Although this is a government press  release,  it  appears  to
record verifiable developments.

48. Fifth, as regards recreation, it is certainly the  case  that  the  2005
report by the European  Commission  (going  by  Professor  Coyle's  summary)
found that there was no proper programme of vocational training  and  income
generation for prisoners and the  prison  service,  but  it  did  note  that
recreation consisted of 'indoor games'. We lack important information  about
how extensive is the lack of work or educational facilities in relation  to,
for example, being able to take daily outdoor walks, obtaining books  and/or
newspapers from a library, watching television, listening to music,  playing
board games, exercising and the like. We  also  lack  information  about  to
what extent ordinary prisoners  are  afforded  adequate  contacts  with  the
outside world by way of personal visits or the  extent  to  which  they  are
allowed to receive correspondence, parcels of  food,  toiletries,  vitamins,
books and clothes.

49. Sixth, as regards the quality of food services, Ms Brown contended  that
the latest COIS report at para 15.03 said  that  the  calorific  content  of
prison food had been considered satisfactory; however,  with  respect,  that
report refers to a 2002 UNDP report (which we have  already  recounted)  and
is little help in assessing what is the position currently. But there is  no
evidence that the quality  of  food  and  catering  has  adversely  affected
prisoners in any serious ways.

50. Seventh, so far as the monitoring of  prisons  is  concerned,  it  is  a
relevant fact that they  are  not  monitored  by  independent  human  rights
monitors in any regular way, but Professor Coyle's own report  refers  to  a
1980 Commission inquiry and to two recent reports (based on  visits  to  2-4
prisons) carried out by international  bodies  (UNDP,  in  conjunction  with
Penal Reform International  and  an  EU  Commission/"Justice  Identification
Mission" report. In the COIS report summarising the UNDP 2002 report,  there
was a reference to a 1998 judicial inquiry. He also  notes  that  there  are
government-appointed  committees  of  prominent  private  citizens  in  each
prison locality monitoring prisons monthly. On the  strength  of  the  press
report  from  the  New  Nation  dated  3  March  2008   headed   "Row   over
accommodation in [Chittagong] Jail: Prison  Unrest"  and  the  press  report
from the Bangladesh News 1 February 2008, there is a climate  of  government
openness about  prison  conditions.  The  New  Nation  article  notes  that:
"Talking to reporters, who recently visited the jail, Senior  Superintendent
of the Chittagong Central Jail  Ataur  Rahman  said  the  suffering  of  the
prisons would largely reduce after completion of the work  [construction  of
6 new barracks due to be  completed  by  2010  enhancing  the  accommodation
capacity to 5,000] "(emphasis added). The  Bangladesh  News  article  quotes
two  inspectors  general  of  police   (Prisons)   and   two   senior   jail
administrators, each of whom was prepared to furnish details which  did  not
on their face put the government in a good light.  It is  important  in  our
view to bear in mind that whilst Professor Coyle is right to point out  that
the conditions in Bangladesh  prisons  must  be  measured  by  international
standards, not local standards, equally they are not to  be  judged  by  the
standards  of  a  liberal  democracy  and  the  fact  that  the  prisons  in
Bangladesh are under the control of a  government  that  is  not  a  liberal
democracy is immaterial in assessing whether  conditions in them  give  rise
to treatment contrary to Article 3.  Professor Coyle's  observation  in  his
May 2007 report  that  "[c]rucially,  there  is  no  independent  inspection
mechanism that reports to Parliament annually" is  indicative  in  our  view
that the core of his evaluation is concerned not with the issue  of  whether
prison conditions violate Article 3 of the ECHR but whether they breach non-
treaty standards which are features to be found (so far  as  we  are  aware)
only in the prison systems of advanced liberal democracies.

 51. By way of conclusion, we agree  with  Ms  Brown  that  apart  from  the
evidence about overcrowding, there  are  no  clear  indications  that  other
shortcomings are of a grave or severe nature. It is our view  that  although
there are serious deficiencies in the Bangladesh prison system and  although
conditions in them can be properly  described  as  "abysmal",  the  evidence
falls short of demonstrating that  ordinary  convicted  prisoners  generally
face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3.

52. We reiterate at this point that whilst the Strasbourg case law  confirms
that poor prison conditions  can  result  in  a  situation  where  prisoners
generally can be described as living in conditions contrary  to  Article  3,
the cases in which that argument succeeded were those  where  there  were  a
number of special exacerbating features. In Kalashnikov,  for  example,  the
applicant was forced to share a cell which was not only infested with  pests
but in which there were people  suffering  from  disease  including  TB  and
syphilis. Overcrowding, where it has featured  as  a  serious  problem,  has
never been seen  enough  on  its  own  to  establish  a  real  risk  of  ill
treatment.

53. Considered in the light of Strasbourg cases,  we  think  it  significant
that the evidence before us as to prisons in Bangladesh  does  not  suggest,
for example any consistent pattern of ordinary  prisoners  being  locked  in
cells for periods of  24 hours with no lighting  or  ventilation,  being  in
pest-infested  cells  or  in  contact  with  prisoners  carrying   dangerous
infectious diseases such as TB, or to  solitary  confinement,  or  suffering
sleep deprivation or a pattern of arbitrary punishment for any  breaches  of
prison discipline.  Whilst  the  evidence  before  us  does  record  serious
shortcomings past and/or present in numbers, hygiene,  bedding,  recreation,
educational facilities, sanitation, medical  facilities  and  the  like,  it
does not identify that these shortcomings result in a consistent pattern  of
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

54. We conclude , therefore, in  answer  to  the  second  question  we  were
directed to decide, that  prison  conditions  in  Bangladesh  at  least  for
ordinary prisoners, do not violate Article 3 ECHR. This conclusion does  not
mean that an individual who faces prison on return to Bangladesh  can  never
succeed in showing a violation of Article 3 in the particular  circumstances
of his case. We think that a useful starting-point is afforded  by  the  OGN
approach that:

    "...However, the individual facts of each case should be considered  to
    determine whether detention will cause a particular individual  in  his
    particular circumstances to suffer treatment  contrary  to  Article  3,
    relevant factors being the likely length of detention, the likely  type
    of detention facility and the individual's age  and  state  of  health.
    Where in  an  individual  case  treatment  does  reach  the  Article  3
    threshold a grant of Humanitarian Protection will be appropriate."

55. However, we also bear in mind the evidence we have  before  us  in  this
case about the increasing use of detention by the  authorities  where  there
is a political element. This leads us to consider  that  detainees  of  this
kind  may  face  treatment  different  from  that  meted  out  to   ordinary
prisoners. Also, we have considerable evidence about  the  delays  in  those
detained awaiting trial being brought  to  trial.  In  the  light  of  these
factors, we would modify the OGN  approach  for  our  purposes  to  read  as
follows.

    The individual facts of each case should  be  considered  to  determine
    whether detention will cause a particular individual in his  particular
    circumstances to suffer  treatment  contrary  to  Article  3,  relevant
    factors being, inter alia, whether there is a political element to  the
    person having been detained, whether it is detention awaiting trial  or
    detention in service of a sentence, the likely length of detention, the
    likely type of detention facility, and the individual's age  and  state
    of health.

 The appellant's case
56. It remains to set out our conclusions on the appellant's  case,  bearing
in mind our earlier observation that we must consider whether there are  any
significant specific features of the appellant's situation that  might  mean
that his position is not to be considered as being like that  of  any  other
prisoner.

57. In our judgement there are no  special  circumstances  relating  to  his
age,  health  or  physical  or  mental  abilities   that   require   us   to
differentiate his likely situation from that  faced  by  the  generality  of
prisoners in Bangladesh. The fact  that  he  faces  return  as  an  ordinary
prisoner serving a sentence, may indeed make his  lot  less  difficult  than
that of those awaiting trial who do not have access to legal assistance.  We
say that because the appellant is someone  who  has  already  been  able  to
obtain access to legal assistance,  before  and  after  his  departure  from
Bangladesh and it  is  reasonably  likely  such  legal  assistance  will  be
available to him on return.

58. The only  specific feature of the  appellant's  case  which  causes  any
concern from the point of view of assessing  his  claims  for  international
protection, is that (in view of our earlier findings) what he faces  is  not
a short term of imprisonment but a term in jail of up  to  seven  years.  In
this regard we bear in mind the importance attached by the Strasbourg  Court
(and also by the Home Office  OGN)  to  considering  the  likely  length  of
detention as a relevant factor  when  examining  the  cumulative  impact  of
prison conditions.

59. However, bearing in mind our earlier findings on  prison  conditions  in
Bangladesh generally (at least for prisoners to whose detention there is  no
political element) taken together with the fact that there  are  no  special
circumstances relating to his age, health or physical or  mental  abilities,
we do not consider that the likelihood that he will have to serve  a  prison
sentence of up to 7 years would cause him serious harm or violate his  right
under Article 3 of the ECHR.

60.  For  the  above  reasons  we  conclude  that  the  decision  we  should
substitute for that of the panel (whose decision was legally flawed)  is  to
dismiss the appellant's human rights  appeal.  We  also  conclude  that  the
appellant  does  not  meet  the  requirements  governing   eligibility   for
humanitarian protection under para 339C(iii) of HC 395 (as amended)
