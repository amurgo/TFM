                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  Designated
           First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy on 9  May  2017  against  the
           decision and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sullivan  who
           had dismissed the protection and  human  rights  appeal  of  the
           Appellant.  The decision and reasons was promulgated on 12 April
           2017.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born there on 1  July
           1989. He entered the United Kingdom on 17 April 2009 as a Tier 4
           (General) Student migrant. His protection claim was made  on  26
           August 2016, after his application to remain on Article  8  ECHR
           grounds had been refused and  certified  on  23  May  2016.   He
           claimed that he would be at risk on return from the authorities,
           extremists and his own family because he is a militant  atheist.
           Credibility  was  the  only  issue  as  the  country  background
           evidence was not in dispute.   Judge  Sullivan  found  that  the
           Appellant's claims were not proved to the lower standard: he was
           not an atheist and  was  not  reasonably  likely  to  have  been
           identified or  be  identifiable  in  Bangladesh  as  an  atheist
           blogger.  Nor  would  the  Appellant  be  reasonably  likely  to
           continue to publish such views on return.


      3.    Permission to appeal was granted because it was considered  that
           the judge had arguably erred  by  concluding  that  the  atheism
           claim was opportunistic.  There had  been  independent  evidence
           and it was arguable that the judge had not examined the evidence
           in the round.


      4.    Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
           notice opposing the onwards appeal was filed by the  Respondent,
           dated 12 May 2017.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Gilbert for the  Appellant  relied  on  the  grounds  earlier
           submitted and the grant of permission to appeal.   He  submitted
           that the judge had paid too much attention  to  the  Appellant's
           immigration history (i.e., his late asylum  claim).   The  judge
           had taken too narrow a view  of  the  Appellant's  social  media
           contacts, e.g., on Facebook where 100 contacts were shown.  This
           was shown at p.69 of the Appellant's bundle: "100 friends".  The
           languages used by him were Bengali  as  well  as  English.   The
           flavour of the debate was important, and the  judge  had  missed
           that.  The Appellant had provided evidence of threats  received.
           There was a record of views and "likes", indicating the level of
           exposure or circulation, with links to YouTube and Twitter,  and
           the GAAF website.  The Appellant  had  followers.   One  of  the
           points which the judge had missed was the ease of access to  the
           Appellant's postings, and the significance of the threats he had
           received.  The judge  should  have  given  more  weight  to  the
           threats.


      6.    The judge had further erred  at  [21(b)]  of  the  decision  and
           reasons when considering  the  anti-Muslim  cartoons  which  the
           Appellant had circulated.  Again, too narrow  a  view  had  been
           taken.   There  had  plainly  been  a  misunderstanding  by  the
           Appellant's family who saw "drawing" cartoons as  equivalent  to
           "circulating" them.  The judge had been wrong to make an adverse
           credibility finding based on an inconsistency between  "drawing"
           and "circulating" cartoons.


      7.     The  extent  of  the  judge's  misapprehension  and  restricted
           approach meant that none of the adverse  findings  could  stand.
           The appeal to the Upper Tribunal  should  be  allowed,  and  the
           appeal reheard in the First-tier Tribunal by another judge.


      8.    Mr Wilding for the Respondent relied on the rule 24 notice.  The
           judge had been fully entitled to reach her  adverse  credibility
           findings, of  no  genuinely  held  atheist  belief.   There  was
           nothing in conducting a microanalysis of the  Appellant's  posts
           on social media.  The Appellant had made no attempt  to  contact
           the United Kingdom authorities about the threats he had  claimed
           to have received.  The whole of the  Appellant's  atheist  story
           had no context: nothing had happened until his last  application
           for further leave to remain had been refused.  The discrepancies
           which the judge had identified were significant and  they  could
           not   be   explained   away   on   the   basis   of   linguistic
           misunderstanding.  The privacy settings which the Appellant  had
           selected for his Facebook had not been  revealed,  which  was  a
           further indication of the substance of the claim.  There was  no
           error of law and the decision and reasons should stand.


      9.    In reply, Mr Gilbert reiterated his  submission  concerning  the
           cartoons.  Anxious scrutiny had  not  been  applied  to  whether
           there was a real distinction between drawing and simply posting,
           which had the same  effect.   The  Facebook  settings  were  not
           material because messages could be received from "non  friends",
           as had been shown.




      Discussion - No error of law


      10.   At the conclusion of submissions the tribunal indicated that  it
           found no error of law and that the determination  was  reserved.
           The tribunal's reasons now follow.


      11.   In the tribunal's view, Judge Sullivan  conducted  a  meticulous
           analysis of the Appellant's claim, applying anxious scrutiny  at
           every stage.   The judge was careful to place the  claim  within
           the country background evidence,  itself  not  in  dispute,  but
           nevertheless  essential  context:  see  [27]  onwards   of   the
           determination.  As Mr Wilding submitted, context  was  the  very
           element  missing  from  the  Appellant's  case.   His   supposed
           militant atheism cannot be traced further than  the  refusal  of
           his application in May 2016, as the judge noted at [17] and [26]
           of the decision and elsewhere.  It was  proper  that  the  judge
           took that into  account  when  considering  the  timing  of  the
           protection claim, years  after  the  Appellant's  entry  to  the
           United Kingdom with  the  declared  intention  of  returning  to
           Bangladesh.


      12.   The judge's analysis of the Appellant's claim revealed it to  be
           without  substance,  a  faï¿½ade  created  in  the  hope  that   a
           superficial view of the materials submitted would be taken.   As
           to the "flavour" of the case, the Appellant's materials show  an
           absence of  any  considered  or  reasoned  position  as  to  the
           existence or non-existence of a deity, which is not  what  would
           reasonably be expected from an educated man who claimed  he  had
           reflected before taking a conscience driven stance which he knew
           might be unpopular with his compatriots.  The cartoons which  he
           circulated or reposted are  crude  and  deliberately  offensive,
           repellent to any thinking person, regardless of their  faith  or
           beliefs.  That is not intelligent debate, mere bigotry,  and  it
           reinforces  the  judge's  view  that  the  Appellant's  declared
           atheism was simply a false claim for  an  ulterior  motive.  The
           judge was entitled to find that the Appellant's document stating
           that he had drawn cartoons conflicted with the  Appellant's  own
           evidence.  Mr Gilbert's attempt to persuade  the  tribunal  that
           this was simply a misunderstanding by the document's  author  is
           far from persuasive, as these were documents  submitted  by  the
           Appellant to advance his case and which he must be taken to have
           read and approved.


      13.   The judge's analysis of the effect  of  the  Appellant's  social
           media postings is irreproachable:  see  [18(g)].   Mr  Gilbert's
           submission that the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the
           possibility of wider access to fanatics and others was not  well
           founded.  The judge at [18] was recording the facts put  forward
           by the Appellant which she accepted, not the consequences, which
           formed part of her subsequent "in the round" evaluation  of  the
           evidence as a whole,  other  parts  of  which  she  rejected  as
           unreliable or worse.  It must in any event be observed that  the
           recorded degree of contact  or  exposure  from  the  Appellant's
           social  media  activities  was  tiny:  e.g.,  100  contacts   on
           Facebook, 938 views. Mr Wilding was in the  tribunal's  judgment
           right to point out that the Appellant had not taken  any  action
           to seek help from the United Kingdom authorities in relation  to
           the threats he had received via social media, hardly the conduct
           of a person who considered that the threats were genuine or  who
           was concerned to protect  himself.   Extremism  and  intolerance
           have raised their  vile  heads  all  too  often  in  the  United
           Kingdom, despite the best efforts of successive governments,  so
           the Appellant had more than Bangladesh to think of, if  he  took
           the threats seriously.


      14.   The tribunal considers  that  none  of  the  criticisms  of  the
           judge's decision and reasons has any substance  or  merit.   The
           judge dealt  comprehensively  with  a  transparently  false  and
           abusive claim.  The onwards appeal is dismissed.
