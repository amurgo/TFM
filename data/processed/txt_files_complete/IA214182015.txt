                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  the  Philippines,  who  appeals  with
    permission against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing
    her appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse her a  residence
    card under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
    (as amended)  as  the  family  member  of  her  son-in-law,  who  is  a
    Lithuanian citizen and therefore an EEA national.

 2.  The  appellant  did  not  attend  the   hearing   today   or   arrange
    representation and no explanation for her absence has been received.

 3. The respondent's decision was made on 26th May 2015 and  therefore  the
    2006 Regulations applied to it.  The appellant's case is that she is  a
    family member as defined in Section 7(1)(c) of the 2006 Regulations:

         "(1)  Subject  to  paragraph  (2),  for  the  purposes   of   these
             Regulations the following persons shall be treated  as  family
             members of another person - ...

             (c)  dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or  that
                  of    his    spouse     or     his     civil     partner."
                           [Emphasis added]

 4. As set out in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision,  there  is  no
    dispute that the appellant is the ascending family member  of  the  EEA
    national's spouse.  The question is whether she is dependent.   If  the
    appellant is not dependent on the EEA national or his spouse, she is an
    extended family member, and I have no jurisdiction by way of  statutory
    appeal (Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) Albania [2016]  UKUT  411  (IAC)).
    However, if the appellant can show dependency, she is a family  member,
    not an extended family member, and is entitled to a residence card.

 5. I have no assistance from the appellant herself today, so I  must  rely
    on  the  facts  found  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal   decision.    The
    relationship between the appellant and her sponsor did not begin  until
    2012 by which time the appellant had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    eleven years. The appellant's daughter met her husband some time  after
    she came to the United Kingdom, and married him here.   This  appellant
    was not dependent on her daughter's spouse whilst  in  the  Philippines
    because she had her own business there and her daughter had not yet met
    and married the sponsor.

 6. The appellant asserted in the First-tier Tribunal that her business  in
    the Philippines had collapsed in 2001, but no evidence  whatsoever  was
    adduced in support of that assertion and the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    not accept that fact.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  was
    that the appellant works as a care worker, since coming to  the  United
    Kingdom, but  that  her  ability  to  work  and  earn  her  living  was
    interrupted for some time.  However, it was also her evidence that  she
    had now been able to return to work.  The appellant was living with her
    pregnant daughter and the sponsor in their accommodation,  and  earning
    �350 a month.   The sponsor and the daughter pay the rent.

 7. The First-tier Judge directed himself by reference to  the  meaning  of
    dependency as set out by Lord Justice Elias at paragraph 32  in  Lim  v
    Entry Clearance  Officer  Manila  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1383  and  did  so
    correctly.  That passage says this:

         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,  and  Reyes  now
         makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is a simple matter
         of fact.  If he can support himself, there is no  dependency,  even
         if he is given financial material support by the EU citizen.  Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs.  If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights.  The fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the facts of this case, there was no dependency.
           The  appellant  had  the  funds  to  support  herself.   She  was
         financially independent and did not need the  additional  resources
         for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

 8. There is no indication that there was any evidence  before  the  First-
    tier as to whether the appellant could live on �350 a month,  with  the
    addition of such benefits as she might be entitled to receive, or  even
    without them.  On the basis of the evidence which was before the First-
    tier Judge it was unarguably open to the judge  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant had not shown that she is a dependent direct relative in  her
    daughter's ascending line and accordingly she  is  an  extended  family
    member and the Upper Tribunal, like the  First-tier  Tribunal,  has  no
    jurisdiction in this appeal.

 9. Appeal dismissed.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
