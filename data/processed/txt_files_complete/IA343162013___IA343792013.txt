Wise Solicitors
For the Appellant:     Mr G Saunders, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Priya Kamal Raj is 28 years of age, having been born  on  11  September
    1985 and Srinivas Avula is 33 years of age,  having  been  born  on  19
    April 1980.  They are married to each other and are  both  citizens  of
    India.

 2. Mrs Raj obtained various nursing qualifications in India and wished  to
    obtain higher qualifications in the United Kingdom.  To  this  end  she
    obtained leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student under the points-based system and did so on 28 April 2011.

 3. Thereafter, she was granted leave to remain in the same capacity  until
    25 June 2013 and throughout this period Mr Avula had leave to enter and
    remain as her dependant.

 4. Whilst in the United Kingdom, Mrs  Raj  obtained  an  MSc  in  Advanced
    Nursing and decided that she wished to obtain an MBA.  To this end,  on
    24 June 2013, she applied for further  leave  to  remain  in  the  same
    capacity, as did Mr Avula.

 5. On 5 August 2013, the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    refused the applications.  Mrs Raj's application was refused because of
    failure to meet the Maintenance (Funds)  requirements  and  Mr  Avula's
    application was refused because he was a dependant of an individual who
    had been refused leave to remain.

 6. Mrs Raj and Mr Avula appealed against these decisions to the First-tier
    Tribunal who allowed their appeals  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  3
    February 2014.  The Secretary of State appeals with permission  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. The grounds of appeal before us are two fold: firstly, that the  First-
    tier Tribunal failed to appreciate that where an  individual  fails  to
    obtain leave to remain under the Immigration Rules, it is only if there
    are compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules that an individual should be granted leave to remain on Article 8
    grounds, and; secondly, the factors taken into account  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did not amount to compelling circumstances.

 8. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, it was conceded that Mrs
    Raj's application under the Immigration Rules was bound to fail due  to
    non-compliance with the Maintenance (Funds) requirements.   The  nature
    of the non-compliance was  that  the  bank  statements  which  she  had
    provided with her application failed to demonstrate that she had �3,200
    maintenance during the 28 day period between 11 May  2013  and  7  June
    2013, and her financial sponsor was not one who was entitled to act  as
    such under the Rules.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal said that "On that basis it could only be dealt
    with under Article 8".  It then identified what it considered to be the
    main issue in the case, namely "...whether or not the  first  appellant
    is a genuine student and is here with her husband for the  purposes  of
    enhancing her career".  The First-tier Tribunal then went  on  to  make
    various  findings  of  fact,  namely  that  Mrs  Raj  had  successfully
    completed her MSc in Advanced Nursing and that she genuinely desired to
    obtain an MBA.  The First-tier Tribunal  took  into  account  documents
    which showed that Mrs Raj had the requisite funds available  and  found
    that, had it not been for flooding in India at the material time, those
    documents  could  have  been  provided  to  the  Secretary  of   State.
    Furthermore, Mrs Raj had not only already commenced her MBA course, but
    had paid �6,000 towards it, which would be lost if she did not complete
    the course.

10. In relation to the decision of the Secretary of State,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  concluded   that   "Applying   the   well-known   Article   8
    jurisprudence  in  this  respect  I  am  satisfied  that  this  was   a
    disproportionate interference with her Article 8 rights".

11. Undoubtedly, there was no express reference by the First-tier  Tribunal
    to the decisions of R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin),  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640  (IAC)  and
    Shahzad (Article 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 85.  Nor do we consider
    that it  was  likely  that  the  reference  to  "well-known  Article  8
    jurisprudence" was a reference to these decisions.  However,  and  more
    to the point, we cannot detect that the First-tier Tribunal  considered
    the effect of these decisions, namely that the  Immigration  Rules  are
    designed to be  a  comprehensive  code  for  the  consideration  of  an
    individual's Article 8 rights and it is only if  there  are  compelling
    circumstances,  beyond  those  envisaged  under  the  Rules,  that   an
    individual may be able to succeed on  Article  8  grounds  outside  the
    Rules.

12. Whereas we appreciate that those decisions were concerned  with  family
    life under Article 8, we do not  consider  that  this  precludes  their
    materiality to the consideration of private life under article 8 in the
    present case.

13. We consider that this omission to  direct  itself  in  accordance  with
    these decisions was an error of law  on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and its  effect  was  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed
    sufficiently to appreciate the hurdle which had to be met by  Mrs  Raj,
    if she was to seek to overturn the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    on Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.

14. We turn then to consider those grounds which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    held to have been established.  Essentially they amounted to  the  fact
    that the First-tier Tribunal was itself satisfied that Mrs Raj did have
    the funds available to her, and that having embarked on her MBA  course
    it concluded that it would be disproportionate not to allow  her  leave
    to remain to complete it.

15. Whilst we have some sympathy with these sentiments, regrettably they do
    not take into account other jurisprudence in this area.  Not only  does
    S.85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  mean  that
    decisions of the Secretary  of  State  are  to  be  considered  by  the
    Tribunal  on  the  basis  of  the  documentation  provided   with   the
    application, but it has been made clear in a number of decisions that a
    Tribunal is not entitled to allow appeals because of near misses in the
    documentation  including  Miah  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, Alam v SSHD [2012]  EWCA  Civ  960  and
    Raju v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 754.

16. Whilst we appreciate that in this case  the  First-tier  Tribunal  also
    held that, but for the floods in India  the  documentation  could  have
    been available, we also note that not  only  had  Mrs  Raj  delayed  in
    making her application to the last moment, but the  documentation  from
    the sponsor was in any event defective.  In these circumstances, we  do
    not consider that this  factor,  taken  singly  or  together  with  the
    others, amounted to a sufficiently compelling reason for  consideration
    of Mrs Raj's Article 8 rights outside the Rules.

17. As Lord Carnwath made clear in Patel v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 at paragraph
    57:

         "It is important to remember  that  article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the  Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right.  The merits of
         a decision not to depart from  the  rules  are  not  reviewable  on
         appeal: section 86(6).  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in
         Pankina for 'common sense' in  the  application  of  the  rules  to
         graduates who have been studying in the UK for some years (see para
         47 above).  However,  such  considerations  do  not  by  themselves
         provide grounds of appeal under article 8, which is concerned  with
         private or family life, not education as such.  The opportunity for
         a promising student to complete his course in this country, however
         desirable in general terms, is not  in  itself  a  right  protected
         under article 8."

18. Accordingly, not only have we reached the conclusion that the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal exhibited an incorrect approach to the issue
    that was raised before it on appeal, but  we  also  consider  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was not entitled to conclude  that  the  identified
    factors relating to Mrs Raj's Article 8 rights  were  ones  capable  of
    being sufficiently compelling to have merited consideration outside the
    Rules.

19. Accordingly, as we have concluded that the First-tier Tribunal erred in
    law we set aside the decision of that Tribunal.  We remake the decision
    and dismiss the appeals of both Mrs Raj and Mr  Avula  which  stand  or
    fall together.
