Representation:
For the Appellant:         Mr C Appiah, Counsel instructed under the public
access scheme
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines, born 1st April 1984.  On
    13 June 2014 she applied for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Migrant pursuant to paragraph 245ZX  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  This
    application was refused by the Respondent in a decision  dated  8  July
    2014 and on the same date the Respondent made a decision to remove  the
    appellant  pursuant  to  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant provided two bank statements to the respondent  with  her
    application, each relating to the same account held by her at a  London
    branch of the Metro Bank. The first bank statement provides an 'Account
    Summary' from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 2014 and  includes  details  of  the
    balance of the account on any given date as well  as  the  transactions
    that took place in relation to such account  during  this  period.  The
    second statement from  the  Metro  Bank  is  dated  10  June  2014  and
    specifies an opening balance of  �891.23  on  2  May  2014,  a  closing
    balance of �2100.89 and details of the transactions which took place in
    relation to the account in the intervening period.

 3. In her decision of 8 July the respondent concluded that  the  appellant
    was required to demonstrate that she had held a sum  of  �1600  in  her
    bank account for a consecutive 28 day  period  prior  to  the  date  of
    application. She then identifies the relevant 28 day  period  as  being
    between 3 May 2014 and 30 May 2014, concluding that the  appellant  had
    not held the necessary funds in the account  continuously  during  such
    period.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision to the First-tier  Tribunal.  This
    appeal was dismissed by Judge Saffer in a determination promulgated  on
    1 October 2014. The matter comes before us with the permission of Judge
    De Haney, granted on 26 November 2014.

 5. At the hearing before us Mr Walker conceded  that  (i)  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination contains an error on a point of law and should
    be set aside and (ii) that the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration  Rules  and  consequently  that  her
    appeal should be allowed. This had also been our preliminary  view  and
    we now briefly set out the reasons why this is so.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal erred, as did the Secretary of State, by, inter
    alia, failing to correctly identify the appropriate start and end dates
    for the relevant 28-day period during which the appellant was  required
    to demonstrate that she  had  continuously  held  the  necessary  funds
    (�1600) in her account.

 7. By paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C to the Immigration Rules the end  date
    of the relevant 28 day period is to  "be  taken  as  the  date  of  the
    closing balance on the most recent of the  specified  documents..."  In
    the instant matter the date of the closing balance on the  most  recent
    bank statement from Metro Bank is the 10 June 2014. The relevant 28-day
    period for  the  purposes  of  Appendix  C  to  the  Immigration  Rules
    therefore begins on 13 May 2014 and ends on 10 June  2014.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal incorrectly identified the end date for the 28 day period
    as being the 3 June 2014 and subsequently dismissed the appeal  on  the
    basis that the appellant held less than �1600 in her bank account on  9
    May 2014.

 8. This error was material  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination
    because when one analyses the bank statement of  10  June  2014  it  is
    plain  that  the  appellant  held  in  excess  �1600  in  this  account
    continuously between 13 May 2014 and 10 June 2014.  She  therefore  met
    the maintenance requirements set  out  in  Appendix  C  of  the  Rules.
    Accordingly we set aside the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

 9. The respondent has not identified any other reasons why it is said that
    the appellant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX of  the
    Rules and we have found the respondent  to  be  incorrect  in  the  one
    reason she did seek to rely  upon.   We  therefore  conclude  that  the
    appellant meets the requirements of paragraph 245ZX of the  Immigration
    Rules and her appeal is accordingly allowed.

Decision

For the reasons given above:

      i) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside; and
     ii) Upon re-making the decision for ourselves we allow the  appellant's
         appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State's decision was  not
         in accordance with the Immigration Rules.
