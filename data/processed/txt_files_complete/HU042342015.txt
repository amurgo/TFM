Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Colvin promulgated on 30 November 2016.


2.   Although before me the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is
    the Appellant  and  Ms  Fadeni  is  the  Respondent  for  the  sake  of
    consistency with the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall
    hereafter refer to Ms Fadeni as the  Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of
    State as the Respondent.


3.   The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 10  January  1973.   She
    first entered the United Kingdom on 1 March 2006 with  entry  clearance
    as a visitor.  On 7 August 2006 she made an application  for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of Mr Fadeni Festus  Omoshola.   That  application
    was granted on 13 September 2006 with leave  until  30  November  2006.
    Thereafter she made a series  of  'in-time'  applications  for  further
    leave to remain and was granted variations of leave up until a  refusal
    in March 2010.  However, subsequent  to  that  refusal  the  Respondent
    reconsidered the Appellant's case and she was again granted leave until
    8 August 2012.  She thereafter secured further leave until 14 September
    2014, and then on 6 September 2014  she  made  an  application  as  the
    spouse of a settled person,  her  husband  having  acquired  indefinite
    leave to remain by that time.   That  application  was  granted  on  15
    October 2014 and the Appellant was granted leave  to  remain  until  15
    April 2017.


4.   It may be seen in those circumstances that the Appellant's leave  would
    have run to a point just over 11 years after her initial entry  to  the
    UK.  During the whole of that period the Appellant has  made  'in-time'
    applications all of which  were  in  due  course  successful.   She  is
    plainly an individual who has at all material times complied  with  the
    requirements of immigration control.


5.   On 30 April 2015 the  Appellant  made  an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain relying in particular upon her long residence in the UK
    with reference  to  paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    covering  letter  with  the  application  drafted  by   representatives
    (different from the  current  representatives)  erroneously  repeatedly
    asserts that the Appellant has completed more  than  10  years  in  the
    United Kingdom.  In fact, as may be seen from the  chronology,  at  the
    time of the application the Appellant was just over 10 months early  in
    making an application based on paragraph 276B.


6.   The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for reasons set  out
    in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL')  dated  28  July  2015.   In
    particular it was noted that a period of only 9 years and 4 months  had
    elapsed and therefore the Appellant could  not  demonstrate  10  years'
    continuous lawful residence and so did not satisfy the requirements  of
    paragraph 276B(i)(a).


7.   The RFRL went on to give consideration to  the  Appellant's  case  with
    reference to Appendix FM, it being identified that the Appellant had  a
    settled partner and also three children in the UK.  In respect  of  the
    children, whose dates of  birth  are  variously  20  October  2006,  21
    November 2009 and 3 July 2013, it is apparent  that  each  of  them  is
    eligible to apply for British citizenship.


8.   After consideration of the various provisions of Appendix FM,  and  the
    consequent potential routes to settlement  were  leave  to  be  granted
    pursuant to  any  of  those  provisions,  the  Respondent  reached  the
    entirely sustainable conclusion  that  it  would  in  fact  be  to  the
    Appellant's disadvantage to place her on what would  effectively  be  a
    new 10 year route to settlement.  Accordingly the Respondent determined
    that the most appropriate course of action would be  simply  to  refuse
    the application but to leave the  Appellant's  still  extant  leave  to
    remain in place.  Her extant leave,  as  has  already  been  indicated,
    conferred leave until 15 April 2017.


9.   It was also expressly noted in the  RFRL  that  this  would  allow  the
    Appellant to make an application based on 10 years'  continuous  lawful
    residence in due course - that is in practice once the date of 4  March
    2016 had been reached - albeit the RFRL contained the caveat that  this
    was on the assumption of no change in the  Rules  and  nothing  adverse
    happening between the date of the decision letter  and  any  subsequent
    application.


10.  Be that as it may, the Appellant  elected  to  appeal.   Her  right  of
    appeal to the Tribunal, as again identified in the RFRL,  was  pursuant
    to section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  but
    limited to the ground that the decision was unlawful under section 6 of
    the Human Rights Act 1998 pursuant to  the  amendments  to  the  appeal
    regime introduced by the Immigration Act 2014:  see  sections  82(1)(b)
    and 84(2) of the 2002 Act.


11.  I pause to note that there are two aspects  of  the  case  that  appear
    curious.   The  first  is  the  premature  timing  of  the  Appellant's
    application. As I have indicated, the representatives' letter seems  to
    be premised on the  erroneous  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  already
    completed 10 years: on its face there would appear to be scope for some
    concern as to the extent to  which  her  advisers  had  understood  the
    factual  situation  and/or  the  competency  of  the  advice  that  the
    Appellant might have received in respect of making the  application  so
    prematurely.


12.  The other perhaps curious aspect is the Appellant's election to  appeal
    the decision rather than simply await the passage of time  until  March
    2016 and then make a further application.  This matter is alluded to in
    the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 4  where  it
    is recorded that the Appellant had indicated "that she did not consider
    making a settlement application after the refusal decision as this  was
    too expensive".  In this regard by way of  'rough-and-ready  reckoning'
    Mr Gaffar has told me today that  the  approximate  difference  between
    pursuing such an application and pursuing an appeal  might  be  in  the
    order of ï¿½1,000.


13.  Be that as it may, the Appellant pursued her appeal and it was  allowed
    by the First-tier Tribunal Judge for reasons set out in  his  Decision.
    The Respondent has sought to challenge the  Decision  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page on 31 May 2017.


14.  I have  little  hesitation  in  agreeing  with  the  substance  of  the
    Respondent's challenge.  I have already indicated that the scope of the
    appeal was restricted to human rights grounds  by  virtue  of  sections
    82(1)(b) and 84(2) of the 2002 Act.   Whilst  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge purports to recognise this at paragraph 5  of  his  Decision,  he
    immediately thereafter goes on to state that the task for the Appellant
    was "to  show  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  [she  met]  the
    requirements of either the relevant  immigration  rules  or  Article  8
    outside of the Rules" (my emphasis).


15.  Indeed, in due course, it is clear from  paragraph  6  that  the  Judge
    simply allowed the appeal on the basis  that  it  was  considered  that
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules was satisfied. In  terms  under
    the heading 'Notice of Decision'  the  Judge  states:  "The  appeal  is
    allowed under the Immigration Rules".  In  context,  in  a  very  brief
    decision it is transparent that the Judge simply allowed the appeal  on
    the basis that it was agreed as a preliminary  matter  at  the  hearing
    that the Appellant could by that time demonstrate 10 years'  continuous
    lawful residence in the UK (see paragraph 3).


16.  In my judgment this  constitutes  a  clear  error  in  respect  of  the
    Tribunal's jurisdiction.


17.  I note that Mr Gaffar has today sought to persuade me  that  the  Judge
    did not fall into error by referring to the  Appellant's  'Section  120
    Notice' and the case of Jaff (s.120  notice;  statement  of  additional
    grounds) Iraq [2012] UKUT 00396 (IAC).   I  am  afraid  I  consider  Mr
    Gaffar's submissions in this  regard  to  be  misconceived.   There  is
    nothing in the case of Jaff that  permits  the  Tribunal  to  assume  a
    jurisdiction it quite simply does not have simply by reason of  matters
    being raised in a Section 120 Notice.


18.  The Respondent additionally raises in her Grounds of  Appeal  that  the
    error of jurisdiction is not simply  immaterial  in  this  regard.   In
    particular, reference is made in the Grounds  to  the  public  interest
    question under  Article  8(2)  and  the  analogous  balancing  exercise
    required to be conducted pursuant to paragraph 276B, and it  is  argued
    that no such exercise was undertaken either by the  Respondent  in  the
    RFRL (for the simple  reason  that  it  was  not  necessary  where  the
    Appellant had not completed 10 years'  lawful  residence),  or  by  the
    Tribunal.


19.  Whilst factually this is correct, it might also  be  observed  that  on
    the face of it no countervailing factors are  readily  identifiable  in
    the Appellant's case such as would weigh significantly against the fact
    of 10 years' continuous lawful residence.


20.  However,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  situation  is  one  of  greater
    difficulty for the Appellant.  Had the Judge properly  recognised  that
    his jurisdiction was limited to the ECHR  grounds,  and  in  particular
    Article 8, it would - or at least should - have been  readily  apparent
    that the Respondent's decision was not unlawful under section 6 of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998 because it left the Appellant with  extant  leave
    and thereby did not interfere in any way with her enjoyment  of  family
    and private life in the United Kingdom. I do not see how the  Appellant
    could possibly have succeeded in this appeal on  human  rights  grounds
    alone.


21.  Accordingly, if I am to set aside the Decision  of  the  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal it seems to me  inevitable  that  in  remaking  the
    decision under human rights grounds the  appeal  would  require  to  be
    dismissed.  I have given some consideration therefore to the discretion
    conferred upon the Tribunal  by  virtue  of  section  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 such that even if  there  is
    an error of law the  Tribunal  is  not  duty-bound  to  set  aside  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal.    I   have   given   careful
    consideration to this because inevitably matters have  moved  on  since
    the date of the Respondent's decision - as indeed was recognised by the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge (and informed the basis of the outcome before
    the First-tier Tribunal).


22.  In this regard it is to be noted that the Appellant has  been  lawfully
    present in the United Kingdom since March 2006, has, as I have  already
    indicated, at all times complied  with  immigration  control,  and  was
    ultimately granted periods of leave in excess of  11  years.   She  has
    previously been granted periods of leave 'in-line' with her spouse  who
    is now settled in the United Kingdom, and their three children are  all
    eligible for British citizenship.  The Appellant has provided  evidence
    of her English language skills and a 'Life in the UK' test.   There  is
    much of merit in this case  which  might  suggest  that  the  Appellant
    deserves a successful outcome in her appeal.


23.  However, Mr Whitwell argues that the Tribunal should not  exercise  the
    discretion under section 12(2)(a) to  uphold  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision.  I agree with his submission: ultimately it would not
    be appropriate to use the discretion to  uphold  a  Decision  which  is
    founded on a fundamental lack of jurisdiction, no matter  the  apparent
    merits of the case and the possible practicality of such a resolution.


24.  Further to this Mr Whitwell notes  that  ultimately  the  Appellant  is
    unlikely to be prejudiced in terms of her immigration position.  It  is
    still open to her to make an application under  paragraph  276B  again.
    As things stand at the moment, she  has  statutorily  varied  leave  to
    remain and has at no point breached immigration control;  she  may  yet
    make  an  'in-time'  application  prior  to  becoming  'appeal   rights
    exhausted'.  In any event Mr Whitwell has directed my attention to page
    9 of 43 of the Respondent's 'Long Residence' instruction (version 15.0,
    3 April 2017), which indicates that once 10 years lawful residence  has
    been completed an  applicant  is  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit  of
    paragraph 276B even if his or her application  is  made  at  some  time
    later. It states in material part: "Once an applicant has  built  up  a
    period of 10 years continuous lawful residence, there is  no  limit  on
    the length of time afterwards when they  can  apply.  This  means  they
    could leave the UK,  re-enter  on  any  lawful  basis,  and  apply  for
    settlement from within the UK based on a 10 year period  of  continuous
    lawful residence they built up in the past. There is  also  nothing  to
    prevent a person relying on a 10 year period that they may have  relied
    on in a previous application or grant."  (I note,  without  making  any
    decision in this regard, that this would appear to reflect the  wording
    of paragraph 276B(i) which uses the phrase "he has  had  at  least  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the  United  Kingdom",  with  the
    emphasis on the words 'has had'.)


25.  So far as the additional  cost  that  that  might  be  involved,  well,
    bluntly, so be it.  It may be a matter for the  Appellant  to  consider
    whether she has any remedy against her previous advisers in respect  of
    monies wasted on a premature application and whether that might  assist
    her in meeting her future expenses - but that is not a matter for me.


26.  Accordingly, in all the circumstances I reach the conclusion  that  the
    Decision of the First-tier Tribunal was in error  of  law  because  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  recognise  the  limit  of  his
    jurisdiction and  wrongly  allowed  the  appeal  by  reference  to  the
    Immigration Rules.  In those circumstances the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside.  I remake the decision  with  reference  to
    human rights grounds, but for  the  reasons  identified  above,  in  my
    judgment, it is inevitable that the appeal must  fail  and  accordingly
    the appeal is dismissed.


Notice of Decision

    law and is set aside.
