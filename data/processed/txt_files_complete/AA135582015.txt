               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant sought asylum in the UK, saying that he was a Syrian Kurd
    who had deserted from the army.

 2. The respondent refused his claim by a decision dated 1 December 2015:

    �15 - 16, language analysis showed that he spoke Kurdish Bardini  found
    in Iraq, not Syria;

    �17 - 18, his knowledge was not consistent with his claimed nationality
    - he could not name the rebel groups fighting the army, and thought the
    President was a Sunni Muslim not an Alawi;

    �20 - 23, not accepted to be Syrian or a deserter.

 3. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT state that  he  is  Syrian
    and a deserter.

 4. The proceedings in the FtT were adjourned several  times,  because  the
    appellant produced a Syrian family book and identity  card,  which  the
    respondent proposed to verify, and because the  appellant  intended  to
    obtain an expert report on his  language,  documentation  and  national
    identity.

 5. The respondent provided a statement by Ms Timms, assistant  immigration
    officer, dated 22 November 2016, and  reports  on  the  two  documents,
    dated 11 October 2016, opining that the family  book  was  counterfeit,
    and that the identity document, being a photocopy, was unverifiable.

 6. On 15 December 2016 the FtT issued directions, inter alia requiring the
    respondent to provide "details of the qualifications and experience  of
    Ms Timms in assessing documents".

 7. The respondent did not comply with those directions.

 8. The appellant did not provide an expert report.

 9.  FtT  Judge  Mill  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a  decision
    promulgated on 11 July 2017.  His decision includes the following:

         "24.     Not only can I not rely upon the copy Syrian ID  card  and
         family book ... but a more significant difficulty  arises.   I  now
         approach the matter having concluded that  the  appellant  has  ...
         lodged fraudulent documents  ...  this  significantly  reduces  his
         credibility.

         25.      The appellant does not provide convincing knowledge  about
         life in Syria  ...  He  also  provides  very  skeletal  detail  ...
         regarding the reasons why he fled ...

         ...

         32.      The core of the ... claim is not  detailed  nor  plausible
         ... his  knowledge  is  substantially  lacking.   He  has  produced
         documents ... one of which is fraudulent ... The linguistic  report
         is supportive of the fact that he is not Syrian ..."

10. The appellant's 3  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  set  out  in  his
    application for permission dated 24 July 2017, may shortly be put thus:

         (1)      The respondent failed to provide evidence which  justified
         the judge's finding that documentation was counterfeit; the witness
         did not attend; her training, length  of  service  and  familiarity
         with Syrian documentation were not stated; the alleged anomalies in
         the documentation were not explained; the judge "failed to properly
         consider  documentary  evidence   relating   to   the   appellant's
         nationality".

         (2)      The appellant was asked about Syria at interview, Q/A  150
         - 193, and got only  5  answers  wrong;  he  demonstrated  adequate
         knowledge;  the  judge  failed  to   scrutinise   this,   and   the
         explanations for such deficiencies as the respondent had found, and
         "failed to  take  account  of  accurate  information  and  evidence
         provided by the appellant and, therefore, materially erred  in  law
         in his assessment of the appellant's nationality".

         (3)      It was highlighted to the judge that the appellant's  home
         village was  three  kilometres  south  of  the  Iraqi  border;  the
         respondent failed to disclose this to the  language  analysts;  the
         judge correctly found the report not determinative, but  failed  to
         take account of its acknowledged limitations and the facts "that it
         is more likely to be an accurate guide of where the  appellant  was
         socialised [and] that  the  appellant  resided  within  very  close
         proximity to the border between Syria and Iraq".

11. On 15 December 2017 FtT Judge Hollingworth granted  permission,  taking
    the view that the following points were arguable:  the  judge  did  not
    sufficiently analyse the nature and extent  of  the  experience  of  Ms
    Timms; the finding that the family book was  fraudulent  attracted  too
    much weight in the credibility analysis; that analysis was  effectively
    concluded at �24; and the appellant's  demonstration  of  knowledge  at
    Q/A150 - 193 might have required a fuller analysis.

12. In a rule 24 response to the grant of permission  the  respondent  says
    that the judge considered all the evidence  and  conducted  a  detailed
    analysis, and that "the lengthy grounds in essence  do  not  amount  to
    more than disagreement".

13. By letter dated  9  April  2018  the  respondent  applies  for  further
    evidence to be admitted.  It is conceded that there  has  been  lengthy
    delay and that the information should  have  been  before  the  FtT  in
    compliance with directions.  The evidence is an  email  from  Ms  Timms
    explaining her training and experience  in  document  examination,  her
    source of information about safeguards identifiable in  genuine  Syrian
    family books, and further details of the absence of  such  features  in
    the document produced by the appellant.

14. Mr Martin' submissions were along the lines of the grounds.   The  main
    further points I noted were these:

      i) The further evidence should not be admitted, as it could and should
         have been available to the FtT, and it came extremely late.

     ii) The point suggested by the grant of  permission  was  adopted:  the
         adverse conclusion was  reached  prematurely  at  �24,  and  little
         weight was given to anything else.

    iii) An appellant might not be wholly  reliable,  and  might  even  have
         unwisely fabricated part of his account, yet  be  reliable  on  its
         core - which in this case was simply nationality.

     iv) The appellant had not produced an expert  report,  but  that  would
         test the language  he  spoke  not  his  nationality,  a  limitation
         recognised in the  report  produced  by  the  respondent.   He  had
         advanced a significant explanation in his evidence,  the  situation
         of  his  home  near  the  border,  which  was  fluid  rather   than
         watertight, so that the report should have  been  given  much  less
         significance.

      v) Even if the further evidence was admitted,  there  would  still  be
         enough force in the grounds to require a remit to the FtT.

15. The main points which I noted from the submissions by Mr Matthews  were
    these:

      i) There was enough in the witness statement by Ms Timms from which it
         could sensibly be read in that she  had  appropriate  training  and
         experience  for  the  role  in  which  she  was  employed  by   the
         respondent.

     ii) The original report on the family document was brief but sufficient
         to justify its conclusion.

    iii) If the further evidence was not admitted by the UT, and there was a
         further hearing, the evidence would be considered at that stage  (a
         point which Mr Martin, realistically, accepted).  There would be no
         useful purpose in deferring any issue to a further hearing.

     iv) The evidence from Ms Timms in its full form was more than enough to
         discharge the onus on the respondent to show the  documentation  to
         be fraudulent.

      v) It was telling that although the appellant  had  indicated  that  a
         report would been forthcoming  from  Dr  Fatah,  a  well-known  and
         respected exert in this area, no report was ever  forthcoming,  and
         no explanation for its absence was offered.

     vi) Analysis of the interview  showed  that  the  suggestion  that  the
         appellant  was  mostly  right  on  45  nationality  questions   was
         misleading.  Most of those questions did  not  go  to  nationality.
         The wrong answers  were  telling,  as  identified  in  the  refusal
         letter, and in further detail: e.g., he claimed to have  served  in
         the Syrian army, but did not know that most  of  its  officers  are
         Alawi; he did not know the name given to Kurds in Syria who do  not
         have full nationality.

16. Having considered the grounds and submissions, I find that no error  of
    law by the FtT has been shown.

17. The judge quoted at �21 the reasons by the document examiner and  found
    them cogent: "The document is entirely inkjet printed, the corners  are
    hand cut, there is printed simulation of embedded fibres.   The  needle
    perforation is of poor quality, the serial number on the  front  inside
    cover is inkjet printed.  None of this is expected  in  a  document  of
    this type."

18. Those reasons are briefly expressed, but it was well within the judge's
    scope to consider that the examiner knew what to look for, and that the
    features mentioned all pertain to a fraudulent document and not to  one
    officially produced by the Syrian government.

19. At �24 the judge went on to give that finding no more  weight  that  he
    was entitled to do.

20. Ground (1), even without further evidence being admitted to counter it,
    is not made out.

21. Ground (2) glosses  over  the  significant  areas  of  the  appellant's
    ignorance.  The judge was entitled to find that he did not  know  basic
    matters about officers and opponents which would have been  obvious  to
    someone who had served in the Syrian army.

22. As to ground (3), the judge noted the appellant's claim  to  come  from
    near the northern part of the Iraqi Kurdish region and found that to be
    of some relevance, but not materially to undermine  the  report,  which
    was not taken as determinative (�16) but  only  as  supportive  of  his
    conclusions (�32).

23.  Grounds (2) and (3) are only insistence and disagreement on the facts.

24. The application to admit further evidence came very  late.  However,  I
    would admit it even at the "error of law" stage, because (a) procedural
    shortcomings of the respondent  should  not  enable  the  appellant  to
    benefit from the use of  fraud  and  (b)  as  Mr  Martin  acknowledged,
    victory on this point was likely to be Pyrrhic, as the further evidence
    would come into play if the decision were to be remade.

25. In her recent email Ms Timms makes it clear that she has  had  training
    and that examination of documents for fraud has been part of her  daily
    duties since 2004.  Information  about  safeguards  in  genuine  Syrian
    family documents comes from the Dutch government, a  reputable  source.
    She provides some further detail, explaining that security  fibres  are
    embedded randomly within the paper of a genuine  document  rather  than
    printed on the paper as in the questioned document.

26. If ground (1) had been found to disclose error, I  would  have  had  no
    difficulty on all the evidence  in  substituting  a  further  decision,
    dismissing the appeal.

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

28. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
