Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs. Cleghorn, Counsel, instructed by N.C.Brothers

For the respondent:    Ms. Petersen, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

          1. Although the Secretary of State  is  the  appellant  in  these
             proceedings for convenience I will continue to  refer  to  the
             parties hereinafter as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

          2. The appellant is a national of Nepal born  on  the  18th  June
             1988. He applied for settlement as a dependent of his  father,
             Mr Nariman Pun, a former Gurkha.  His  application  for  entry
             clearance was refused on 12 January 2016. His parents came  to
             the United Kingdom on 10 September 2011. The  entry  clearance
             officer was not satisfied he was dependent upon them. No other
             features were identified justifying leave on  a  discretionary
             basis.

          3. His appeal was heard in Birmingham on  3  August  2017  before
             Judge Watson of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In  the  decision
             promulgated on 9 August 2017  the  appeal  was  allowed  under
             article 8. It was common case that the appellant did not  meet
             the immigration rules .The judge concluded  that  family  life
             existed, with the appellant being financially and  emotionally
             dependent upon his parents. Following  from  this,  the  judge
             concluded the decision was disproportionate.

    The Upper Tribunal

          4. The respondent  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal on the basis that the judge had  not  given  adequate
             reasons  for  finding  a  dependency.  Reference  is  made  to
             paragraph 35 of AAO -v- Entry Clearance  Officer  [2011]  EWCA
             Civ 840 where it was said that for family life to exist within
             the meaning of  article  8  in  the  case  of  adults  it  was
             necessary to show a dependency which went  beyond  the  normal
             emotional ties. The grounds also argued that the decision  did
             not take into  account  the  public  interest  in  immigration
             control. Reference was made to section 117 B and  the  absence
             of evidence that the appellant could integrate  into  life  in
             the United Kingdom, particularly as no findings had been  made
             on his ability to speak English. It was also argued  that  the
             judge  misdirected  themselves  on  the   historic   injustice
             argument and made assumptions about what might have happened.

          5. Permission was granted on  the  basis  it  was  arguable  that
             inadequate reasons had been  given  for  finding  family  life
             existed and that the judge had failed to  balance  the  public
             interest  in  immigration  control  against  the   appellant's
             interests.

          6. Ms. Petersen at hearing relied upon  the  grounds  upon  which
             permission was granted. She submitted the judge  was  required
             to take into account the appellant's policy in considering the
             appeal. Mrs. Cleghorn in response argued that  the  judge  had
             indicated an awareness of the policy by acknowledging that  it
             could not be met. She submitted that the judge had applied the
             correct test and followed the guidance given in  Rai  -v-  ECO
             [2017] EWCA Civ 320. She submitted the respondent  should  not
             rely upon section 117 B in a Gurkha case in light of what  was
             said by the Court of Appeal in Rai -v- ECO at para 56 .

          7. Both representatives were in  agreement  that  if  I  found  a
             material error of law the matter should  be  remitted  for  de
             novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal

    Consideration

          8. In Rai -v- ECO  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  320  the  Court  of  Appeal
             considered the meaning of family life between  adults  in  the
             context of article 8. In that, case as is the  position  here,
             the appellant  did  not  meet  the  terms  of  the  rules.  At
             paragraph 17 Lord Justice Lindblom referred  to  Lord  Justice
             Arden at paragraph 24 of Kugathas -v- SSHD [2003]  EWCA  Civ31
             and the need to identify the near relatives; the nature of the
             links between them; the age of the  appellant  and  where  and
             with whom he has resided and the contact maintained since. She
             acknowledged  at  paragraph  25  that  family  life   is   not
             established between an adult  child  and  parent  or  siblings
             unless something more exists than normal  emotional  ties.  In
             Ghising( family life-adults - Gurkha policy the Upper Tribunal
             accepted that Kugathas had been interpreted too  restrictively
             and that family  life  could  be  found  without  evidence  of
             exceptional dependency.

          9. The judge's decision sets out the background. The  appellant's
             parents came to the United Kingdom in order to  settle  on  10
             September 2011. At that stage the appellant  was  23.  He  was
             single. The appellant has two younger siblings, a brother  and
             sisters, who were under 18. They came with  their  parents  to
             the United Kingdom leaving the appellant behind. Rai  -v-  ECO
             at paragraphs 38 and 42 emphasise  that  the  fact  a  sponsor
             chose to leave is a matter of financial reality and  does  not
             detract from the existence of family life.  The  situation  at
             that time and up to the present has to be considered. He lives
             alone in rented accommodation. The  judge  accepted  that  the
             appellant and his parents and younger siblings formed a family
             unit until the  separation.  The  appellant  has  three  older
             siblings; a brother and two sisters who remain in  Nepal,  are
             married and live away from the family home.

         10. The appellant's father visited him in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
             judge accepted that the appellant  was  financially  dependent
             upon his sponsor and concluded that he  was  also  emotionally
             dependent  upon  his  parents.  The  judge  referred  to   the
             continuing contact between them and found article 8 engaged.

         11. By the time of the refusal letter the appellant was  27  years
             of age. He had no medical conditions or disability. Whilst  he
             claimed to be unemployed and to be financially dependent  upon
             his sponsor the entry clearance officer  felt  it  was  highly
             unlikely he would not have worked in the  past.  He  submitted
             some recent money transfers from his  sponsor  but  the  entry
             clearance  officer  was  not   satisfied   this   demonstrated
             financial dependence  on  his  parents.  The  entry  clearance
             officer did not accept the existence of family life  over  and
             above that between an adult child and his parents.

         12. I  find  Judge  Watson  has  made  bare  assertions  that  the
             appellant is financially and emotionally  dependent  upon  the
             sponsor. The evidence before the judge  was  limited  and  the
             sponsor in his statement said he had  not  kept  documentation
             because he did not realise the importance of it.

         13.  Whether   family   life   exists   requires   an   evaluative
             consideration of all the relevant facts of the particular case
             and the decision is very fact sensitive. The Court  of  Appeal
             in Rai -v-  ECO  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  320  sets  out  the  legal
             principles at paragraph 17  and  18  words  of  the  decision.
             Whether family life exists requires a careful consideration of
             all the relevant facts. There  is  no  self-direction  in  the
             decision on this but this is not fatal. However, it cannot  be
             inferred that the necessary principles have been applied.  The
             judge needed to have set out the ongoing contact  and  support
             given from when the sponsor and his  wife  left.  It  was  not
             sufficient to simply make  a  statement.  The  judge  has  not
             explained what it  is  about  the  situation  which  makes  it
             different from the norm whereby  adult  children  and  parents
             maintain contact but are independent.

         14. It is my conclusion  that  First-tier  Judge  Watson  did  not
             adequately set out the basis for concluding that  family  life
             existed. Until this is done the matter cannot proceed  to  the
             proportionality stage. The decision is based on  what  amounts
             to mere statements without explaining precisely the evidential
             basis. For this reason I find the judge  materially  erred  in
             law and the decision will have to be set aside and remade.

         15. I  agree with Mrs. Cleghorn's contention that  section  117  A
             and B of the 2002 Act , in line with the comments at paragraph
             55 onwards of  the  Court  of  Appeal  would  not  affect  the
             outcome. However, for the reasons I have stated the deficiency
             relates to the preliminary issue of whether family life exists
             in  the  circumstance.   Until   this   is   established   the
             proportionality issue does not arise.

    Decision.

    The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson  allowing  the  appeal
    materially erred in law and cannot be sustained. The appeal is remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

    Directions.

          1. The appeal of remitted for de novo hearing in  the  First-tier
             Tribunal excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson.

          2. The  appeal  was  previously  listed  in  Birmingham  and  the
             appellant's representatives should advise if this is  still  a
             convenient venue. It seems likely that a Nepalese  interpreter
             will be required but the First-tier Tribunal office should  be
             advised by the appellant's representative.

          3. In preparing for the appeal the representative should  provide
             up-to-date evidence to show the historic and ongoing nature of
             the contact and support between the parties. Any  evidence  as
             to the appellant's circumstances in Nepal would be helpful.

          4. It is anticipated the hearing would take 1 � hours.
