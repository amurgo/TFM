                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to by  the  parties.
The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face  to  face  hearing
was not held because  it  was  not  practicable  and  all  issues  could  be
determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing I  reserved
my decisions and reasons, which I now give. The order made is  described  at
the end of these reasons.


 1. The appellant, who is a national of Jamaica with date of birth given as
    3.2.79, has appealed with permission to the Upper Tribunal against  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated  10.3.20  (Judge  Ali),
    dismissing on all grounds  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, 13.9.18, to refuse his  human  rights  claim.  This
    followed the decision of 13.7.18, served on 14.8.18, to deport him from
    the UK as a foreign criminal.

 2. The appellant first came to the UK in 2002 with leave to  remain  as  a
    student until 2004. He was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in  2007.
    He has 5  British  citizen  children,  four  of  whom  arise  from  his
    relationship with his ex-wife, whom he divorced in 2016. The eldest  of
    those children is now 16 years of age. He also has a son, born in 2017,
    with his current partner, also British citizens. He claimed  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with all of his children, although  contact
    with the four eldest is limited.

 3. The appellant's antecedent record details a total of 7 convictions  for
    9 criminal offences between 2005 and 2018. He was indicted on two drug-
    dealing offences, possession with intent to supply a Class B controlled
    drugs, namely 30g of cannabis, and possession with intent to  supply  a
    Class A controlled drug, namely 26.5g of cocaine with a purity  of  91%
    and a street value of approximately ï¿½2,000. Having  originally  pleaded
    not guilty, on the day of trial on  5.6.18  he  changed  his  pleas  to
    guilty and was subsequently sentenced on 6.7.18 to a total sentence  of
    immediate imprisonment of 27 months.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the appellant was not as engaged
    with his family members in the UK as claim and that he is not  socially
    or culturally integrated in the UK, despite living  here  for  some  19
    years. The judge  found  that  there  would  not  be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration in Jamaica. At [45] of the  decision,  the
    judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his current partner and his youngest child.  However,
    whilst he had a genuine relationship with the four older  children,  he
    only had  regular  contact  with  the  two  oldest  children  and  very
    infrequent contact with the other two.

 5. At [46] of the decision it was accepted that it would be  unduly  harsh
    to expect either his current partner or any of  the  five  children  to
    leave the UK. However at [47]  of  the  decision,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the criteria in paragraphs 399(a)(i)(b)  or  399(b)(iii)
    were met. It was accepted that "the appellant and  all  of  the  family
    would be devastated  if  he  was  deported,"  but  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that "the adverse impact on them by his removal would be  any
    greater than any other young people." The judge pointed out that he was
    absent from their lives for at least 12 months when  a  non-molestation
    order was in force, and for at least 12 months when he was in prison.

 6. At [49] of the decision the judge  concluded,  "The  rules  contemplate
    family separation and hardship. I am not  satisfied  that  any  of  the
    individual factors or the cumulative set of factors in this family  are
    not contemplated within the rules, or amount to compelling  (let  alone
    very compelling) circumstances over and above the factors described  in
    [399 and 399A] such as to mean that the public  interest  in  deporting
    the appellant is outweighed by the reasons for him being able to stay."

 7. The poorly-drafted grounds of application for permission to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal argue that the First-tier Tribunal failed to provide
    sufficient explanation for dismissing the appeal and applied the  wrong
    standard of proof. It is also submitted that having found a genuine and
    subsisting relationship with his British citizen  partner  and  British
    citizen children and that it would be unduly harsh for  them  to  leave
    the UK, the judge should have found it would be unduly harsh  for  them
    to remain in the UK without  the  appellant.  It  is  argued  that  the
    conclusion to the contrary is "arbitrary". Finally, the  grounds  argue
    that the judge failed to apply article 8 ECHR and to consider the  best
    interests of the children.

 8. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 28.4.20. However, when the application was renewed  to
    the Upper Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Coker  granted  permission  on
    20.7.20, considering it arguable that "having made a  finding  that  it
    would  be  devastating  for  the  children  and  the  appellant  to  be
    separated, the judge has not provided reasons why that would not amount
    to it being unduly harsh although it is not  clear  what  evidence  was
    before the judge to reach that finding in any event."

 9. I have carefully considered the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    the light of  the  submissions  and  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

10. The complaint that the  decision  is  inadequately  reasoned  is  well-
    founded. It is not  clear  on  what  basis  the  judge  concluded  that
    separation of the appellant from  his  current  partner  and  his  five
    children would be devastating. More significantly, apart from the  bare
    finding that it would not be unduly harsh for them to remain in the  UK
    without him, this part of the decision is almost devoid of  any  cogent
    reasoning. It is not clear what evidence was considered or relied on to
    justify the finding. I take on board the point made by Mr McVeety  that
    there was virtually no evidence  from  or  about  the  children's  best
    interests,  what  their  wishes  were,  or  what  the  effect  of   the
    appellant's removal might be on them. However, I am not satisfied  that
    the judge adequately engaged with the test of unduly harsh,  making  no
    reference to the case authorities and little reference  to  the  facts,
    other than as contained in [47] of the decision. Neither  is  it  clear
    why the judge  accepted  that  the  effect  of  his  removal  would  be
    "devastating" on them.

11. The issue as to what is unduly harsh has recently been reconsidered  by
    the Court of Appeal in KB (Jamaica) [2020] EWCA  Civ  1385,  where  the
    following is set out:

         "15.     The meaning of "unduly harsh" in the test provided for  by
         s.117C(5)  has  been  authoritatively  established  by  two  recent
         decisions: that of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of
         State for the Home Department [2018] 1 WLR 5273; and  the  decision
         of this court in HA (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2020] EWCA Civ  117.  It  is  sufficient  to  note  the
         following without the need to quote the relevant passages:

             (1)  The  unduly  harsh  test  is  to  be  determined  without
             reference to the criminality of the parent or the severity  of
             the relevant offences: KO (Nigeria) para 23, reversing in this
             respect the Court of Appeal's decision in that case,  reported
             under the name MM (Uganda) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
             Department [2016] EWCA Civ 617, in which at paragraph 26  Laws
             LJ expressed this court's conclusion  that  the  unduly  harsh
             test required regard  to  be  had  to  all  the  circumstances
             including the criminal's immigration and criminal history.

             (2) "Unduly" harsh requires a degree of harshness  which  goes
             beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child  faced
             with deportation of a parent: KO (Nigeria) para 23.

             (3) That is an elevated test, which carries  a  much  stronger
             emphasis  that  mere  undesirability   or   what   is   merely
             uncomfortable, inconvenient, or difficult; but  the  threshold
             is not as high as the very compelling circumstances test in s.
             117C(6): KO (Nigeria) para 27; HA (Iraq) paras 51-52.

             (4) The formulation in para 23 of KO (Nigeria) does not  posit
             some objectively measurable standard  of  harshness  which  is
             acceptable, and it is potentially misleading and dangerous  to
             seek to identify some "ordinary"  level  of  harshness  as  an
             acceptable  level  by  reference  to  what  may  be   commonly
             encountered circumstances: there is no reason in principle why
             cases of undue hardship may not occur quite commonly; and  how
             a child will be affected by a parent's deportation will depend
             upon an almost infinitely variable range of circumstances;  it
             is not possible to identify a base level of "ordinariness": HA
             (Iraq) paras 44, 50-53, 56 and 157, AA (Nigeria)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1296 at  para
             12.

             (5) Beyond this guidance, further  exposition  of  the  phrase
             will rarely be helpful; and tribunals will not err in  law  if
             they carefully evaluate the effect of the parent's deportation
             on the particular child and then decide whether the effect  is
             not merely harsh but unduly harsh applying the above guidance:
             HA (Iraq) at paras 53 and 57. There is no substitute  for  the
             statutory wording (ibid at para 157)."

12. Whilst the judge referenced MM at [18] of the decision, it is not clear
    that the First-tier Tribunal made any assessment of 'unduly harsh' that
    is consistent with the case guidance then extant,  including  the  more
    recent decisions of the Supreme Court in KO or the Court of  Appeal  in
    HA.

13. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out  above,  I  find  such
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as  to
    require it to be set aside.

14. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal vitiate all other findings of fact and  the  conclusions  from
    those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of  the
    issues in the appeal.

15. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2.

Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.

    The remaking of the decision in the appeal is remitted  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  sitting  at  Bradford,  to  be  remade  afresh  with  no
    preserved findings.

    I make no order for costs.

    I make no anonymity direction.
