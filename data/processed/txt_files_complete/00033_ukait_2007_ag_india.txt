For the Respondent:          Mr O'Leary, Home Office Presenting Officer

The word 'incidental' in paragraph 95(vi) of HC 395 means what it says,  and
embodies a requirement of the Rules.   The  Secretary  of  State  may  grant
leave to enter outside the Rules, but it is not open  to  the  Secretary  of
State to purport to adopt a meaning of the Rules that is contrary  to  their
clear words.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, a citizen of India, applied for entry clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as a working holiday-maker for a  period  of  one  year.
    His application was refused on 10 February 2006.  He  appealed  to  the
    Tribunal and, following a hearing before  an  Immigration  Judge  on  7
    September 2006, his appeal was dismissed.  The appellant  then  applied
    for and was granted an order  for  reconsideration.   Thus  the  matter
    comes before us.

 2. The relevant Immigration Rules are those contained in paragraph  95  of
    the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395, which we  do  not
    need to set out in full.  It does, however, contain  requirements  that
    the applicant:

      "(iv) has the means to pay for his return or onward journey; and
      (v)   is able and intends to maintain and accommodate himself without
             recourse to public funds; and
      (vi)  is intending only to take employment incidental to  a  holiday,
             and not to engage in business, or  to  provide  services  as  a
             professional sports person, and in any event not  to  work  for
             more than 12 months during his stay; and
      ...
      (viii)     intends to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  his
             working holiday".

 3. If the requirements of the Rules are otherwise met, entry clearance and
    accordingly leave to enter, will be for a limited period not  exceeding
    two years.

 4. The Notice of Refusal  issued  to  the  appellant  indicates  that  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of
    sub-paragraphs  (iv),  (v),  (vi)  or  (viii)  of  paragraph  95.   The
    Immigration Judge found at paragraph 11 of her determination  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of sub-paragraph (iv).  She  also  found
    that the sponsor, the  appellant's  uncle,  was  willing  and  able  to
    accommodate him during his stay:  that appears to be a finding that the
    appellant met the requirements of sub-paragraph (v).  We  need  to  set
    out in full the part of her determination in which she deals  with  the
    other issues.

      "15.  The real issue in this case in my view is whether the appellant
             intended to take employment only incidental to a holiday.  I do
             not find the answer easy because although the Rules say that  a
             person  may  work  for  12  months  that  work  must  still  be
             incidental to the holiday and the IDI requires the  holiday  to
             be the main reason for coming here.


      16.   The sponsor stated that the appellant would work 'as he needed'
             and that this would be for personal expenses  such  as  drinks.
             He would not work for more than 15 to 25 hours  per  week.   He
             did not envisage that he would go off on his own other than  to
             stay with family members.  The prospective employers state that
             the appellant would work for 15 hours per week, the times to be
             agreed.  Even if the appellant were to work for only  15  hours
             and paid the minimum wage as promised by the employer, he would
             earn �300 per month as opposed to the �62 he receives from  his
             father.  If he worked for 25  hours  he  would  earn  �500  per
             month.  This seems to me to amount  to  far  more  than  pocket
             money  for  incidentals  and  would  allow   him   to   acquire
             substantial savings by Indian  standards.   The  sponsor  works
             full time and given that the appellant apparently had not plans
             to go off alone I find it far more  likely  than  not  that  he
             planned to work for the full 25 hours per week throughout  most
             of his stay here.


      17.   It is not clear from the Rules or the IDI whether a person  who
             is not planning to stay for the full two years may nevertheless
             work for 12 months.  It seems to me that each case must  depend
             on its own facts.  There are situations where the  only  way  a
             person may visit another country for any length of time can  do
             so only by funding the cost of the trip  through  working.   In
             this situation I would consider  that  even  so  the  work  was
             incidental because it supported the holiday.  This is  not  the
             position here however.  The appellant is not having to pay  for
             board and lodging or family outings; at most he  is  having  to
             pay for personal incidentals.


      18.   I accept it is important for the appellant to spent  time  with
             his family in the UK and I am sure that they will take him  out
             and about here during their free time.  However I find in  this
             case that  the  employment  would  not  be  incidental  to  the
             holiday.


      19.   I have considered whether the fact that the appellant would  be
             able to take back substantial savings by the standards  of  his
             own country prejudices him  compared  with  say  an  Australian
             where such sums would be irrelevant and would probably  not  be
             taken into consideration in one's findings because there is not
             such a difference in earnings between the  countries,  but  for
             that very reason such a situation is unlikely to arise.


      20.   I have  also  considered  whether  my  findings  prejudice  the
             appellant because he has family here who are willing to support
             him, but I do not think that they do.  The  situation  is  that
             the appellant does not have to work to fund  his  holiday.   He
             has not given any explanation how working for a friend  of  the
             family as a labourer would benefit him in cultural terms and  I
             cannot see that it would.  Thus my view that he is coming  here
             mainly to work  is  reinforced.   This  in  turn  leads  me  to
             conclude that the appellant did not  intend  to  leave  the  UK
             after 12 months."

    There is no  other  reference  to  the  requirements  of  sub-paragraph
(viii).

 5. Before us Mr O'Leary on behalf of the respondent  produced  a  skeleton
    argument dated the day before the hearing.  We shall have to return  to
    some of its submissions in more detail, but we turn first to  the  part
    entitled "The issues for reconsideration".  That part of  the  skeleton
    identifies two issues, the first by reference  to  sub-paragraphs  (vi)
    and (viii).  The skeleton submits that even if it is accepted that  the
    appellant met the requirements of sub-paragraph (vi),

        "7.      There are issues raised by the ECO in the  refusal  of  10
             December 2006 as to whether the appellant intends to return  to
             India at the end of his working holiday.   In  particular,  the
             ECO asserts


              a) The appellant is not essential requirement to the  work  of
                 his father's farm
              b) The appellant has  failed  to  satisfactorily  explain  the
                 benefits  of  taking  part  in  the  Working  Holidaymakers
                 Scheme.
              c) The appellant's account of his circumstances in India  have
                 not demonstrated on the balance of  probabilities  that  he
                 intends to return to India.  In particular, the  fact  that
                 the appellant has given up his employment, he has little in
                 the way of prospects or return,  and  that  he  intends  to
                 spend an unknown amount of money on his holiday.


         8.      It is  submitted  that  the  above  amount  to  sufficient
             reasons as to why the appellant has failed to demonstrate  that
             he will return to India at the end of his working holiday."

 6. At the hearing we reminded Mr O'Leary of the  terms  of  Rule  30.   He
    readily accepted that the skeleton argument was out of time insofar  as
    it amounted to a notice under that Rule.  In our  judgment,  the  items
    marked (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 7 of the skeleton are new  issues.
    The only reason  given  in  the  determination  for  finding  that  the
    appellant does not meet the requirements of  sub-paragraph  (viii)  are
    those relating to the Immigration Judge's assessment of his  compliance
    with sub-paragraph (vi).  The respondent having given no notice in time
    that he wished the Tribunal  to  uphold  the  determination  for  these
    additional reasons, we declined to allow him to argue them.

 7. That takes us back to the question of whether the appellant intended to
    take employment only incidental to a  holiday,  which  the  Immigration
    Judge identified as "the real issue  in  this  case".   Before  us  the
    respondent sought to  concede  the  appellant's  compliance  with  sub-
    paragraph (vi), on the following basis as set out in his skeleton:

      "3.   It is accepted on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  that  the
             Immigration Judge materially erred in law in his assessment  of
             paragraph 95(vi), that is, whether the appellant 'is  intending
             to take employment incidental to the holiday, and not to engage
             in business, or to provide services as  a  professional  sports
             person, and in any event not to work for more  than  12  months
             during his stay'.  The Immigration Judge's concentration on the
             amount the appellant could potentially earn  is  not  a  matter
             that the Immigration Rules require to be assessed.


      The correct approach to the meaning of 'incidental'


      4.    It is submitted that the correct approach when deciding whether
             an applicant's employment will be incidental to the holiday  is
             to concentrate on whether the  amount  of  time  spent  working
             exceeds the 12 month limit, as imposed by virtue  of  paragraph
             95(vi).  It is submitted that it is  the  12  month  limitation
             which is the material consideration  in  deciding  whether  the
             employment is incidental.  On the current construction  of  the
             Rules as long as an applicant does not work  in  excess  of  12
             months then the amount of money he  earns,  or  the  amount  of
             hours he works, are not matters which effect [sic] whether  the
             employment is incidental."

 8. Mr O'Leary confirmed that the concession was  made  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent Entry Clearance Officer, not on behalf of the  Secretary  of
    State.  The reference to "the current construction of the Rules"  ought
    not to be a reference to the Immigration Directorate's Instructions, as
    indicated  in  the  Immigration  Judge's  determination,  but  to   the
    Diplomatic Service Procedures, which are the equivalent of the IDIs for
    Entry Clearance Officers.  The relevant paragraph of  the  DSPs  is  as
    follows:

        "Employment


        Working holidaymakers are expected to intend to take  work  in  the
        United Kingdom as an incidental  part  of  their  working  holiday.
        Those wishing to enter in the category should treat the  work  that
        they do as a purely incidental part of their holiday (which  should
        be their primary reason for  being  here)  rather  than  being  the
        reason for which they have sought  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom.
        Accordingly, working holidaymakers must not intend  to  spend  more
        than 12 months of their stay in  employment,  and  must  intend  to
        spend the rest of their stay holidaying.


        Entrants in the category may take most employment of their  choice,
        including voluntary work. However, they may not engage in  business
        or provide services as a professional sportsperson,  and  they  may
        only engage in work for a maximum period  of  12  months  in  total
        throughout their stay. They may choose when to  work  and  when  to
        take their holiday breaks as they wish, but those  who  exceed  the
        maximum 12 month period of work permitted  will  be  in  breach  of
        their conditions.


        Particular  restrictions   are   placed   on   the   admission   of
        sportspersons as Working Holidaymakers. Those  who  participate  in
        sport as amateurs abroad and who wish to continue this activity for
        recreational purposes  in  the  UK  may  do  so.  However,  persons
        established as professionals or  semi-professionals  in  sport  who
        intend to continue  such  activities  in  the  UK  temporarily  for
        payment or say they will do so for no pay, should be refused  entry
        as WHMs and required to obtain work permits."

      The current version of the IDIs is in similar terms.

 9. It is clear that the interpretation advanced by the respondent's behalf
    by Mr O'Leary goes considerably further than the DSPs.  Indeed, he told
    us in his submissions that he was instructed to advance the  view  than
    any working by a working holidaymaker was regarded to be incidental  if
    it amounted, in total, to less than twelve months full-time  work.   He
    agreed that that meant that a working holidaymaker intending to come to
    the United Kingdom for twelve months or less could work  full-time  for
    the whole of his visit.  We cannot accept a submission  in  that  form,
    even by way of concession.  We are concerned in this  appeal  with  the
    appellant's claim that the decision to refuse him entry clearance was a
    decision which was not  in  accordance  with  the  law,  including  the
    Immigration Rules.  Sub-paragraph (vi) of paragraph 95 makes  it  clear
    that an applicant is not entitled to  entry  clearance  unless  he  "is
    intending only to  take  employment  incidental  to  a  holiday".   The
    reference to "twelve months" towards the end of that  sub-paragraph  is
    preceded by the words "in any event".  There can be no doubt  that  the
    primary requirement is that any employment taken will  be  "incidental"
    to the holiday.

10. That requirement was inserted into  paragraph  95  by  a  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 302,  which  came  into  effect  on  8
    February 2005.  The Immigration Rules, through their various amendments
    and changes, have Parliamentary authority under s3  of  the  1971  Act.
    Although no doubt it is open to the Secretary of  State  to  adopt  and
    indeed argue for interpretations of any ambiguous provisions, we cannot
    see that the Secretary of State is entitled to adopt a  practice  which
    is contrary to the  clear  meaning  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  while
    claiming to be applying them.  If such a stance  were  adopted  in  the
    IDIs or the DSPs, a claimant might be able to succeed on the basis that
    a decision was "not otherwise in  accordance  with  the  law"  on  Abdi
    [1996] Imm AR 46 principles; that is, he would be claiming outside  the
    Rules.  In the present case, it  is  clear  that  the  DSPs,  like  the
    Immigration Rules themselves, require the employment to be  incidental.



11. The  appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the  Immigration  Judge  that  his
    intention was to take work only incidental  to  a  holiday.   In  those
    circumstances the Immigration Judge made no error of law in  dismissing
    the appeal and we order that her determination shall stand.

12. In view of the way in which this appeal was argued on the  respondent's
    behalf before the Tribunal, Mr  O'Leary  agreed  that  his  submissions
    amounted to an undertaking that the present appellant would be  granted
    entry clearance as a working holidaymaker if the question  whether  his
    employment would be merely incidental was the  only  issue  outstanding
    following his appeal.  As we have indicated, it is.  He will  therefore
    receive his grant of entry clearance:  but  for  the  reasons  we  have
    given, his appeal remains dismissed.
