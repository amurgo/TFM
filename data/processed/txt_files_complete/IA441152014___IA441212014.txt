For the Appellants:    Mr M Bhuiyan, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwalia (HOPO)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge James, promulgated on 22nd July  2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 29th  June  2015.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Neela Sridhar and Rajitha Gundu, following  which
    the Respondent, Secretary  of  State,  applied  for,  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife.  They are both citizens of  India.
    The First Appellant, the husband, was born on 2nd December 1975 and the
    Second Appellant, the wife, was born on 13th June 1980.

 3. Their application was refused by the Respondent on the basis  that  the
    Respondent was not satisfied of the First Appellant's intention to  set
    up a business and there was  insufficient  evidence  of  that  business
    being in operation, the full reasons  being  set  out  in  the  refusal
    letter dated 22nd October 2014.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the
    application was as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

The Appellant's Claim

 4. The Appellant's claim is that the refusal letter of 21st  October  2014
    had accepted that the  Appellant  had  invested  ï¿½50,000  held  in  his
    business in the United Kingdom as specified under provision (d) in  the
    first row of table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The Appellant, according to the refusal letter, also had to satisfy the
    requirement under paragraph 41-SD(e) that  the  Appellant  was  in  the
    occupation as part of his business, Neela Sridhar Business Limited, but
    this evidence, according to the refusal letter, was  insufficient,  and
    the advertising material was not acceptable because it did not cover  a
    continuous period commencing before 11th July 2014, up  to  no  earlier
    than three months before the date of the application.

The Judge's Findings

 6. At the hearing before Judge James, it was  apparently  agreed  by  both
    representatives that the Secretary of State had applied the wrong legal
    provision.  This is because paragraph 41-SD of Appendix  A  deals  with
    available funds which are ready  to  invest,  whereas  paragraph  46-SD
    deals with funds which are already being invested.   The  Secretary  of
    State in the refusal letter had already accepted  that  the  money  had
    been invested into the business (so that paragraph 46-SD  would  appear
    to have been complied with).

 7. However, when the Secretary of State considered the application it  was
    treated as if the funds were only  available  to  invest,  rather  than
    having been already been  invested,  (in  which  case  paragraph  41-SD
    applied).  The application was refused simply because the Secretary  of
    State had applied paragraph 41-SD.  She ought to have applied paragraph
    46-SD because it had already been accepted  that  the  funds  had  been
    invested.

 8. Before Judge James, both representatives agreed that there had been  an
    error in the initial decision making process, so that  the  appropriate
    course of action was for the judge to remit  the  matter  back  to  the
    Secretary of State  so  that  the  correct  legal  provision  could  be
    applied, namely, paragraph 46-SD.

 9.  However,  in  coming  to  her  decision,  the  judge  in  the  written
    determination made no reference to this and simply proceeded  to  allow
    the appeal, which is why now the Secretary of State was challenging the
    manner in which the appeal had been allowed outright.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 7th January 2016, both parties  once  again
    agreed that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  applied  the  wrong  legal
    provision, that the appropriate course of action was for the matter  to
    return back to the Secretary of State so that the right legal provision
    could be applied, which would be paragraph 46-SD, given that the  funds
    had already been invested into the business, and  the  judge  had  been
    wrong to overlook this consensus between the  parties  at  the  hearing
    before her on 29th June 2015.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    [2007]) such that I should set aside the decision.

12. My reasons are those that both parties  have  agreed  upon  by  way  of
    submissions before me.  I note from the skeleton argument of Mr Bhuiyan
    that he states (at paragraph 2.7) that,

         "Once Judge James started the  proceedings,  she  was  respectfully
         made aware of the discussions and agreement between two  advocates;
         hence the matter was resolved with a  brief  submission  from  both
         sides and the ...... agreed to remit the matter back  to  the  SSHD
         for making of a lawful decision."

13. Secondly, it is clear that something has gone wrong in the very writing
    of the determination, in the way in which Judge James could simply  not
    have intended, because the determination is incomplete.

14. There is a heading "findings of fact," in which Judge James states that
    she has taken into account the documentary evidence and the submissions
    made in this appeal.  She then goes on to say that,  "thus  in  summary
    the Appellants ....." (see paragraph 7).

15. The judge no doubt intended to  set  down  here  what  the  submissions
    before her were, but for some reason the  sentence  is  incomplete  and
    there is no proper basis for the decision.

16. Third, and in any event, there is  an  error  in  allowing  the  appeal
    outright in the way that has happened in this case because plainly, the
    appropriate course of action was  to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the
    Secretary of State for the correct application of the law.

17. For all these reasons, the only course  of  action  here  is  that  the
    matter should return back to the Secretary of State for a decision that
    is correct in law.



Re-Making the Decision

18. I have re-made the decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    original judge, the evidence before her, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  I am allowing this appeal to the extent that  it  is
    remitted back to the Secretary of State for a fresh  decision,  on  the
    basis of the correct legal provision, given that the Secretary of State
    has accepted that the funds were invested in the business  named  Neela
    Sridhar Business Limited.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is  allowed
to the extent that it is remitted back to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  a
fresh decision.

No anonymity order is made.
