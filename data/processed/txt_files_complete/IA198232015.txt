Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Walker, legal representative
For the Respondent:    Mr S Withwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Greasley promulgated on 22 August 2016, in which her appeal against the
    Respondent's decision to refuse her application for leave to remain  on
    the grounds of family life under Appendix FM  dated  11  May  2015  was
    dismissed.

 2. The Appellant is a national of the Philippines born on 5 May 1975,  who
    first arrived in the United Kingdom on  11  December  2008  with  entry
    clearance as a student and leave to remain as such granted to 30  March
    2015.  On 19 March 2015 the Appellant made an application  for  further
    leave to remain on the basis  of  her  marriage  to  Wayne  Lewis,  the
    "Sponsor", a British national.

 3. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application under Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules on the basis that she did not  provide  specified
    evidence  from  her  Sponsor  to  demonstrate  that   the   maintenance
    requirements  in  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1(a)  were  met  (as  only   bank
    statements had been provided) and it was not accepted that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom  such  that  paragraph  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  was  not
    satisfied.  The Respondent also  refused  the  Appellant's  application
    under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules on the basis that there
    were no very  significant  obstacles  to  her  reintegration  into  the
    Philippines.  Finally, the Respondent considered whether there were any
    exceptional circumstances outside of the Immigration  Rules  but  found
    none.

 4. Judge Greasley dismissed the Appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules on the basis that he was not satisfied on the evidence  available
    that the Sponsor had provided accurate  and  reliable  details  of  his
    income and earnings such that it had not  been  demonstrated  that  the
    financial requirement of �18,600 gross income in  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules had been met.  Further,  Judge  Greasley  found  that
    there were no exceptional circumstances to go on to consider Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights outside of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

Grounds of appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals the decision of Judge Greasley  on  two  grounds.
    First, that he took into account irrelevant material - namely that  the
    Sponsor was unable to explain the direct cost deduction of  �68,500  in
    his accounts and that the Sponsor was in dispute with HMRC over his tax
    affairs, and that he had failed to take into account relevant material,
    the Sponsor's bank statements; when  assessing  whether  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM had been satisfied.  Secondly,  that  Judge
    Greasley had failed to consider whether paragraph EX.1 of  Appendix  FM
    was satisfied and further failed to give any reasons why  he  found  no
    exceptional circumstances to  consider  the  Appellant's  circumstances
    outside of the Immigration Rules on Article 8 grounds.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer on
    all grounds.

 7. At the oral hearing, on behalf of the Appellant, the grounds of  appeal
    were relied  upon.   The  Appellant's  representative  added  that  the
    Sponsor's accounts which were before Judge Greasley were clear, showing
    turnover of �112,075 and total income of �43,575 which was the relevant
    gross income figure for the purposes of the application  for  leave  to
    remain.  The bank statements and invoices which had been submitted with
    the application supported these earnings figures but it was  not  clear
    from the Appellant's representative that these were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  It appears that there was an assumption that they would
    have been in the  Respondent's  bundle  as  these  documents  had  been
    submitted with the application, but there was nothing on  the  file  or
    from the Appellant to suggest that this had happened.

 8. It was further submitted that there was an issue of  fairness  in  this
    case, that it was clear that the substance of the Immigration Rules had
    been met as to the income requirement and  if  needed,  the  Respondent
    could and should have asked for further documents.   It  was  submitted
    that it was an error of law by the First-tier Tribunal not to  consider
    this, but the Appellant's representative accepted that this was  not  a
    ground of appeal nor was it material in any event.

 9. In relation to Article 8,  the  Appellant's  representative  reiterated
    that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to consider paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM and that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life
    continuing outside of the United Kingdom and if necessary,  exceptional
    circumstances for consideration of Article 8 outside of the Immigration
    Rules.  The Sponsor had established family  and  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom, where his elderly father (aged 82), four  children  and
    grandchild lived; all of whom relied upon him for emotional support and
    advice.  He had an established legal practice (he is head  of  chambers
    and has been practising since 1982) which could not be recreated in the
    Philippines as he is unfamiliar with the law and language  there.   The
    Sponsor also has diabetes and currently enjoys free  prescriptions  and
    healthcare in the United Kingdom which he would not be entitled  to  in
    the Philippines and with no ability to work there, he would not be able
    to afford the required healthcare to manage his condition.

10. The Appellant's representative made two further points in  relation  to
    Judge Greasley's decision,  first,  that  the  name  of  the  Sponsor's
    chambers was wrong (it  was  recorded  as  Access  Lloyds,  not  Access
    Lawyers) and secondly, that in paragraph 5 only one child was  referred
    to when the Sponsor has four children and a grandchild.  Nothing  turns
    on either of these points, the first is clearly a  typographical  error
    with no material consequence and the second is a misunderstanding of  a
    particular paragraph of the decision which sets  out  the  Respondent's
    reasons for refusal and the decision that there was no evidence of  any
    child living with the Appellant and her husband.

11. On behalf of the Respondent, the Home Office Presenting  Office  relied
    on the Rule 24 response.  In relation to the income  requirements,  the
    decision made was one which was open to Judge Greasley on the basis  of
    evidence before him.  The Sponsor was asked direct questions about  his
    accounts which he could not give satisfactory answers to  and  that  of
    itself justifies  the  findings  in  paragraphs  23  and  27  that  the
    Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof to reliably  establish
    the Sponsor's income.

12. On the facts, the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration  Rules  must
    fail.  The Sponsor has not shown that the figures in his  accounts  can
    be relied upon and in accordance with paragraph 19(b)(ii)  of  Appendix
    FM-SE (which sets out the documents required for those  who  are  self-
    employed and that gross taxable profits do not  include  expenses)  the
    net income figure of �12,510.84 in the accounts would be  the  relevant
    one to consider in any event.  This falls far  short  of  the  required
    �18,600 per annum.

13. It was accepted on behalf of the Respondent that  on  its  face,  Judge
    Greasley's decision does not expressly consider paragraph EX.1, but  it
    was submitted that this was not a material error on the facts  of  this
    case.  The Court of Appeal in Agyarko v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440 confirmed that  the  need  to  establish
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom was a stringent one.  The facts of  the  present  appeal
    were very similar to those in Agyarko, the only distinguishing  feature
    being that the Sponsor has diabetes but there was no evidence that this
    was an insurmountable obstacle to living in the Philippines.

14. Further, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that  there  were
    no exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons for consideration of
    the appeal outside of the Immigration Rules under Article 8.   In  this
    case, there are no insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing
    outside of the United  Kingdom  and  no  further  factors  to  consider
    outside of the Immigration Rules.

Findings and reasons

15. Judge Greasley found, in relation to the income  requirement,  that  he
    could not be satisfied, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
    Sponsor had provided accurate and credible evidence in relation to  his
    earnings.  It was incumbent upon him to demonstrate that the  financial
    requirement of �18,600 was met  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules but he failed to do so.  Judge Greasley considered it
    relevant that the Sponsor was not able to provide any answer  as  to  a
    significant deduction in his accounts of �68,500 and as such it was not
    accepted that full and accurate  information  had  been  given.   Judge
    Greasley considered it relevant that the Sponsor was  in  dispute  with
    HMRC in relation to his tax affairs.

16. I do not find that either  factor  was  irrelevant  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's assessment of the evidence  in  relation  to  the  Sponsor's
    income.  It was open to the Judge to consider the evidence given by the
    Sponsor and in particular his inability to explain  how  a  significant
    sum of money had been deducted from his  accounts  and  the  fact  that
    matters were in dispute.  On the basis of that evidence and the claimed
    lack of clarity on the  face  of  the  accounts,  it  is  difficult  to
    envisage how any different conclusion could have been  reached  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal as to whether there was reliable evidence of income
    and therefore whether the income requirement had been satisfied even on
    the balance of probabilities.

17. Further, there is nothing to suggest that the Sponsor's bank statements
    were before Judge Greasley and it can not therefore be an error of  law
    for him not to take them into account.   It  can  not  be  assumed,  as
    suggested at the hearing before me  that  the  Sponsor  did,  that  all
    material submitted with the application  would  be  reproduced  in  the
    Appellant's bundle.  Directions were given to the Appellant  on  9  May
    2016 to submit a bundle of all documents on which she wished to rely in
    support of her appeal as soon as they were available.  It was incumbent
    upon the Appellant to submit to the First-tier Tribunal  the  Sponsor's
    bank statements if she wished to rely on them.  In this case,  she  did
    not.

18. In any event, I would not have found that  any  error  in  the  matters
    taken into account and/or not taken into  account  when  assessing  the
    Sponsor's income were material.  On the face of the Sponsor's accounts,
    his net income in accordance with paragraph 19(b) of Appendix FM-SE  of
    the Immigration Rules, was �12,510.84; which is broadly consistent with
    his declared profit from self-employment on his tax return for the same
    year (�11,920.00).  The submissions on behalf of the Appellant  to  the
    contrary that either the turnover figure minus liability for tax or the
    total income figure (before expenses) reflected gross income is  simply
    not sustainable or consistent with paragraph 19(b) of  Appendix  FM-SE.
    It is difficult to envisage how sight of the Sponsor's bank  statements
    could affect that conclusion.  The Sponsor's income,  on  the  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal fell significantly short of the required
    level of �18,600 per annum required for the application  for  leave  to
    remain and the appeal  was  therefore  correctly  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

19. For the reasons set out above, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    did not involve the making of a material error of law in  the  approach
    to assessing the Sponsor's income for the purposes of the appeal  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

20. The second ground of appeal is that Judge Greasley erred in failing  to
    consider paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    failed to give reasons for  finding  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances to consider the appeal outside of the Immigration Rules.

21. On its face, the decision  of  Judge  Greasley  does  not  contain  any
    assessment of whether  the  requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1  are  met
    (namely whether there would be insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    continuing in the Philippines) and no reasons are  expressly  given  in
    relation  to  Article  8  outside  of  the  Immigration   Rules.    The
    application of paragraph EX.1 was raised in the Appellant's grounds  of
    appeal and referred to in  the  skeleton  argument  submitted  for  her
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal; as was Article 8 outside of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It was therefore a ground of appeal which the First-
    tier Tribunal was  required  to  determine  and  on  the  face  of  the
    decision, failed to do, at least in respect of paragraph EX.1.

22. I do not however find that the error was a material one on the facts of
    this case.  The Appellant has family in the Philippines (her  children)
    and she has not made any submissions or provided any evidence  to  show
    that there would be very significant obstacles to her own reintegration
    there.  It is claimed that the insurmountable obstacles to enjoyment of
    family life outside of the United Kingdom are solely in relation to the
    Sponsor's position and that it would entail  exceptional  hardship  for
    him to relocate to the Philippines.  The factors relied upon  are  that
    he has lived in the United Kingdom for 51 years, has an elderly father,
    two brothers, four (adult) children and a grandchild here as well as an
    established legal practise and that he suffers from diabetes  requiring
    long-term healthcare for which there is not an equivalent  standard  in
    the Philippines.

23. The test of insurmountable obstacles in paragraph EX.1 is  a  stringent
    one, as confirmed in Agyarko and involves more than  mere  hardship  or
    difficulties in relocation.  The factors relied upon by  the  Appellant
    as  to  the  Sponsor  not  wishing  to  relocate  do  not   amount   to
    insurmountable obstacles, particularly as there is no  suggestion  that
    medical treatment is not available and as he would be able to  maintain
    family relationships from the Philippines.  There is no specific reason
    as to why the Sponsor would be unable to learn  the  language  or  find
    employment in the Philippines, a country which he has visited and where
    he would have the assistance of his wife, the Appellant.

24. In these circumstances, there are no  further  factors  that  could  be
    considered exceptional or compelling to justify  consideration  of  the
    Appellant's circumstances under Article 8 outside  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  As  Lord  Justice  Sales  noted  in  Agyarko,  in  relation  to
    precarious family cases (which the present  one  is  as  the  Appellant
    began her relationship and married when she had only limited  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a student), the gap  between  paragraph
    EX.1 and the requirements of Article 8 is likely to be small.  I do not
    therefore find Judge Greasley's conclusion to the same effect  involves
    any material error of law.

25. For these reasons, the decision of Judge Greasley did not  involve  the
    making of  any  material  errors  of  law  in  the  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's Article 8 appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which was promulgated on  22  August
2016 did not involve the making of any material errors of law in  dismissing
the appeal that requires the decision to  be  set  aside  and  remade.   The
decision to dismiss the appeal is accordingly confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
