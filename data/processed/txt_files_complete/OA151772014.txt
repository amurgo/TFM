For the Respondent:    Mr Ahmed of A1 Immigration Services


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hillis made following a hearing at Bradford on 12th May 2015.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He applied to come to the UK on
    14th April 2014 for settlement under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules as a  spouse.   His  application  was  refused
    because the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that he  met  the
    income  threshold  required  under  Appendix  FM  and/or  the   related
    evidential requirements.

 3. The Claimant was required to  provide,  in  respect  of  his  sponsor's
    salaried employment in the UK.
          a) Wage slips covering a period of six months prior to  the  date
             of application if the applicant has  been  employed  by  their
             current employer for at least six months (and where  paragraph
             13B of this Appendix does not apply); or
              ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of  twelve
                  months prior to the date of application if  the  applicant
                  has been employed by their current employer for less  than
                  six months (or at least six months but the person does not
                  rely on  paragraph  13A  of  this  Appendix),  or  in  the
                  financial years relied upon  by  a  self-employed  person.
                  These wage slips should demonstrate  that  your  sponsor's
                  income meets the financial requirements of the Immigration
                  Rules.
          b) A letter from the  employer  who  issued  the  wage  slips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming
               i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
              ii) the length of their employment;
             iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
                  level of salary relied upon in the application; and
              iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed term contract  or
                  agency).
          c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as
             the wage slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the  salary  has
             been paid into an account in the name of  the  person  or  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer recorded that the bank statements submitted
    for October 2013 did not show the sponsor's salary from the  wage  slip
    dated 31st October 2013 as specified in (c) above.  The  officer  noted
    that, after extra  documents  were  requested  from  the  sponsor,  she
    provided a letter from her employer stating that  the  wages  for  2013
    were paid by cash and not BACS as stated on  the  original  wage  slip.
    The Entry Clearance Officer found the letter  to  be  self-serving  and
    only issued in an attempt  to  circumnavigate  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Accordingly he refused the application on the grounds that,  given  the
    lack of specified evidence, he was not satisfied that the  sponsor  was
    employed and paid as stated, nor that the total income for the past six
    months met the income threshold.

 5. The claimant accepted that the bank statement for October 2013 did  not
    show her salary being paid into it.

 6. The judge was entirely satisfied that the sponsor's gross annual income
    was �19,980 for the relevant period. It was accepted by the  respondent
    that she submitted further documentation in response to  their  written
    request.  It was also accepted by the Presenting Officer at the hearing
    that she was a credible and reliable witness and that she did  in  fact
    request and receive her monthly salary  in  October  2013  in  cash  to
    facilitate the purchase of items for her wedding in Pakistan before she
    flew out three days later.  It was agreed that her salary did  in  fact
    exceed the �18,600 minimum requirement.

 7. The judge concluded as follows:
         "I conclude that were the only reason the application  was  refused
         was due to the fact that the sponsor had requested her salary to be
         paid in cash and not into the bank account as usual to  enable  her
         to purchase a number of items for her wedding three days  prior  to
         flying to Pakistan for that wedding the  ECO  has  not  taken  into
         account the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  (d)(iii)(e)  and  (f)
         above.
         I conclude that having exercised evidential flexibility and written
         to the appellant for further information the  information  provided
         in reliance of that request when taken together with the  documents
         already  submitted  with  the  application   the   respondent   has
         sufficient information before her to conclude  that  the  appellant
         met the relevant terms of Appendix FM-SE."

 8. The judge  concluded  that  the  claimant  had  provided  the  required
    documentation and information and  had  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  He allowed the appeal both  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    under Article 8.

The Grounds of Application

 9. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had erred in law in failing to make  the  assessment  of  the
    evidence with regard to the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision.  The Rules require that the sponsor earn at least the minimum
    income requirement for the  whole  of  the  period  and  there  was  no
    evidence to show that this was the case.

10. The Tribunal relied on postdecision evidence to provide an  explanation
    for an alleged discrepancy in October 2013.  Given the evidence  should
    have been available it was not  a  case  where  evidential  flexibility
    needed to be applied.  If the decision under the Rules was not  correct
    then the decision on Article 8 was flawed.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Andrew for the reasons stated
    in the grounds on 5th August 2015.

The Hearing

12. Mr Diwnycz said that he had made enquiries with the Inland Revenue  and
    there was no doubt that the sponsor had in fact worked since July 2013.
     He did not seek to amplify the grounds.

Findings and Conclusions

13. Under Appendix DM/SE
         D(a), in deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or Secretary of State (the decision  maker)  will
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.
          b) if the applicant
               i) has submitted
                  aa) a sequence of documents and some of the documents  in
                      the sequence have been  omitted  (e.g.  if  one  bank
                      statement from a series is missing);
                  ab)  a document is in the wrong format (for example if  a
                      letter is not on a letterhead paper as specified) or
                  ac) a document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                      document; or
                  ad)  a  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the
                      specified information; or (ii) has  not  specified  a
                      specified document, the decision  maker  may  contact
                      the applicant or his  representative  in  writing  or
                      otherwise and request the  document  or  the  correct
                      version.  The material requested must be received  at
                      the  address  specified  in  the  request  within   a
                      reasonable timescale specified in the request.

13. Under Appendix DM/SE(d) if the applicant has submitted;
               i) A document in the wrong format; or
              ii) A document that is a copy and not an original document, or


             iii) A document that does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                  information but  the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:
                   i) Other documents submitted with the application,
                  ii)  The  application  may   be   granted   exceptionally
                      providing the decision maker is  satisfied  that  the
                      document is genuine and that the applicant meets  the
                      requirement  to  which  the  document  relates.   The
                      decision maker reserves  the  right  to  request  the
                      specified original document in the correct format  in
                      all cases where  sub-paragraph  (b)  applies  and  to
                      refuse applications if this material is not  provided
                      as set out in sub-paragraph (b).
          e) where the decision maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why  a  specified  document  cannot  be  supplied  e.g.
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost he or she  may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply  the  requirement  for  the  document  or   to   request
             alternative or  additional  information  or  documents  to  be
             submitted by the applicant.
          f) before making a decision under Appendix FM  or  this  Appendix
             the  decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or   their
             representative in writing  or  otherwise  to  request  further
             information or documents.   The  material  requested  must  be
             received at the address specified  in  the  request  within  a
             reasonable timescale specified in the request.

15. In this case, the Entry Clearance Officer was provided with all of  the
    relevant specified evidence save for the bank statement of October 2013
    and accordingly asked the claimant to provide further information.  The
    claimant then provided a letter from  the  employer  stating  that  the
    wages were paid in cash for that month, because the sponsor wanted  the
    money to pay for the wedding.

16. However, the Entry Clearance Officer regarded  the  information  to  be
    self-serving and discounted it.  The  respondent  no  longer  maintains
    that this was the correct decision.  Both the Presenting Officer at the
    original hearing and the  Presenting  Officer  today  accept  that  the
    sponsor was working as claimed.  Clearly the  sponsor  could  not  have
    ever provided a bank statement for October 2013 because the wages  were
    simply never paid into her account.

17. The Entry Clearance Officer, had he been in possession of the facts  as
    they are now accepted to have been, would have granted the  application
    exceptionally.

18. The grounds challenging the judge's decision appear to be arguing  that
    this was not a case where evidential flexibility  ought  to  have  been
    applied.  Mr Diwnycz accepted that this was wrong.

19. Accordingly I agree with the respondent to the extent that there is  an
    error of law in this determination in that the appeal should  not  have
    been allowed outright. It should have been allowed to the  extent  that
    the matter was remitted back to the Entry Clearance Officer  to  decide
    whether to grant entry clearance on the basis of the facts as they  are
    now known to be.

20. In the light of the information  from  Mr  Diwnycz  who  contacted  the
    Inland Revenue and who have confirmed  that  the  sponsor  was  working
    throughout the relevant period and earned above  the  income  threshold
    there is no reason why entry clearance should not be issued.

Decision

21. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside and  remade
    as follows.  The appeal is allowed insofar as it is  remitted  back  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer to decide whether the application should be
    granted exceptionally under Appendix DM/SE D(d).

No anonymity direction is made.
