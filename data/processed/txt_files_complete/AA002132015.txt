                          (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
Appellant   Mr Selway (Solicitor)
Respondent  Mr Dewison (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  The  appellant  applied  for
       asylum on July 17, 2014. The respondent refused the  application  on
       December 17, 2014.

    2. The appellant appealed  this  decision  on  January  6,  2015  under
       Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

    3. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Handley  on
       May 12, 2015 and in a  decision  promulgated  on  May  29,  2015  he
       refused the appellant's asylum claim and her claim under articles  2
       and 3 ECHR.

    4. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  June  15,  2015  and
       permission to appeal was granted solely on the basis the  Judge  had
       failed to deal with the appellant's article 8 claim in circumstances
       where she claimed to have been here since  at  least  2005  and  had
       children who had each been born here.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
       pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I make no Order.

    6. The matter came before me on the above date.

    7. I indicated to the representatives that  there  appeared  to  be  an
       obvious error in law. The original grounds of appeal clearly  raised
       article 8 and the Judge had touched on her circumstances which  made
       a decision on that aspect of her claim an obvious requirement.

    8. Although Mr Dewison submitted that the Judge  had  referred  to  the
       partner's claim that had included the appellant I pointed out to him
       that the Judge had been dealing with her claim and if  he  found  no
       merit then he should have dealt with it accordingly.

    9. The Judge's finding on her asylum claim were upheld on appeal but as
       there were no findings on her article 8 claim I  find  there  is  an
       error in law.

   10. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

      Remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute the normal
      approach to determining appeals where an error of law is  found,  even
      if some further fact finding is necessary."

   11. I suggested that this matter be remitted back to Judge of the First-
       tier Tribunal Handley to complete the job he commenced in May  2015.
       Any findings on credibility  are  retained  and  in  particular  his
       findings between paragraphs [32] and [37], [39] and [42] should form
       the starting point of any assessment of any article 8 claim.

   12. I am conscious of the fact the first appeal was heard  in  May  2015
       and I  therefore  direct  that  the  parties  serve  any  additional
       evidence in accordance with the current Procedural Rules.

DECISION

   13. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law on the basis no  assessment
       under the Immigration Rules or under article 8 ECHR was  undertaken.
       The asylum decision is upheld.

   14. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  these
       issues to be addressed hearing under Section 12  of  the  Tribunals,
       Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

   15. These remaining matters should be dealt with by Judge of the  First-
       tier Tribunal R Handley, if at all possible, as he has already heard
       the earlier evidence and the error is not  one  that  precludes  him
       from dealing with the remainder of the case.


Signed:                                 Dated:
