Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S McQuitty, McLaughlin & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are husband and wife born on 10 September  1980  and  11
    January 1980 respectively.  Both are nationals of India.  They  have  a
    son, Jaimail, who was born on 25 September 2012 at Belfast.

2.   The first appellant came to the United Kingdom on 14  July  2007  under
    the work permit scheme.  His leave was valid until 10 July 2012.

3.   On 28 June 2012 he applied for indefinite leave to  remain,  which  was
    refused on 9 August 2012 because  the  application  fee  had  not  been
    paid.

4.   On 30 August 2012 he reapplied.  That was refused by the respondent  on
    10 May 2013.

5.   The refusal was for two reasons.  The first reason being  that  it  was
    contended that the application was out of time.  The  second  being  as
    follows:-

          "You have confirmed on your application form that, on  10  January
         2012, you were convicted of driving  as  an  unaccompanied  learner
         driver not displaying L plates.  You were fined  �100.   Under  the
         Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 ,  the fine  is  spent  for  a
         period of five years.  You therefore have an unspent conviction and
         do not meet the requirements of paragraph 134(vii).

6.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly on 12 June 2014.

7.   The Judge having heard the evidence accepted that  the  non-payment  of
    the fee was as a result of bank error rather  than  insufficient  funds
    within the bank.  Paragraph 134(viii) was however applied, it being the
    finding of the Judge that the second application  was  made  within  28
    days  of  the  notification  of  decision  in  respect  of  the   first
    application.  It was therefore the finding of  the  Immigration  Judge,
    which has not been challenged by the respondent, that  the  application
    of 30 August 2012 was an in- time application.

8.   The Judge, however, upheld the refusal, not on the basis that  was  set
    out in the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  but  on  the  basis  that  the
    Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 did not apply in Northern Ireland,
    the  relevant  statute  in  effect  in  Northern  Ireland   being   the
    Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 which retains
    five years as the operative period in respect of the time taken  for  a
    fine to become an unspent conviction.  The Judge read  the  Immigration
    Rule in the light of that consideration and found, therefore, that  the
    appellant did not have an unspent conviction as  at  the  time  of  the
    application or indeed at the  time  of  the  decision  or  hearing  and
    therefore dismissed the appeal.

9.   Grounds of appeal have been submitted in relation to that finding.

10.  Thus  the  matter  comes  before  me  in  pursuance  of  the  grant  of
    permission.

11.  The relevant Immigration Rule which was in existence  at  the  time  of
    the decision was paragraphs 134(vii) which provided that:-

          "Indefinite leave may be granted providing that 'he does not  have
         one  or  more  unspent  convictions  within  the  meaning  of   the
         Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974'."

12.  The appellant was convicted on  10  January  2012  for  driving  as  an
    unaccompanied learner driver and not displaying L plates.  He was fined
    �100.  Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, a  fine  is  not
    spent for a period of five years.

13.  Section 139 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and  Punishment  of  Offenders
    Act 2012 provided that the rehabilitation period for  fines  under  the
    1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act was to be twelve months.

14.  By virtue of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders  Act
    2012 (Commencement Number 9,  Saving  Provision  and  Specification  of
    Commencement Date) Order 2014 provided that Section 139 of the 2012 Act
    came into force on 10 March 2014.

15.  Thus at the time of the hearing of the appeal, not at the time  of  the
    decision of 10 May 2013, the appellant's  conviction  would  have  been
    spent if the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 applied to him.

16.  Although an argument was directed in the course of the  hearing  as  to
    whether the situation at the time of application or decision or hearing
    should apply, that is in  my  view  largely  academic  so  far  as  the
    Rehabilitation of Offenders Act  1974  is  concerned,  because  of  the
    provisions of Section 141 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing  and  Punishment
    of Offenders Act 2012 which also came into force under the  Order  2014
    on  10  March  2014.   In  effect  that  section  gives  effect  to   a
    retrospective application of Section 139. Thus  the  situation  at  the
    time of decision as well as of hearing would be that  Section  139  was
    deemed to have operated to reduce the period from five years to  twelve
    months.   At the time of decision, as well as of hearing, the appellant
    would  have  met  the  requirements  of  Section  139  having  a  spent
    conviction at the time of his application so as to meet the Rule.

17.  The difficulty, as was recognised by the Judge, was that by  virtue  of
    Section 152 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and  Punishment  of  Offenders
    Act 2012 Section 139 of the 2012  Act  extended  only  to  England  and
    Wales.  The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 did not in fact  apply
    in Northern Ireland.  The operative legislation was the  Rehabilitation
    of Offenders (Northern  Ireland)  Order  1974  which  at  the  time  of
    application, decision and hearing retained five years as the  operative
    period.

18.  The Judge recognised the anomaly but  nevertheless  considered  himself
    bound by that legislation to the extent of finding that  the  appellant
    could not benefit neither from section 139 nor from the  Rehabilitation
    of Offenders Act 1974.   The Judge therefore found that  the  appellant
    had an unspent conviction and therefore that his appeal be dismissed.

19.  Mr Shilliday, who represents the respondent, invited me  to  find  that
    the Judge was entitled to apply the Northern Ireland legislation to the
    appellant in the circumstances.  He fairly conceded that the difference
    of approach as between  appellants in England and Wales  and  those  in
    the Northern Ireland was not  intended  but  nevertheless  it  was  the
    inevitably consequence of the difference in legislation.

20.  Paragraph 134(vii) of  the  Immigration  Rules  has  now  been  amended
    making  the  requirement  that  an  application  should  not  have  any
    convictions within 24 months of the application.  Given that situation,
    Mr  Shilliday  submits  that  the  appellant  should   make   a   fresh
    application, which is likely to succeed, given that he  now  meets  the
    requirement.

21.  Mr McQuitty, on behalf of  the  appellant,  submits  that  it  was  not
    properly open to the Judge to in effect rewrite the Immigration Rule.

22.  Paragraph 134(vii) of the Immigration  Rules  had  application  to  the
    whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.   As  such  it
    was setting out  the policy and intention of  the  Secretary  of  State
    towards  applications  that  were  made  within  the  jurisdiction  for
    indefinite leave to remain.  He  submitted  that  the  operative  words
    within that paragraph were the words "within the meaning  of"  and  the
    requirements under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 were to  be
    the benchmark against which such applications were  to  be  considered.
    It would be wholly divisive if certain areas of the United Kingdom  had
    a greater benefit than others.  He submitted that that was not intended
    and relied indeed on the concession made by Mr Shilliday that that  had
    not been the intention of the Secretary of State in the drafting of the
    legislation.

23.  Indeed before  the  application  of  Section  139  of  the  Legal  Aid,
    Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, the provisions of  the
    Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  Act  1974  and  the  Rehabilitation   of
    Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order) Act 1978 were to the same effect.

24.  It was Section 139 which reduced the  rehabilitation  period  of  fines
    under the 1974 Act.  Section 141 stated that Section 139 will apply  to
    conviction before the commencement  date  "As  if  the  amendments  and
    repeals made by section 139 always had effect".

25.  A matter of fundamental importance, which  it  seems  to  me,  is  that
    paragraph 134(vii) of the Immigration  Rules  had  application  to  the
    whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.   As  such  it
    was setting out the policy and intention  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    towards applications that were made within the  jurisdiction  for  ILR.
    The operative words within that paragraph were the  words  "within  the
    meaning of".  The requirements under the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders
    Act 1974 were to be the benchmark against which such applications  were
    to be considered.  It would be wholly divisive if certain areas of  the
    United Kingdom had a greater benefit than others.  That result was  not
    intended.  Indeed there is the concession made  by  Mr  Shilliday  that
    that had not been the intention  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
    drafting of the legislation.

26.  Indeed before  the  application  of  section  139  of  the  Legal  Aid,
    Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Commencement Number 9,
    Saving Provision and Specification of Commencement Date) Order 2014 the
    provisions  of  the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  Act  1974  and  the
    Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 were  to  the
    same effect.

27.  It was Section 139 which reduces the rehabilitation  periods  of  fines
    under the 1974 Act. Section 141 stated that section 139 will  apply  to
    convictions  before the commencement date "as  if  the  amendments  and
    repeals made by section 139 always had effect."

28.   I  find  that  paragraph  134(vii)  of  the  Immigration   Rules   had
    application for the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland.  It  set
    out the indication of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  in  considering
    whether or not an appellant has one or more unspent convictions, such a
    issue would be determined within the meaning of the  Rehabilitation  of
    Offenders  Act  1974.   That  was  to  be  the   benchmark   for   such
    considerations.

29.  It seems to me and I so find that that should have  been  the  starting
    point of the Judge in the circumstances of this case.  What  the  Judge
    has effectively done is to rewrite the Rule to add effectively  to  the
    words to  the  Rule  "or  the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  (Northern
    Ireland) Order 1978".  It seems to me it is the task of the legislature
    and not of the Judge, particularly as the Judge recognised the  anomaly
    which would thereby be created.

30.  I find, therefore, that the Judge has  erred  in  law  in  taking  that
    approach to the wording of the Immigration Rule.

31.  In those circumstances the appeal is allowed to  the  extent  that  the
    decision is set aide to be remade.

32.  I find, therefore, that the purposive approach is the one  that  should
    be taken in all the circumstances, particularly as indeed Mr  Shilliday
    had  indicated,  there  had  been  no  overt  intention  to  create   a
    distinction between citizens of Northern  Ireland  and  of  the  United
    Kingdom in the application of the Immigration Rules.

33.  The situation is that by virtue of the combination of Sections 139  and
    141 at the time of application, decision  and  hearing  the  conviction
    would have been spent as  at  all  occasions.   Given  the  Legal  Aid,
    Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Commencement Number 9,
    Saving Provision and Specification of  Commencement Date) Order 2014 it
    would have been apparent to the Judge at the  hearing of 12  June  2014
    that Section 139 and Section 141 had been in operation and had been  so
    since 10 March 2014.

34.  I find, therefore, that within the meaning  of  the  Rehabilitation  of
    Offenders Act 1974 the appeal should have been allowed on the basis  of
    the law and Immigration Rules that  were  applicable  at  the  time  of
    application and decision.

35.  I note, indeed that whatever may be the interpretation  of  that  older
    version of the  Immigration  Rules,  the  Immigration  Rules  have  now
    changed such that it is immaterial whether the conviction was spent  or
    unspent. As Mr Shilliday fairly indicated it would seem that under  the
    new version of the Immigration Rules the  appellant  would  succeed  on
    that issue in any event.

36.  It would seem that on the basis of the Immigration Rule as at the  time
    of decision or the Immigration Rules at the time of  this  hearing  the
    appellant would be entitled to succeed on that issue.

37.  In  the  circumstances  therefore  the  appeal  is  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

38.  Given that the appellant satisfies the rule it is  perhaps  unnecessary
    in the circumstances to go on  to  consider  the  issue  of  Article  8
    outside of those Rules.  It is not entirely clear whether the Judge did
    in fact consider Article 8 on its merits given the indication that  was
    made that an Article 8  application  could   have  been   made  on  the
    payment of an appropriate fee. Although the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    highlighted Gulshan no clear findings were  made  upon  that  issue  of
    whether or not there  were  compelling  circumstances  outside  of  the
    rules.  In those circumstances I do not find that the Judge  adequately
    considered Article 8 and so that finding  shall  be  set  aside  to  be
    remade if need be.  I do not deal with it as I have indicated   because
    I find that it  does  not  strictly  arise  given  the  fact  that  the
    appellants now meet the Rules.

Decision

39.  The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal  are  to  be  set  aside.  The
    decision in respect of the Immigration Rules is remade  to  the  extent
    that the appeal is allowed.
