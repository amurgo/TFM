                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This written Determination supplements and summarises the  ex  tempore
      judgement pronounced at the conclusion of the  appeal  hearing  on  13
      January 2014.

   2. This appeal has its origins in a decision made by the Entry  Clearance
      Officer ("the ECO") refusing the Appellant's application for clearance
      to enter the United Kingdom as a dependent  parent.  The  refusal  was
      based on an assessment that the application did not comply with all of
      the requirements of paragraph 317  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Upon
      internal appeal, this decision was affirmed  by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Manager, on 8th November 2012.

   3. The ensuing appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal ("FTT") was dismissed in
      a determination promulgated on 1st March 2013.   The  Judge  reasoned,
      found and concluded as follows:

      (a) The accommodation on offer to the Appellant, located in  the  same
           accommodation block as her daughter at a monthly rent  of  �130,
           differs from that proposed by the Appellant in her application -
           and, by implication, constitutes evidence postdating  the  ECO's
           decision, which must be disregarded by virtue of  section  85(A)
           of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("the  2002
           Act").


      (b) During the period of six months preceding the ECO's decision,  the
           Appellant was receiving, on average, some �312 per month from  a
           Northern Ireland bank account sustained  by  voluntary  payments
           made by various persons.


      (c) Her daughter (the sponsor) is  a  qualified  nurse  and  would  do
           everything possible to support the Appellant.


      (d) The sponsor has an income of at least �350 per  month,  funded  as
           noted above, which is "undoubtedly adequate for her  own  needs"
           and will remain secure.

      The Judge stated, finally, in paragraph 20:


           "However,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,   in   particular   the
           uncertainty over the Argentinean pension and the  rate  of  �130
           per month, I am not satisfied  the  Appellant  can  satisfy  the
           provisions of Rule 317(iv) and (iv)(a) and  accordingly  I  find
           myself having to dismiss this appeal."

   4. In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede stated:

           "There  is  an  arguable  point  about   the   nature   of   the
           accommodation offered to the Appellant and  whether  or  not  it
           must be disregarded as post-decision evidence.   There  is  also
           arguable merit in the grounds relating to the calculation of the
           sponsor's income and the lack of consideration given to  Article
           8 ECHR."

     One relates this to the grounds of appeal, which embody  the  following
contentions:


        i) The  Judge  erred  about  the  sponsor's  income,  the  evidence
           (emanating from two bank accounts) being that  this  was  around
           �700 per month, of which some �300 was devoted to the support of
           the Appellant.

      (ii)    This error is exposed and magnified by the simple  calculation
           which, based on the Judge's apparent finding, yields the  meagre
           residual  sum  of  around  �38  per  month  for  the   sponsor's
           maintenance and accommodation.

      (iii)   The judge failed to make any clear finding about  whether  the
           Appellant's Argentinean  state  pension  would  continue  to  be
           available to her in the United Kingdom.

      (iv)    The Judge, wrongly, appeared to invoke the  current  UK  basic
           state pension of �107.45 per  week  as  the  yardstick  for  the
           amount which the Appellant would require  to  maintain  herself.
           This ignored, for example, the current  Job  Seeker's  Allowance
           rate of �71 per week.


     (v) The FTT determination contains no consideration of Article 8  ECHR.



   5.     With specific reference to the grounds  of  appeal  listed  above,
      questions posed by the Tribunal at the hearing elicited the  following
      response from the Respondent's representative:

        i) It was acknowledged that the Judge's finding that the  sponsor's
           income was some �350.00,  rather  than  �700.00,  per  month  is
           perverse, as the evidence confounds it.


       ii) The unsustainability of  the  income  finding  is  magnified  by
           appropriate consequential calculations.

      iii) The Judge failed to make any finding about the  availability  of
           the Appellant's Argentinean state pension to her in the event of
           coming to live in the United Kingdom, a  failing  of  undeniable
           significance.

       iv) The yardstick which the Judge should properly have employed  was
           that of the Income Support rate of �67.50 per week, rather  than
           the current UK basic weekly state pension of �107.45.

        v) The Judge's failure to consider  Article  8  ECHR  and  to  make
           appropriate findings was a substantial one.


   6.     The two discrete requirements at paragraph 317 of the  Immigration
      Rules in play throughout were whether the Appellant:

        a)    can, and will, be accommodated adequately, together with  any
           dependents, without recourse to public funds,  in  accommodation
           which the sponsor owns or occupies exclusively; and


        b)    can, and will, be maintained adequately,  together  with  any
           dependents, without recourse to public funds.

     It was incumbent on the Judge to make  findings on every issue  bearing
      on the question of whether the  application  complied  with  paragraph
      317.  He was obliged to do so in clear terms  and  to  articulate  his
      supporting reasons.  See MK (Duty to  give  Reasons)  Pakistan  [2013]
      UKUT 641 (IAC).  In the  Determination  under  scrutiny,  there  is  a
      failure to make clear  findings  of  fact  relating  to  each  of  the
      requirements of the Rules.  There is also a free standing  failure  to
      make a clear finding  concerning  the  Appellant's  Argentinian  state
      pension. Furthermore, there is no consideration at all  of  Article  8
      ECHR.  The inexorable conclusion is  that  the  decision  of  the  FTT
      suffers from a series  of  errors  of  law  and  is  unsustainable  in
      consequence.  It must be set aside accordingly.

REMAKING THE DECISION

   7.      The  parties'  representatives  concurred  with  the   Tribunal's
      proposal that the decision be remade in this forum.  In this exercise,
      the only mildly  contentious  issue  which  emerged  was  whether  the
      Appellant  was  attempting,  impermissibly,  to  rely  on  some   new,
      additional information  contained  in  a  letter  dated  16  May  2012
      transmitted  on  her  behalf.   By  virtue  of   Section  85A  of  the
      Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the Tribunal was confined
      to considering "only the circumstances appertaining at the time of the
      decision".  I am satisfied that the aforementioned letter did not  add
      anything of substance or novelty to the information contained  in  the
      completed entry clearance application dated 12  March  2012  and  duly
      considered by the ECO in the initial decision of 26  April  2012  and,
      subsequently, by the Entry Clearance Manager in  the  internal  appeal
      decision dated  8  November  2012.   It  is  evident  that  the  ECO's
      decision, affirmed by the Manager, consisted of a failure to  properly
      consider and understand the information supplied in  the  application.
      I consider that the application  was  compliant  with  the  Rules  and
      should, therefore, have been allowed.  It  follows  that  this  appeal
      must succeed substantively.

   8.      In  passing,  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  the  potentially
      interesting question of whether the operative  decision,  for  initial
      appeal purposes, was, as a matter of law, the initial ECO decision  or
      the subsequent review decision of the Entry  Clearance  Manager  which
      "maintained" the former.





DECISION

   9.     The decision of the FtT is set aside and remade and the appeal  is
      allowed.

  10.     It follows that it is now incumbent on the  ECO,  subject  to  any
      sustainable bar, to grant the Appellant the visa requested.
