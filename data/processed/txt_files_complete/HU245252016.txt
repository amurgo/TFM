Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Y Darboe, Queen's Park Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against a decision by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal Cameron dismissing an appeal under the Immigration Rules and
      under Article 8.  The appeal was decided by the First-tier Tribunal
      without a hearing.


   2. The appellant is a national of Gambia.  Her appeal was brought against
      a decision dated 12 October 2016 by the respondent refusing her leave
      to remain as the partner of a British citizen.  The couple have a
      child who is a British citizen.

   3. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal.  This was
      principally on the basis that although the judge dismissed the appeal
      because the appellant had not provided all the specified documentary
      evidence under Appendix FM, it was arguable the judge did not make a
      clear finding on whether the appellant met the substantive maintenance
      requirements of Appendix FM and then proceed to consider how such a
      finding would factor into the proportionality assessment.  All the
      grounds were considered arguable.

Error of law

   4. Before me Mr Darboe began by concentrating on the issue of whether the
      documentary evidence which was before the judge met the requirements
      of Appendix FM.  He then turned to the significance of the appellant's
      daughter, who is a British citizen, having come from the Gambia to
      join her parents in the UK in the period between the refusal decision
      and the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  He questioned whether the
      judge had proper regard to paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM and to s
      117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as
      amended).  He contended that by refusing the appellant leave her
      daughter would be deprived of the benefits of her British and EU
      citizenship.


   5. Addressing first the issues arising from the presence of the
      appellant's daughter in the UK, there seemed to be an implication in
      the respondent's case that the daughter was brought to the UK for the
      specific purpose of affecting the outcome of this appeal.  In my view
      the evidence does not support this.  The evidence is that the daughter
      was sent to live with her grandmother in the Gambia while her father
      was studying full time here.  It was always the family's intention
      that when those studies were completed she would rejoin her parents in
      the UK.  The timing of this during the appeal proceedings was largely
      coincidental.  The daughter is now attending school in the UK.

   6. Mr Govan submitted that the presence of the daughter was a "new
      matter" in terms of s 85 of the 2002 Act and as such the consent of
      the Secretary of State was required before the Tribunal might consider
      the matter.  I do not agree.  A "new matter" is defined in s 85(6), in
      terms of which a matter is a "new matter" if it constitutes a ground
      of appeal of a kind listed in s 84.  Among the kinds of ground of
      appeal listed in s 84 is that the decision appealed against is
      unlawful under s 6 of the Human rights Act 1998.  The sole ground in
      this appeal is that the respondent's decision is a breach of Article
      8.  Accordingly, no new ground of appeal has been invoked.  The
      presence of the appellant's daughter in the UK is potentially a
      material factor in relation to the ground of appeal under Article 8
      but it does not constitute in itself a different ground of appeal of a
      kind listed in s 84 - it is an aspect of the original ground of appeal
      arising from new evidence.  Accordingly the daughter's presence is not
      a "new matter" under s 85(6).

   7. In the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal it was pointed out that
      at paragraph 39 the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found on the
      basis of the appellant's daughter having joined her in the UK that the
      appellant had a family life which would engage Article 8.
      Nevertheless, the judge did not consider the appeal under paragraph
      EX.1, seemingly because the respondent had not done so in the refusal
      decision.  The respondent could not have done so, however, because at
      the time of the respondent's decision the daughter was in the Gambia.
      Under s 85(4) of the 2002 Act the Tribunal was empowered to consider
      any relevant matter, including a matter arising after the date of the
      respondent's decision.  For reasons which I have already expressed,
      the daughter's arrival was not excluded from consideration as a "new
      matter" under sub-sections 85(5) and (6) but it was material.  The
      judge ought therefore to have had regard to it under paragraph
      EX.1.(a)(i) and the failure to do so constitutes an error of law.

   8. Similarly, although the judge found there was family life with the
      daughter in the UK, and referred to parts of s 117B, the judge did not
      refer specifically to s 117B(6) setting out the test of reasonableness
      in expecting the daughter to leave the UK.  Instead the judge appears
      to have considered whether there were obstacles to the daughter's
      return to the Gambia and whether this would be against her best
      interests.  The judge concluded, at paragraph 44, that it would not be
      unreasonable to expect the daughter and her father to accompany the
      appellant to the Gambia.  This finding appears to be based almost
      entirely on the lack of obstacles to the daughter's return and makes
      no mention at all of the positive benefits to the daughter, as a
      British citizen, of remaining in the UK.  By neglecting these positive
      factors, which might include, for example, the daughter's educational
      prospects, I consider that the judge disregarded relevant
      considerations and did not give adequate reasons for the conclusion
      reached.  These are further errors of law.

   9. Mr Darboe took me in great detail through the documentary evidence
      relating to the finances and employment of the appellant and her
      partner in relation to whether the specified documents required by
      Appendix FM-SE were provided.  I am grateful to Mr Darboe, and also to
      Mr Govan, for the assistance they gave me in relation to this and for
      their attention to detail.

  10. It is not disputed that the appellant did not initially provide all
      the specified documents with her application for leave to remain.
      Following receipt of the application the respondent wrote to the
      appellant asking for additional documents.  In the appellant's bundle
      was a copy of a letter dated 20 August 2016 sent by the appellant to
      the respondent enclosing "requested documents".  Regrettably the
      appellant did not provide a list of the documents enclosed with the
      letter.  This omission has in part contributed to the length and
      complexity of these proceedings.

  11. Nevertheless, Mr Darboe was able to demonstrate to my satisfaction
      that among the documents which accompanied the appellant's letter of
      20 August 2016 was a significant quantity to which the respondent
      failed to have regard in the refusal decision of 12 October 2016.  The
      refusal decision referred to missing payslips and bank statements in
      respect of both the appellant and her partner.  Mr Darboe pointed out
      that all of these documents, apart from a small number of payslips for
      the appellant, were provided with the letter of 20 August 2016, as was
      evidenced by the copies of them in the respondent's bundle.  Some of
      the missing payslips had then been submitted with the appellants'
      appeal bundle but there were still a couple which had been mislaid by
      the appellant.  Mr Darboe submitted that if the respondent had
      accepted that all the other documents had been provided, then a
      discretion could have been exercised to overlook the few missing
      payslips.  The payslips which were still missing appeared to be those
      for week 52 of 2015-16 and week 4 of 2016-17.  Mr Darboe further
      submitted that the respondent had not had regard to the correct period
      for payslips to be provided for the appellant's partner.  The
      respondent had asked for payslips for 12 months when only 6 months'
      payslips should have been required as, unlike the appellant, the
      partner had been working for the same employer for at least 6 months.


  12. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found at paragraph 25 that the
      appellant had not provided the specified documents requested by the
      respondent.  I can understand why the judge made this finding.  The
      judge heard no oral evidence or submissions and the appellant's letter
      of 20 August 2016, as already observed, did not list the documents
      provided.  Accordingly the respondent's error in the refusal letter as
      to the documents provided was not corrected by the judge.  In the
      circumstances this issue may not have been material to the outcome of
      the appeal, as the outcome hinged on reasonableness and
      proportionality.  Nevertheless, the appellant's strenuous attempt to
      provide all the specified documents might have had some effect, first
      on showing the substantive maintenance requirements were met, and
      secondly on proportionality, in that the appellant not only met the
      substantive requirement but had done all that she could to provide the
      specified documents.  I might add at this point that Mr Govan
      submitted that the respondent did not receive a copy of the
      appellant's appeal bundle but Mr Darboe contended this had been sent
      to Fleetbank House and proof of posting was available.  I did not
      consider it necessary to pursue this point further.


Substantive issues


  13. Having found errors of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,
      I invited the parties to address me on the substantive issues.  Not
      surprisingly, Mr Darboe's position was that not only were the
      substantive maintenance requirements met but it would not be
      reasonable to expect the appellant's child to leave the UK, in terms
      both of s 117B(6) and paragraph EX.1.(a)(i).  The documentary evidence
      showed the appellant to be earning around �13,500 per annum and her
      partner around �14,000.  I note that at paragraph 40 of the decision
      the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal appeared to accept that the
      maintenance requirements were met but did not proceed to factor this
      properly into the proportionality assessment.

  14. It is difficult to envisage a successful counter-argument to the
      submission by Mr Darboe as to how the decision should be re-made.
      Satisfying the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules,
      albeit subject to two missing payslips, greatly reduces the weight to
      be given to any public interest in refusing the appellant leave to
      remain.  Although the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found it would
      not be unreasonable to expect the appellant's daughter to leave the
      UK, this finding was made, as I have already pointed out, without any
      apparent regard to the positive benefits to the daughter of remaining
      here.  It was always the family's intention that the daughter would
      rejoin her parents in the UK after her father's studies were
      completed.  The daughter is at school here.  Her father is able to
      provide her with a settled family home here.  Notwithstanding that the
      daughter has lived for several years in the Gambia, it is difficult to
      see how her best interests would not be adversely affected by
      uprooting her from her new life in the UK.  On the contrary, this
      would be likely to have a deleterious effect on her education, her
      prospects and expectations, and on her emotional stability.  For these
      reasons I am satisfied it would not be reasonable to expect the
      appellant's daughter to leave the UK.

  15. The proper outcome for this appeal is that it is allowed under
      paragraph EX.1.(a)(i) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and
      under Article 8.


Conclusions


  16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the
      making of an error on a point of law.


  17. The decision of the First-tier tribunal is set aside.

  18. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.


Anonymity

I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and I see no reason of
substance for doing so.

Fee award                          (N.B.  This is not part of the decision)

Although my attention was drawn to deficiencies in the refusal decision,
the appellant made her application without all the specified documents.
The additional documents she submitted on 20 August 2016 also contained
omissions.  The outcome of the appeal was affected by the arrival of the
appellant's daughter in the UK.  I have not been asked to make a fee award
and in the circumstances I do not consider it appropriate to do so.
