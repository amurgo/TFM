Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Ximena Vengeochea, Advocate, instructed by Jain,
                    Neil, & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) Determination by FtT Judge McGavin, AA/05374/2015, promulgated on 6
         November 2015.

     ii) Respondent's decision, dated 3 March 2017.

    iii) Decision by FtT Judge Hands, promulgated on 11 July 2017.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission dated 25 July 2017.

 2. Ms Vengeochea referred to the extent to which the  appellant's  account
    had been accepted by the respondent, up to and including  the  incident
    of 11 August 2014, but not including claimed events on 12 August  2014,
    when the appellant said that she and other family members attended  the
    Islamic Office in connection with paperwork to register and  begin  the
    process of conversion to Islam.  The submission for the appellant  then
    followed these lines:

      i) There were two errors arising from �48 of  the  decision  of  Judge
         Hands.

     ii) The narration that from 2004 until they left  Malaysia  the  family
         "did not  encounter  difficulties  in  practising  their  Christian
         faith" took no account of the accepted facts.  The  judge  went  on
         from there to reach a conclusion not reasonably open to her on  the
         evidence.

    iii) It was accepted that the appellant's  father  converted  to  Islam.
         That compromised the religious freedom of the other family members.
          One example was that his marriage was  considered  to  be  against
         Sharia law.

     iv) The other error at �48 was in  saying,  "The  issue  before  me  is
         whether or not this appellant has signed a form to convert to Islam
         ...".  The correct issue was whether the appellant  was  liable  to
         forced conversion.  In  resolving  that  issue,  there  were  three
         possible scenarios.

      v)  Firstly,  the  appellant  had  completed  the   forms,   including
         signature, and the taking of a thumbprint and photographs, as shown
         by the evidence she relied upon in the  FtT.   In  that  case,  she
         would be officially considered Muslim, but it is accepted that  she
         is Christian.  The background evidence  (references  given)  showed
         that to have consequences amounting to persecution.  If accepted to
         have signed the forms, the appellant was entitled to protection.

     vi) Secondly, if no form was signed, the  appellant  is  the  Christian
         daughter of a Muslim convert father, and as such, by  reference  to
         similar background evidence, at risk of persecution.

    vii) Thirdly, if the  form  was  filled  in  but  not  signed,  and  the
         appellant failed to follow through on her conversion  as  expected,
         she would be seen as having renounced Islam or become an  apostate,
         with drastic consequences.

   viii) The issue was not signature or non-signature, but the likelihood of
         persecution as a Christian in an Islamic country.

     ix) The submission was  not  that  all  Christians  from  Malaysia  are
         entitled to protection, but that even on the accepted facts  up  to
         11 August 2014, put in context  of  the  background  evidence,  the
         appellant had made out her case.

      x) Those submissions were based on ground 1.  The other  grounds  were
         adopted but there was nothing to add.

 3. The main points of the submission for the respondent were as follows.

      i) The line between facts accepted and not accepted was agreed.

     ii) The claimed incident of  12  August  2014  had  been  part  of  the
         appellant's case before Judge McGavin.  That case failed because it
         was not  shown  that  the  alleged  persecutor  was,  as  belatedly
         claimed, prominent among the Malaysian authorities or in the Muslim
         community.  Thus, there was no risk  from  government  or  official
         sources, and both legal  sufficiency  of  protection  and  internal
         flight were available (see �18, 19, and 35).

    iii) The appellant before Judge Hands had not tried  to  show  that  the
         alleged persecutor has any higher profile than as  found  by  Judge
         McGavin, and had not shown that any other  conclusion  should  have
         been reached on sufficiency of protection.

     iv) Judge McGavin did not appear to have made a specific finding  about
         the incident of 12 August 2014, but that was  because  the  parties
         had taken the crucial issue to be the position and influence of the
         persecutor, on which the appellant failed.

      v) The phrase in �48 about not encountering  difficulties  had  to  be
         read in context.  The decision as a whole made it  clear  that  the
         prior incidents were well known to the judge.  They  had  not  been
         accepted  as  incidents  of  persecution  by  the  authorities   on
         religious grounds.  There was no misunderstanding.

     vi) Judge Hands took up her task from the  point  where  Judge  McGavin
         left the case, and correctly focused on what remained  for  her  to
         decide - a question of fact, whether there had been an  attempt  at
         forced conversion on 12 August 2014, in the resolution of which  no
         error was shown.

    vii) The rest of the appellant's submissions  had  no  basis  either  in
         ground 1 or in the rest of the grounds, and were in substance  only
         re-argument of the case put to the FtT.

   viii) Grounds 2 - 8 were all only complaints about the  FtT's  resolution
         of the facts.  None of them disclosed anything of substance.

 4. Ms Vengeochea in reply submitted that the judge  had  fallen  into  the
    error of looking at the incident of 12 August 2014 independently of the
    previous incidents, and so misunderstood the real issue, and failed  to
    factor in the accepted facts which  led  the  appellant  to  flee  from
    Malaysia.

 5. I reserved my decision.

 6. Read fairly and in context, Judge Hands at �48 was not saying that  the
    appellant and her family never had  any  problems.  Previous  incidents
    were clearly before her, but they had not been proved to  be  instances
    of persecution on religious grounds or from official sources - see  the
    conclusions of Judge McGavin at �35.

 7. The facts prior to 12 August 2014 did  not  entitle  the  appellant  to
    protection - as found by Judge McGavin.

 8. The appellant's submissions were clearly developed,  but  they  had  no
    anchor point of error by Judge Hands.  In substance, they are only  re-
    argument of a case which has been successively rejected, for reasons in
    which no error on a point of law has been shown.

 9. There was no error in the identification by Judge Hands  of  the  issue
    before her.  That exactly reflected the presentation  of  the  case  by
    both sides.  Nor is any error shown in her resolution  of  that  issue.
    The grounds in that respect are no  more  than  insistence,  through  a
    series of immaterial quibbles.

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

11. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
