Representation:

For the appellants:    Mrs M Izevbizua, instructed by Leslie Charles
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellants,  Oulwayemisi  Adebola  Matthew-Okoromi,  her  husband,
    Matthew  Erumusele  Okoromi,  and  their  child  Emmanuella  Moyinoluwa
    Matthew-Okoromi, date of birth 3.12.07, are citizens of Nigeria.

 2. These are their linked appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Garratt,  promulgated  on  10.2.14,  dismissing  their
    appeals against  the  decisions  of  the  respondent  to  refuse  their
    applications made on 11.5.12 for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    on human rights grounds.  The Judge heard the appeal on 28.1.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane granted permission to appeal on 3.3.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Garratt should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background is that the first appellant came to the UK as a
    student in 2007. She was married to the second appellant in Nigeria  in
    2005 and they have two children  from  their  relationship,  the  third
    appellant was born in the UK in 2007. Sadly, they lost a second  child.
    However, their third child was born in the UK on 18.9.12. The first and
    second appellants lived together in Nigeria before she came to the  UK.
    She continues to have close relatives including  her  mother  and  four
    siblings. The second appellant also has family in Nigeria.  There  have
    been visits to and from the relatives in Nigeria. Unusually, the second
    appellant had obtained employment in Nigeria some two years earlier  to
    the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  and  he  continues  to  work  there,
    returning to the UK to visit his family during his  vacation  time.  He
    had last returned from Nigeria on  24.1.14,  having  been  there  since
    28.9.13, and was due to return to work in Nigeria on 9.2.14, living  in
    the same rented home he had  shared  there  with  the  first  appellant
    before she came to the UK. Although he continued with his employment he
    feared fall-out from a proposed prosecution of  the  directors  of  his
    employing company, MTN.

 7. The applications were made  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  on  human
    rights grounds.

 8. Judge Garratt found that there was no real risk of serious  harm  under
    article 8. The judge then proceeded to consider  article  8,  including
    the best interests  of  the  two  children,  finding  that  their  best
    interests were to be with their  parents,  whether  in  the  UK  or  in
    Nigeria, with their immediate and extended family. The judge considered
    the private and family life of the two adult appellants, as well as the
    private and family life of the child appellant and the other child. The
    judge found no compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised under
    the Immigration Rules such as to justify granting leave  to  remain  on
    the basis of article 8 ECHR outside the Rules. The judge found  nothing
    to prevent relocation of the family to Nigeria. Finally, the judge went
    on  to  consider  article  8  under  the  well-known  5  Razgar  steps,
    concluding that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    disproportionate.

 9. The grounds content that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a  material
    error of law in failing to consider article 8 ECHR outside  the  Rules.
    However, it is clear that the judge  did  in  fact  conduct  a  careful
    article 8 assessment outside the Immigration  Rules.  I  thus  find  no
    merit in that ground of appeal. Neither  can  I  find  that  the  judge
    failed to take into account any material factors or  evidence  relating
    to article 8 private and family life considerations.

10. The primary ground of appeal is that the judge made a material error of
    law by applying the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard of proof, rather
    than the balance of probabilities. At �28 the judge stated, "As to  the
    evidence I apply the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and look
    at the facts as at the date of the hearing."

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Keane observed,  "Although  the
    judge in the final  sentence  of  paragraph  31  of  his  determination
    explicitly applied the real risk standard of proof in finding that  the
    appellants would not be exposed to a risk of harm contrary to Article 3
    of the Human Rights Convention upon their return to Nigeria, given  the
    judge's reference to the beyond reasonable doubt standard of  proof  it
    is arguable that he had in mind a higher standard of  proof  than  that
    applicable  and  arguably  his  findings  as  to  the  risk  which  the
    appellants  faced  upon  a  return  to  Nigeria  were  in  error.   The
    applications for permission are granted."

12. The Rule 24 response asserts that whilst the  judge  at  �28  "mentions
    'beyond reasonable doubt' it is clear from the  findings  made  he  has
    used (the) correct standard being the balance of probabilities." It  is
    further submitted in respect of the other grounds that the  judge  gave
    full and cogent reasons for rejecting the article 3 claim and  properly
    considered the article 8 claim, including the  best  interests  of  the
    child, finding that there are no compelling reasons why  it  should  be
    considered outside the Rules. However, for good order sake went  on  to
    consider the 5 step Razgar test, finding the decision of the  Secretary
    of State proportionate. "Despite the apparent slip of the  judge's  pen
    at paragraph 28 it will be submitted that the decision does not  reveal
    a material error of law."

13. It is important to point out  that  in  this  case  the  essential  and
    background facts were not in dispute; the judge's task was to apply the
    correct law to those facts. There was no requirement therefore for  the
    judge  to  decide  between  competing  assertions  as  to  the  factual
    background, as there often may  be  in  other  cases.  This  is  highly
    relevant to the issue as the error of standard of proof.

14. There is no doubt that at �28 the judge  stated  that  he  intended  to
    apply the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard of proof. However, I  find
    that it is clear and beyond doubt from  the  determination  read  as  a
    whole that the judge applied the correct standard of proof and did  not
    seek to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt. For example at �31,  when
    reaching his conclusion on the claim under article 3, the judge stated,
    "I am not satisfied that the appellants have shown that there is a real
    risk of suffering the serious harm proscribed  by  Article  3  if  they
    return to Nigeria to live." The judge had already recited the claim  of
    the second appellant that he was involved in a legal dispute  that  put
    he and his family "at real risk of serious harm of the kind set out  in
    Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention. For the reasons which  follow
    I do not accept that such a risk exists."

15. Similarly, in relation to  article  8,  it  is  clear  that  the  judge
    considered and took into account the best interests of the two children
    of the adult appellants and reached the conclusion that  the  decisions
    of the Secretary of State were not disproportionate to  the  rights  of
    the appellants.

16. I find that the appellants are in essence seeking to take advantage  of
    an obvious clerical slip by the  judge  when  stating  the  burden  and
    standard of proof. If one took out �28 from the determination there  is
    nothing within the balance of the determination  to  suggest  that  the
    judge was applying the wrong  standard  of  proof  at  any  stage.  The
    background facts not being in dispute, the appellants have been  unable
    to point to any  finding  of  fact  which  should  have  been  resolved
    differently, or to which it could be said the judge  may  have  applied
    too high a standard of proof.

17. In the circumstances, whilst the slip referred to in  relation  to  the
    standard of proof could have been fatal to the  determination,  on  the
    facts of this case and on a careful reading of the determination it  is
    abundantly clear that  when  it  came  down  to  applying  the  correct
    standard of proof, the judge did so.

18. For all the reasons stated, I find that there is no material  error  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

19. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. However,  no  submissions  were
made in respect of anonymity. I see no basis for  continuing  the  anonymity
order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal remain dismissed.
