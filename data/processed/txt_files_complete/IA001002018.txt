Appellant:  None
Respondent: Ms Isherwood


                          DECISION AND REASONS (A)


   1. This is an appeal with a lengthy history.  It is  unnecessary  to  set
      this out in any detail here.  Suffice to say that  the  appellant  has
      sought to challenge a decision of the FTT not  to  adjourn  a  hearing
      that took place on 4 December  2018.   In  its  decision  sent  on  25
      January 2019, the FTT dismissed the appellant's appeal.  The  decision
      under appeal is not altogether clear from the FTT's decision.    Since
      then the appellant made an application for a residence card on 19  May
      2019, which he was granted (due to expire on 23 July 2024).


   2. In a decision dated 19 August 2020 I concluded  that  the  appellant's
      appeal has been abandoned by statute, and  notice  was  given  to  the
      appellant  informing  him  that  the  appeal  was  being  treated   as
      abandoned.  The appellant has not responded to that  decision  or  the
      notice contained within it, and the time-limit for doing so  has  long
      passed - see  s. 104(4A) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
      Act 2002 and rule 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
      2008 ('the 2018 Rules').


   3. In an email dated 3  September  2020  Mr  Deller,  on  behalf  of  the
      respondent, suggested that as the appellant was  granted  a  residence
      card pursuant to the EEA  Regulations  and  not  "leave  to  enter  or
      remain", his appeal could not be treated as abandoned pursuant  to  s.
      104(4A).  Mr Deller was quite right to point this out - see [5] of MSU
      (S.104(4b) notices) Bangladesh [2019] UKUT 412 (IAC).  I do  not  need
      to resolve this issue because I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant's
      appeal must be dismissed in any event.

   4. The appellant was clearly told in the decision dated  19  August  2020
      that he should contact the Tribunal within 14 days  if  he  wished  to
      pursue his appeal (notwithstanding the grant of a residence card)  and
      he has not done so.  He has been given notice of this hearing and  not
      attended, without explanation.

   5. In all the circumstances and  bearing  in  mind  the  2018  Rules,  in
      particular the overriding objective, I am satisfied that the appellant
      has demonstrated no  interest  in  pursuing  his  appeal  and  it  can
      properly and fairly be determined  on  the  papers.   The  reason  the
      appellant has not prosecuted his own appeal is probably because he has
      already been granted the outcome  he  was  seeking  by  bringing  this
      appeal  -  lawful  residence  in  the  UK.   Given   the   appellant's
      demonstrable lack of any interest in pursuing this appeal, he has  not
      met the burden of proof on him and I dismiss his appeal.


Signed: Ms M Plimmer                               Dated: 18 December 2020
