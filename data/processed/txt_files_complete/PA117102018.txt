Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. Brown, Counsel instructed by First Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").  As
    this a protection claim, it is appropriate that a  direction  is  made.
    Unless and until a Tribunal or Court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly  or
    indirectly identify him or any member of  his  family.  This  direction
    applies amongst others to all parties.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan who appealed to the FtT against
    a decision of the respondent dated 24th August 2018 refusing his  claim
    for asylum and humanitarian protection.  His appeal was  dismissed  for
    the reasons set out in the decision of FtT Judge Davies promulgated  on
    12th November 2018.


The decision of the FtT Judge


 3. The background to the appellant's claim for  international  protection,
    taken from the respondents decision, is set out at paragraphs  [15]  to
    [21] of the decision. At the hearing of the appeal, the FtT Judge heard
    evidence from the appellant, and two witnesses.  The  evidence  of  the
    appellant is set out at paragraphs [28] to [44] of  the  decision.  The
    evidence of the first witness, [ZM], who  claims  to  have  been  in  a
    sexual relationship with the appellant since January 2017, is  set  out
    at paragraphs [45] to [48] of the decision.  The evidence of the second
    witness, [IC], who claims to be a famous drag queen known as  'ZK',  is
    set out at paragraphs [49] to [53] of the decision.


 4. The Judge's findings and conclusions are set out at paragraphs [75]  to
    [92] of the decision. At paragraph [75]. The Judge states:


         "I  have  no  hesitation  in  this  appeal  in  concluding,   after
         considering all the evidence, and applying the  lower  standard  of
         proof to it, that both the appellant and his witnesses  have  given
         evidence that is untruthful and thus unreliable."


 5. At paragraph [76] of the decision, the  FtT  Judge  concluded  that  he
    could attach no weight to a written statement from  [GH],  a  Pakistani
    national who sought to confirm that he had had  a  sexual  relationship
    with the appellant, whilst the two of them were studying  in  the  same
    school in Pakistan. Having considered the evidence of the appellant and
    [GH], the FtT Judge identifies  a  number  of  concerns  regarding  the
    credibility of the claim made by the appellant.  At paragraphs [87]  to
    [91], the FtT Judge considered the evidence of the two  witnesses  that
    had given evidence to the Tribunal.  Insofar as [ZM] is  concerned,  at
    paragraphs [87] and [88], the Judge states:


         "87. Whilst accepting  that  the  witness  [ZM]  has  been  granted
         refugee status on the basis of his sexuality, taking  into  account
         the appellant's lack of credibility I do not  believe  that  he  is
         genuinely in a homosexual relationship with the appellant.


         88.  I do not believe that [ZM] has been a truthful witness."


 6. Insofar as the evidence of [IC] is concerned, the Judge found that  the
    evidence was of no value because  the  appellant  and  [IC]  had  given
    completely inconsistent evidence  as  to  where  they  met.  The  Judge
    rejected the claim that [IC] and the appellant were in a  relationship,
    which resulted in them having sex in a hotel in Manchester. Again,  the
    Judge found [IC] to be an untruthful witness who was brought  to  court
    to support a false claim  for  refugee  status  by  the  appellant.  At
    paragraph [91], the Judge concluded as follows:


         "I have fully considered the submissions made  by  the  appellant's
         representatives but I cannot accept that the appellant is genuinely
         a bisexual, that he  was  ever  in  a  homosexual  relationship  in
         Pakistan,  or  that  he  was  ever  genuinely   in   a   homosexual
         relationship in the United Kingdom."


The appeal before me


 7. The grounds of appeal  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  criticise  the
    Judge's assessment of the evidence given by the appellant's  witnesses,
    and the support that they provide to the account  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant.  The appellant contends that the Judge  provides  inadequate
    reasons for rejecting the evidence of [ZM] and [IC].  It is  said  that
    the 'mistake' in the evidence between the appellant  and  [IC],  as  to
    where they had met, was not sufficient to  undermine  the  evidence  of
    their relationship and the claim that they had had sex at  a  hotel  in
    Manchester following a night out. It is also said that the Judge  erred
    in the assessment of the written evidence of [GH], and failed  to  make
    any finding as to whether the appellant was in a relationship with R.


 8. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge Murray om  18th  December
    2018.  The matter comes before me to determine whether the decision  of
    the FtT Judge contains a material error of law, and if so,  the  remake
    the decision.


 9. On the behalf of the appellant, Mr  Brown  submits  that  both  of  the
    witnesses that  gave  evidence  before  the  Tribunal,  attested  to  a
    physical and sexual relationship with the appellant.  He  submits  that
    the Judge has failed to provide  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    evidence given by [ZM] and [IC], and the Judge appears to  have  formed
    an opinion about the appellant, that has infected his consideration  of
    the evidence given by the witnesses.   He  submits  that  it  does  not
    appear to have put to either of the witnesses  that  attended  to  give
    evidence, that they had come to  the  Tribunal  to  give  a  fabricated
    account, to support the claim being made by the appellant.  He  submits
    that the finding that the evidence of the witnesses was untruthful, was
    a serious allegation that was not put to the witnesses.


10.  Mr Bates submits that it was properly open to the Judge to outline the
    conclusion that he had reached, at paragraph [75], and to then set  out
    his reasons for that conclusion. He submits that the matters set out at
    paragraphs [80] to [85] of the decision, are plainly matters that  were
    relevant to the  assessment  of  the  appellant's  credibility.  Having
    rejected the appellant's evidence it was open to the Judge, to conclude
    that  [ZM]  was  not  a  truthful  witness.  He  claimed  to  be  in  a
    relationship with  the  appellant,  and  the  Judge  had  rejected  the
    appellant's claim that they were in a relationship.  Mr  Bates  submits
    the Judge considered the evidence of [IM], and was  again  entitled  to
    reject that evidence.  There was plainly an inconsistency  between  the
    account provided by the appellant and [IM], as to where they  met.   Mr
    Bates submits that the Judge considered the written  evidence  of  [GH]
    and was entitled to conclude that no weight can  be  attached  to  that
    evidence, for the reasons given. He submits that the  Judge  considered
    all the evidence in the round, and reached findings that were  open  to
    him on the evidence.


Discussion


11. The assessment of credibility in an appeal such as  this  is  always  a
    highly fact sensitive task.  The Judge was  required  to  consider  the
    evidence carefully, and where the appellant's account was rejected, set
    out his reasons for rejecting the evidence. The Judge was  required  to
    give a brief explanation of the conclusions that he had reached on  the
    central issues; Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT
    00085 IAC


12. I have carefully read the witness statements of the appellant  and  his
    witnesses.  The Judge could not have been assisted by  the  brevity  of
    the statements of the witnesses.  They provide very  scant  information
    about their relationship with the appellant.  Although  I  accept  that
    the reasons provided in the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  need  not  be
    extensive, the reasons  given  by  the  FtT  Judge  for  rejecting  the
    evidence of [ZM] in particular, are in my judgement, insufficient.  The
    Judge accepted that [ZM] has been granted refugee status on  the  basis
    of his sexuality but did  not  accept  that  [ZM]  is  genuinely  in  a
    relationship with the appellant.  The Judge simply states that he  does
    not believe [ZM] to be a truthful witness.  It is difficult to  discern
    from the decision, the reasons why  the  Judge  found  [ZM]  to  be  an
    untruthful witness.


13. I pause to note that it would appear that [ZM] was granted a  Residence
    Permit in June 2017, after his claimed relationship with the  appellant
    had commenced.  The witness statement  of  [ZM]  provides  very  little
    information about his relationship with the appellant.  The Judge might
    have  been  assisted  by  the  disclosure  of  the  background  to  the
    protection claim made by [ZM] to establish whether [ZM]  had  made  any
    reference in his own claim, to his  relationship  with  the  appellant.
    The Judge was not assisted in his task by the very limited  information
    provided about the relationship by [ZM], but that is not  to  say  that
    the Judge was entitled  to  find  that  [ZM]  is  not  genuinely  in  a
    relationship with the appellant,  and  that  [ZM]  is  not  a  truthful
    witness, without adequate reasons.


14. There was plainly a material inconsistency between the evidence of  the
    appellant and [IM], that the Judge was entitled to take  into  account,
    in reaching his decision.  On its own, I would not have found there  to
    have been an error of law in the Judge's approach to  the  evidence  of
    [IM].  I have carefully read the witness statement of [IM]  and  it  is
    limited in its content, and very vague about the  relationship  between
    [IM] and the appellant.


15. I am quite satisfied that the matters set out  at  paragraphs  [80]  to
    [85] of the decision, are matters that were relevant to the  assessment
    of the  appellant's  credibility,  and  weigh  against  the  appellant.
    Having carefully  considered  the  appellant's  account  of  events  in
    Pakistan, his relationships in the UK, and  the  extent  to  which  the
    evidence of the witnesses lends support to that account,  it  may  well
    have been open to the Judge to find in the end,  that  the  appellant's
    account of events is not credible and is untrue, but the  appellant  is
    entitled to know the reasons why the Judge rejected the evidence of the
    witnesses.


16. In my judgement, the FtT Judge failed to provide adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the evidence of the witnesses,  in  particular  [ZM],  as  to
    those aspects of the claim that lay at  the  heart  of  the  claim.   A
    careful reading of the decision establishes that the  Judge  failed  to
    consider the evidence in the round, and failed to consider whether  the
    evidence of the  witnesses  was  capable  of  lending  support  to  the
    evidence of the appellant.   It  follows  that  in  my  judgement,  the
    decision of the FtT Judge is infected by a material error of  law,  and
    the appeal is allowed.


17. I must then consider whether to remit the case to the FtT,  or  to  re-
    make the decision myself. In my judgment, the appropriate course is  to
    remit the matter to  the  FtT  for  hearing  afresh  with  no  findings
    preserved. In reaching my decision, I have taken into account paragraph
    7.2 of the Senior President's  Practice  Statement  of  25th  September
    2012.  In my view, in determining the appeal, the nature and extent  of
    any judicial fact-finding necessary will be extensive. The parties will
    be advised of the date  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  in  due
    course.


Notice of Decision


18. The appeal is allowed, and the decision of  FtT  Judge  Davies  is  set
    aside.


19. The appeal is remitted to the FtT for a fresh  hearing  of  the  appeal
    with no findings preserved.  The parties will be informed of a  hearing
    date in due course.
