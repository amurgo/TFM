                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless I  shall  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the First Tier Tribunal that  is  Mr  and  Mrs  A  and
    children  as  the  appellants  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as   the
    respondent.

 2. The appellants are nationals of Sri Lanka and their applications  dated
    14th November 2013 under Appendix FM were refused on 27th December 2013
    by the respondent under  R-LTRP.1.1  and  under  paragraph  276ADE.   A
    decision was also made to remove them.

 3. In a decision dated 29th August 2014 Judge of the First  Tier  Tribunal
    Samimi allowed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.

 4. She recorded that the first appellant arrived in the UK in October 2005
    and his wife and children now aged 15 years and 11  years  followed  in
    2008. The first appellant worked as a manager in Macdonalds  Restaurant
    and the children were settled and doing well at school.  An independent
    social  worker  gave  evidence  that  the  children  would   experience
    emotional harm should they be removed to Sri  Lanka.   She  also  found
    that the appellants were not an economic burden on the UK.

Application for Permission to Appeal

 5.  The  application  for  permission  made  stated  that  any  Article  8
    assessment should only be made after a consideration of the  rules  and
    the assessment should be carried out only when  there  were  compelling
    circumstances.  Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640  (IAC)  made  clear  that  an
    Article 8 assessment  should  only  be  carried  out  when  there  were
    compelling circumstances and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720  confirmed that  the
    meaning of exceptional circumstances as  leading  to  an  unjustifiably
    harsh outcome.

 6. The judge had failed to provide adequate reasoning  to  show  why  this
    would lead to an unjustifiably harsh  outcome.    The  family  knew  on
    entry that their life here was temporary.  The family still  have  ties
    in Sri Lanka and were able  to  speak  the  language.  The  family  had
    knowledge of the language and customs there and could  fully  re-adapt.
    As Sri Lankan nationals it would be in the children's best interests to
    return. Paragraph 60 of  EV Philippines & Oths v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    874 stated

         'That is a long way from the facts of our case. In our case none of
         the family is a British citizen. None has the right  to  remain  in
         this  country.  If  the  mother  is  removed,  the  father  has  no
         independent right to remain. If the parents are removed, then it is
         entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them. As  the
         immigration judge found it is obviously in their best interests  to
         remain with their parents. Although it is, of course a question  of
         fact for the tribunal, I cannot see that the desirability of  being
         educated at public expense in the UK can outweigh  the  benefit  to
         the children of remaining with their parents.  Just  as  we  cannot
         provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot  educate  the
         world'.

 7. The judge had erred in failing to consider the  burden  on  the  public
    purse and resources.  The social worker report  was  not  an  objective
    report and the expert was not a country  expert  on  Sri  Lanka  nor  a
    qualified psychologist and therefore not qualified to  make  assessment
    on the psychological impact on the appellants if removed.   In  essence
    this was an ordinary family.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing Mr Melvin submitted that  the  schooling  costs  of  the
    third and fourth appellants were a burden to the public purse and  this
    had not been taken into account and outweighed  any  the  assertion  of
    relaxation of immigration control.  The judge had  misdirected  herself
    by not following the MF Nigeria [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.   The  judge  was
    not aware of Patel and ors v SSHD [2013] UKSC  72  which  reminded  the
    courts that Article 8 was not a general dispensing power.  At the  date
    of the application the children had only been in the UK for 7 years and
    could not  come  within  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  focus  in  the
    determination was purely on the education of the children. If the judge
    had considered the correct caselaw she could  not  have  come  to  this
    decision.  There was  nothing  unjustifiably  harsh  in  expecting  the
    family to leave.

 9. Ms  Yong  submitted  that  the  judge  had  looked  at  the  compelling
    circumstances outside the immigration rules at [10]  of  the  decision.
    She referred to [128] of MM.  This  case  was  clearly  distinguishable
    from Patel which referred to  adult  students.  These  were  two  young
    children who had spent their formative years in the UK.   She  accepted
    that  the  expert  was  neither  an  educational  psychologist  nor   a
    psychiatrist but  the judge took into account the best interests of the
    children.  The social ties of the children to the  UK  had  been  taken
    into account.  The first appellant earned an income  of  �21,000.   His
    wife was not working. The P60 submitted by the first  appellant  showed
    he earned �24,000 in 2012 to 2013 not  �21,000.   The  family  did  not
    claim any benefits.

Conclusions

10. The judge took into account the principles  evinced  in  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27 and repeated throughout the decision that the  appellants  were
    not an economic burden on the country [17], [23].  That said the  judge
    also concentrated on the education that the children were receiving and
    how  well  they  were  doing  academically.   She  accepted  that   the
    appellants had integrated well into the community [23]  and  took  into
    account the best interests of the children  following  Zoumbas  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 74.   She  identified  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decision
    affecting  children;  onwards  appeals)  [2013]  UKUT  197  IAC   which
    identified that with regards children seven years from the age of  four
    is likely to be more significant to a child that the first seven  years
    of life.

11. The fact is however that only the first appellant is working and paying
    tax.  He paid the sum of �2,702 in the tax  year  2012-2013.   Although
    there were repeated findings that  the  family  were  not  an  economic
    burden on the country there was no evidence before  the  judge  of  the
    cost to the taxpayer of the children's education.  The judge  cited  EV
    Philippines v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 but did not appear  to  identify
    the reasoning that the public expense of education should be taken into
    account and this was an error. EV stated

         'In fact the immigration judge weighed the best  interests  of  the
         children as  a  primary  consideration,  and  set  against  it  the
         economic well-being of the country. As Maurice Kay LJ  pointed  out
         in AE (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]
         EWCA Civ 653 at [9] in conducting that exercise it would have  been
         appropriate to consider the cost to the public purse  in  providing
         education to these children. In fact that was  not  something  that
         the  immigration  judge   explicitly   considered.   If   anything,
         therefore, the immigration judge adopted an approach too favourable
         to the appellant'.

12. Further the judge identified that a child remaining in the UK for seven
    years was a relevant period in assessing proportionality but found that
    the children had only been in the country for 6 years and 9 months. The
    judge found at [16] that

         'the children would clearly be removed with their parents and there
         would be no prospect of the family unit being disrupted.  The first
         and second appellants have no right to remain in their  own  right.
         They  are  not  British  Citizens  and  they  have  no   legitimate
         expectation of remaining in the United Kingdom beyond the period of
         their leave.  The first appellant has said that the family do  have
         a home in Sri Lanka and given that the first appellant ahs  studied
         and worked in the United Kingdom it is highly likely that he  would
         be in a good position to seek employment in Sri Lanka.  However  in
         considering the interest of the children I attach particular  weigh
         to the fact that they have been living in the  United  Kingdom  for
         six years and nine  months  now.   In  this  regard  this  case  is
         distinguishable from EV where the children had only resided in  the
         United Kingdom for three years'.

13. I find that the judge erred when approaching the matter  on  the  basis
    that the appellants are not an economic burden on  the  UK  and  I  set
    aside the decision.  There are two children in full time education  and
    the papers before the First Tier Tribunal Judge showed the tax paid  by
    the father, the first appellant which was �2,702 in the tax  year  2012
    to 2013 on a yearly salary of �21,440.

14. It was accepted by Counsel for the appellant that the appellants  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules and I find that to be the case.
     The determination of Judge Samimi is also preserved in respect of  the
    findings regarding the Immigration Rules.

15. I am not persuaded there is anything which is not  encompassed  by  the
    Immigration Rules such that the matter needs to be  considered  further
    save that the children have been in  the  UK  for  a  lengthy  time.  I
    proceed to remake the decision following the Razgar principles.

         'In a case where removal is resisted  in  reliance  on  Article  8,
         these questions are likely to be:


               b. Will the proposed removal be an interference by  a  public
                  authority with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to
                  respect for his private or (as the  case  may  be)  family
                  life?


               c. If so, will such interference have  consequences  of  such
                  gravity as potentially to engage the operation of  Article
                  8?


               d. If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


               e. If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
                  society in the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                  safety or the economic well-being of the country, for  the
                  prevention of disorder or crime,  for  the  protection  of
                  health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and
                  freedoms of others?


               f.  If  so,  is  such  interference  proportionate   to   the
                  legitimate public ends sought to be achieved?'

16. I accept that the family have developed a private life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Their family life however is amongst themselves. As the judge
    stated at [16] of her determination, and which  paragraph  I  preserve,
    the family will be removed together.   The threshold to show that their
    removal from the  United  Kingdom  would  have  "consequences  of  such
    gravity' as to engage Article 8 is low. I find that his removal  is  in
    accordance with the law and indeed it was accepted by counsel that  the
    family could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.  I conclude  that
    the decision has a legitimate aim and is necessary for  the  protection
    of the rights and freedoms of others and the economic wellbeing of  the
    country through the maintenance of immigration control.  I give  weight
    to the position of the Secretary of State further to  Shahzad  (Art  8:
    legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC).

17. I turn to proportionality. I consider the  children's  interests  as  a
    primary  consideration  and  further  to  Section  55  of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.   I  have  read  the  independent
    social worker's report.  The children  have  now  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for 6 years and  11  months.   It  is  clear  that  this  is  a
    considerable time and a time which is during the formative years of the
    children's development, Azimi-Moayed. Nonetheless the older child spent
    the first eight years of his life in Sri Lanka prior to coming  to  the
    UK in 2008.  However, the daughter came to the UK at the  age  of  four
    and has now spent a key period of her life developing  in  the  UK.   I
    factor this into the balancing exercise.  The  older  child  a  son  is
    about to take his GCSE examinations in 2015 and  his  predicted  grades
    are 10 A*s.  The younger child a daughter is due to take  her  11  plus
    examination in September 2014. Both have friends at school and  in  the
    community.

18. I also note the report from Diane Jackson the independent social worker
    dated 30th July 2014.  She referred  to  the  negative  impact  of  the
    children's education and the sense of bereavement should  the  children
    be removed to Sri Lanka because they were  completely  acclimatised  to
    life in the UK and had strong ties. She opined that the  removal  would
    set the children back several years and would cause them emotional harm
    but this is speculation and although a social worker  Ms  Jackson  does
    not profess to be a psychiatrist or a psychologist. The children  would
    be parted from friends but would remain with the emotional  support  of
    their parents who assisted them in the transition and  relocation  from
    Sri Lanka some years ago.  There was no indication  that  the  removal,
    particularly when the parents have always known that their stay in  the
    United Kingdom was temporary, could  not  be  effected  constructively.
    There was no indication of significant  special  educational  needs  or
    health problems.

19. The best interests of the children further to  ZH  (Tanzania)   v  SSHD
    [2011] UKSC 4 is that they remain with  their  parents.   There  is  no
    question other than the children would remove with their parents to Sri
    Lanka. The children speak basic Sinhalese and have a home in Sri  Lanka
    to which they can return.  I take into  account  that  their  education
    would be disrupted but there was no evidence before me that  there  was
    no education system in Sri Lanka.  Indeed the first appellant  came  to
    the United Kingdom in 2007  having had an education  in  Sri  Lanka  to
    continue his studies. The  children's  education  may  be  of  a  lower
    standard in Sri Lanka and that is a factor that I take into account but
    it is not the case that the children would be without parents,  a  home
    or an education or health care on removal to Sri Lanka.

20. The children also have extended family in Sri Lanka and are Sri  Lankan
    nationals.  To continue their lives in the United Kingdom will  deprive
    them of further knowledge of their own customs  and  traditions  there.
    The best interests of the children are to be with their  parents.  That
    their education will be disrupted  is  unfortunate  and  not  in  their
    interests but I am enjoined to consider other factors.  Indeed  Zoumbas
    confirms that the best interests of the children can be  outweighed  by
    other factors.

21. I cannot see that the desirability of being educated at public  expense
    in the UK can outweigh the benefit to the children  of  remaining  with
    their parents.  All of the family have  only  been  here  on  temporary
    leave.

22. I must also have regard factors with regard  to  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that

    (3)
      'It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
      the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek
      to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
      because such persons-

      (a) are not a burden on taxpayers',

      ...and..


    (5)

      'Little weight should be given to a  private  life  established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious'.

23. The maintenance of immigration control is thus in the  public  interest
    and those who seek to remain in the United Kingdom should not a  burden
    on taxpayers.  That cannot be said of this family.   I  do  not  accept
    that the cost of educating the children is outweighed by the  tax  paid
    by the father as outlined above.  His salary is now at �24,000 but this
    would not generate significantly more tax. Both children  are  educated
    at state expense and only the father is working and paying tax.

24. Despite the fact that EV Philippines related to children who  had  been
    in the UK  for  a  lesser  period  nonetheless  the  general  principle
    enunciated was as follows at paragraph 59

         'In my judgment, therefore, the assessment of the best interests of
         the children must be made on the basis that the facts are  as  they
         are in the real world. If one parent has no right  to  remain,  but
         the other parent does, that is the  background  against  which  the
         assessment is conducted. If neither parent has the right to remain,
         then that  is  the  background  against  which  the  assessment  is
         conducted. Thus the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable  to
         expect the child to follow the parent with no right  to  remain  to
         the country of origin?'

25. I must consider the position of the parents.  Neither have a  right  to
    remain. Both came to the United Kingdom on temporary leave and with  no
    expectation of being able to remain here. I must  have  regard  to  the
    fact that little weight should be given to a private  life  established
    by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
    precarious.  Since arrival and prior to the refusal  in  December  2013
    the appellants have known that their status was at best  temporary  and
    since December 2013 have known their status has been precarious.

26. I also take into account Patel and Oths  v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72  and
    although that judgment referred to adult education  the  principle  was
    nonetheless underlined that Article 8 does not encompass a right to  an
    education.  I can accept that the father has work  in  the  UK  but  he
    visited the UK initially on visit visas until he was granted a  student
    visa in 2007.    The father has had the benefit  of  further  education
    and working experience in the UK which he can put to use on  return  to
    Sri Lanka where the family already have a home.  The parents have lived
    most of their lives in Sri Lanka  and  they  will  be  returning  to  a
    culture and language with which they are familiar.

27. Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11

         'In an article 8 case where this question is reached, the  ultimate
         question for the appellate immigration  authority  is  whether  the
         refusal of leave to enter or remain,  in  circumstances  where  the
         life of the family cannot reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
         elsewhere, taking full account of all  considerations  weighing  in
         favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the  applicant
         in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
         fundamental right protected by article 8. If  the  answer  to  this
         question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the  authority
         must so decide. It is not necessary that the appellate  immigration
         authority, directing itself  along  the  lines  indicated  in  this
         opinion, need ask in addition whether the  case  meets  a  test  of
         exceptionality'.

28. In the light of my findings above I am not persuaded that  family  life
    cannot be reasonably be relocated in Sri Lanka or that the  family  and
    private life of any of the members of the family would be prejudiced in
    a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of their  protected
    rights.

29. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified above and  I  set
    aside that decision pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) save that  I  preserved  the
    findings at [5] and [16] and I remake the decision under section  12(2)
    (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007 and dismiss the appellants' appeals.
