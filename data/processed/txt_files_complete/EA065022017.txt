                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Michael Roots), sitting at Hatton Cross on  8  November
    2018, to  for lack of jurisdiction an appeal by a citizen  of  Jamaica,
    born 1965. The appellant had been  here  from  2010  -  15  on  an  EEA
    residence card, so the decision  under  appeal,  once  that  no  longer
    applied, was to remove her under s. 10 of the  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999, giving her a right of appeal under reg. 36 of the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. When the appeal  came  before  the  judge,  both  sides  had  persuaded
    themselves, and him, that it had  been  premature,  since  the  refusal
    letter was not sent till 19 July 2018. However the notice  of  decision
    was served on the 6th, and the notice of appeal was  validly  given  on
    the 8th: the refusal letter does no more  than  give  reasons  for  the
    decision already served.

 3. It follows that the appellant is entitled to the first-tier hearing she
    never had, before any judge, including Judge Roots.
