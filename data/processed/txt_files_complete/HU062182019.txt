                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  7  April  1984.  His
        immigration history reads:


                 i. 12 March 2008 arrived in the UK with entry clearance  as
                    a student valid to 31 January 2010
                ii. 29 March 2010 applied for leave to remain as at  Tier  4
                    (General Student) granted to 21 May 2011
               iii. 20 May 2011 applied for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
                    Rules refused on 21 July  2011  with  limited  right  of
                    appeal. 26 August 2011 appellant appealed  out  of  time
                    which  was  withdrawn  on  5  March  2012  leaving   the
                    appellant appeal rights exhausted on that date.
                iv. 28 February 2012 applied out of time for leave to remain
                    as a Tier  1  (Highly  Skilled)  Post  Study  migrant  -
                    granted on 8 August 2012 to 8 August 2014.
                 v. 8 August 2014 applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
                    (Highly Skilled) Entrepreneur granted on 6 October  2014
                    with leave valid to 6 October 2017.
                vi. 6 October 2017 applied  for  leave  to  Tier  1  (Highly
                    Skilled) Entrepreneur refused on 3 April 2018 with right
                    of Administrative Review.  17  May  2018  Administrative
                    Review request was received  but  on  15  May  2018  the
                    decision maintained.
               vii. 29 May 2018 applicant applied for  leave  to  remain  on
                    human rights grounds and an application  for  indefinite
                    leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of 10
                    years continuous lawful residence and his private life.


     2. The application was considered by the  decision-maker  pursuant  to
        paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules but refused for although it
        was accepted the appellant held continuous lawful residence between
        12 March 2008 when he arrived in the UK on 21 July 2011, he  had  a
        gap in his continuous lawful residence between 21 July 2011 and the
        next grant of leave to remain on 8 August 2012 as he  had  appealed
        out of time. It was accepted the appellant held  continuous  lawful
        residence from 8 August 2012, but such lawful leave  only  amounted
        to 6 years and 7 months.
     3.  The  decision-maker  also  refused  the  application   under   the
        Immigration Rules and outside the Rules; concluding that it had not
        been established that the decision to refuse  was  disproportionate
        on the basis the appellant had not established a  right  to  remain
        pursuant to paragraph 276 ADE or established there was anything  in
        his circumstances to warrant a  grant  of  permission  outside  the
        Rules.



Background


     4. The appellant's appeal against the refusal came  before  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Siddiqi sitting at Manchester  on  18  June  and  25
        September 2019. In a decision promulgated on 15  October  2019  the
        Judge sets out findings specific to the long residence question  at
        [18 - 21] in the following terms:


             18.   The  Appellant  initially  sought  to  argue  that   the
                  Respondent's decision of 21 July  2011  was  not  received
                  until 19 August 2011  and  I  found  his  evidence  to  be
                  credible on this point. I note that he had the same  legal
                  representatives acting for him in 2011 and at the  hearing
                  before me. His legal representatives  would  clearly  have
                  been aware of the implications of the Appellant submitting
                  a witness statement which referred to delayed  service  of
                  the decision of 21 July 2011 if in fact  he  had  received
                  the decision  before  19  August  2011.  It  is  extremely
                  difficult for an appellant to prove a negative i.e. that a
                  decision was delayed in the post and I was  not  persuaded
                  by the Respondent's argument that  such  delay  cannot  be
                  taken into account when assessing whether the appellant is
                  in overstayer.


             19.  However, at the  hearing  of  18  June  2019,  I  queried
                  whether in any event, the Appellants section 3C leave  had
                  come to an end once he had withdrawn  his  appeal  against
                  the decision of 21 July 2011. In  his  submissions  of  18
                  June 2019, Mr Rai sought to persuade me that paragraph 39E
                  of the Rules applied and therefore the Appellant would not
                  be an  overstayer.  However,  he  now  accepts  that  this
                  argument no longer  assist  the  Appellant  following  the
                  judgement in Ahmed.


             20.  In Ahmed it was held that


                  "The disregarding of current or previous short periods  of
                  overstaying for the purposes of subparagraph (v) does  not
                  convert such periods into periods  of  lawful  LTR;  still
                  less are such periods to be "disregarded" when it comes to
                  considering  whether  an  applicant  has   fulfilled   the
                  separate requirement of establishing "10 years  continuous
                  lawful residence" under paragraph (i) (a)."

             21   The Appellant has spent more than 10 years in the UK  but
                  not all of that residence is lawful.  Therefore,  he  does
                  not meet the long residence requirements of the Rules.


     5. The Judge records at [22] that it was accepted the appellant  could
        not meet the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE and at [26] that the
        respondent's   decision   outside   the   Immigration   Rules    is
        proportionate.
     6. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal but granted  on
        a renewed application  by  a  judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
        operative part of which is in the following terms:


             2.   The issue to be decided is whether  the  appellant  could
                  demonstrate that he had resided in the UK lawfully  for  a
                  continuous 10-year period. Given that the  Judge  accepted
                  that the respondent had delayed in sending the decision of
                  21 July 2011 and that his appeal against this decision was
                  therefore in time while noting that the appellant withdrew
                  that  appeal  having  previously  been  granted  leave  to
                  remain, it is arguable that the appellant's leave was  not
                  interrupted. All grounds may be argued.


     7. On 4 May 2020, the appeal was listed  for  an  Initial  Hearing  at
        Field House which had to be vacated as a  result  of  the  Covid-19
        pandemic and subsequent arrangements for the administration of  the
        work of the Upper Tribunal. Accordingly, on 1 May  2020  directions
        were served upon the parties advising that the Upper  Tribunal  had
        reached a provisional view that the question of whether  the  Judge
        had erred in law and whether that was material to the  decision  to
        dismiss the appeal could be dealt with on the  papers;  giving  the
        parties time in which to make representations. Such representations
        have been received and the Tribunal is  of  the  opinion  that  the
        matter can be fairly disposed of on the papers at this stage.




Submissions



     8. The appellant's grounds erroneously refer to the decision of First-
        Tier Tribunal Judge Easterman but that  was  the  decision  of  the
        First-Tier Tribunal which initially refused  permission  to  appeal
        and does not have any further  relevance  following  the  grant  of
        permission to appeal by the Upper Tribunal.
     9. The appellant's original Grounds asserted the Judge  erred  in  law
        relying upon the decision in Ahmed [2019] EWCA  Civ  1070  and  the
        respondent's updated guidance, asserting procedural  unfairness  as
        the principles of that case were not  relevant  to  the  issues  at
        large in this appeal as the appellant  has  never  overstayed.  The
        appellant asserts  that  his  leave,  either  lawfully  granted  or
        pursuant to section 3C Immigration Acted 1971 always continued.
    10. The appellant also asserted that an application of 28 February 2012
        was granted by the respondent  without  mentioning  any  period  of
        overstaying as it was made prior  to  the  end  of  the  appellants
        section 3C leave  and  was  therefore  to  be  considered  a  valid
        application for further leave.  The  judge  breached  the  fairness
        principles and failed to consider whether  discretion  should  have
        been exercised in the  appellant's  favour  on  the  basis  it  was
        claimed the appellant had completed 10 years long residence in  the
        UK.
    11. The appellant also pleads at Ground 4, in the alternative, a  claim
        the respondent failed to  consider  a  policy  and  implication  in
        respect of the human rights claim for the reasons set  out  in  the
        pleadings the 21 February 2020.
    12. Additional submissions provided by the appellant sent  under  cover
        of an email of the 6 May 2020 assert, inter alia,:


                i. The FTJ in this appeal accepts at  [18  and  19]  of  the
                   determination  that  he  was   not   persuaded   by   the
                   respondent's argument  that  such  delay  in  lodging  an
                   appeal on 26 August 2011 cannot  be  taken  into  account
                   when assessing whether an appellant is an overstayer,  as
                   such it is concluded that A  leave was extended until the
                   withdrawn appeal of 05 March 2012.
               ii. FTJ has further conceded that A's  3C  leave  would  have
                   come to an end once he had withdrawn his  appeal  against
                   the decision of 21 July 2011 on 05 March 2012.
              iii. FTJ has failed  to  oversee  that  A  has  submitted  his
                   application for leave to remain on 28/02/2012,  which  is
                   prior to the assumed end of 3C leave  is  determined,  as
                   such there is not even a single day gap in the continuous
                   lawful residence of A and therefore even the  application
                   of Ahmed is not tenable.
               iv. Therefore, reliance on  the  authorities  was  erroneous,
                   especially given the very difficult factual  scenario  in
                   this appeal and  given  that  the  respondent's  guidance
                   falls squarely within the  circumstances  that  arise  in
                   this appeal.


    13. The appellant repeats the claim to have always had lawful leave and
        to be entitled to a right to remain in the United Kingdom  pursuant
        to paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the Immigration Rules.
    14. The respondent's further submissions received on 20 May 2020 oppose
        the application  asserting  it  was  accepted  by  the  appellant's
        representative that the appellant could not benefit from  paragraph
        39E of the Immigration Rules and that the Judge had  therefore  not
        erred in law in finding there was a break in the appellant's period
        of lawful leave in the United Kingdom.
    15. The respondent  argues  there  is  no  unfairness  in  the  Judge's
        decision noting the Judge could raise the issue of  the  effect  of
        the withdrawal of the application of 5 March 2012 but also  granted
        an adjournment for both parties to provide further submissions. The
        respondent maintains that the appeal against  the  decision  of  21
        July 2011  had  been  submitted  out  of  time  and  therefore  the
        appellant's section 3C leave had ended.
    16. The respondent disagrees with the appellant's submission  that  the
        Judge failed  to  consider  discretion  and  adopted  an  incorrect
        approach and asserts the Judge has given adequate reasons  for  why
        the matter was approached in  the  manner  it  was  and  that  mere
        disagreement is  insufficient.  The  respondent's  grounds  note  a
        contradiction in the appellant's pleadings in that in Ground 1  the
        appellant suggested the decision in Ahmed [2019] EWCA Civ 1070  did
        not apply as the appellant did not overstaying whereas in Ground  4
        the appellant is suggesting that that case law  should  apply.  The
        respondent's position is however that the guidance claimed did  not
        assist the appellant and it is  claimed  it  was  not  an  argument
        raised in the Grounds before the Judge or  contained  in  an  early
        skeleton argument and therefore amounted to a new matter.



Error of law


    17. No procedural unfairness arises in the Judge's decision. The appeal
        initially came before the Judge on the 18 June 2019  at  which  the
        Judge raised the issue of whether the appellant's 3C leave ended at
        the time the appellant withdrew an appeal on 5 March 2012. As  this
        was not a matter in the  refusal  the  Judge  adjourned  to  enable
        further submissions to be made, bringing the matter back before the
        tribunal on the 25 September 2019.
    18. The Judge refers to an issue being raised concerning  the  date  of
        receipt of a decision and whilst that may be relevant to  assessing
        whether it was appropriate for a person who  lodged  an  appeal  to
        challenge the decision out of time, as a result of the delay  in  a
        decision being received by them, any delay between the decision  of
        21 July 2011 and receipt on 19 August 2011 does not, arguably, have
        the effect of retrospectively reinstating leave that may  otherwise
        have expired.
    19. An overstayer is a person who has remained in  the  UK  beyond  the
        period they are permitted. This will either be the expiry  date  on
        their most recently issued visa, or the date  any  leave  that  has
        been extended by Section 3C or Section 3D of  the  Immigration  Act
        1971 ends.
    20. The appellants immigration history shows he applied  for  leave  to
        remain outside the Rules on 20 May 2011, in time, which was refused
        on 21 July 2011 with limited right of appeal. On  26  August  2011,
        the appellant appealed the decision out of time.
    21. The appellant relies upon section 3C  Immigration  Act  1971  which
        provides that a person will have section 3C leave if:


        .they have limited leave to enter or remain in the UK
        .they apply to the Secretary of State for variation of that leave
        .the application for variation is made before the leave expires
        .the leave expires without the  application  for  variation  having
        been decided .the application for variation is neither decided  nor
        withdrawn.


    22. Leave can also continue pursuant to section 3C  during  any  period
        when:


        .an in-country appeal could be brought (ignoring any possibility of
        appeal out of time with permission)
        .the appeal is pending (within the meaning of section  104  of  the
        Nationality, Asylum, and Immigration Act 2002), meaning it has been
        lodged and has not been finally determined.


        Or pending Administrative Review, as  Section  3C  leave  continues
        during any period when:


        .an administrative review could be sought
        .the administrative review is  pending,  in  that  it  has  not  be
        determined
        .no new application for leave to remain has been made


    23. It is not disputed the appeal lodged on 26 August 2011 was  out  of
        time which will have the effect of ending the appellant's leave  as
        the possibility of an appeal out of time with permission is ignored
        in the assessment as noted above.
    24. Even if the appellants section 3C leave continued as  a  result  of
        the out of time appeal, the appellant, in any  event  withdrew  the
        appeal on 5 March 2012 making him appeal rights exhausted  on  that
        date as found by the Judge.
    25. Paragraph 39 E of the Immigration Rules reads:


        39E. This paragraph applies where:
            (1) the application was made within 14 days of  the  applicant's
            leave expiring and the Secretary of State considers  that  there
            was a good reason beyond the control of the applicant  or  their
            representative, provided in or with  the  application,  why  the
            application could not be made in-time; or
           (2) the application was made:
           (a) following the refusal of a previous  application  for  leave
           which was made in-time; and
           (b) within 14 days of:
              1. (i) the refusal of the previous application for leave; or
              2. (ii) the expiry of any leave extended by section 3C of  the
                 Immigration Act 1971; or
              3. (iii) the expiry of the time-limit for  making  an  in-time
                 application for  administrative  review  or  appeal  (where
                 applicable); or
              4. (iv) any administrative review or appeal  being  concluded,
                 withdrawn or abandoned or lapsing.
    26. The appellant's representative  quite  properly  accepted  that  an
        argument the appellant's leave had been extended as a result  of  a
        subsequent application had no merit in light of Ahmed is  factually
        correct. The effect of this provision is that if  the  requirements
        are met the fact a person is an overstayer will not be held against
        an applicant, as it was  in  the  past  when  there  were  numerous
        refusals solely on the basis that a  person  had  overstayed  their
        leave and made an out of time application. Paragraph 39E provides a
        14-day period in which an application will  be  considered  on  its
        merits and not rejected solely on the basis that the person  is  an
        overstayer, but this does not assist the appellant in this case.
    27. The appellant assert the Judge has failed to take into account that
        when the appellant submitted his application for leave to remain on
        28 February 2012 that was before the end of his  section  3C  leave
        which the Judge found had ended on 5 March 2012.
    28. The difficulties for the appellant with this argument are  twofold.
        The first is that as the appeal against the decision of 2 July 2011
        was out of time the appellant did not have section  3C  leave  from
        the expiration of the limitation period provided in  the  Procedure
        Rules for lodging an appeal in time.  The  second  problem  is  the
        effect of section 3C(4) which reads:


             (4)  A person may not make an application for variation of his
                  leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while  that
                  leave is extended by virtue of this section.


    29. In the alternative and taking the appellants case at  its  highest,
        if the lawful leave granted to the appellant expired on 21 May 2011
        and even if that leave was extended pursuant to section 3C until  5
        March 2012 unless the appellant had withdrawn  the  appeal  against
        the refusal such that his section 3C leave came to an end he  could
        not make a valid application on 28 February 2012 for further  leave
        to remain. Even though the respondent appears to have granted leave
        sought until 8 August  2014  that  does  not  have  the  effect  of
        overriding the statutory effect  of  section  3C.  It  is  for  the
        respondent to decide whether to exercise discretion and grant leave
        which appears to  have  occurred  in  this  case  even  though  the
        application was invalid. That does not, however, have the effect of
        extending section 3C leave in this appeal.
    30. I find when the chronology and  appropriate  legal  provisions  are
        examined in detail there is no legal error material to the decision
        of the Judge to dismiss the appeal sufficient to warrant the  Upper
        Tribunal interfering any further in this matter.


Decision

        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.
