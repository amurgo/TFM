For the Appellant:     Ms C Grubb instructed by Hoole & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who was born on 31  August  1958.
    On 30 January 2012, she made an application for leave to remain in  the
    UK outside the Immigration Rules.  That application was refused by  the
    Secretary of State on 5 November 2012 and, against which, the appellant
    had no right of appeal.

 2. On 18 September 2013, the appellant was served  form  IS151A  notifying
    her of her immigration status as an overstayer and that she was  liable
    to detention and  removal  from  the  UK.   On  10  October  2013,  the
    appellant indicated that she would be voluntarily departing to Jamaica.
     However, on  28  October  2013  the  appellant  advised  that  further
    representations would be  submitted.   On  29  November  2013,  further
    representations were received by the Secretary of State.

 3. On 4 February 2014, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application for leave based primarily  upon  her  claimed  relationship
    with her partner, Mr Edwards who is also a citizen of Jamaica  and  had
    limited leave to remain in the UK and also on the basis of her  private
    life in the UK.  The Secretary of State concluded  that  the  appellant
    could not succeed under Appendix FM, in  particular  E-LTRP  and  under
    para 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395  as  amended).   On  4
    February 2014, the Secretary of State also made a  decision  to  remove
    the appellant as an overstayer by way of directions to Jamaica.

 4. The appellant appealed that latter decision to the First-tier Tribunal.
     In a determination promulgated on 4  July  2014,  Judge  M  J  Waygood
    dismissed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  and  also
    under Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 28
    August 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge P J M Hollingworth) granted
    the appellant permission to appeal.

 6. On 11 September 2014, the Secretary of State served a  rule  24  notice
    opposing the appellant's appeal.

The Judge's Decision

 7. First, the judge accepted that the  appellant  and  Mr  Edwards  had  a
    "genuine and subsisting" relationship  and  had  lived  together  since
    2010.  However, the appellant could not succeed under Appendix FM as  a
    "partner" because Mr Edwards only had  limited leave and therefore  was
    not a British citizen, someone settled in the UK, or someone with leave
    as a refugee or humanitarian protection as required by para E-LTRP.1.2.



 8. Secondly, the judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of para 276ADE as she had not been in the  UK  for  twenty
    years and it was not established  that  she  had  lost  all  ties  with
    Jamaica.

 9. Neither of those findings is challenged by Ms Grubb on  behalf  of  the
    appellant before me.

10. Thirdly, the judge went on to consider Art 8  outside  the  Rules.   At
    paras 82-92, the judge considered the medical evidence  concerning  the
    health of both the appellant and Mr Edwards  and  found  that,  on  the
    basis of the background information, any required medication or support
    would be available in Jamaica.  As a consequence, the judge found  that
    the appellant could not succeed under Art 8 on the basis of her  health
    and, it was not suggested otherwise before  him,  she  could  also  not
    succeed under Art 3.

11. Fourthly the judge considered the appellant's private and  family  life
    including the best interests of the  children  who  were  part  of  the
    appellant's family living in the UK and Mr Edwards'  grandchildren  and
    concluded that it would be reasonable for the appellant and Mr  Edwards
    to return to  Jamaica  and  continue  their  family  life  there.   The
    appellant's removal was a proportionate interference  with  her  family
    and private life in the UK and no breach of Art 8 had been established.



The Submissions

12. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Grubb made two submissions.

13. First, she submitted that the judge had erred  in  law  by  considering
    separately the Art 8 issues in relation to the health issues  and  then
    in respect of her private and family life.  She submitted that that was
    contrary to the  approach  required  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MM
    (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279 at [23].  She submitted that  the
    judge failed to deal with the Art 8 issues  "holistically".   Ms  Grubb
    accepted that the appellant could not succeed on health  grounds  alone
    under Art 8.  Nevertheless, her (and Mr Edwards') health were  relevant
    as to their circumstances in Jamaica and,  she  submitted,  effectively
    they would be "destitute" because they would  be  unable  to  work  and
    would be unable then to return to see their families in  the  UK.   She
    submitted that there was evidence that they could not afford drugs  and
    so their health would deteriorate.

14. Secondly, Ms Grubb submitted  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  by
    considering whether the appellant met the requirement  of  Appendix  FM
    and para 276ADE which only applied to applications made on or  after  9
    July 2012.  The appellant's application had been made  prior  to  that.
    She relied upon the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in  Edgehill  and
    Another v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402 that  pre-9  July  2012  application
    should be decided under the Rules in force prior to 9 July  2012.   She
    submitted that the subsequent, and contrary, decision of the  Court  of
    Appeal in Haleemudeen  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  558  should  not  be
    followed.  Ms Grubb submitted that the judge's error, in  applying  the
    post-9  July  2012  Rules,  was  material.   Under  para  281  of   the
    Immigration Rules, even though the appellant could not  succeed  as  Mr
    Edwards was not "present and settled"  in  the  UK,  nevertheless  they
    could satisfy the adequate maintenance requirement since  their  income
    was �16,357.80 even though it did not meet the  threshold  requirements
    in Appendix FM of �18,600.

15. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards submitted that the  judge  had
    not erred in law in carrying  out  the  assessment  of  proportionality
    under Art 8.  He submitted that it was clear  that  the  judge,  having
    considered the relevant background evidence at para 83, had found  that
    the appellant and Mr Edwards would  be  able  to  obtain  the  required
    medication and support which was available in Jamaica (see para  92  of
    the determination).  Mr Richards submitted  that  at  para  99  of  his
    determination, the judge did refer to the "medical issues" which he had
    already considered when considering the wider issues of the appellant's
    private  and  family  life  in  the  UK.   Given  the  availability  of
    treatment, Mr Richards submitted that it  was  inconceivable  that  the
    judge would  have  reached  any  other  finding,  namely  that  it  was
    reasonable for the appellant and Mr Edwards to  continue  their  family
    life in Jamaica and not disproportionate.

16. As regards the applicable Immigration Rules, Mr Richards submitted that
    the judge was entitled to follow Haleemudeen which was the most  recent
    decision of the Court of Appeal.  In any event, Mr  Richards  submitted
    that even if that was wrong his error was not material as the judge had
    engaged in a full assessment of proportionality and had not taken  into
    account the issue of the financial threshold as a  negative  factor  in
    assessing proportionality.

Discussion

17. It is convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal  in  relation
    to the applicable Immigration Rules to this appeal.

    Ground 2

18. Ms Grubb invited me  to  follow  the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in
    Edgehill rather than the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in
    Haleemudeen.

19. Since this appeal was heard  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  resolved  the
    conflict between Edgehill and Haleemudeen in Singh  v  SSHD;  Khalid  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, preferring the reasoning in Edgehill  to  that
    in Haleemudeen, namely that the old Rules applied to applications  made
    before 9 July 2012 which were decided on or after that date.   However,
    the Court of Appeal held that Edgehill only applied to decisions  taken
    between 9 July 2012 and 6 September 2012.  As a  result  of  a  further
    amendment to the Rules made by HC 565  with  effect  from  6  September
    2012, the Secretary of State was entitled  to  take  into  account  the
    provisions of Appendix FM and para  276ADE  when  deciding  private  or
    family law applications even if they were made prior  to  9  July  2012
    (see [56]).

20. In this appeal, the decision to refuse leave was  made  on  4  February
    2014 and so did not fall within the 'window' recognised  in  Singh  and
    Khalid  to  which   Edeghill   applied.    The   new   Rules   applied.
    Consequently, Judge Waygood did not  err  in  law  in  considering  the
    appellant's appeal under Appendix FM and para 276AE.

21. In any event,, even if the pre-9 July  Rules  had  applied,  any  error
    would not, in my judgment, have been  material  to  the  decision.   Ms
    Grubb did not suggest that the appellant could succeed under the  pre-9
    July Rules.

22. First, the appellant could not succeed under the  predecessor  to  para
    276ADE, namely para 276B.  The appellant arrived in the UK on 5  August
    2012 with leave as a visitor valid until 5 February 2003.  Although the
    appellant made an in time application on 17 January 2003 to extend that
    leave, that application was rejected on 23 March 2003 as no application
    form was submitted.  Her subsequent application on 10  April  2003  was
    refused on 15 May 2003 and against which she had no right of appeal  as
    she had no extant leave.  The appellant's leave, therefore, expired  no
    later than 23 March 2003.  As a consequence, the  appellant  could  not
    establish under para 276B that she had  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence or 14 years' continuous residence.

23. Secondly, in relation to her claim as a partner under Appendix FM,  she
    failed for the very same reason that she would have failed  under  para
    281 (as a spouse) or para 295A  as  an  unmarried  partner  because  Mr
    Edwards was not a person "present and settled in the United Kingdom" as
    he only had limited leave to remain.  Ms Grubb placed some reliance  on
    the fact that the appellant would have been able to establish "adequate
    maintenance" on the basis of Mr Edward's income in the UK of �16,357.80
    even if he could not satisfy the threshold requirement of  Appendix  FM
    of �18,600.  The difficulty with that submission  is,  as  Mr  Richards
    pointed out in his submissions, that at para 98  of  his  determination
    the judge expressly ignored the fact that the appellant did  not  reach
    the financial threshold under Appendix FM in assessing proportionality.
     He said this:

         "... In this case the fact that Mr Edwards, as the appellant is not
         earning any money, does not reach the financial threshold I find in
         any event does not sway my assessment of proportionality,  they  do
         not meet the requirements of the Rules for the  reasons  previously
         stated ..."

24. In other words the aspect of non-compliance with the Immigration  Rules
    which the judge considered important was applicable equally  under  the
    pre-9 July 2012 Rules, namely that Mr Edwards was not "settled" in  the
    UK because he only had limited leave to remain.  It  would,  therefore,
    have been irrelevant to the judge's reasoning if he  had  applied  para
    281 or para 295B that the appellant had "adequate maintenance".

25. Further, it is, in any event, difficult to see any  material  error  of
    law given the judge's extensive consideration of Art 8 outside the Rule
    at paras 73-105 of his determination.  Without succeeding on her  first
    ground, even if the judge should  have  applied  the  pre-9  July  2012
    Rules, there is no proper basis upon which it can  be  said  that  that
    factor in any  way  tainted  or  infected  the  judge's  reasoning  and
    conclusion for finding that the appellant's removal  was  proportionate
    under Art 8 of the ECHR.

26. Ms Grubb accepted as much in her submissions when she  recognised  that
    the judge's application of  Gulshan  (Art  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) at paras 71-72 of  his  determination
    could only be successfully criticised if she made good her first ground
    in relation to the judge's assessment of proportionality under Art 8.

27. Consequently, I reject Ms Grubb's submissions in relation to  Ground  2
    and I now turn to Ground 1.







    Ground 1

28. Ms Grubb submitted that the judge was wrong to  consider  the  "medical
    issues" in relation to Art 8 separately at paras 82-92 from  the  wider
    family and private life issue at paras  93-105  of  his  determination.
    She  submitted  that  the  correct  approach  was  to   consider   them
    "holistically".  She relied upon [23] of MM (Zimbabwe) where  Moses  LJ
    (with whose judgment the Master of the Rolls and McFarlane  LJ  agreed)
    stated:

         "23  The only cases I can foresee where  the  absence  of  adequate
             medical treatment in the country to which a person  is  to  be
             deported will be relevant to Article 8 , is  where  it  is  an
             additional factor to be weighed in  the  balance,  with  other
             factors which by themselves engage Article  8  .  Suppose,  in
             this case, the appellant had established firm family  ties  in
             this country, then  the  availability  of  continuing  medical
             treatment here, coupled with his dependence on the family here
             for support, together establish 'private life' under Article 8
             . That conclusion  would  not  involve  a  comparison  between
             medical facilities here and those in Zimbabwe.  Such a finding
             would not offend the principle expressed above that the United
             Kingdom is under no Convention obligation to  provide  medical
             treatment here when it is not  available  in  the  country  to
             which the appellant is to be deported."

29. In Akhalu (health claim: ECHR) Art 8 [2013] UKUT 00400 (IAC) the  Upper
    Tribunal considered MM  and,  in  particular,  [23]  of  the  judgment.
    Having noted at [41] that the decision in MM ultimately did not turn on
    a comparison of medical treatment available in  the  UK  with  that  in
    Zimbabwe, the Upper Tribunal said this about the proper approach to Art
    8 (at [43] - [46]):

         "43.  MM  (Zimbabwe)  does  not  establish  that  a   claimant   is
             disqualified from accessing the protection of article 8  where
             an aspect of her claim is a difficulty or inability to  access
             health care in her country of  nationality  unless,  possibly,
             her private or family life has a bearing upon  her  prognosis.
             The correct approach is not to leave out of account  what  is,
             by any view, a material consideration of central importance to
             the  individual  concerned   but   to   recognise   that   the
             countervailing public interest in removal  will  outweigh  the
             consequences for the health  of  the  claimant  because  of  a
             disparity of health care facilities in all but a very few rare
             cases.

         44.  When a judge arrives at the question of proportionality he  is
             required to have regard to all  of  the  circumstances  relied
             upon by both parties. If he left out of account aspects of the
             claimant's private life established here because it could  not
             be shown that they had a direct bearing on her prognosis,  the
             balancing exercise would be fundamentally flawed  and  legally
             deficient.

        45.   The correct approach is for the judge to have regard to every
             aspect of the claimant's private life  here,  as  well  as  the
             consequences for her health of removal, but  to  have  in  mind
             when striking the balance of proportionality that a  comparison
             of levels of medical treatment available is something that will
             not in itself have any  real  impact  on  the  outcome  of  the
             exercise. The judge must recognise, as did Judge  Saffer,  that
             it will be a rare case that succeeds where this is an important
             aspect of the claimant's case.

         46.  Put another way, the consequences of removal for the health of
             a claimant who would not be able to access  equivalent  health
             care in their country of nationality as was available in  this
             country,   are   plainly   relevant   to   the   question   of
             proportionality. But when weighed against the public  interest
             in ensuring that  the  limited  resources  of  this  country's
             health service are used to the best effect for the benefit  of
             those for whom they are intended, those  consequences  do  not
             weigh heavily in the claimant's favour but speak  cogently  in
             support of the public interests in removal."

30. That passage provides support for Ms Grubb's submission  that  a  judge
    should  adopt  a  "holistic"  approach  in  applying  Art  8  including
    consideration of health  issues  but,  as  the  UT  noted,  the  public
    interest is likely to outweigh the consequences for the  health  of  an
    individual simply where there is a disparity of  healthcare  facilities
    in all but "a very few rare cases".

31. The latter point has recently been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.  In
    GS (India) v others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40  Underhill  LJ  said  (at
    [111]) this about the approach in MM and the passage  from  Moses  LJ's
    judgment at [23] cited above :
         "There  are  possibly  some  ambiguities  in  the  details  of  the
         reasoning in that passage,  but  I  think  it  is  clear  that  two
         essential points are being made. First, the absence  or  inadequacy
         of  medical  treatment,  even  life-preserving  treatment,  in  the
         country of return, cannot be relied on at all as a factor  engaging
         article 8: if that is all there is, the claim must fail.  Secondly,
         where article 8 is engaged by other  factors,  the  fact  that  the
         claimant is receiving medical treatment in this country  which  may
         not be available in the country of return may be a  factor  in  the
         proportionality exercise; but that factor cannot be treated  as  by
         itself giving rise to a breach since that would contravene the  "no
         obligation to treat" principle."

32. In this appeal, Ms Grubb accepted (as she  did  before  Judge  Waygood)
    that the appellant could not succeed under Art 8 simply on the basis of
    health or medical issues.  I agree.  It added little or nothing to  the
    appellant's claim under Art 8 considered 'holistically'.

33. The judge set out the evidence concerning  the  health  issues  of  the
    appellant and Mr Edwards at para 82 as follows:

         "... The appellant's medical evidence is contained in section 3  of
         the  appellant's   bundle.   It  appears  that  back  in  2011  the
         appellant underwent examination in  relation  to  her  kidneys  but
         there  is  no   outcome   indicated.    Additionally   within   the
         respondent's bundle there are letters  to  the  appellant  in  2012
         indicating that she requires a repeat blood pressure check and also
         indications that she has routine blood tests  and  then  a  further
         letter  to  the  appellant  from  the  community  urology   service
         indicating that an appointment was made her on 26 May 2011.   There
         is no indication of any adverse outcome from any of these tests  or
         checks.  As far as Mr Edwards is concerned there is  an  indication
         in the documentation provided in particular from a letter from  the
         Montpellier health centre in Bristol dated 23 May 2014 that he  has
         been registered with them since 2002 and that he  has  degenerative
         cervical stenosis diagnosed in 2013, hypertension diagnosed in 2005
         and diabetes diagnosed in 2009.  The letter states his diabetes and
         hypertension are managed by medication and he has physiotherapy for
         his neck symptoms and continues to take analgesia.  In addition  of
         course Mr Edwards has indicated that he ha some memory problems and
         is helped in this by the appellant, although there is  no  specific
         medical diagnosis that has been placed before me at this point."

34. Then, at para 83 the judge set out  the  relevant  background  evidence
    concerning the availability of  drugs  and  treatments  in  Jamaica  as
    follows:

         "83. The respondent referred in the refusal letter to the  National
             Health Fund in Jamaica provided  by  the  Jamaica  information
             service on the Ministry of health from  September  2009.   The
             information that was obtained was from the Country  of  Origin
             Information Report on Jamaica.  This section  is  set  out  as
             follows:

                  The  Jamaica  Information  Service,  Ministry  of  Health,
                  accessed 11 September 2009, noted that  the  state  health
                  sector provides most of the island' health care provision,
                  Services are provided through the government'  network  of

                  institutions. [24d]

                  The National Health Fund (NHF)

                  25.05    It was stated on  the  website  of  the  National
                  Health Fund of Jamaica, accessed in November 2012:

                  The National Health  Fund  [was]  established  to  provide
                  financial support to the  national  healthcare  system  to
                  improve its effeciveness and the health  of  the  Jamaican
                  population through two categories of benefits.

                  The NHF] provides assistance  to  persons,  initially,  to
                  purchase specific prescription drugs used in the treatment
                  and management of designated chronic  illnesses.   Persons
                  seeking assistance from NHF Individual  Benefits  must  be
                  certified, by a registered private or public doctor,  with
                  one or more of the specific medial conditions and register
                  with the NHF.  Once approved, the  beneficiary  is  issued
                  with a NHF card and will be able to  get  assistance  with
                  the  purchase  of  drugs   from   approved   participating
                  pharmacies.  The NHF makes a  fixed  payment  towards  the
                  price set by the pharmacy for drugs approved by  the  NHF.
                  The beneficiary is required to pay the difference - the co-
                  payment.  The NHF also takes an active role  in  educating
                  the population and its beneficiaries on the importance  of
                  properly managing and treating  their  chronic  condition.
                  "[46b]

             25.06     Under  the  JADEP  programme,  the  NHF  provides  a
                  specific list of drugs, free of cost, to beneficiaries who
                  are over 60 years of age fro the  treatment  of  ten  (10)
                  chronic  illnesses:  Hypertension,   cardiac   conditions,
                  arthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, high cholesterol,
                  vascular   disease,   diabetes,   glaucoma,    psychiatric
                  conditions and asthma."

35. At para 84, the judge noted that: "none of the above  was  contradicted
    by the appellant or Mr Edwards in their evidence."  At para 92,  having
    referred to the case law including Akhalu, at para 92  the  judge  said
    this:

         "There is no evidence that the appellant or Mr Edwards  if  removed
         from the UK would die for example  within  a  few  weeks,  days  or
         months of return.  In fact the Country of Origin Information Report
         indicates that  drugs  and  support  are  available.   I  therefore
         conclude that she cannot succeed in any Art 3 or  Art  8  claim  as
         regards to health.  I consider that these conclusions equally apply
         to Mr Edwards should he  decide  to  return  to  Jamaica  with  the
         Appellant."

36. Ms Grubb submitted that the evidence from the sponsor was that he  took
    medication, although she accepted that there was  no  specific  medical
    evidence as to what that medication was.  She submitted that  his  oral
    evidence was that he could not afford  that  medication.   However,  at
    para 104 of his determination,  the  judge  did  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant or Mr Edwards would be unable to work on return  to  Jamaica.
    He said this:

         "The Appellant has undertaken some qualifications in care in the UK
         which I find will assist her should she wish to gain employment  in
         the UK (sic).   In  addition,  Mr  Edwards  works  in  the  UK  and
         therefore again if you wish to could work in Jamaica.  He has  said
         that there is no work in Jamaica but no evidence  was  provided  to
         support that contention."

37. Clearly there is a slip in the judge's reasoning: the sense is that the
    Appellant would be able to gain employment "in Jamaica".

38. Neither of these findings is, nor could properly be, challenged in this
    appeal.  The evidence such that it was, and the judge's findings,  were
    that the Appellant and Mr Edwards would be able  to  work  in  Jamaica.
    There is no evidence, apart from his assertion, that he  would  not  be
    able to do so and he would not be able to afford any medicine which  he
    required, presumably for his diabetes  and  hypertension.   It  is  not
    suggested that those medications are not available in  Jamaica  on  the
    basis of the  background  evidence  to  which  I  have  referred.   The
    consequence is that, on the judge's findings, both the appellant and Mr
    Edwards would be in substantially  the  same  position  in  Jamaica  as
    regards their health as they are currently in the UK.

39. Consequently, the  medial  issues  effectively  added  nothing  to  the
    appellant's claim that her removal would be disproportionate.  Even  if
    it can be said, therefore, that in considering the family  and  private
    life of the appellant, Mr Edwards and their families at paras 92 - 105,
    the judge did not take into account  the  "medical  issues"  simply  by
    referring to them at para 99 (a conclusion which is  not  without  some
    difficulty given a fair reading  of  the  judge's  determination  as  a
    whole), those medical issues  could  not  conceivably  have  added  any
    weight to the appellant's claim such that the judge might have  reached
    a different conclusion on proportionality.  I am in no  doubt  that  he
    would still have concluded that it was reasonable for the appellant and
    Mr Edwards to relocate to  Jamaica  and  any  interference  with  their
    private and family life was proportionate.

40. For these  reasons,  I  also  reject  Ground  1.   The  judge  did  not
    materially err in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art 8.



Decision

41. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal on
    all grounds did not involve the making of a material error of law.  Its
    decision stands.

42. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

                                                                     A Grubb
