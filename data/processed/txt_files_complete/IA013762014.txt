Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Waqas Khalid, was born on 20 September  1985  and  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant had appealed against the refusal by
    the respondent of his application for a residence card as  confirmation
    of his right to reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse  of  an  EEA
    national (Lucie Sidakova - hereafter referred to as the sponsor).   The
    appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Pirotta) which, in a determination promulgated on 19 March 2014,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant did not attend the hearing of the  Upper  Tribunal  on  2
    July 2014 nor was he represented.  I am satisfied that a notice of  the
    hearing was sent both to the  appellant  and  to  his  solicitors  (Sky
    Solicitors Ltd) by first class post on 3 June 2014.  In the absence  of
    any satisfactory explanation for the absence of the  appellant  or  his
    representatives, I decided to proceed with the hearing in any event.

 3. In her determination at [20], Judge Pirotta had written:

         As the Secretary of State is not represented in  these  proceedings
         as a direct result of the appellant having elected a  determination
         on the papers and by virtue of the late service of the bundle,  the
         Secretary of State was not afforded an opportunity  to  review  the
         decision in the light of further material.  The Secretary of  State
         has no choice in the matter once the appellant has elected to  have
         a determination on the papers.  It  would  not  be  appropriate  to
         consider whether the appellant would have met the criteria  of  the
         sponsor exercising Treaty Rights or whether he met the other  tests
         of the application which he had  submitted  had  the  Secretary  of
         State had access to that material.

 4.  The  grounds  complain  of  the  refusal  by  the  judge  to  consider
    documentary evidence  which  had  been  submitted  in  support  of  the
    application.  Mrs Pettersen, for  the  respondent,  accepted  that  the
    judge had erred by refusing to consider the documents provided  by  the
    appellant given that this was not a points-based decision under  appeal
    but an in-country appeal and there was nothing to prevent the  evidence
    from being admitted by the judge.  In the circumstances,  I  set  aside
    the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  have  remade  the
    decision.

 5. Mrs Pettersen  made  a  number  of  submissions  to  me  regarding  the
    documentary evidence.  Much of that  evidence  is  concerned  with  the
    appellant's attempts to prove that the sponsor  was  exercising  Treaty
    Rights in the United Kingdom as a worker.  The  refusal  letter  of  10
    December 2013 records that attempts were made to contact the  sponsor's
    claimed employer on 24 and 25 September 2013 but "no  answer  could  be
    obtained."  Accordingly, because the "employment of your sponsor  could
    not therefore be verified", the appellant had been refused a  residence
    card.   Mrs  Pettersen  drew  my  attention  to  other  evidence  which
    concerned another of  the  sponsor's  claimed  employers,  SM  Plumbing
    Services.  There is a wage slip from this firm, bearing  the  sponsor's
    name, for 6 June 2014.  The wage slip shows no  deductions  for  income
    tax or national insurance.  The wage  slip  records  that  the  sponsor
    worked for twenty hours at the rate of �6.31 per hour.  The net payment
    shown on the wage slip was �126.20.  The supplemental bundle which  has
    been submitted by the appellant's solicitors under cover  of  a  letter
    dated 18 June 2014 refers to these  payslips  and  also  an  employment
    letter from SM Plumbing Services dated 13 June 2014.  Also enclosed are
    "bank statements of Mr Khalid [the appellant] confirming wages  of  his
    sponsor going in (sic)".  The bank statement provided is for the period
    29 April 2014 - 9 June 2014.  This  shows  one  payment  of  "sponsor's
    wages going in" that is, on 9 June 2014 where there is  a  transfer  of
    the  sum  of  �126.00  from  a  Mr  Muhammad  Sarfra  (presumably,  the
    proprietor of SM Plumbing  Services).   Mrs  Pettersen  submitted  that
    there was no correlation between the wage slip (for  �126.20)  and  the
    transfer into the appellant's account (of �126.00).  She also submitted
    that it was significant that the sponsor's wages were not paid into her
    own bank account but into that of the appellant.  These anomalies were,
    in her submission,  a  clear  indication  that  the  evidence  was  not
    credible.

 6. I agree with Mrs Pettersen.   If  the  sponsor's  wages  were,  as  the
    covering letter with the bundle suggested, paid  into  the  appellant's
    account it is not clear what has happened to  the  20  pence  over  and
    above the transfer payment which appears on the appellant's wage slips.
     I also agree with Mrs  Pettersen  that  it  makes  no  sense  (without
    further explanation or evidence which have not been  forthcoming)  that
    the sponsor's own wages are not paid  to  her  or  into  a  joint  bank
    account but to the appellant.

 7. I find that the anomalies which I have described above are  sufficient,
    in the absence of any proper explanation,  to  cast  significant  doubt
    upon the credibility of the evidence adduced by the  appellant.   I  am
    reminded that the burden of proof in the appeal rests on the  appellant
    subject to the standard of proof of the balance of probabilities.  I am
    not satisfied that the appellant has discharged the burden  of  proving
    that the sponsor has exercised and is exercising Treaty Rights  in  the
    United Kingdom as an EEA citizen.  The appeal against  the  immigration
    decision is dismissed accordingly.

Decision

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    19 March  2014  is  set  aside.   I  have  remade  the  decision.   The
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision dated 10  December
    2013 is dismissed.
