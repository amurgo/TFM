Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Schwenk, instructed by UK Immigration Solutions
Limited


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   ("SSHD") against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge J S Law allowing
   [AF]'s appeal against the respondent's decision to  refuse  to  vary  his
   leave to remain and to remove him from the UK following  the  refusal  of
   his asylum claim.

2. For the purposes of this decision, I shall  refer  to  the  Secretary  of
   State as the respondent and  [AF]  as  the  appellant,  reflecting  their
   positions as they were in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a national  of  Afghanistan,  whose  date  of  birth  is
   regarded by the respondent as [ ] 1993, although claimed by the appellant
   to be [ ] 1995. He arrived in the UK in June 2009 and claimed asylum. His
   claim was refused on 14 October 2009 but  he  was  granted  discretionary
   leave until 3 March 2011 as an unaccompanied minor.  He  did  not  appeal
   against the decision. On 1 March 2011 he  submitted  an  application  for
   further leave to remain (HPDL). That application was refused on 11  March
   2011. The appellant appealed against that decision but later withdrew the
   appeal when  the  respondent  agreed  to  reconsider  the  decision.  The
   appellant's HPDL application was refused again on 2 December 2011 and  he
   appealed against that decision. His appeal was allowed by the  First-tier
   Tribunal on 23 February 2012, but to the extent only that  the  case  was
   remitted to the Home Office to reconsider the decision in the light of DS
   (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2011]  EWCA
   Civ 305. The application was then refused again on 7 November 2014.


4. The basis of the appellant's claim was that he feared persecution at  the
   hands of his step-uncle, a former mujahedin commander during the  Taliban
   rule and subsequently a police commander. He was born in Kabul but  lived
   in [ ] province and his uncle was a police commander in  that  area.  The
   appellant claimed that when his grandfather died  his  land  was  divided
   between his father and his step-uncle (his  father's  step-brother).  His
   step-uncle lost his portion of the land  through  gambling  and  demanded
   that his father divide his share of the land. When  his  father  refused,
   his step-uncle had him arrested and taken to prison. His  father  was  in
   prison for four months and, following his  release,  died  from  injuries
   received in prison. The land then passed to the appellant. His step-uncle
   started harassing his mother for the land and she  moved  the  family  to
   Kabul. She complained to the police but they would not help  her  due  to
   his step-uncle's position. Once his step-uncle discovered that they  were
   in Kabul he sent people to demand that the land ownership pass to him and
   he also visited his mother personally and warned her to comply  with  his
   demands. His mother was worried about him and so sold a small portion  of
   the land to pay for an agent to take him out of Afghanistan.

5. The respondent,  in  refusing  the  appellant's  claim,  noted  that  the
   appellant had given inconsistent evidence about his step-uncle's position
   and did not accept that he held the  influence  claimed.  The  respondent
   noted further that there had been no attempt  by  the  appellant's  step-
   uncle to harm him and again concluded that that demonstrated his lack  of
   influence. The respondent considered that  the  appellant  could  in  any
   event seek protection from the police  in  Kabul  or  could  resolve  the
   matter by selling or giving the  land  to  his  step-uncle.  It  was  not
   accepted that the appellant would be at risk on return to Afghanistan and
   it was not accepted that his removal would breach his human rights.

6. The appellant's appeal  was  heard  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  25
   February 2015, by which time the appellant's evidence  was  that  he  had
   been beaten and tortured by his step-uncle to  the  extent  that  he  had
   developed a shoulder injury which required surgery. It was  also  claimed
   by the appellant that his brother had been kidnapped in  Afghanistan  and
   that he had paid a ransom of ï¿½15,000 for his release. Evidence  was  also
   produced to the Tribunal of the appellant's successful boxing career. The
   appellant was supported, at  the  hearing,  by  a  number  of  witnesses,
   including the owner of the boxing gym which he had attended and  who  had
   in effect adopted him as his own son when his  foster  family  threw  him
   out, as well as his boxing manager and  his  girlfriend  of  five  years.
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Law accepted the appellant's  claim  and  found
   that he would be at risk on return to Afghanistan. He allowed the  appeal
   on asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights grounds.


7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had failed to provide adequate reasons  for
   his findings and had erred by finding that the appellant could qualify as
   a refugee when it had not been shown that persecution was for  a  refugee
   convention reason.

8. Permission to appeal was granted on 23 March 2015.

9. At the hearing Ms Johnstone  submitted  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
   address  the  inconsistencies  identified  by  the  respondent   in   the
   appellant's evidence and had failed to explain why the appellant would be
   at risk on return. The judge had failed to identify a convention  reason.
   He had also erred in his assessment of Article 8.

10.   Mr Schwenk submitted that the appellant  was  a  member  of  a  social
   group and had been persecuted because of his  father.  Accordingly  there
   was a  convention  reason.  He  submitted  further  that  the  judge  had
   summarised the refusal letters in detail and had noted  all  the  adverse
   credibility points but had found the appellant credible. The respondent's
   challenge was no more than a disagreement.  The  judge  was  entitled  to
   allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds in light of the extensive  evidence
   relating to his private life.

Consideration and findings

11. I find merit in the respondent's grounds of challenge  and  would  agree
   that the judge's findings have not been properly reasoned.

12. The respondent, in refusing  the  appellant's  original  claim  and  his
   subsequent application for further leave, noted his inconsistent evidence
   about his step-uncle's position and did  not  accept  that  he  held  the
   influential position claimed. In the second decision the respondent  also
   noted that there was no evidence of  the  appellant's  step-uncle  having
   shown any continuing interest in him in the five years since he had  left
   Afghanistan. Further credibility issues were raised by the respondent  at
   the hearing, in that the appellant's account included details of  torture
   and  the  kidnapping  of  his  brother  which  had  not  been   mentioned
   previously.


13. Although Judge Laws referred to the credibility concerns,  his  findings
   were limited to what he said at [28], which was simply that the appellant
   was a minor when he gave the statements and that he  would  not  make  an
   adverse finding against him, other than to accept  that  there  may  have
   been a small attempt to embellish his claim with regard to the account of
   the kidnapping. Whilst I am loathe  to  interfere  with  the  credibility
   findings of a judge who has had the benefit of hearing from the appellant
   and his witnesses, I cannot ignore the  fact  that  such  a  finding,  if
   indeed it is a finding at all,  is  devoid  of  any  reasoning  and  goes
   nowhere towards engaging with any of the issues raised by the respondent.
   It appears that the judge accepted the  appellant's  credibility  on  all
   matters, other than, perhaps, the kidnapping claim, but that is certainly
   not clear, as all the judge did was to state that he would  not  make  an
   adverse finding. Neither is it clear how the judge reached the conclusion
   that the appellant was at risk on return to Kabul since, again, no proper
   reasoning has been given in his decision.


14. Furthermore, whilst the  judge,  at  [29],  addressed  the  respondent's
   submission as to the qualification under the refugee convention,  he  did
   not in fact make any finding  as  to  what  the  convention  reason  was.
   Whether or not the appellant's step-uncle was  using  the  power  of  the
   state against an individual, it was still incumbent  upon  the  judge  to
   address the question of how the actions  of  the  appellant's  step-uncle
   amounted to persecution for a convention reason.  Mr  Schwenk  sought  to
   argue that the appellant was a member of a social group,  but  I  do  not
   agree with his submission and, in any event, note that the judge did  not
   make any such findings.


15. Accordingly the judge's decision simply cannot stand. I  do  not  accept
   Mr Schwenk's submission that the findings on Article 8 were independently
   made on the basis of the appellant's private life. It is clear  that  his
   findings on Article 8 were inextricably linked to his findings on risk on
   return and are therefore infected by the  errors  of  law  made  in  that
   regard.


16. For all of these reasons I  find  that  the  judge's  decision  contains
   material errors of law and simply cannot stand. None of the findings  can
   be preserved and the appeal clearly needs to be determined afresh on  all
   grounds. Accordingly the  appeal  will  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal to be heard de novo.

DECISION

17. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The Secretary of State's appeal  is
   allowed. The decision is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the  First-
   tier Tribunal, to be dealt with afresh, pursuant to  section  12(2)(b)(i)
   of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice  Statement
   7.2(b), before any judge aside from Judge Law.
