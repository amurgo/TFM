                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the  claimant's  appeal  against  a
    decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to grant her  ILR  on  the
    ground that she had been continuously  resident  in  the  UK  for  over
    twenty years.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the claimant should  be  accorded
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant made her application in October  2013.   In  the  covering
    letter, her solicitors said that she had been born on 11 September 1960
    in Nigeria.  Her father had come to the UK in 1960, just before she was
    born, and the claimant and her mother had joined him in 1964.  She  had
    travelled on her mother's passport, issued in Lagos on 25 August 1964.

 3. The solicitors went on to give details of the primary school  in  Kent,
    and the  secondary  school  in  Hammersmith,  which  the  claimant  had
    attended between 1966 and  1972  (primary  school)  and  1972  to  1977
    (secondary school).

 4. They gave details of different addresses in London where  their  client
    instructed them she had  resided  between  1998  and  2013.   She  had,
    according to their instructions, variously resided on and off with  her
    sister, her partner and an unidentified friend.

 5. They said that their client had no established ties with  Nigeria,  but
    she had established a social and cultural background here  in  the  UK.
    Her  family  were  all  here,  although  she  had  not  had  the   best
    relationship with her mother and father who left "them" in  the  1980s.
    She had significant private and family life in  the  UK.   Her  mother,
    sister and father were all British citizens, and all resided in the UK.
     Significant private life had been established through friends that she
    had had since she was 4 years old, and she had a relationship with  her
    partner Gregory Lansquot "whom she has lived with for the past  sixteen
    years".

 6. They asserted that the claimant had provided  documentary  evidence  to
    show length of residence, as set out within the guidance.  At  the  end
    of the letter, there is a manuscript endorsement indicating  that  they
    were enclosing with the letter the claimant's Nigerian passport, number
    AO4569759.

 7. Enclosed with the application was a letter from  Mr  Lansquot  dated  6
    December 2012 in which he confirmed that the claimant was his  partner.
    He said he had been responsible for her accommodation  and  maintenance
    since the year 2000, and he was happy to continue to be responsible for
    her.

 8. In the letter dated 26 September 2013, the claimant's sister said  that
    the claimant had come to the United Kingdom in 1964 with their  mother.
    She was writing to support her application, and willing to support  her
    in any other way.  She was her only sister, they were  extremely  close
    and she had a close bond with her husband and children.

 9. On 14 February 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application.  No evidence of lawful entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom had been found, and it was therefore considered  that  she  had
    entered the United Kingdom illegally.  She had provided  evidence  that
    she was resident in the UK from 1966 to 1977  in  the  form  of  school
    records, and it was accepted that she was resident in the UK throughout
    this period.  She had also provided bank statements and NHS letters  as
    evidence of residence in the  UK  for  the  year  2013.   She  had  not
    provided evidence of her residence in the UK between 1978 and 2012.  If
    she had generally been resident in the UK continuously since 1977,  she
    would have been able to have access to plenty of  evidence.   The  onus
    was on her to establish residence in the UK,  and  she  had  failed  to
    establish that she had been living in the UK continuously between  1978
    and 2012.  She provided photographs, letters of  support  from  friends
    and relatives and greeting cards as evidence of residence.   But  these
    documents were not from an  official  source,  and  little  weight  was
    therefore attached to them.

10. She also did not meet the requirements of limited leave to remain as  a
    partner  under  Appendix  FM.   She  had  not  shown  there  were   any
    insurmountable obstacles to her return  to  Nigeria  with  her  claimed
    partner, and continuing their relationship there.  There were  cultural
    differences between the UK and Nigeria, for both men and women.  It was
    not unreasonable to expect her to fully support her partner through the
    transitional period on relocation to Nigeria to help him adapt  to  any
    changes he might encounter there.  She had offered no explanation as to
    why her partner would not be able to regularise his status by  applying
    for a visa to join her in Nigeria.   Their preference to live  together
    in the United Kingdom would not amount to insurmountable  obstacles  to
    continuing their relationship in Nigeria.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Sweet sitting at  Hatton  Cross
    in the First-tier Tribunal on 5th  February  2015.   The  claimant  was
    represented by Ms Bonsu of Counsel, and the respondent was  represented
    by a Presenting Officer.  The judge received  oral  evidence  from  the
    claimant and Mr Lansquot.

12. Mr Lansquot said that their relationship had started when he was 17 and
    she was 13.  They had been in a relationship continuously  since  then.
    The claimant did not want children.  Another  woman  had  children  for
    him, and their relationship had been on and  off.   He  started  living
    with the claimant "ten to fifteen years ago or earlier in 1997".   They
    were not living together between 1978 and 1997, but he used to see that
    she was OK.  She had a mental breakdown but took no professional  help.
    Sometimes she spent time with her sister in the  UK.   She  might  have
    further documents at his home.

13. In her evidence, the claimant agreed there were no documents from  1979
    onwards.  She said that in her late teens she left home because she was
    being abused.  She was homeless and she engaged in rough sleeping.  Her
    parents were still alive.  She had not  spoken  to  the  Nigerian  High
    Commission, and did not know that they could  help.   She  also  had  a
    letter of support from Asaf Meen, who said that he had known her  since
    2003.  She said that in 2003 she had a chance encounter with Asaf  when
    she was with her partner at Debenhams, and she was not homeless at that
    stage.  She had become homeless in her late teens, "in the early or mid
    1990s".  She had not reported her abuse to the authorities, because  it
    was too upsetting and she was ashamed.  She had not returned to Nigeria
    after completing her UK education.  She had been in a relationship with
    her partner from the age of 13 until 1995, when they had broken up  for
    less than a year.  He had had children with another woman in the 1980s.
     They moved around every six to nine months, so documents went missing.
     On re-examination, she confirmed that  it  was  her  parents  who  had
    abused her.  She produced the marriage certificate for the  wedding  of
    her sister in the UK in August 2003, at which she said she had  been  a
    witness.  Her sister had purchased for her the outfit which she wore at
    that wedding.

14. In his subsequent decision, the judge's findings of fact are set out at
    paragraphs [25] onwards.  At paragraph [28] he said:

         "I have not found all aspects of the claimant's evidence  regarding
         her  stay  in  the  UK  to  be  satisfactory,  and  the   lack   of
         documentation  from  1978  onwards   (apart   from   the   marriage
         certificate of her sister) is a concern - but I take  into  account
         that she has changed her address since  and  claims  to  have  been
         homeless and therefore it would be difficult for her to  retain  or
         obtain documents confirming her stay.  She states that she kept the
         documents relating to her schooling with one of her friends at  one
         of the addresses at which she stayed."

    The judge continued in paragraph [29]:

         "The claimant has given evidence that she has no  ongoing  ties  to
         Nigeria, she does not have any accommodation  or  any  other  ties,
         whether social, cultural or family with that country.   I  conclude
         that the claimant has lived continuously in the UK for at least  20
         years and therefore meets the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(iii)
         of the Immigration Rules.  If I had not reached that conclusion,  I
         would have allowed this appeal under paragraph  276ADE(vi)  because
         although she would have lived continuously in the UK for less  than
         twenty years, I am satisfied that she has no ties with the  country
         to which she would have to go if she left the UK."

15. At paragraph [30], he said that although  the  evidence  regarding  her
    relationship with her partner was "somewhat unsatisfactory", given  the
    lack of documentary evidence that she had been with him  for  the  last
    ten to fifteen years at the same  accommodation  (or  since  1997),  he
    accepted that their evidence at the hearing was  consistent  with  each
    other regarding their activities of the previous day and so if  he  had
    not allowed the appeal under Rule 276ADE in respect of private life, he
    would have allowed it under Appendix FM because she had a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with her partner in the UK who  was  a  British
    citizen, and there were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with
    that partner continuing outside the UK.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

16. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  Tribunal  had  given
    wholly inadequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the  claimant  met  the
    requirements of Rule 276ADE(iii) or for  finding  that  she  was  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner within  the  meaning
    of Appendix FM, and that there were insurmountable obstacles to  family
    life continuing elsewhere.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

17. On 14 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson  granted  permission
    to appeal as she was  satisfied  the  grounds  identified  an  arguable
    material error of law.

The Error of Law Hearing

18. At the hearing before  me,  Ms  Bonsu  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    received compelling oral evidence  from  the  claimant,  who  had  been
    extensively cross-examined by the Presenting Officer.   She  had  given
    compelling evidence about her abuse, which explained why she had become
    homeless and also why she had not sought any medical help between  1978
    (when an NHS medical card was issued to her) and 2013 (when the medical
    records evidencing her treatment by a  GP  begin).   She  had  answered
    questions about things that had happened in the UK in  the  intervening
    period, such as the hurricane, which showed that she had been here.

19. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Miss Holmes submitted that, in the
    absence of documentation, the oral  evidence  would  need  to  be  very
    compelling to  enable  the  judicial  decision-maker  to  find  in  the
    claimant's favour on continuous residence.  The judge had not  set  out
    in the decision the flow of questions and answers in  cross-examination
    which demonstrated that the oral evidence given by the claimant reached
    this high threshold.  On the face of it, the reasoning of the judge was
    completely inadequate and very na�ve.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

20. I am mindful of the Mukarkar principle, and I recognise that the  judge
    had the benefit of receiving oral evidence from  the  claimant  and  Mr
    Lansquot, whose evidence was tested in cross-examination.  But while it
    was open to him to find their oral evidence persuasive,  he  needed  to
    give adequate reasons for finding that the claimant had discharged  the
    burden of proof.

21. The judge wholly failed to engage with the fact that the case being put
    forward was inconsistent and contradictory, and it was very  vague  for
    the period between 1978/9 and 1998.  He did not take into account  that
    the case had  changed  significantly  from  that  put  forward  in  the
    application.  Among other things, the claimant  and  Mr  Lansquot  were
    giving  a  completely  different  account  from  that  given   in   the
    application as to where the claimant had allegedly been residing  since
    1998. Also, it was not suggested in the application that  the  claimant
    was currently estranged from her parents. They were put forward in  the
    application as  being  among  her  relatives  with  whom  the  claimant
    currently enjoyed family life. It is true that in  the  application  it
    was said that the claimant had not had the best of  relationships  with
    her parents, but the reason given was not that they had abused her, but
    that they had abandoned her and her sister in the 1980s.

22. According to the application, she had been living on and off  with  her
    sister between 1998 and 2000; and again between 2002 and 2004; and  for
    a third time between 2010 and 2012.  This was all at the  same  address
    as the sister had given in her letter of support.  Notably, her  sister
    in her letter of support does not actually confirm  that  the  claimant
    has been continuously resident in the UK since arriving here in 1964.

23. Mr Lansquot asserted in  his  letter  of  December  2012  that  he  had
    provided maintenance and accommodation for the claimant on a continuous
    basis since the year 2000.  So what he said in the letter did not tally
    with  the  instructions  given  by  the  claimant  to  her  solicitors.
    Moreover, in his oral evidence, he said that he started living with the
    claimant "ten to fifteen years ago or earlier in  1997".  Only  one  of
    these three start dates is consistent with what he said in  the  letter
    of December 2012.

24. In the early or  mid  1990s,  the  claimant  would  have  been  in  her
    thirties, not in her late teens. So, according to her oral evidence  as
    recorded by the judge at paragraph  [13]  of  his  decision,  her  oral
    evidence as to when she became homeless was internally contradictory.

25. The judge's alternative finding under Rule 276ADE(vi) is illogical  and
    not supported by any reasoning at all.  It  is  illogical  because,  in
    order to have lived continuously in the UK for less than twenty  years,
    she would (on her own account) have had to have gone  back  to  Nigeria
    after completing her secondary education in  the  UK.   Without  having
    made a finding as to when the claimant is likely to  have  returned  to
    the UK from Nigeria (for example, in time for her sister's  wedding  in
    2003), the judge was not in a position to draw the inference  that  she
    had no ties with the country to which she would have to go if she  left
    the UK.

26.  The  finding  under  Appendix  FM  is  also   inadequately   reasoned.
    Essentially the only reason given is that  the  oral  evidence  at  the
    hearing was consistent regarding their activities of the previous  day.
    But all this  showed  was  that  the  claimant  and  Mr  Lansquot  were
    currently living together as of the last 24-48 hours. It did  not  show
    that they had been living in a relationship akin  to  marriage  for  at
    least two years, as  required  by  GEN  1.2(iv)  of  Appendix  FM.  The
    eligibility requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner  make
    it clear that the applicant's partner cannot be the applicant's  fianc�
    or proposed civil partner,  unless  the  applicant  was  granted  entry
    clearance in that capacity: see E-LTRP.1.12.

Conclusion

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law, such
    that it should be set aside and remade.

28. Both parties have been deprived of a fair  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and so this is an appropriate  case  for  the  appeal  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

Directions

29. This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross  for
    a hearing de novo before any judge apart from Judge Sweet.

30. None of the findings of fact made by  the  previous  Tribunal  will  be
    preserved.

31. My time estimate for the hearing is 2 hours.

32. No anonymity direction is made.
