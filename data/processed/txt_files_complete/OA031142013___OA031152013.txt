Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr T Nyawanza of Genesis Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of Zimbabwe born respectively on 21st  July
    1999 and 15th November 1994.  Both sought entry clearance to  come  to
    the United Kingdom for settlement to join their mother Nancy Chirwa and
    in the case of the First  Appellant  also  to  join  her  father.   The
    decisions under appeal were made on 4th December 2012.

 2. Appeals against those refusals by both Appellants were dismissed  in  a
    decision promulgated on 16th January 2014 following a  hearing  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes.   The
    Appellants appealed with permission to this  Tribunal.   On  24th  June
    2014 those appeals came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McCarthy who
    made a decision of the same date that the determination of Judge Parkes
    contained errors on a point of law and the decisions in respect of both
    Appellants were set aside.  A copy  of  Judge  McCarthy's  decision  is
    annexed to this determination.  It will be seen  from  that  notice  of
    decision that Judge McCarthy gave specific directions  with  regard  to
    the resumed hearing which was to take place in the Upper Tribunal.   He
    intended that the appeals  should  be  heard  before  him  but  due  to
    temporary unavailability on 29th July 2014 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Allen
    directed that the appeal be transferred to a  different  judge  and  on
    this basis it came before me.

 3. Judge McCarthy helpfully set out the principal points to be decided  at
    the resumed hearing as part of his decision.   I  repeat  those  points
    here:

      i) The issue that has  to  be  addressed  in  relation  to  the  First
         Appellant is: were both her parents settled in the UK at  the  date
         of decision.

     ii) The issue that has to  be  addressed  in  relation  to  the  Second
         Appellant is: did her mother have sole responsibility  for  her  at
         the date of decision?

    iii) The issues that have to be addressed in relation to both Appellants
         are:

          a) was adequate maintenance and accommodation available  to  them
             at the date of decision without recourse to public funds? and

          b) if they  cannot  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  does
             Article 8 apply directly?

    I will address those issues in the course of this determination.

 4. At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  it  was  confirmed  that  both
    representatives (who were the same representatives as at the hearing of
    24th June 2014) had the notice of decision on error of law.   Mr  Smart
    for his part accepted that both of the parents of the  First  Appellant
    did have indefinite leave to remain as at the date  of  decision.   The
    remaining  issues  in  respect  of  that  Appellant  were  whether  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements  of  paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules were met as at the date of decision  and  in  default
    whether the Appellant could succeed under Article 8.  In respect of the
    Second Appellant (whose father appears  to  be  in  South  Africa)  the
    issues were whether as at the  date  of  decision  the  Sponsor,  Nancy
    Chirwa, had sole responsibility for the child's upbringing as  required
    by paragraph  297(i)(e)  of  the  Rules,  whether  there  was  adequate
    maintenance and accommodation and if  not  whether  she  could  succeed
    under Article 8.

 5. The documents before me consisted of the Respondent's  core  bundle  in
    respect of  each  Appellant  and  a  bundle  filed  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants by their representatives comprising 126 pages.  Mr Nyawanza
    also produced a fuller copy of the Sponsor's  tenancy  agreement.   The
    full copy had not been produced earlier.  Mr Smart read this in  detail
    and did not object  to  it  being  admitted  at  this  late  stage.   I
    accordingly allowed it to be adduced.  I heard oral evidence  from  the
    Sponsor  and  from  her  husband  (father  of  the   First   Appellant)
    Matambanashe Sibanda, both of whom spoke in English. At the end of  the
    hearing I reserved my decision.

 6. At this point I will summarise the  refusal  notices  of  4th  December
    2012.  In respect of the First Appellant the ECO did  not  address  the
    point under paragraph 297(i)(a) of the Rules as to whether her  parents
    were settled  in  this  country  but  focused  on  paragraph  297(i)(e)
    asserting that it  had  not  been  shown  that  the  Sponsor  had  sole
    responsibility.  The ECO was of the view that it had been her  guardian
    rather than the sponsoring parent who had taken the important decisions
    in her life.  She had a carer and was living in  a  stable  environment
    and suffered no medical condition requiring treatment.  There  were  no
    serious  and   compelling   considerations.    Both   maintenance   and
    accommodation were also put  in  issue.   With  regard  to  the  Second
    Appellant it was again said that it was not accepted that  the  Sponsor
    had shown sole responsibility for her upbringing and it  had  not  been
    demonstrated  that  she  had  taken  decisions  with  regard   to   the
    Appellant's education or health.  She had been cared for by  her  uncle
    since her grandmother had died.  She was in full-time education and  in
    a stable and relatively comfortable environment.  It was  not  accepted
    that  there  were  any  serious  and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations  making  her  exclusion  undesirable.   Maintenance  and
    accommodation were again in issue.

 7. In her evidence the Sponsor adopted her brief statement  in  which  she
    set out that both Appellants were her daughters.  With  regard  to  the
    Second Appellant, Lorraine, her father had never been involved with her
    upbringing and had denied paternity.  When the  Sponsor  left  Zimbabwe
    for the United Kingdom in August 2002 she was left in the care  of  the
    Sponsor's parents but both had now died.  A  family  friend  Butholezwi
    Sibanda who lived in the  flats  opposite  watched  over  them  but  he
    travelled frequently  to  South  Africa.   With  regard  to  the  First
    Appellant,  Nokuthaba,  the  Sponsor  and  her  customary  law  husband
    Matambanashe  Sibanda  were  the  biological  parents  and   both   had
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.   She  had  exercised
    sole responsibility for both Appellants, sending  money  for  food  and
    education and deciding which schools they attended and paying the fees.
     She decided which church they attended  as  well  as  the  doctor  who
    looked after them.  The Sponsor went on to give details of  her  income
    as a support worker and her outgoings, further details  of  which  were
    later agreed and are set out subsequently in this  determination.   She
    and her husband lived in a two bedroomed house which had a  lounge  and
    there would be sufficient room for the  Appellants.   Her  husband  had
    recently finished a course in auto mechanics and was looking for  work.
    The  First  Appellant  was  still  in  education  although  the  Second
    Appellant had just finished hers.  She wished for her daughters to live
    with her and felt it was not desirable as  teenagers  for  them  to  be
    living alone with no parent in Zimbabwe.

 8. She continued giving further details of  her  income  and  how  it  was
    received.  At the date of decision her husband had been a  student  and
    she therefore had paid only half rate council tax, at the rate  of  ï¿½46
    per month.  The couple now had a son who had been born on 30th  January
    2011.

 9. It was put to her that in a letter her husband had indicated that  they
    were separated.  She replied that they had separated for a  short  time
    of about three weeks but he had returned.  During his  absence  he  had
    stayed with a friend but she was not sure with whom.  They  had  stayed
    in touch during this period.  She said he was back home by the date  of
    decision, 4th December 2012.

10. Butholezwi Sibanda was referred to as the uncle of the Appellants,  the
    Sponsor said, but that was only an honorary title, in fact he was  just
    a friend.  The decisions he made had always been at  the  direction  of
    the Sponsor.  Money had been sent to the older Appellant but had always
    been handed over to Mr Sibanda for payment because he was an adult.  No
    money was received from Lorraine's father and she had no idea where  he
    was.

11. Matambanashe Sibanda in his evidence also adopted his  brief  statement
    in which he confirmed that he had indefinite leave to  remain.  He  was
    the biological father of Lorraine.  He and the Sponsor had been married
    for about seventeen years.  When they had met the Sponsor  already  had
    Lorraine who was  about  3.   Her  biological  father  had  denied  her
    paternity and had never been involved with her  upbringing.   They  had
    always made the key decisions.  The children were very  close  to  each
    other.

12. He continued in his oral evidence stating that he was  currently  still
    looking for work.  When it put to him that a letter indicated  that  he
    and his wife had separated he accepted that he had written  the  letter
    but said that the meaning was different and he had not  in  fact  moved
    out, even for a short period, although he and his  wife  had  had  some
    problems and on reflection he said that he had lived for a  short  time
    with a friend in Coventry.  The issue had been between him and his wife
    and did not concern the children.  At the date of decision he had  been
    a student without income.

13. After the oral evidence the representatives requested a little time  to
    consider the figures in the hope of being able to agree some  items  of
    the finances and I agreed to that suggestion and adjourned for a  short
    period.

14. When the hearing resumed the representatives addressed me and confirmed
    that various figures had been agreed between  them.   Mr  Smart  stated
    that it was accepted that the Appellant at  the  relevant  time  earned
    ï¿½1,000 per month net which was equivalent to  ï¿½230.76  per  week.   She
    received working tax credit of  ï¿½346.38  every  four  weeks  which  was
    equivalent to ï¿½86.59 per week and child tax credit of ï¿½60.71 per  week.
    Mr Nyawanza confirmed that these figures were agreed.   Mr  Smart  said
    that he considered that child benefit (which the Sponsor received at  a
    rate of ï¿½20.50 per week in respect of her son) should not be  included.
    On his calculations the total income (leaving aside child benefit)  was
    ï¿½377.96 per week.

15. He then went on to set out the relevant benefit levels as at  the  date
    of decision, following the guidance  in  KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of
    maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065, as subsequently  approved  by
    the Court of Appeal.  The income support level  for  a  couple  at  the
    relevant time was ï¿½111.45 per week, for  each  child  ï¿½64.99  per  week
    added to which was a family premium of ï¿½17.40.  He pointed out that  as
    at the date of decision there would have been  three  children  in  the
    family as the son had been born the previous  January.   The  total  on
    that basis was ï¿½323.82 per  week.   Mr  Nyawanza  confirmed  that  this
    figure also was agreed.

16. With regard to accommodation the weekly sum for rent amounted to ï¿½80.76
    per week.  There was no evidence with regard to  council  tax  but  the
    Sponsor had stated in her own evidence that at the  relevant  time  she
    had been paying ï¿½46 a month which appeared to be a reasonable figure as
    half of the relevant sum and Mr Smart said he was  prepared  to  accept
    that.  That (calculated on payments being made over a ten month  period
    per annum)  equated  to  ï¿½8.84  per  week  resulting  in  a  total  for
    accommodation of ï¿½89.60 per week.  That too was  not  in  dispute.   If
    child benefit were to be taken into account then he said  it  was  only
    right that that should also be added on to the income support level and
    the figures would cancel each other out.

17. With regard to sole responsibility for the Second Appellant Lorraine he
    submitted that the witness's evidence was tainted  by  the  credibility
    issue.  The husband in his letter had stated they  were  separated  and
    the Sponsor had accepted that that was the case for a short period  but
    he had initially denied that in his evidence.  He  submitted  that  the
    ECO had come to the correct conclusion with regard  to  Lorraine  under
    the  Rules.   It  had  not  been  shown  that  the  Sponsor  held  sole
    responsibility.    Both   Appellants   failed   on   the    maintenance
    requirements.

18. With regard to Article 8 the  situation  had  been  engineered  by  the
    parents who had decided to come to this country.   They  had  not  been
    required to travel here.  They had chosen to continue family life as it
    currently existed at the date of decision.  He  did  not  dispute  that
    there was family life.  Into the proportionality assessment  should  be
    factored the credibility issue.  He accepted that there was family life
    as between the sisters for Article 8 purposes.

19. In response Mr Nyawanza submitted that account should be taken of child
    benefit  and  he  referred  to  the  reported  determination  of  Ahmed
    (benefits: proof of receipt; evidence) [2013]  UKUT  00084  (IAC).   He
    submitted it was necessary to take account of the number  of  children.
    Adding child benefit of ï¿½20.50 for the first child and ï¿½13.40 for  each
    of the other children would result in  a  sum  of  ï¿½47.10  which  would
    increase the Sponsor's income to  ï¿½420.06,  which  would  be  over  the
    threshold.

20. With regard to sole responsibility in respect of  Lorraine  she  should
    succeed.  He accepted that there had been a discrepancy in the evidence
    as to whether the Sponsor and her husband had separated  for  a  period
    but he said that was not a material issue and appeared to  have  arisen
    as a result of embarrassment.  With regard to Article 8 the credibility
    of the witnesses was relevant.  If the income requirements were not met
    he said it would be a question of proportionality.  I enquired  whether
    an anonymity order was sought and he confirmed that it was not.

21. In considering the merits of these appeals I  bear  in  mind  that  the
    burden of proof is upon the Appellants and the standard  of  proof  the
    balance of probabilities.   The  relevant  date  for  consideration  of
    merits is the date of decision, 4th December  2012.   It  was  accepted
    that with regard to the First Appellant, Nokuthaba, both of her parents
    had indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom as at the date  of
    decision.  So far as the Rules are concerned the issue in her  case  is
    one of maintenance and accommodation only.

22. With regard to Lorraine I have to decide whether  as  at  the  date  of
    decision the Sponsor had sole responsibility for her care.  It is well-
    established that sole responsibility does not necessarily involve  day-
    to-day contact with a child on a personal basis but  turns  on  whether
    the parent retained continuing control and direction over  the  child's
    upbringing, including making all  the  important  decisions  -  see  TD
    (297(i)(e): "sole responsibility") Yemen  [2006]  UKAIT  00049.   There
    were produced to me numerous receipts for substantial payments  earlier
    in the year 2012 sent to Lorraine by the  Sponsor  via  Western  Union.
    There were also  telephone  cards  which  although  not  conclusive  in
    themselves may be an indication of  continuing  contact  by  telephone.
    Significantly there was a letter from a  pastor  V  Gumbo  of  Bulawayo
    stating that he was the pastor of a church there and had been in  touch
    with Lorraine's mother on a regular basis.  It  was  Lorraine's  mother
    who had decided that she should attend that particular  church  and  so
    far as he was aware it was the Sponsor who was solely  responsible  for
    Lorraine and Nokuthaba.  Lorraine had become a member of the church  in
    2012.  There was also a letter from a Dr Leonid Ndlovu stating that  he
    had been the GP for  both  Appellants  since  they  were  infants.   He
    regularly spoke to the Sponsor in the United Kingdom and it was she who
    had decided that he should continue looking after  the  girls'  medical
    attention when she left for the UK.  She also paid the bills  which  he
    charged when the girls needed treatment.  He was not  aware  of  anyone
    else he should consult concerning the girls  since  the  death  of  the
    grandparents.  There were also in the bundle various photographs of the
    Sponsor with both Appellants showing them in  what  appeared  to  be  a
    close family relationship.

23. It is the case that there  was  a  conflict  of  evidence  between  the
    Sponsor and her husband as to whether  the  couple  had  for  a  period
    separated, as was clearly indicated by the husband's letter to the ECO.
     I prefer the mother's evidence to the effect that the husband was away
    for a relatively short period during a  family  dispute.   The  husband
    acknowledged this after it was put to him and I come to the  view  that
    it was the result of embarrassment  that  led  him  to  give  what  was
    undoubtedly misleading evidence.  I do not find however that this  goes
    to  the  core  of  the  case  as  to  whether  the  Sponsor  held  sole
    responsibility for Lorraine.  At interview it was said that it was  the
    guardian, their "uncle" Butholezwi Sibanda who had chosen their  school
    but I find that he is likely to have  done  so  following  consultation
    with the Sponsor, who I acept was meeting the cost of the fees.  Taking
    the evidence together I accept that it  has  been  established  on  the
    balance of probabilities that as at the date of  decision  the  Sponsor
    exercised sole responsibility for the upbringing of Lorraine, albeit in
    part through the agency of others.  The Appellants therefore  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 297(i)(a) and 297(i)(e) respectively  of  the
    Rules.

24. I turn now to maintenance and accommodation.  In doing  so  I  bear  in
    mind that there are two appeals before me but  both  applications  were
    made at the same time, on the basis that both Appellants  would  travel
    together and arrive in this country at the same time.  I therefore deal
    with the figures in a composite manner.  The representatives  had  most
    helpfully discussed the figures between themselves and come to  what  I
    regard as entirely appropriate conclusions with regard to  the  figures
    which were agreed.  These are set out above at the section in  which  I
    recited the submissions.  In summary  the  cost  of  accommodation  was
    ï¿½89.60 per week and  the  Sponsor's  income  from  her  earnings,  from
    working tax credit and from child tax credit amounted  to  ï¿½377.96  per
    week, leaving a net balance of weekly income of ï¿½288.36.  There was  an
    issue as to whether or not the child benefit which the Sponsor received
    in respect of her young son should come  into  account.   It  was  also
    agreed that the  benefit  level  for  a  couple  with  three  children,
    including family premium was ï¿½323.82.  On  this  basis  the  Appellants
    clearly fall short of the required figure.  Mr Nyawanza suggested  that
    child benefit in respect not only of the Sponsor's son in  the  UK  but
    also of the two Appellants should be  added  to  the  figures,  in  the
    combined sum of ï¿½47.10.  To do so would give a total  projected  income
    of ï¿½335.46, some ï¿½12 over the benefit threshold.  Mr Smart for his part
    argued that child benefit should not be taken into account at all.

25. These are not easy matters as has been well set out  in  Ahmed  amongst
    other cases.  I do not see that child benefit for the two Appellants on
    their arrival in this country can properly be taken  into  account,  as
    child benefit is one of the benefits classified as  "public  funds"  at
    paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules.  I  appreciate  that  I  am  only
    concerned with additional recourse  to  public  funds  but  were  child
    benefit for the two Appellants to be added to the income level for  the
    Sponsor then that would amount to additional recourse to  public  funds
    and is not permissible.  I find that the situation  is  different  with
    regard to the child benefit which the  Sponsor  currently  receives  in
    respect of her son, in the sum of ï¿½20.50  per  week.   That  is  income
    which is currently payable and the arrival of the Appellants would  not
    result in any increase in this sum.  It is income in the hands  of  the
    Sponsor.  In Ahmed it was treated as part of the Sponsor's income  (see
    paragraph 16) and I can see no reason to discount it.   However  taking
    this sum into account still leaves a  shortfall  of  ï¿½14.96  per  week.
    Although that is significant it is not a great sum.  It is not  however
    so modest that it can be regarded as de minimis.  It  is  arguably  not
    even a "near miss" but it is well-established  that  cannot  avail  the
    Appellants - see Miah and Others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261 and Hayat v
    SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  1054.  The  appeals  therefore  fail  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

26. Both Appellants also relied on Article 8 ECHR.  They do not come within
    any  of  the  provisions  relating  to  Article  8  contained  in   the
    Immigration Rules as at the date of decision.  The guidance in  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 and  Nagre
    v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) indicate that if an Appellant  does  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules there need to be good grounds  shown
    for going beyond the Rules to consider issues under Article 8 and  only
    if  there  are  compelling  circumstances  or  the  result   would   be
    unjustifiably harsh consequences should the appeal be allowed  on  that
    basis.  That approach has been approved  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

27. In order to ascertain whether the Appellants have  potentially  a  good
    arguable case under Article 8 which might  entail  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences as a result of the decision  I  have  had  regard  to  the
    approach approved by the House of Lords in Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27
    and in particular the series of steps  suggested  by  Lord Bingham  at
    paragraph 17.

28. The applications which led to the decisions under appeal were  made  on
    5th November 2012.  As at that date the First Appellant was aged 13 and
    the Second Appellant was 17 but would have been 18 within ten days.  By
    the date of decision she had attained the age  of  18.   Although  that
    would not potentially preclude her from succeeding under the  Rules  it
    is a factor to be borne in mind in considering Article 8, the  date  of
    decision being the relevant date as decided  in  AS  (Somalia)  v  SSHD
    [2009] UKHL 32.  I have accepted that the Sponsor has been  responsible
    for directions as to the Appellants' education and has been responsible
    for  their  upkeep.   Until  a  relatively  short   time   before   the
    applications this was dealt with via the Appellants'  grandparents  but
    since then has been handled by a friend of the family who  lives  close
    by.  It was said that he was regularly in South Africa but there was no
    evidence from him to this effect.  There was no  indication  that  such
    trips were of any great duration.  He is  clearly  a  person  whom  the
    Sponsor trusts.  As at the date of decision both Appellants were  still
    in education and there was no indication that  their  material  welfare
    was being neglected.  The mother has visited.  It is also the case that
    it was the decision of the mother and her husband to leave Zimbabwe and
    come to this country.  They are not refugees.

29. The Appellants have grown up in the culture of Zimbabwe.  There was  no
    evidence to this effect but it would be surprising if they did not have
    circles of friends in that country.  Although conventionally  the  best
    interests of children are to be with their parents in this case, as  at
    the date of decision, the Second Appellant had just attained the age of
    majority and  the  First  Appellant  was  living  with  her  under  the
    guardianship of Mr Sibanda.  It was clear from  the  letters  that  the
    family have connections with a local  church  and  have  medical  care.
    Given the disruption that a move at this stage would have been to their
    lives it is not made out that their best interests would lie in leaving
    a culture they knew and in which they were amply provided for  to  come
    to a new country and start afresh, leaving friends behind.

30. Turning to Lord Bingham's questions it was not in  dispute  that  there
    was at the date of decision a family life between  the  Appellants  and
    their mother in particular.  That is a blood relationship which remains
    intact and is fostered by contact.  The decisions  under  appeal  would
    arguably be of sufficient gravity to interfere with that  family  life.
    The decisions are in accordance with the law being made  under  statute
    and in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules  and  in  pursuit  of  a
    legitimate aim, the maintenance of effective immigration controls which
    would come within the ambit of prevention of  disorder  or  crime,  the
    maintenance of the economic wellbeing of the  country  and  potentially
    respect for the rights of others.  It is  now  established  by  statute
    (Section 117B(1)) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.

31. In considering proportionality I bear in  mind  the  situation  of  the
    Appellants as at the date of decision.  The First Appellant was  living
    with her older sister who was by then just an adult.  They  were  being
    properly provided for and had the guidance  of  a  pastor,  doctor  and
    guardian.  Albeit it not by a large margin  they  failed  to  meet  the
    financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  indicates  a
    likelihood that they would have become some charge on the public purse.
     Section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act now provides that it is in the  public
    interest and in particular the interests of the economic  wellbeing  of
    the United Kingdom that persons who seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom are financially independent.

32. Taking all of these factors together I have come to the view  that  the
    decisions under appeal are not disproportionate to the legitimate  aims
    pursued and the Appellants have not  shown  that  the  consequences  of
    refusal are of sufficient substance to outweigh the  need  to  maintain
    immigration control.   The  appeals  therefore  do  not  succeed  under
    Article 8.

Notice of Decisions

33. The original determination contained a material error on a point of law
    and has been set aside.

34. I have remade the decisions and for the reasons  set  out  above  these
    appeals are dismissed.

35. No anonymity direction is made.
