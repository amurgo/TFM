Representation:

For the Appellant:     Not represented.
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer

Paragraph 95 (vi) of HC 395 is to be read as requiring an applicant for
entry clearance as a working holidaymaker to the UK to demonstrate an
intention to work.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India.  He appeals against  the  decision
    of the respondent on 16th March 2006  to  refuse  to  grant  him  entry
    clearance as a working holidaymaker for a period of two years.

2.   The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant  was  intending  to
    take employment incidental to a holiday or that he  intended  to  leave
    the UK at the end of his working holiday.  The reasons for the decision
    were as follows:

                  "I note that you have never previously  taken  a  holiday,
        and were unable to describe in any detail the sights  you  wish  to
        see in the UK.  Taking a holiday now is presumably not  a  decision
        you have taken lightly and it is reasonable to expect you  to  have
        at least researched some aspects of the country in which you intend
        to spend two years.  If you  were  genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
        working holidaymaker, I would expect you to have at  least  planned
        some aspects of your trip.

     The working  holidaymaker  scheme  requires  that  employment  is  only
        incidental to a holiday.  Your  economic  circumstances  in  India,
        combined with your description of how you intend to spend your time
        in the UK do not satisfy me, on the balance of probabilities,  that
        this is your  intention.   The  working  holidaymaker  scheme  also
        requires that you demonstrate that you  have  sufficient  funds  to
        support  yourself.   I  am  not  satisfied,  on  the   balance   of
        probabilities, that you have demonstrated this for the  period  you
        are not allowed to work.  Your  circumstances  in  India  and  your
        description of your intentions in the UK suggest, on the balance of
        probabilities that your  true  intention  is  to  secure  full-time
        employment.  Taking account of all the above, I am  not  satisfied,
        on the balance of probabilities that you are intending to take only
        employment incidental to a holiday, and not to engage in  business,
        or to provide services as a professional sportsperson, and  in  any
        event not to work for more than twelve months during your stay.

     You have been employed in India since March 2005 and I do not  find  it
        credible that you should give up your job in order to go abroad  on
        holiday for two years.  You have shown no evidence that you will be
        able to resume your employment after such a protracted absence.   I
        do not find it credible that your employer would hold your position
        open for this period of time.  This coupled with the fact that  you
        are unable to provide anything but  the  barest  information  about
        your proposed  intentions  in  the  UK,  causes  me  to  doubt  the
        credibility of your  application.   I  am  not  satisfied,  on  the
        balance of probabilities that you intend to leave the UK at the end
        of your working holiday.

     The working holidaymaker scheme is of limited duration.  A decision  to
        take a working holiday for two years is presumably not one that  is
        taken lightly.  I would consider it reasonable for you to  be  able
        to explain the benefits of taking such a decision in  your  present
        circumstances.  You failed to do this, which means that  I  am  not
        satisfied, on the balance of probabilities,  that  your  intensions
        are as stated and that you intend to leave the UK  at  the  end  of
        your proposed working holiday.

     Whilst it is reasonable that a young Commonwealth citizen  should  seek
        to spend up to two years as a working  holidaymaker,  you  need  to
        satisfy me that you intend to leave the United Kingdom at  the  end
        of it.  This can only be judged by taking into consideration all of
        your circumstances.  I am mindful of the fact that you have  little
        in the way of prospects for the future in India,  having  given  up
        your job.  Against this background, you seek to spend two years  on
        a working holiday in the United  Kingdom.   Your  account  of  your
        circumstances in India has failed to satisfy me, on  a  balance  of
        probabilities that you intend to leave the UK after that period.

     You state that you earn RS5, 000 (�62) a month as  a  consultant.   You
        have been in this job since  March  2005.   You  have  provided  no
        evidence of your employment.  In support of your  application,  you
        have produced your personal account containing RS2-lakh (�2,500) of
        which there have been large recent deposits.  I  am  therefore  not
        satisfied as to the provenance of these funds.  Taking into account
        of your personal circumstances, I am not satisfied, on the  balance
        of probabilities that you intend to leave the UK on  completion  of
        your visit."

3.   Immigration Judge Hopkinson heard the appeal on 16th January 2007.   He
    heard evidence from the appellant's sponsor who is his  uncle  and  the
    key part of this evidence, and the basis for  the  Immigration  Judge's
    decision to dismiss the appeal, is set out at paragraph 8 as follows:

     "The sponsor told me that he had invited the appellant over so that  he
        could get some experience of travelling around  the  country.   The
        sponsor did not think the appellant would work whilst  he  is  here
        because jobs are difficult to get.  The sponsor had  not  made  any
        enquiries about the possibility of the appellant getting a job, nor
        had the appellant himself.  It did not matter to the sponsor if the
        appellant was unable to get a job."

4.   We should say at this point that this  evidence  directly  contradicted
    what the appellant is recorded as having  said  to  the  respondent  in
    reply to questions at the interview as follows:

        "Q7. What do you know about the working holidaymaker scheme?
        A.   One year work and one year holiday.
        Q8.  What preparation for this hol?
        A.   I have done shopping, clothes for myself; I have  informed  my
              maternal aunt about my visit.
        Q9.  What prep for employment?
        A.   My maternal uncle has business and a shop.   He  will  arrange
              job for me.
        Q10. How did you find out about it?
        A.   From the TV.
        Q11. Do you intend to work during your stay?
        A.   Yes.  Will work for nine months and rest of time have holiday.
        Q12. Have you any employment arranged at this stage?
        A.   N/A.
        Q13. Has your work been arranged?
        A.   My uncle said I can work in his shop.
        Q14. Who is doing that job at present?
        A.   His wife is helping him.
        Q15. What hours will he be working and what is the wage?
        A.   Eight hours, six days a week at �8 an hour."


5.   We have also noted that it contradicts what the appellant said  in  his
    application form.  At Section 5, which asks about the applicant's  stay
    in the UK; the appellant stated that he intended  to  holiday  for  one
    year and work for one year.  He  repeats  this  in  the  annex  to  the
    application form in his personal statement.

6.   It was the sponsor's evidence however  that  troubled  the  Immigration
    Judge and it was on that evidence that he reached his  conclusion  that
    the appellant was not genuine in his intentions.  He said as follows at
    paragraph 13:

     "I am not satisfied that the appellant genuinely intends to  enter  the
        UK as a working holidaymaker.  This is because he has  carried  out
        no research to ascertain the prospects of obtaining  employment  in
        the UK, and because of the difficulty identified by the sponsor  in
        the appellant getting a job.  It is  necessary  under  the  working
        holidaymaker scheme that the applicant intends to fund some or part
        of his holiday by working for up to half his time in the  UK.   The
        scheme  requires  a  genuine  intention  only  to  take  employment
        incidental to a holiday.  The appellant has not satisfied  me  that
        he genuinely intends to seek work to fund some of his  expenses  on
        the holiday.  I find that the appellant's true intention is to have
        an extended holiday largely at the expense of the sponsor for up to
        two years.  Effectively  he  is  coming  as  a  family  visitor  or
        tourist, but for a period of more than six months allowed under the
        Rules for this category of visitor.  Therefore I find that he  does
        not qualify for entry clearance under Rule 95."

7.   The appellant challenged the decision generally in his application  for
    reconsideration; however  the  Senior  Immigration  Judge  who  ordered
    reconsideration identified that there was arguably a potential error of
    law in the Immigration Judge's approach.  It was clear the  Immigration
    Judge had dismissed the appeal for  a  reason  not  identified  by  the
    respondent, namely that he did not believe the  appellant  intended  to
    seek work at all.  The Senior Immigration  Judge  thought  it  arguable
    that as paragraph 95 of HC 395 had now  reverted  to  permitting  "only
    employment incidental  to  a  holiday"  that  it  did  not  require  an
    intention to work.  He thought it arguable that the current wording  of
    the Rule should be interpreted in the same way as the Court  of  Appeal
    had in Bari [1987] Imm AR 13, in which it was held that  there  was  no
    obligation on an intending working holidaymaker to show  that  he  will
    work at all or to put forward any realistic proposal for  work,  albeit
    that the latter may be relevant to an applicant's bona fides.

8.   Paragraph 95 of HC 395 has been the subject of  various  amendments  in
    recent years.  At the time Bari  was  decided  the  relevant  rule  was
    paragraph 30 of HC 169 and it was  rather  different  in  a  number  of
    material respects  to  the  current  Rule.   We  shall  return  to  the
    relevance of this later. Paragraph 95 states as follows:

        "95. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to  enter
             the United Kingdom as a working holidaymaker are that he:
             (i)   is a national or citizen of a country listed in  Appendix
                 3 of these Rules, or a British Overseas citizen; a  British
                 Overseas  Territory  citizen;   or   a   British   national
                 (overseas); and
             (ii)  is aged between 17 and 30 inclusive or was so aged at the
                 date of his application for leave to enter; and
             (iii) (a) is unmarried and is not a civil partner or
              (b)  is married to, or the civil  partner  of,  a  person  who
                    meets the requirements of this paragraph and the parties
                    to the marriage or civil partnership intend  to  take  a
                    working holiday together; and
             (iv)  has the means to pay for his return  or  onward  journey;
                 and
             (v)   is able and intends to maintain and  accommodate  himself
                 without recourse to public funds; and
             (vi)  is intending only to  take  employment  incidental  to  a
                 holiday, and not to  engage  in  business,  or  to  provide
                 services as a professional sportsperson, and in  any  event
                 not to work for more than twelve months  during  his  stay;
                 and
             (vii) does not have dependent children any of whom are 5  years
                 of age or over or who will reach 5 years of age before  the
                 applicant completes his working holiday; and
             (viii)    intends to leave the UK at the  end  of  his  working
                 holiday; and
             (ix)  has not spent time in the United Kingdom  on  a  previous
                 working holidaymaker entry clearance; and
             (x)   holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance, granted for
                 a limited period not exceeding two years, for entry in this
                 capacity."


9.   The appellant was not legally represented at  the  hearing  before  us.
    The sponsor was unable to attend; however he had asked his daughter  to
    attend on behalf of the appellant.  Miss Degan told  us  that  she  had
    simply been asked to attend by her father the sponsor and that she  had
    no experience of the law and would not be able to assist us in relation
    to those matters.  We decided to proceed with  the  hearing.   We  were
    satisfied that the appellant's side of the case was represented in  the
    manner he chose.

10.  Mr Deller said that when the Court of Appeal decided on the  matter  in
    1987 there was nothing in the wording of the paragraph as it then stood
    to suggest that an intention to work was required.  He reminded us that
    this Rule has undergone several changes over the  years  including  for
    example the use of the word "integral" and then again  "incidental"  in
    relation to the nature of the employment that can be undertaken in  the
    context of a working holiday.  He said that although the form of  words
    that the Court of Appeal had considered in Bari  was  similar  in  some
    respects, he would draw our attention to the fact that the word  "only"
    had changed position under paragraph 95(vi).  Mr Deller put this change
    down to the passage of time  rather  than  any  significant  change  in
    meaning.

11.   He  did  acknowledge,   however,   that   although   the   Immigration
    Directorate's Instructions of April 2004 were clear that  an  intention
    to work was required, there was  scope  for  confusion  from  the  Home
    Office  website  pages  entitled  "Working  in  the  UK"  which   gives
    information about working holidaymakers and appears  to  indicate  that
    working is an available option rather than a requirement.  Nevertheless
    he submitted that the Rule was aimed at working holidaymakers: so  that
    was an indication of the intention behind the provision.   He  asserted
    that the correct interpretation of the Rule was that it did require  an
    intention to work.  He reminded us that it  was  not  possible  for  an
    applicant to change category from a visitor to a working  holidaymaker,
    nor to obtain leave to remain in that category.  It  was  also  an  "on
    entry" category only, in other words the applicant has to  satisfy  the
    Entry Clearance Officer and must hold a valid entry clearance  in  this
    capacity on entry to the UK.  Referring again to the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in Bari where there had been a comparison with  the  provision
    of the Rules relating to visitors at that time, he  said  that  it  was
    then possible for a visitor to extend a visit from six months to twelve
    months: in other words it was an entirely different situation.

12.  The issue in this case is  whether  the  Immigration  Judge  materially
    erred in law in reaching his conclusion that paragraph 95(vi)  required
    the appellant to  demonstrate  an  intention  to  work.   We  start  by
    examining in more detail the Court of Appeal decision in Bari.  We have
    also considered two  decisions  of  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal,
    Acheampong (18348) IAS 1999 Vol 2 No  6,  and  Singh  (Surjit)  (14334)
    (1997, unreported), solely because, like Bari, they  are  mentioned  at
    paragraph 9.68 of the sixth edition of Macdonald's Immigration Law  and
    Practice.

13.  In Bari, the Court of Appeal held that on a true interpretation of  the
    relevant rule, which they found had to be  contrasted  with  the  rules
    relating to visitors, there was no obligation on an  intending  working
    holidaymaker to show that he would work at all during his leave in that
    capacity.    Paragraph 30 of HC 169 stated as follows:

     "Young Commonwealth citizens aged 17 to 27 inclusive  who  satisfy  the
        Immigration Officer that they are coming to the United Kingdom  for
        an extended holiday before settling down in  their  own  countries,
        and that  they  intend  to  take  only  employment  which  will  be
        incidental to their holiday, may be admitted, on the  understanding
        that they will not have recourse to public funds,  for  up  to  two
        years provided that they have the means to  pay  for  their  return
        journey.  Where the Immigration Officer has reason to  believe  the
        recourse to public funds is likely, he will refuse leave to  enter.
        If a passenger has previously spent time in the United Kingdom on a
        working holiday he may be admitted for a  further  period  for  the
        same purpose but for the total aggregate period should  not  exceed
        two years".

14.  It can be seen that the Rule explicitly referred to  applicants  having
    an extended holiday before they settled down in  their  own  countries.
    The main emphasis however was on the requirement not to  have  recourse
    to public funds during the duration of the holiday provided  there  was
    also the means to pay for a return journey.  Dillon LJ in the Court  of
    Appeal recognised that the emphasis of the Rule was to  protect  public
    funds.  He contrasted the Rule with the then provisions as to  visitors
    at paragraph 20 of HC 169 and concluded  that  the  same  emphasis  was
    present in that Rule.  He expressed it thus:

     "It seems to me that the gravamen of that paragraph [paragraph 20],  as
        of the 'working holidays'  paragraph  30,  is,  firstly,  that  the
        person coming as a visitor or as a working holidaymaker is  not  to
        become a charge on public funds  and,  secondly,  that  the  person
        coming is not to work during his presence  in  the  United  Kingdom
        except, in the case of the working holidaymaker, if his  employment
        is incidental to his holiday, that is to say,  he  finds  that  the
        funds he has are not enough to enable him to stay for as long as he
        wishes for the holiday without doing some  work.   It  is  not  the
        purpose to require the person coming for a working holiday to  show
        that he will be able to work, as there is no obligation on  him  to
        work.  The obligation is the other way round,  that  he  must  show
        that he is not going to work except incidentally to his holiday."

15.  The provisions of paragraph 30 were different  from  the  current  Rule
    not only in terms of scope and content but also, as the Court of Appeal
    highlighted,  the  Rule  was  aimed  at  ensuring  that   the   working
    holidaymaker had no recourse to public funds and there was no  specific
    requirement to take employment. The current Rule, by contrast, requires
    a positive ability to fund the working holiday, as we discuss later.

16.  The decisions in Acheampong and Singh  were  also  concerned  with  the
    interpretation of paragraph 95(vi) of HC 395 as it  was  then  drafted.
    At the time these appeals were heard the  relevant  part  of  the  Rule
    stated as follows:

        "(vi)     is intending to take employment incidental to  a  holiday
              but  not  to  engage  in  business,  provide  services  as  a
              professional sportsman or entertainer or pursue a  career  in
              the United Kingdom;"


17.  What is immediately apparent from this is that the word "only" had,  at
    that time, been removed from  paragraph  95(vi).   It  is  perhaps  not
    surprising then that the  Tribunal  in  Singh,  applying  the  ordinary
    meaning to those words found that it was "patently clear" from the  use
    of both the  title  "working  holidaymaker"  and  the  wording  of  the
    requirements, that an intention to obtain employment incidental to  the
    holiday had to be established.  They also  had  regard  to  a  guidance
    leaflet issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office entitled "British
    Immigration  and  Visa   Requirements   -   Information   for   Working
    Holidaymakers (Commonwealth Citizens Only)".  In the guidance notes  of
    this document it stated that a working holidaymaker should be coming to
    the United Kingdom with the intention of taking work as part of his  or
    her holiday.  Having considered these matters the Tribunal came to  the
    conclusion that the decision in Bari, relating as it did to an  earlier
    Immigration Rule, was not relevant to  the  appeal  before  them.   The
    Tribunal acknowledged that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office guidance
    leaflet was not a part of the Immigration Rule but stated that  it  did
    accurately explain the requirements and the purpose  of  the  Rule,  as
    then drafted.

18.  In the decision of Acheampong the Tribunal  was  dealing  with  exactly
    the same version of the Rule  as  in  Singh;  however  it  reached  the
    opposite view.  In Acheampong the Tribunal considered whether  the  new
    paragraph 95 as it then was had the effect of overturning the  decision
    in Bari.  They were persuaded that because a  Home  Office  information
    leaflet on working holidaymakers had failed to take the opportunity  to
    make it explicit that an applicant had to  demonstrate  to  an  ECO  an
    intention to work, that no such intention was  included  in  the  Rule.
    Thus they arguably ignored what the Rule actually said.

19.  All of these  decisions  dealt  with  either  a  different  Rule  or  a
    different version of paragraph 95(vi) of HC 395.  Paragraph  30  of  HC
    169 had an entirely different emphasis to the current  Rule.  Paragraph
    95(vi) of HC 395, as it stood at the time of the decisions in Singh and
    Acheampong clearly required, on its face, an  intention  to  work.  The
    Tribunal in Acheampong held, apparently, that the force  of  the  clear
    words was modified by the guidance leaflet's omission of any  reference
    to the change.  We note that the wording of  paragraph  95(vi)  at  the
    time of the decisions in Singh and Acheampong differed from the current
    wording solely to the extent that the word "only" was then omitted.  We
    shall return to the effect of the inclusion of the word "only" again in
    the current version  of  the  Rule  shortly;  however  we  gain  little
    assistance from any of these decisions as to how the current version of
    the Rule should be interpreted. There is no doubt  in  our  minds  that
    Bari is not to be taken as an authority on the current meaning  of  the
    current rules. It was superseded by the introduction of HC 395 (if  not
    before), with  the  latter's  entirely  different  formulation  of  the
    requirements. The decision in Singh is not helpful because the Tribunal
    there were concerned with the ordinary meaning of paragraph  95(vi)  of
    HC 395 as it was then drafted and there  is  yet  a  different  version
    before us.  The same applies to the decision in Acheampong although  we
    would comment that that decision ought not to be  relied  upon  in  any
    event since the Tribunal appeared to give undue weight to what  a  Home
    Office information leaflet on working holidaymakers had  not  said,  as
    opposed to having regard to what the Rule did say.

20.  We turn then to the Rule before us, which  we  have  set  out  earlier.
    What is clear from the wording of paragraph 95 is that  it  contains  a
    number of requirements that are conjunctive: an applicant must  satisfy
    an Entry Clearance  Officer  that  he  meets  all  of  the  substantive
    requirements  in  order  for  entry  clearance  to  be  granted.    The
    requirements are all essential and an applicant who fails to satisfy an
    Entry Clearance Officer as to any one of them will not  be  successful.
    We are particularly concerned with  the  wording  of  paragraph  95(vi)
    which we repeat here for ease of reference:

        "(vi) is intending only to take employment incidental to a holiday,
             and not to engage in business, or  to  provide  services  as  a
             professional sportsperson, and in any event  not  to  work  for
             more than twelve months during his stay;"


     This in our judgment is incomprehensible.   The  present  placement  of
    the word "only" makes the Rule nonsense.  It is clear from paragraph 95
    that there are a lot of intentions that  a  successful  applicant  must
    have.  So to describe this intention as the only one (which is what "is
    intending only" as distinct from "intends only  employment  incidental"
    appears to mean) does not make any sense.   In  Bari,  of  course,  the
    wording of the paragraph as it then stood - "that they intend  to  take
    only employment which will be incidental to their holiday" - was clear.
     As Dillon LJ said, if a working holidaymaker found  that  he  did  not
    have enough funds to complete his holiday, he could take work  provided
    that it was incidental to the holiday.  The version of  the  Rule  that
    the Tribunal considered in Singh was also clear, as the Tribunal found.
    It is not clear in this version of the Rule. What is clear is that  the
    draftsman of the changes introduced subsequent to (but not so far as we
    are aware because of) Singh and Acheampong, cannot be seen as intending
    to revive the Court of Appeal's decision in Bari. If  he  had  intended
    that, he would have used the words in HC 169 that the Court interpreted
    in that case.

21.  Nevertheless, we must try to understand paragraph 95(vi)  as  presently
    formulated. There are clearly dangers in taking  it  in  isolation.  We
    read it in the context of  the  Rules  as  a  whole  and,  importantly,
    compare the current provisions as to visitors at paragraph 41 of HC 395
    in order to understand the correct interpretation of the paragraph.  We
    have also had regard  to  what  is  said  in  the  current  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions (the IDIs); although this  cannot  be  binding
    upon us in relation to how we interpret this provision of the Rule.

22.  The current Rule continues to emphasise the  requirement  not  to  have
    recourse to public funds; however it is now expressly  stated  that  an
    applicant must have the ability to maintain  and  accommodate  himself.
    In addition he must have the means to pay  for  his  return  or  onward
    journey.  There is therefore a  positive  emphasis  on  an  applicant's
    ability to meet the financial commitment of an extended holiday.

23.  We have considered the relationship between this Rule and  the  current
    provisions as to visitors at paragraph 41 of HC 395.   The  latter  has
    changed considerably over the years (and since the  decision  in  Bari)
    and restrictions have been imposed.  It is now the case that those  who
    seek to enter the United Kingdom  as  visitors  may  only  come  for  a
    maximum of six months and, inter alia,  the  taking  of  employment  is
    expressly prohibited. Under HC 169, an applicant for a visitor visa did
    not have to demonstrate that he  did  not  intend  to  take  employment
    although leave to enter was to be refused  if  an  immigration  officer
    suspected that employment was the real purpose behind the  trip.  There
    is now a restricted right of appeal against the refusal of a visit visa
    (family visits only). For a period previously there  was  no  right  of
    appeal at all except in extremely limited circumstances (Section 13(3A)
    of the Immigration Act 1971 as amended by Section 10 of the Asylum  and
    Immigration Appeals Act 1993) but at the time Bari  was  decided  there
    was a  full,  in  country,  right  of  appeal.  We  have  compared  the
    provisions as to  working  holidaymakers  with  the  provisions  as  to
    visitors and in our view it would be surprising if it were possible for
    an applicant under paragraph 95 to come to the United Kingdom for a six
    month visit or even longer - up to two years - with a right  of  appeal
    against an adverse decision  without  a  family  sponsor,  which  would
    follow if there is no requirement to show an intention  to  work  under
    paragraph 95.  Similarly a person who is aged 17  could  come  for  two
    years without meeting any  of  the  requirements  that  would  normally
    attach to a child visitor (see, in contrast, paragraphs 46A and 46B  of
    HC 395).  These factors, together with  the  changed  emphasis  of  the
    Rule, have led us to the conclusion that the Rule  requires  a  working
    holiday to be something different from a long visit.

24.  It is relevant to note here the IDIs and the information  contained  on
    the Home Office website. We are aware also that it  is  the  Diplomatic
    Service Procedures (DSPs) that contain guidance to ECOs on dealing with
    applications for entry clearance; however nobody has suggested that the
    DSPs are different from the IDIs and the comment we make below  on  the
    latter will be equally applicable to the former.  It is clear from  the
    April 2004 IDIs, Chapter 4, Section 2, Annex C at  paragraph  2.1  that
    the primary reason for coming to the United Kingdom must be a  holiday.
    It is also clear from the provisions that an applicant must be able  to
    demonstrate that he has the means to pay for a return or onward journey
    and the ability to maintain and accommodate himself without recourse to
    public funds.

25.  In the IDIs at Section 2 guidance is  given  about  employment  in  the
    context of a working holiday.  Paragraph 2.1 deals with what  is  meant
    by intention to work as follows:

     "A working holidaymaker should come to  the  United  Kingdom  with  the
        intention of taking paid work here as an  incidental  part  of  his
        working holiday.  If he does not intend working he  will  not  meet
        the requirements of the working  holidaymaker  Rules  and  will  be
        refused entry clearance."

26.  Paragraph 2.2 states in  relation  to  work  incidental  to  a  working
    holiday:

     "Working holidaymakers are expected to take work in the United  Kingdom
        as an incidental part of their working holiday.  Those  wishing  to
        enter in the category should treat the  work  that  they  do  as  a
        purely incidental part of their  holiday  (which  should  be  their
        primary reason for being here) rather than  being  the  reason  for
        which they have sought entry to the United  Kingdom.   Accordingly,
        working holidaymakers must not intend to  spend  more  than  twelve
        months of their stay in employment, and must intend  to  spend  the
        rest of their stay holidaying.

     Entrants in the category may take  most  employment  of  their  choice,
        including voluntary work."

27.  The Instruction then goes on to deal with the prohibition  on  engaging
    in  business  or  services  as  a  professional  sportsperson  and  the
    restriction on working in any event  for  longer  than  twelve  months.
    Earlier, at paragraph 1.4, it deals with funding and support and states
    that a working holidaymaker must be able to satisfy the Entry Clearance
    Officer that he can support himself  for  at  least  two  months  after
    arrival or at least one month if he has a job arranged in advance.

28.  There is some confusion on the Home Office website.  In describing  the
    nature of the working holidaymaker scheme, it states as follows:

     "You can work, but only provided this is  incidental  to  the  holiday.
        The holiday should be the primary reason for your stay".

29.  This, arguably, comes close  to  suggesting  that  work  is  an  option
    provided it is incidental.   However,  the  website  then  goes  on  to
    describe how an individual can qualify as a  working  holidaymaker  and
    states there that an applicant must intend to take employment  as  part
    of his holiday.  Later on in answer to the question how much  and  what
    work can be done, again it is expressly stated that there  must  be  an
    intention to take work in the UK, only as an  incidental  part  of  the
    holiday and that the applicant must intend to spend no more than twelve
    months working.  This therefore does not differ in any material respect
    from the IDIs.

30.  What is also clear from the IDIs, and the same will apply to the  DSPs,
    and the public information disseminated is that there is no requirement
    on an applicant to show that he  has  a  job  arranged  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that there is no restriction on the type of work that might
    be undertaken provided it is incidental to the holiday.  For example it
    is clear that work might be  voluntary  work.   If  there  is  no  work
    arranged in advance, an applicant  must  at  least  show  a  reasonable
    prospect of obtaining work in the UK of one sort or another, if  he  is
    to show the requisite genuine intention.  However when he works and for
    how long within the twelve  month  time  limit  is  a  matter  for  the
    applicant provided any  planned  work  can  be  properly  described  as
    incidental to the holiday.

31.  Taking account  of  all  these  factors;  which  are  in  summary,  the
    emphasis on the ability to finance the working holiday within the  Rule
    itself; the potential serious conflict with the visitor provisions, and
    having regard to the Home  Office  IDIs,  we  have  concluded  that  an
    applicant under paragraph 95 must demonstrate an intention to work.  It
    will be a matter for an ECO and  on  appeal  an  Immigration  Judge  to
    determine having regard to all the circumstances whether  or  not  that
    intention has been shown, taking account of the appellant's ability  to
    maintain and accommodate himself within the Rule. We  acknowledge  that
    it was found there was no requirement to work  under  paragraph  30  of
    HC169. However, the Rule has been amended several times,  no  doubt  in
    response to changes in patterns of migration across the world  and  the
    need to tighten control and regulate the entry  of  non-nationals  into
    the UK. Parliament is entitled to place restrictions  and  requirements
    on the grant of entry clearance. In our view it has done so in relation
    to the requirements to be met by working holidaymakers.

32.  We turn then to the decision of the Immigration Judge  before  us.   It
    follows on our analysis that he was correct in his conclusion that  the
    appellant needed to show the requisite intention  to  take  employment.
    The reasons he gave at paragraph 13 for finding the appellant  had  not
    demonstrated that intention  are  in  our  view  adequate  and  proper.
    Although the appellant had indicated in his application form and in his
    interview that he did intend to work, as we have set out earlier  there
    is a discrepancy in what he said.  It was open to the Immigration Judge
    to consider what the sponsor had told him in evidence compared to  what
    the appellant had said to  the  interviewing  officer.   The  sponsor's
    evidence was clear: there had been no enquiries made by  either  he  or
    the appellant  about  finding  suitable  work,  contrary  to  what  the
    appellant had said in interview that his uncle had said he  could  work
    in his shop.  The Immigration Judge also pointed out that the appellant
    had done nothing to ascertain the prospect of obtaining  employment  in
    the UK.  It might be said, although it has not been said in this  case,
    that this particular point took the appellant by surprise and  that  he
    should have been given time to deal with it. It is, however, clear that
    this reconsideration has afforded the appellant  every  opportunity  to
    deal with the issue. There is nothing before us additional to what  was
    before the Immigration Judge.  The Immigration Judge  was  entitled  to
    base his decision on the clear oral evidence before him.

33.  Since the appellant could not meet this requirement in the Rule it  was
    not necessary for the Immigration Judge to go on to consider any  other
    issue as the appellant could not succeed in any event.

DECISION

34.  The original Tribunal did not make a material  error  of  law  and  the
    original determination of the appeal shall stand.
