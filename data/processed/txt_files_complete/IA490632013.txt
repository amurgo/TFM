For the Appellant:           Mr Patel, KG Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of birth 23rd June  1989.
    He appeals with permission[1] the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Dickenson)[2] to dismiss his  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse to vary his leave to remain as an unmarried  partner
    of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom[3].


 2. The first matter in issue was whether the Appellant is in a genuine and
    subsisting  relationship  with  his  sponsor,  Ms  Sabah  Farhat.   The
    Respondent did not accept that this was the case because the  Appellant
    had previously been given leave to enter the UK as the spouse of  a  Ms
    Faria Iqbal. He stated that he was not divorced  from  Ms  Iqbal  until
    September 2013 but claims to have been  living  with  Ms  Farhat  since
    April of that year.  Further the Respondent was not satisfied that  the
    Appellant had passed his English language  exam.    On  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal the  Respondent  conceded  this  latter  issue  but
    introduced a further ground for refusal, the HOPO on the day contending
    that the Appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-
    ELTRP.3.1 in respect of funds.

 3. Judge Dickinson accepted that the Appellant and his partner  Ms  Farhat
    are in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage.  As  to  maintenance  he
    correctly directed himself that the Appellant had to show that  at  the
    date of decision he and Ms Farhat had a household income of �18,600 per
    annum.  He was not  however  satisfied  that  this  test  was  met.  At
    paragraph 16 the determination notes that the  Appellant  supplied  his
    wage slips, a P60 and his wife's P60 relating to her employment at  Al-
    Islah school, but that this evidence did not show the  requisite  level
    of income. The appeal was therefore dismissed.

 4. The grounds of appeal are that the  Appellant  did  meet  the  required
    threshold and that the determination is flawed for want  of  reasoning,
    and/or mistake of fact.  It is further submitted that since  the  issue
    as to finances was only raised on the day of the hearing the  Appellant
    was not given adequate time to produce the required evidence.


    Error of Law

 5. At the hearing before me Mr Harrison for  the  Respondent  agreed  that
    this matter had not been raised in the  refusal  letter  and  that  the
    Appellant was only put on notice of it at the hearing.  If the evidence
    had been limited that was because the Appellant had not  come  prepared
    to deal with the point.  I am satisfied  that  this  was  a  procedural
    irregularity. It was unfair that the Appellant was not given the chance
    to present further evidence relating to his finances.  There is further
    a lack of reasoning at paragraph 16 such that the Appellant is not able
    to understand why he did not succeed.  The decision  is  therefore  set
    aside.


    The Re-Making

 6. At the hearing before me Mr Harrison and Mr Patel very  helpfully  took
    some time to review all of  the  evidence  relating  to  the  household
    income at the date of decision.  It was agreed that  as  an  in-country
    appeal concerning leave  to  remain  as  a  partner,  the  Tribunal  is
    entitled to take into account any evidence establishing matters as they
    stood at the date of decision.   The �18,600 could come from the  joint
    income of both Appellant and Sponsor.  It was further agreed  that  the
    following evidence did show that  the  household  income  exceeded  the
    required amount of �18,600 and that all of the requirements of Appendix
    FM-SE are met:

        . Appellant's non-salaried employment[4] with First  4  Print  Ltd.
          Commenced 12th September 2011, still employed there to  date.  In
          the 26 weeks prior  to  the  application  being  made  he  earned
          �8274.68 gross. This is demonstrated by wage slips, his P60, bank
          statements and a handbook issued by his employer  explaining  the
          terms and conditions of  his  employment.    This  works  out  to
          �16,549 per year.


        . Sponsor's salaried employment  with  Al-Islah  School.  Commenced
          September 2012, still employed to date.  Ms Farhat produced  wage
          slips, bank  statements,  a  letter  from  her  employer  and  an
          employer's handbook.  This evidence showed her to earn an  annual
          salary of �8925, having received �4559.90 in the 6  months  prior
          to the application being made.

    Decisions

 7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it has been set aside.


 8. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
