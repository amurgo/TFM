Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms  Jaja, Counsel instructed by Howe & Co
For the Respondents:   Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Nepal, husband and  wife,  and  born  on
    10th February 1977 and 22nd November 1987, thus aged 38  years  and  28
    years respectively.  Mr  and  Mrs  Pun  appealed  the  refusal  of  the
    Secretary of State dated 30th January  2014  to  grant  them  leave  to
    remain as the adult dependants of a former member  of  the  Brigade  of
    Gurkhas, Mr Ril Bahadur Pun, who is now present and settled in the  UK.
    He was enlisted in the Brigade of Gurkhas in 1968  and  was  discharged
    from that service on 18th March 1989.

 2. The second appellant arrived in the UK on 27th October 2010 with  leave
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student and the first appellant arrived in the UK
    on 28th November 2011 as a dependant spouse.  They were  granted  leave
    to enter until 30th April 2013.  On  11th  April  2013  the  appellants
    applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK as the adult dependent
    relatives of the first appellant's father.

 3. A brief history to this appeal is that Judge Youngerwood of the  First-
    tier Tribunal heard and allowed the appeals  on  16th  September  2014.
    The judge found no family life as the appellants  had  no  physical  or
    mental problems, were both working and were no longer children or  even
    young adults and there was no emotional dependency but  he  found  they
    had established a private life and  purported  to  follow  Gurung  (CA)
    [2013] 1 WLR 2546, which highlighted that the historic injustice of the
    less favourable treatment accorded to Gurkha veterans was a substantial
    factor to be weighed in the proportionality balancing exercise although
    not determinative.

 4. The decision of Judge Youngerwood was challenged by  the  Secretary  of
    State who identified that Gurung (CA) and Ghising & Ors (Ghurkhas/BOCs:
    historic wrong; weight) (Nepal) [2013] UKUT 567, established that where
    there was an interference with family life sufficient to engage Article
    8, recognition that a  family  had  been  the  victim  of  a  "historic
    injustice" may well be relevant in  determining  proportionality  under
    Article 8(2), JB (India) & Ors v Entry Clearance  Officer  [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 234 (11th February 2009), but in this  particular  case  the  judge
    found that there was no family life and as such  the  consideration  of
    historic injustice was irrelevant to the proportionality assessment.

 5. An error of law was found and the decision was set aside.

 6. At the resumed substantive hearing Ms Jyoti Pun  gave  oral  testimony.
    She confirmed that she and the first appellant married in 2005 and that
    her husband was living in the family home and  she  joined  them.   Her
    father in law came to the UK in 2009 and  she  came  in  2010  and  her
    husband joined her in 2011.  Her application for her son to  join  them
    had not been allowed. She stated that her father in law  paid  for  her
    college fees. She would help take her mother in law to  hospital.   The
    father in law could not take her to hospital as  he  was  working  full
    time.  On the day of the hearing, however, another close  relative  who
    lived nearby was assisting her. The second appellant had  been  working
    part-time since 2011 but had stopped working when she became  pregnant.
    Since 2005 she had remained living with her parents in  law.  She  also
    had family in Nepal who were 2 hours travel away from where  she  lived
    in Nepal.

 7. Under cross-examination she stated that she and her husband sent  money
    for their son John in Nepal. Both she and  her  husband  paid  for  the
    bills. She now paid for shopping her child in  the  UK.   She  finished
    studying in 2013.  Since her husband had come to the UK in 2011 he  had
    been working.   He had helped her whilst she  was  studying.  When  she
    came to the UK she brought money with her  from  Nepal  which  she  had
    saved.  Her father in law had helped. Her own family  in  Nepal  had  a
    shop and a business.

 8. Ganesh Pun, the second appellant gave oral testimony.  He confirmed  he
    was 38 years old. He had always stayed with his parents  in  Nepal  and
    had continued to do so because of Nepalese culture, which stated that a
    son should look after his parents.   He had a younger sister who  lived
    in Hong Kong. He worked in the same restaurant  in  Colchester  as  his
    father. He worked regularly 5 days a week. He earned approximately �700
    per month. He used it for rent and food and bills.  When he came to the
    UK he confirmed that he had intended to stay. He added that he did work
    for one year whilst in Nepal repairing computers. He left school at the
    age of 25 or 26 years. At present some relatives  were  living  in  his
    parents' house in Nepal. The appellant then changed  his  evidence  and
    stated that he left college at the age of 25 or 26 years.

 9. Ril Bahadur Pun gave oral evidence. He worked full time at a restaurant
    and his son worked with him. He did not  own  the  business.  When  his
    daughter in law came to the UK she lived with  him.  He  paid  for  her
    tickets and her fees.  He stated that he wanted his son to be with  him
    all the time because he was his son. He confirmed that his  son  worked
    in Nepal for about 9 months. It was the culture in Nepal for the son to
    live with the parents and to take responsibility.

10. Under cross-examination, he confirmed that he did  not  know  when  the
    daughter in law had finished her course of studies. He  confirmed  that
    he once paid the tuition fees when she came in 2010.  The  college  was
    paid from Nepal. The sum was approximately �2,500.  His son contributed
    to the bills of the household. The witness confirmed  he  earned  about
    �1,000 per month. He stated that his son and daughter decided they  did
    not wish to return until the end of 2012. He claimed his  son  finished
    his studies in Nepal at the age of 20. He finished school at  17  years
    and commenced a commerce course of 2  to  3  years.  He  completed  the
    course at 20 years. He would then help cultivate the land at home. When
    challenged about the discrepancy between the first appellant's evidence
    and his regarding the date of leaving school he  stated  that  his  son
    kept failing his examinations. He could not remember  whether  he  paid
    for a second tranche of fees for the second appellant.

11. In submissions Ms Pal referred to the Reasons for Refusal  letter.  She
    denied there was family life. The appellants had a son  in  Nepal  whom
    they continued to support. The first  appellant  worked  on  a  regular
    basis. There was no  indication  that  the  appellants  were  dependent
    financially on the father-in-law. They paid bills on a  regular  basis.
    On his own evidence the first appellant earned not far off  that  which
    the father earned. The family life was with the child in Nepal and  the
    new baby. It was proportionate that  they  return  to  Nepal.  Historic
    injustice only 'bit' where there was dependency but there was  none  in
    this case. She referred to paragraphs 50 and 51  of  Gurung  (CA).  The
    appeal should be dismissed.

12. Ms Jaja referred to the  approach  adopted  in  Ghising  (family  life)
    paragraphs 50 to 62.  She submitted that Nepalese  culture,  such  that
    the son would live with his father, was not dealt with by  Gurung  (CA)
    and the facts need to be considered. She referred to  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal letter which indicated that the  appellant  had  re-established
    family  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   She   referred   to   Ghising
    (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong:  weight)  [2013]  UKUT  00567   which
    identified that the historic wrong suffered by the  Gurkhas  should  be
    given substantial weight in the Article 8(2)  balancing  exercise.  The
    family were not on benefits.  Article 8 was  fact  sensitive  and  this
    family were in Nepal together. She accepted that the historic injustice
    applied to family life.

Conclusions

13. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides:

         "(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
         life, his home and his correspondence.

         (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
         exercise of this right except such as in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
         country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others."

14. We also note Huang v The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2007] 2 AC 167, which reads at [18]:

         "Human beings are social animals.  They  depend  on  others.  Their
         family, or extended family, is the group on which many people  most
         heavily depend, socially, emotionally and often financially.  There
         comes a  point  at  which,  for  some,  prolonged  and  unavoidable
         separation from this group seriously inhibits their ability to live
         full and fulfilling lives. Matters such  as  the  age,  health  and
         vulnerability of the applicant, the closeness and previous  history
         of the family, the applicant's  dependence  on  the  financial  and
         emotional support of the family, the prevailing cultural  tradition
         and conditions in the country of origin and many other factors  may
         all be relevant."

15. It is clear from the authorities that should  family  life  be  engaged
    historic injustice should be given substantial weight.   As  stated  in
    Gurung (CA)

         "in the absence of countervailing factors appeals should ordinarily
         be determined in an appellant's favour where Article 8  is  engaged
         and, but for the historic wrong, the  appellants  would  have  been
         settled in the UK a long time ago."

16. If the respondent can point  to  matters  over  and  above  the  public
    interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy which argue in favour
    of removal or the refusal of leave to enter, these too  must  be  given
    appropriate weight.  Thus a bad  immigration  history  and/or  criminal
    behaviour may still be sufficient  factor  to  effect  refusal.  It  is
    accepted that being an adult child of a Gurkha is not a trump card.

17. We therefore considered first whether family life  was  established  in
    this case and addressed the question of when does  an  adult  cease  to
    enjoy family life with his parents?

18. Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160  (IAC)
    explored the concepts  in  relation  to  Article  8  and  set  out  the
    principles in relation to  family  life  and  adult  children.  Ghising
    (family life) at [62] accepted that each case is highly  fact-sensitive
    and that rather than applying a  blanket  rule  with  regard  to  adult
    children each case should be analysed on its own facts.

19. As stated in Gurung (CA) [45]:

         "Ultimately, the question whether an individual enjoys family  life
         is one of fact and depends on a careful consideration  of  all  the
         relevant facts of the particular case..."

    and at [46]

         "... the Ghising case [2012] UKUT 160 contains a useful  review  of
         some of the jurisprudence and the correct approach to be adopted"

20. Paragraphs 53-55 the court in Ghising (family life) recorded

         '53. In Kugathas v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at [14],  Sedley  LJ  cited  with  approval  the
         Commission's observation in S v United Kingdom [1984] 40 DR 196:

             "Generally the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
             involves cohabiting dependents,  such  as  parents  and  their
             dependent,  minor  children.  Whether  it  extends  to   other
             relationships depends on the circumstances of  the  particular
             case. Relationships between adults, a mother and her  33  year
             old son in the present case, would not necessarily acquire the
             protection of Article 8 of the Convention without evidence  of
             further elements of dependency, involving more than the normal
             emotional ties."'

         '54. Sedley LJ accepted the submission that 'dependency' was not
         limited to economic dependency, at [17]. He added:

             "But if dependency is read down as meaning  "support"  in  the
             personal sense,  and  if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, "real" or "committed"  or  "effective"  to  the
             word "support", then it represents in my view the  irreducible
             minimum of what family life implies".

         55. Arden LJ said at [24] and [25]

             "24. There is no presumption that a person has a family  life,
             even with the members of  a  person's  immediate  family.  The
             court has to scrutinise the  relevant  factors.  Such  factors
             include  identifying  who  are  the  near  relatives  of   the
             appellant, the nature  of  the  links  between  them  and  the
             appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom  he
             has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
             maintained with the other members of the family with  whom  he
             claims to have a family life

             25. Because there is no presumption  of  family  life,  in  my
             judgment a family life is not  established  between  an  adult
             child and  his  surviving  parent  or  other  siblings  unless
             something more exists than normal emotional  ties.   Such  tie
             might exist if the appellant were dependent on his  family  or
             vice versa." '

    At paragraph 61 of Ghising (family life), the court stated that:

         "Recently the ECtHR has reviewed  the  case  law  in  AA  v  United
         Kingdom (Application no 8000/08), finding that a significant factor
         will be whether or not the adult child has founded a family of  his
         own.  If he is still single and living  with  his  parents,  he  is
         likely to enjoy family life with them."

21. The test is however is that the ties must be over an above  the  normal
    emotional ties and in Etti  Adegbola  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1319  Pill  LJ
    identified at [23]

         'I follow that a distinction between underage  children  and  adult
         children may for many purposes properly be drawn. It  is,  however,
         common knowledge that many children, both in this jurisdiction  and
         possibly in other member states, do remain in family  homes  beyond
         the age of majority and at least until they  are  well  into  their
         twenties. Having regard to the ordinary use of  words,  I  find  it
         difficult  to  say  that  family  life   determines,   subject   to
         exceptional circumstances, when the child or children attain  their
         majority'.

22. Although family life can continue beyond the age  of  18  years,  there
    must come a time when that link will be cut and in these  circumstances
    even when it was presented as 'normal' in  the  Nepalese  culture  that
    families lived together for many years it must be that  once  an  adult
    child is married and has  children,  that  his  family  life,  although
    continuing for the purposes of family links, may no longer be protected
    for the purposes of Article 8.

23. AA v United  Kingdom  (Application  no  8000/08),  established  that  a
    significant factor in relation to whether or not the  adult  child  has
    founded a family of his own.  If he is still single and living with his
    parents, he is likely to enjoy family life with them.

24. At [47] AA states

         'However, in two recent cases against the United Kingdom the  Court
         has declined to find "family life" between an adult child  and  his
         parents. Thus in Onur v. the United Kingdom, no. 27319/07,  ��  43-
         45, 17 February 2009, BAILII: [2009] ECHR 289, the Court noted that
         the applicant, aged  around  29  years  old  at  the  time  of  his
         deportation,  had  not  demonstrated  the  additional  element   of
         dependence normally required to  establish  "family  life"  between
         adult parents and adult  children.  In  A.W.  Khan  v.  the  United
         Kingdom, no. 47486/06, BAILII: [2010] ECHR 27,  �  32,  12  January
         2010, the Court reiterated the  need  for  additional  elements  of
         dependence in order to establish family life  between  parents  and
         adult children and found that the 34-year  old  applicant  in  that
         case did not have "family  life"  with  his  mother  and  siblings,
         notwithstanding the fact that he was living with them and that they
         suffered a variety of different health problems. It is  noteworthy,
         however, that both applicants had a child or children of their  own
         following relationships of some duration'.

25. In assessing the relevant factors for family life  Arden LJ in Kugathas
    identified that

         '24. 'There is no presumption that a person has a family life, even
         with the members of a person's immediate family. The court  has  to
         scrutinise the relevant factors. Such factors  include  identifying
         who are the near relatives of the  appellant,  the  nature  of  the
         links between them and the appellant, the  age  of  the  appellant,
         where and with whom he has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of
         contact he has maintained with the other members of the family with
         whom he claims to have a family life'.

26. The first appellant was born in 1977 entered the United Kingdom at  the
    age of 34 years approximately four years ago having previously  married
    in Nepal in 2005.  He claimed that he and his wife the second appellant
    had always lived in his family home.  His father, came  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2009.  The second appellant  came  in  2010  and  the  first
    appellant in 2011.  Thus there was a period when the first  and  second
    appellant were living together without the sponsor in Nepal  albeit  in
    the family home. That said the first appellant also gave evidence  that
    before he came to the UK he worked for a period  of  approximately  one
    year repairing computers.    Prior to that he also worked on the family
    land (although not on a commercial basis).  He was educated to the  age
    of at least 20 years (according to his  father)  and  25  or  26  years
    according to the first appellant.

27. If the word 'support' is to have meaning in  the  emotional  sense,  it
    must be the case that the 'real' emotional support that is  derived  is
    between the spouses.  That would include the relationship  between  the
    first appellant and second appellant and  the  sponsor  and  his  wife.
    Although it was stated that there was emotional dependence between  the
    father and mother and son and daughter in law we cannot accept this  as
    constituting or substituting for real emotional support  such  as  that
    between spouses.  Even though the various personnel lived together  the
    evidence regarding their own emotional support was in fact limited  and
    although the family must share family links the  real  emotional  bonds
    must be within the husband and wife relationship. There was  also  some
    element of contradiction in the evidence between  the  first  appellant
    and his father as to when he left school.  Had  they  been  that  close
    emotionally we find that their evidence would have been more in  unison
    and we also concluded that the second appellant had expanded  his  time
    at school to have bolstered his apparent dependence.

28. The case was also put forward and  argued  on  the  basis  of  economic
    dependence.  The sponsor was said to work full time and support the son
    and his family.  In fact both the son and the daughter had been working
    since they entered the UK and the son confirmed that he contributed  to
    rent, food and bills.  The appellants also  confirmed  that  they  sent
    money to their son in Nepal to pay for his  schooling  in  the  sum  of
    approximately �100 to �200 per month. The financial  arrangements  were
    more akin to shared housing where the family split the bills.  We found
    no particular support in the financial sense.

29. We also note that the appellants are deriving support both  emotionally
    and financially from the support that is being afforded to their son in
    Nepal from the second appellant's parents because he lives with them.

30. The second appellant came to the UK having been sponsored by the father
    in law.  She came on the basis of being a student and not  as  part  of
    any family reunion.  The sponsor was said  to  have  paid  her  tuition
    fees.  The sponsor was clear in his evidence  that  he  only  paid  one
    tranche in the sum of approximately �3500.  The invoice was split  into
    two and payments were made in two separate years with the total sum  of
    �7,000 paid.  There was no evidence  of  remittance  receipts  made  to
    either appellant whilst in Nepal and although it may be the  case  that
    some payments were made for the second appellant to come to the UK, and
    an initial sum paid for fees the father was adamant that he  paid  only
    the first tranche.  A second sum was paid and this would have been  the
    responsibility of the second appellant and no doubt her husband.

31. Financial support is said to be expected in Nepalese culture  and  thus
    even though the son and daughter in law were said to live in the family
    home in Nepal this does not suggest a bond over and above that  usually
    to be expected from the relationship between adult  parents  and  their
    children particularly in Nepal.

32. The son, the first appellant, came to the United Kingdom as the  second
    appellant's dependent, and not under  the  Gurkha  Policy  (Chapter  15
    Section 2A Of the Immigration Directorate  Instructions)  as  an  adult
    dependent child. There was no application made for entry clearance as a
    family member of the Gurkha father  despite  policies  in  relation  to
    Gurkhas being in force at that time.

33. Subsequent to entering the United Kingdom the  appellants  had  another
    child in December 2014 in the United Kingdom.  They now have a child in
    Nepal aged 7 years old and the key family life in this matter  is  that
    between the appellants and their minor children, one of whom remains in
    Nepal, and whom they state they support, and the their child here  whom
    they state they also support.  Although the minor child is not party to
    the appeal any decision must take into account her best interests as  a
    primary factor and that is to remain at  such  a  young  age  with  her
    parents.  She, as is the appellants, and the son in Nepal, Nepalese.

34. Evidence was given that the second  appellant  assisted  with  hospital
    visits but on the day of the hearing the wife was assisted  by  another
    relative who lived nearby.  Evidence was given that the wife had access
    to the National Health Service and even though the husband works we  do
    not accept that dependency is established. There were no  health  needs
    expressed by the appellants.

35. In sum we do not accept that the first appellant and  thus  the  second
    appellant has engaged a family life  within  the  United  Kingdom  with
    Bahadur Pun and his wife.  We cannot accept that a  son  who  has  been
    educated and worked and has reached the age of 38 years, and is in good
    health, and has married and now has two children, one of whom is  still
    in Nepal, can still be said to  be  dependent  emotionally  or  in  the
    United Kingdom economically on his parents.   Consequently  we  do  not
    accept that there is any family life between the second  appellant  and
    her father and mother in law in the United Kingdom.

36. Ms Gaja submitted that the Secretary of State's refusal letter accepted
    that family life had been re-established in the United  Kingdom  but  a
    careful reading of that letter discloses that the  respondent  did  not
    accept that the relationship between the appellants and their  sponsors
    went beyond the normal emotional ties.

37. On the basis  that  family  life  is  not  engaged  we  considered  the
    proposition that historic injustice should apply to private  life.   It
    was argued at the error of law stage that the concept of 'family  life'
    was necessary in 'out of country' cases because there was no obligation
    to respect the private life of a person in Nepal but the  Tribunal  was
    required to do so in removal cases. It submitted that it was irrelevant
    whether the bonds were labelled  as  family  or  private  life  as  the
    Convention looked at substance and not form.  We note AA  v  UK  [2011]
    ECHR 8000/08 at [49] states:

         "However it is not necessary to decide the question given  that  as
         Article  8  also  protects  the  right  to  establish  and  develop
         relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can
         sometimes embrace aspects of an  individual's  social  identity  it
         must be accepted that the totality of social ties  between  settled
         migrants and the community in which  they  are  living  constitutes
         part of the concept of private life within the meaning  of  Article
         8.  Thus regardless of the existence or otherwise of a family  life
         the expulsion of a settled migrant constitutes an interference with
         his right to  respect  for  private  life.   While  the  court  has
         previously referred to the need to decide in the  circumstances  of
         the particular case before it whether it is appropriate to focus on
         family life rather than private life it observes that  in  practice
         the factors to be examined in order to  assess  proportionality  of
         the deportation measure are the same regardless of  whether  family
         or private life is engaged."

38. As stated at paragraph 41 of  Gurung [2013],:

         "The crucial point is that there was a historic injustice  in  both
         cases the consequence of which was that members of both groups were
         prevented from settling in the United Kingdom.   That  is  why  the
         historic injustice is such an important factor  to  be  taken  into
         account in the balancing exercise and why the  applicant  dependent
         child of a Gurkha who is settled in the United Kingdom has  such  a
         strong  claim  to   have   his   Article   8.1   right   vindicated
         notwithstanding the potency of the countervailing  public  interest
         in the maintaining of a firm immigration policy.

         ..."

39. To date we find that the case law has applied historic injustice  as  a
    factor in relation to assessing proportionality when family  life,  not
    private life, is engaged and family life has not been made out here.

40. We turn, however, to the assessment of the appellants' private life and
    applying the five stage test from Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  There  is  no
    doubt that private life has been established  as  both  the  first  and
    second appellants have been here for four and five years  respectively.
    The  second  appellant  has  studied  here.   The  engagement  for  the
    establishment of private life under  Article  8  is  low  AG  (Eritrea)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 801. Applying Appendix FM and Paragraph 276 ADE,  which
    is the starting point, SS  Congo  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  both
    appellants are Nepalese and their child here is Nepalese and thus  they
    cannot take advantage of Appendix FM.  There is  no  qualifying  child.
    Neither appellant has been in the United Kingdom  for  20  years.   The
    second appellant entered as a student in 2010 and the  first  appellant
    entered in 2011.  We do not accept  that  there  would  be  significant
    obstacles to their return. They have  relatives  in  Nepal  and  indeed
    their child in Nepal is with the second appellants' parents  there  who
    have a business and shop.  There is still the property that they stayed
    in previously which is at present inhabited by yet  further  relatives.
    The decision taken by the respondent is in accordance with the law  and
    framed as being necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms
    of others.

41. Ms Jaja conceded that the application of the historic injustice  factor
    applied primarily to family life cases and not those with private life.
     Previously it had been  argued  that  because  the  cases  were  entry
    clearance cases private life had not come into the equation.  It  would
    appear, however, that the Court of  Appeal  considered  the  appeal  in
    Gurung the case of Shani Gurung who appealed against  indefinite  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom. Part of his  appeal  was  against  the
    finding that the Secretary of Sate's refusal to consider  the  claimant
    under the terms of  the  extra-statutory  policy  was  lawful.  In  the
    discussion on the policy the Court of Appeal stated this at [20]

         'The general rule stated in the policy in relation to the dependent
         [our emphasis] adult children of Gurkhas is not so ambiguous in its
         scope as to be misleading as to what would be a  sufficient  reason
         to substantiate  a  discretionary  claim  to  settlement.   On  the
         contrary, the general rule is clearly stated in  Annex  A.   It  is
         that dependent adult children will not 'normally  qualify  for  the
         exercise of discretion in line with the main applicant.'

    and at [24] that

         '... the purpose of the policy was stated by the Secretary of State
         to be to remedy the historic denial to Gurkhas of a right to settle
         in the UK.'

42. It would appear that the case of Mr Gurung was framed  by  way  of  his
    private life but he relied on his claim to have retained a family  life
    to use the historic injustice principle.  Thus there was a  recognition
    that family life was still required in order to enlist  the  assistance
    of historic injustice.

43. We add  as  further  justification  for  our  rejection  that  historic
    injustice applies to private life, that the discretionary policy, which
    attempt  to  set  out  redress  for  historic  injustice,   refers   to
    'dependents' and are not applicable  to  circumstances  where  no  such
    dependency and only private life is engaged.  The policies do not refer
    to a married couple or group of individuals who have come to the UK  on
    a completely separate basis - in this instance as a  Tier  4  dependant
    under the Points Based System.  It is Gurkhas and their dependents  and
    adult dependent children who were to be  given  the  advantage  of  the
    relevant policy.  In effect it is being requested in this appeal,  that
    the principle  also  be  extended  to  non-dependents  dependents  (the
    appellants' children).  The fact that private life is being  relied  on
    is indicative in itself that the link between the  appellants  and  the
    sponsor has indeed been broken for the purposes of historic injustice.

44. Specifically, Ghising (CA) would appear to be predicated on  the  basis
    that where family life was not engaged historic wrong  would  not  come
    into play.  The reference to family/private  life  in  the  context  of
    Ghising (Gurkhas /Bocs) was a discussion of the reversal of  burden  of
    proof not an acceptance that historic injustice applied in cases  where
    family life was not found.

45. Even for family life historic injustice is not a trump card  but  still
    to be weighed in the balance. The Tribunal in Ghising  (Gurkhas  /Bocs)
    confirmed

         "47.     We reject  Mr  Jesurum's  submission  that,  whatever  the
             nature and quality of family life, the Appellants had a  right
             to  enjoy  it,  and  therefore  Article  8(1)  was  inevitably
             engaged.  That this proposition is not  correct  can  be  seen
             from paragraph 14 of Patel, where Sedley LJ said:

                  'You can set out to compensate for a historical wrong, but
                  you cannot reverse the passage of  time.   Many  of  these
                  children have now grown up and embarked on lives of  their
                  own.  Where this has happened, the bonds which  constitute
                  family life will no longer be there, and art. 8 will  have
                  no purchase'.

         48.      But as Sedley LJ immediately went  on  to  say  'what  may
             constitute an extant family life  falls  well  short  of  what
             constitutes dependency'.  In this regard, we note  the  useful
             analysis by the Tribunal in Ghising (at paragraphs 50  to  62)
             of the case law on  family  life  between  parents  and  adult
             children, culminating in the finding that:

                  '62. The different outcomes in  cases  with  superficially
                      similar features emphasises  to  us  that  the  issue
                      under Article 8(1) is highly fact-sensitive.  In  our
                      judgment, rather than applying a  blanket  rule  with
                      regard  to  adult  children,  each  case  should   be
                      analysed on its own facts, to decide whether  or  not
                      family life exists, within  the  meaning  of  Article
                      8(1).'"

46. Therefore even if historic injustice does apply in relation to  private
    life, which we do not accept, we contend that it would be afforded  far
    less weight in these circumstances.

47. When considering proportionality the interests of the child now born in
    the United Kingdom must be considered as a primary factor under Section
    55.  A child's best interests at such a young age is to remain with her
    parents both of whom will be removed together. Her family  and  private
    life are identified with her parents ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD  [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 207.  She is Nepalese and has not even  started  education  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She would in Nepal have the benefit  of  her  sibling.
    Although Section 55 does not apply to the child in Nepal his  interests
    should have some bearing on the matter.  Although he is living with his
    grandparents he is separated from his mother and father who are forging
    a life without him thousands of miles away.  He has been brought up  in
    the Nepalese culture and  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  can  speak
    English.  His interests, like his sister's interests, are  to  be  with
    his parents and to be able to live and be brought up in his own  native
    culture.

48. The appellants in this instance entered the UK as  a  student  and  her
    dependent.  They have been in the UK since November  2011  and  October
    2010 respectively, the second appellant four and  half  years  and  the
    first appellant three and half  years.  The  first  appellant  although
    entering as a dependent and on a temporary basis stated that it was his
    intention to remain in the UK when he entered.  They  have  lived  with
    the family as described above since entry but this, as found above, was
    on a sharing basis.  Both appellants knew when they entered the  United
    Kingdom that there was no guarantee that they would be able  to  remain
    here and declared that it was  their  intention  to  return  when  they
    applied to come.

49. Section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  must
    also be considered.

         '117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases

             (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
             the public interest.

             (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak English, because persons who can speak
             English-

                  (a)   are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
             interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (4) Little weight should be given to-

                  (a)  a private life, or

                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that
                  is established by a person at a time when the person is in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

             (5) Little weight should be given to a private life
             established by a person at a time when the person's
             immigration status is precarious.

50. As can be seen from the deliberations  above  not  only  is  the  first
    appellant unable to speak English, the second appellant could speak  in
    halting English, but in addition the private life  of  both  appellants
    was formed  when  their  status  was  known  by  both  of  them  to  be
    precarious. AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 00260 (IAC)  confirmed  that
    an appellant can gain no positive right to a grant of leave  to  remain
    from either S117B(2) or (3) no matter the  strength  of  his  financial
    resources.  Indeed the case was being presented on the basis  that  the
    appellants  were  at  present  financially  dependent,  albeit  on  the
    sponsor.  There  was  no  suggestion  that  private  rather  than   NHS
    healthcare had been enlisted for the birth of the second child  to  the
    appellants which occurred in the United Kingdom.

51. It is necessary to look at the totality of social ties between  settled
    migrants, and the  community  in  which  they  live,  as  part  of  the
    consideration of their private  lives  and  it  will  no  doubt  be  an
    interruption of the ties that have been formed by  the  appellants  and
    the father and mother with whom they live.  We have taken into  account
    the needs of the father and mother, who are settled migrants, and their
    health needs but as stated above they have each other, access to funds,
    the NHS and relatives here.  The appellants and the relatives in the UK
    can keep in touch through modern methods and there is nothing  to  stop
    them  visiting  and  continuing  financial  support  as  was   effected
    previously. The second appellant has had the advantage of education  in
    the United Kingdom which will stand her in good stead on  return.   The
    appellants have relatives and the prospect of housing in  Nepal  either
    with in the home which is retained, which would  appear  to  have  some
    land or with the parents of the second appellant.

52. Any private life will continue in respect of all its essential elements
    and there is the prospect that the  appellants'  family  life  will  be
    enhanced.  We take into account  the  judgments  of  Nasim  and  Others
    (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) and Patel and Others v SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 72, in particular that Article  8  is  not  a  general  dispensing
    power.

53. We repeat the words of Sedley LJ at paragraph 14 stated in Patel [2010]
    EWCA Civ 17 because of their relevance and importance in this case:

         'You can set out to compensate for  a  historical  wrong,  but  you
         cannot reverse the passage of time.  Many of  these  children  have
         now grown up and embarked on lives of their own.   Where  this  has
         happened, the bonds which constitute family life will no longer  be
         there, and art. 8 will have no purchase'.

54. We find that there is no family life in  this  instance  and  thus  the
    principle of historic injustice does not apply.  The  chain  of  family
    life had been broken not least by the marriage of the first and  second
    appellants. Even if it is asserted that family life was  reasserted  in
    the UK as pointed out in Y v Russia [2008] ECHR 1585,  a  consideration
    is whether family life was created at a time when the persons  involved
    were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the
    persistence of that family life within the host state  would  from  the
    outset be precarious. That must be the case here. Even if the principle
    of historic injustice does have purchase in the context of private life
    it must have less weight than  the  'substantial'  weight  afforded  in
    family life cases not least because the appellants  have  forged  their
    own independent bonds and their responsibilities, which  now  lie  with
    each other and their own children.

55. The right that has been established is  such  that  the  weight  to  be
    afforded to the  respondent's  position  outweighs  the  weight  to  be
    afforded to that of the appellants.   Applying  Huang  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 11 we were not persuaded that
    the private life of the claimants  would  be  prejudiced  in  a  manner
    sufficiently serious to amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental  right
    protected by Article 8.  We find that the decision is a  necessary  and
    proportionate response to any interference in the Article 8 rights.

Order

Appeals dismissed.



Signed      Date 1st July 2015

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington



In the light of the decision to re-make the decision in the appeal,  I  have
considered whether to make a fee award (rule 23A (costs) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007). I have had regard to the  Joint
Presidential Guidance Note: Fee  Awards  in  Immigration  Appeals  (December
2011). I make no award as the  appellants  have  been  unsuccessful  in  all
aspects of their appeals.
