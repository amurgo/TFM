                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
         material legal error in the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal J Lebasci,  promulgated  on  10  May  2018,  allowing  the
         appellant's appeal against the refusal of a human rights claim  (in
         the form of an application for Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  (ILR)
         made pursuant to paragraph 276B of the immigration rules) dated  13
         May 2017.



Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born in February  1982.  He
         entered the UK December 2005 with entry clearance as a student.  He
         obtained further leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
         valid until 31 August 2008. He was issued a Postgraduate Diploma in
         Business Administration (Level 7) in July 2008. He made an  in-time
         application for further leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Post  Study)
         Migrant, and then made two further applications leave to remain  as
         a Tier 1 (General) Migrant which were ultimately granted, the  last
         bestowing leave valid until 15 February 2017.

      3. On 20 January 2016 the appellant made a human rights claim based on
         his 10 years Long Residence. An initial decision was made  refusing
         the application on 12 March 2016 but this decision was withdrawn on
         3 April 2017 and remade on 13 May 2017. The respondent refused  the
         application pursuant to paragraph 322(5) of the immigration  rules.
         This particular provision is located in Part 9 of  the  immigration
         rules dealing with general grounds of refusal and falls  under  the
         heading "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be  refused."
         It is not therefore mandatory ground of refusal.  Paragraph  322(5)
         reads,

             (5) the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security

      4. In his application for leave to remain made on  28  September  2010
         the appellant stated that, for the  financial  year  2010-2011,  he
         received an employment-based income of �5,207.68 (for the period  4
         June 2010 to 31 August 2010) and earnings of �42,540 from dividends
         relating to his  company  (for  the  period  28  June  2010  to  17
         September 2010). In the appellant's application for leave to remain
         made on 5 February 2014 he stated that, for the financial year 2013-
         14, he had an employment-based income of �17,479.25 (for the period
         13 June 2013 to 31 January 2014) and a  dividend  income  from  his
         company of �41,025 (for the period 30 April  2013  to  13  December
         2013). Information obtained from HMRC however disclosed that in the
         financial years 2010-2011  and  2013-2014  the  appellant  did  not
         declare any dividend income relating to his company. The respondent
         noted that the appellant used the services of  SJ  Accountants  and
         HSY  Accountants  in  respect  of  both  his   Tier   1   (General)
         Applications and that he used the services of  AWS  Accountants  to
         prepare his accounts for his application made  in  September  2010.
         The respondent observed that AWS Accountants  and  HSY  Accountants
         were members of the Association of Chartered Certified  Accountants
         (ACCA). Although the appellant  had  retrospectively  declared  his
         dividend income to HMRC (on 6 March 2017 and 29  March  2017).  The
         respondent noted that, in respect of the relevant  tax  years,  the
         appellant would have been classed as a  higher  rate  taxpayer  and
         that by failing to declare his  dividends  to  HMRC  the  appellant
         benefited financially as he would have  appeared  to  have  been  a
         basic rate taxpayer. The respondent observed that paragraph  322(5)
         was a discretionary ground of refusal but  she  was  not  satisfied
         that the appellant's failure to declare this dividend income was  a
         genuine error. The respondent was consequently satisfied  that  the
         appellant had been deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HMRC
         and that it was appropriate to refuse his application for ILR.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  no
         criminal  convictions,  that  no  criticism   was   made   of   his
         associations and that there was no suggestion that he represented a
         threat to national security. The judge found that the appellant had
         not sought to mislead the Home Office as he had  provided  evidence
         to support the income for which he claimed points in  his  previous
         applications and these figures were broadly consistent with the tax
         returns he had now completed and submitted to HMRC. The judge noted
         that the appellant had not made any false declarations to HMRC  but
         did fail to file his tax returns in respect of the financial  years
         2010-11 and 2013-14. The judge did not consider that  this  failure
         was aimed at securing an immigration  advantage  but  that  it  did
         result in financial advantage for  the  appellant  as  he  was  not
         required to pay tax on his dividend income. The judge  then  stated
         that paragraph 322(5)  required  a  balancing  act  and  concluded,
         without giving clear reasons, that the appellant had not  practised
         deception or dishonesty to  bring  him  within  the  ambit  of  the
         paragraph. The judge proceeded to allow the appeal on human  rights
         grounds.

The 'error of law decision and the application for  reconsideration  of  the
'error of law' decision

      6. In the 'error of law'  decision  promulgated  on  18  January  2019
         Deputy Upper Tribunal Chamberlain found that Judge Lebasci erred in
         law by holding that  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  immigration  rules
         requiring a "balancing act", by failing  to  consider  whether  the
         appellant's failure to lodge tax returns was a 'genuine error',  by
         failing to consider the timing of the applicant's correction of his
         tax liability, and by failing to refer to any explanation given  by
         the appellant to account for the omitted tax returns or to  explain
         why she considered this to be a 'genuine error'.

      7. Deputy Judge Chamberlin  set  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
         aside and a further hearing  to  remake  the  decision  was  listed
         before the same judge on 26 February 2019. The hearing was  however
         adjourned to await the handing down on 16 April 2019 of  the  Court
         of Appeal's decision in Balajigari v The Secretary of State for the
         Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673. The appeal was relisted for 19
         September 2019.

      8. At the start of the hearing on 19 September 2019 Mr Rehman produced
         a    document    headed    "Skeleton    argument/application    for
         reconsideration  of  decision  11th  December  2018"  and  produced
         several authorities. Neither the Upper Tribunal nor the  respondent
         were informed in advance of any application to set aside the  error
         of law decision.

      9. Mr Rehman contended that the Upper Tribunal has power  to  vary  or
         set aside an error of law decision at any point before  it  finally
         disposed of an appeal and relied on the decision in  AZ  (error  of
         law: jurisdiction; PTA practice)  Iran  [2018]  UKUT  00245  (IAC).
         Although the Upper Tribunal would only  permit  this  to  occur  in
         'very exceptional circumstances' as per Practice Direction  3.7  of
         the Practice Directions for the Immigration and Asylum Chambers  of
         the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal (made on 10 February
         2010), this high  threshold  was  met  following  the  decision  in
         Balajigari. Judge Chamberlin's conclusion that paragraph 322(5) did
         not require a balancing act was at odds with Balajigari. At [38] of
         the Court of Appeal authority Underhill LJ stated,

             "As for the third limb of the first stage of the analysis,  Mr
             Biggs submitted that the assessment of undesirability requires
             the decision-maker to conduct a balancing exercise informed by
             weighing all relevant factors. That would include such matters
             as any substantial positive contribution to the UK made by the
             applicant and also circumstances relating to the  (mis)conduct
             in question, e.g. that it occurred a long time ago. In support
             of that proposition he relied on the judgment of Foskett J  in
             R (Ngouh) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2010]
             EWHC 2218 (Admin), which also  concerned  the  application  of
             paragraph 322 (5), albeit in relation to a different  kind  of
             conduct: see paras. 110, 120 and 121. While we would  not  say
             that it would always be an error of law for  a  decision-maker
             to fail to conduct the balancing exercise explicitly, we agree
             that it would be good practice for the Secretary of  State  to
             incorporate it in his formal decision-making  process.  In  so
             far as Lord Tyre may be thought to have suggested otherwise in
             Oji v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  CSOH
             127 (see para. 28) and Dadzie v Secretary  of  State  for  the
             Home  Department  [2018]  CSOH  128  (para.   28)   we   would
             respectfully disagree."

     10. Mr Rehman further submitted that  the  Deputy  Judge  relied  on  a
         headnote in R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for
         the Home Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))
         [2018]  UKUT  00384  (IAC)  with  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
         Balajigari disagreed. Mr Rehman  additionally  submitted  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal judge set out the  evidence  before  her  which
         included the appellant's bundle and witness statements and that she
         provided adequate reasons for concluding  that  the  allegation  of
         deception or dishonesty by the appellant had not been made out.

     11. Having regard to the extract from Balajigari I accept  Mr  Rehman's
         submission that Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlin was wrong to
         have found an error of law in the First-tier  Tribunal's  assertion
         that paragraph 322(5) "requires a balancing act." I am not  however
         persuaded that the other errors of law  identified  by  the  Deputy
         Judge were wrong, or that the Deputy Judge's mistake undermines her
         overall  conclusion  that  the   First-tier   Tribunal's   decision
         contained errors on points of law requiring it to be set aside.

     12. The First-tier Tribunal judge concluded that the appellant had  not
         practised deception or dishonesty even though the failure to  lodge
         his tax returns for the relevant  financial  years  resulted  in  a
         financial advantage to him. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  however
         failed to give any or adequate reasons for this finding.  She  made
         no reference at all to the explanation advanced  by  the  appellant
         for his failure to make a tax return for the relevant two years and
         no consideration was given to the timing of his correction  of  his
         tax liability. The judge  failed  to  engage  with  or  assess  the
         explanation advanced by the appellant or to give considered reasons
         for concluding that the omissions were a genuine error.  Mr  Rehman
         boldly submitted that the appellant's explanation was considered by
         the respondent in the Reasons for Refusal Letter and was  contained
         in the appellant's statements and his oral evidence,  and  that  it
         was necessarily implicit in the First-tier Tribunal's decision that
         the explanation was  considered  and  accepted.  The  fact  remains
         however that the explanation is not contained in the  decision  and
         that it is not possible to discern how the  judge  approached  that
         explanation if she had indeed considered it. There were no material
         findings in respect of the  'innocent  explanation'  given  by  the
         appellant. Nor does the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  identify  what
         factors she weighed up  in  the  'balancing  act'  under  paragraph
         322(5).

     13. For  these  reasons  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  are  "very
         exceptional reasons" to depart from  the  Deputy  Judge's  ultimate
         conclusion that the First-tier Tribunal's decision was infected  by
         material errors of law requiring it to be set aside.

The appellant's evidence

     14. The appellant adopted his statements dated 30 March 2017, 14  March
         2018, and 25 February 2019. Although the  appellant  had  lodged  3
         separate bundles of documents, only the 2nd and  3rd  bundles  were
         contained in the Tribunal file. Mr Rehman however indicated that it
         was not necessary for me to have regard to the documents  contained
         in the missing bundle and that he was placing principal reliance on
         the appellant's statements given the narrow  issue  in  contention.
         The 3rd, short bundle contained the Short Tax  Return  relating  to
         the appellant's company for the tax years 2010-2011 and  2013-2014,
         and a letter dated 25 February 2019 from Tax Perks Accountancy, the
         appellant's new accountants. During the course of  the  hearing  Mr
         Jarvis located a letter, dated 3 February 2013,  written  by  Siraj
         Muhammad  of  HSY  Accountants  Ltd  confirming   the   appellant's
         employment and dividend income for  the  period  February  2013  to
         January 2014, and  some  accompanying  documents  relating  to  the
         appellant's  income  and  unaudited  accounts   relating   to   the
         appellant's company and the dividend vouchers covering that period.

     15. In his statement dated 30  March  2017  the  appellant  stated,  at
         paragraphs 10 and 11,

             "I confirm that upon receipt of my  refusal,  I  contacted  my
             previous accountants. Unfortunately  no  proper  response  was
             provided. They were unable to locate my record as  they  moved
             their offices. They kept me in the loop and finally I was told
             that the person who dealt with my affairs was no more with the
             firm. I tried to hunt down the adviser but without any luck. I
             have no accounting experience in this country or abroad. It is
             unfortunate that I was not advised  properly  by  my  previous
             accountants as to the filing of personal  tax  return.  I  was
             only advised to the extent of my company's  accounts  etc  and
             was under the impression that will suffice for tax purposes.

             It was until now I found my new accountants and I was  advised
             to file personal tax returns for the previous years. Upon that
             I requested my accountants to promptly prepare tax returns for
             the previous years and submit those to HMRC. I further confirm
             that I always promptly and with utmost diligence declared  all
             the necessary information to the government agencies."

     16. In his statement dated 14 March 2018 the appellant again stated, at
         paragraph 10, that his previous accountants were unable  to  locate
         his record "as they moved their offices."

     17. In his witness statement  dated  25  February  2019  the  appellant
         claimed that the late filing of his tax returns not an  intentional
         act to deceive the Home Office or HMRC but that it was "due to lack
         of familiarity as to  taxation  system  or  procedures  and  proper
         advice." He stated, "I  must  stress  I  am  not  dishonest  person
         however, I must accept have been insensitive to probe into this and
         differentiate between parallel taxation system one personal and the
         other  companies'  liability  to  declare  accounts  tax  etc."  At
         paragraph 11 of this statement he said,

             "I also tried to contact the SJ Accountants / AWS  Accountants
             to seek clarification.  I  found  out  that  some  reason  the
             accountant dealt with me has left or have [sic]  been  sacked.
             With all honesty, I cannot account  for  why  they  failed  to
             disclose my self-employed earning or alternatively  advise  me
             but  I  consider   that   their   negligence   and   lack   of
             professionalism which might have resulted in his departure."

     18. And at paragraph 12 the appellant stated,

             "I have explored into this matter and tried to liaise with  my
             last accountant but only answer which is given to me that they
             were only instructed to deal with the company  affairs  and  I
             did not instruct them as to file my personal returns.  In  all
             honesty I am bemused with this reasoning. At no given  time  I
             was advised that I shall file my personal returns  support  to
             the business.  I  confirm  had  I  known  that  I  would  have
             certainly filed my personal returns in time."

     19. The appellant referred to his absence of  any  criminal  record  or
         history of evading immigration and that people  with  whom  he  had
         dealt judged him to be honest and respectful and reliable.  It  was
         wrong for the respondent to dispute his  conduct  or  character  in
         isolation based on a single innocent mistake.

     20. There  was  no  examination  in  chief.  In  cross-examination  the
         appellant named the accountant he previously used  as  Siraj.  This
         accountant used different companies, but the appellant  could  only
         recall HSY Accountants. He was unable to recall the  names  of  the
         other accountancy firms involved in  preparing  his  accounts.  The
         appellant met Siraj through a friend and always dealt with  him  on
         the phone. The appellant explained  that  SJ  Accountants  and  AWS
         Accountants were 2 companies but had one office. The appellant  had
         gone on one occasion to the office and had been told that Siraj had
         left. The appellant assumed Siraj had been sacked but  he  had  not
         been told any details. The appellant could not recall the  name  of
         the person to whom he spoke. The person did not  explain  why  they
         could not give the appellant any information. When asked whether he
         had made any official complaint against Siraj the appellant said he
         did not know where to go to lodge a complaint or  who  to  complain
         to. He had not  asked  his  solicitors  for  advice  on  lodging  a
         complaint.

     21. The appellant was aware that his company had to  file  tax  returns
         but he had no idea that  he  had  to  file  a  self-assessment  tax
         return. He was a layman and did not understand the tax process.  He
         always listened to his accountant and did what his accountant  told
         him. He did not realise he had to pay tax on his  dividend  income.
         The appellant's lawyers had asked him to get something  in  writing
         from the accountancy firms. He only went to the accountants' office
         on one occasion but he phoned a couple  of  times.  When  he  asked
         about his records they told him that they didn't have any records.

     22. In response to clarificatory questions from me the  appellant  said
         that he had no evidence of any correspondence between him  and  his
         accountant or the accountant's firms. He  had  always  communicated
         over the phone. There was no statement or letter  from  the  friend
         who introduced him to his accountant. The appellant had  no  emails
         from  his  accountant  or  the  accountancy  firms.  The  appellant
         explained that Siraj had himself moved office and this is  what  he
         meant in his 2017  and  2018  statements.  The  appellant  had  not
         contacted ACCA concerning Siraj's conduct and did not know why  the
         accountancy firms didn't write any letter confirming  what  he  had
         been told by them.

     23. At the end of his evidence the appellant reiterated  his  innocence
         at his ignorance of the tax process and maintains that he  was  not
         lying. He referred to the family he had in the UK and his length of
         residence and his character. He stated that he had forgotten how to
         write in his native language. He repeated that no longer  knew  how
         to write in Urdu and confirmed that he entered the UK when  he  was
         23 or 24 years old.

     24. Mr Jarvis invited me to find that the respondent had discharged the
         burden of proof. Although one  did  not  expect  the  appellant  to
         understand tax law he had been aware  of  these  allegations  since
         2016 and one would expect him to  have  made  more  effort  through
         reasonable  channels  to  obtain  corroborative  evidence.  He  was
         essentially  asserting  complete  miss-practice  by   a   Chartered
         Accountant and that the relevant firms refused to  assist  him.  It
         was not credible that the appellant failed to make any complaint in
         the face of this serious allegation of negligence. He  made  little
         or no effort to obtain corroborated evidence from  the  firms.  The
         appellant's evidence was changeable in respect of the  reasons  for
         the absence of available records. It is concerning that  there  was
         no written evidence from the accountants other than that  from  HSY
         Accountants Ltd  contained  in  the  respondent's  bundle.  It  was
         submitted that it was unlikely that the appellant would be  unaware
         of his potential liabilities given the high level of  his  dividend
         income.

     25. Mr Rahman invited me to find the appellant a credible  witness  and
         that his explanation was also credible.  The  appellant's  evidence
         relating to Siraj was confirmed by the letter from HSY  Accountants
         Ltd dated 3 February  2013.  The  fact  that  there  was  no  other
         documentary evidence was  irrelevant.  It  was  not  reasonable  to
         expect the  appellant  to  have  lodged  a  complaint  against  his
         previous accountants given that he  was  trying  to  sort  out  his
         immigration problems. The appellant's explanation for  the  absence
         of records was credible. His case was a  simple  one  -  he  wasn't
         advised of the dual taxation requirements and he reasonably  relied
         on what his previous accountant told him. The letter from  his  new
         accountants showed that  he  was  diligent  in  honouring  his  tax
         liability. I was invited to find that  there  was  no  evidence  of
         dishonesty and the respondent had  not  discharged  the  burden  of
         proof incumbent on her.  In  relation  to  the  balancing  exercise
         within paragraph 322(5) it was submitted  that  the  appellant  did
         what he required to do and that he had not been dishonest.

     26. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

     27. The burden of proving that  the  appellant  was  dishonest  in  his
         conduct under paragraph 322(5) rests on  the  respondent,  and  the
         standard is the balance of probabilities, but I must bear  in  mind
         the serious nature of the allegation and the  serious  consequences
         which follow from a finding of dishonesty.

     28. The appellant accepts that  he  failed  to  lodge  tax  returns  in
         respect of his dividend income in the tax years 2010-2011 and 2013-
         14 but attributes this to his ignorance of the tax system  and  the
         negligence of his previous accountants. I am however satisfied, for
         the following reasons,  that  the  respondent  has  discharged  the
         burden of proof incumbent on her to prove that the failure to lodge
         the relevant tax  returns  was  as  a  result  of  the  appellant's
         dishonesty.

     29. I acknowledge that the appellant is not an accountant, and that  he
         may have been unfamiliar with the British tax system. He is however
         clearly an intelligent man with a Postgraduate Diploma in  Business
         Administration  (though  I  appreciate  that  this  is  not  a  tax
         qualification). He must also have been aware  that  he  received  a
         large income  from  dividends  derived  from  his  company  in  the
         financial years 2010-11  and  2013-14.  Even  if  one  only  has  a
         rudimentary knowledge of tax systems one would expect to pay tax on
         a large income. In the circumstances it is not  credible  that  the
         appellant would have failed to appreciate that tax would need to be
         paid on his personal income derived from his company. In  the  year
         2010 he received an employment-based income  of  �5,207.68,  and  a
         dividend income  of  �42,540.  His  dividend  income  in  2013  was
         �41,025. These are significant amounts. I simply  do  not  find  it
         credible that he would have failed to  appreciate  that  this  high
         income may expose him to tax liabilities.

     30. The appellant attributes the failure in lodging his tax returns  to
         his previous accountant. I  accept  that  there  are  dishonest  or
         incompetent accountants. The respondent's file  contains  a  letter
         and  income  summaries  and  unaudited  accounts  prepared  by  HSY
         Accountants Ltd, an ACCA firm, for  the  period  February  2013  to
         January 2014. I accept that the appellant did previously  use  this
         firm of accountants, and that Siraj Muhammad (FCCA) was  associated
         with the firm. I do not however accept the appellant's  claim  that
         there was no correspondence and no other documentation,  either  in
         paper form or email, relating to his involvement with Siraj or  HSY
         Accountants Ltd, or indeed with SJ Accountants or AWS  Accountants.
         It is not credible that there would be no terms of service or other
         contract  details  between   the   appellant   and   his   previous
         accountants, or that the accountant's services  would  be  provided
         only by telephone communication without the creation of  any  other
         documents. Nor is it credible that the  appellant  would  not  have
         retained records  relating  to  his  instruction  of  his  previous
         accountants or the information requested by the accountants or  the
         information he provided to the firm.

     31. On the appellant's  account  his  previous  accountants  have  been
         significantly negligent by failing to advise him  of  his  need  to
         file personal tax returns for the relevant financial years when, in
         light of his income, he was clearly liable as a  higher  rate  tax-
         payer. Yet the appellant  has  not  sought  to  lodge  a  complaint
         against his former accountants. Given the seriousness of the matter
         and his knowledge since March 2016 of the claimed  incompetence  of
         his former accountants,  it  is  simply  not  believable  that  the
         appellant would not know where to go or to whom he  could  lodge  a
         complaint. I draw an adverse inference from the appellant's failure
         to take any action against his previous accountants in a period  of
         over three years and the explanation he gives for failing to do so.



     32. In his February 2019 statement the appellant claimed to have  tried
         to contact SJ Accountants / AWS Accountants "to seek clarification"
         but he has not produced any correspondence  or  documentation  from
         this firm(s). He could not offer any explanation  as  to  why  this
         firm wouldn't confirm in writing what they had told him. Given  the
         serious nature of the appellant's allegations against  Siraj  I  do
         not find it at all credible that the accountancy firm(s) would fail
         to confirm in writing what the appellant claimed at paragraph 12 of
         his 2019 statement - that they were only instructed  to  deal  with
         his company affairs and that they were not instructed to  file  his
         personal returns. There is no apparent reason why  the  accountancy
         firm(s) could not confirm that Siraj left their  practice  and  the
         reasons for the absence of any records relating to the appellant. I
         find the absence of any correspondence  at  all  from  any  of  the
         accountancy firms identified by the appellant to detract  from  his
         credibility.

     33. In both his  2017  and  2018  statements  the  appellant  said  his
         previous accountants were unable to locate  his  records  "as  they
         moved their offices." In his oral evidence he claimed that he meant
         that Siraj moved  his  office  from  the  firm  with  whom  he  was
         associated. The appellant's previous two  statements  were  however
         clear. The departure from the firm of "the person  who  dealt  with
         [his] affairs" was not advanced as a reason for the absence of  any
         records. In light of the absence of any confirmation  from  any  of
         the  accountancy  firms  relating  to  the   appellant's   previous
         accountancy  records  I  find  this   inconsistency   damages   his
         credibility.

     34. Although the appellant has retrospectively lodged his  tax  returns
         and is now in an agreement with HMRC to pay  back  his  outstanding
         tax liability, this only came about following the  initial  refusal
         of his ILR application in March 2016.  But  for  the  refusal  this
         application there is no indication that the  appellant  would  have
         ever declared his dividend income to HMRC. The appellant  stood  to
         gain a significant financial advantage from  the  nondisclosure  of
         his dividend income. I acknowledge that he has no  criminal  record
         and that he has not otherwise sought to evade immigration  control,
         and I note the character references provided in support. Mr  Rehman
         drew my attention to the letter from Tax Perks Accountancy but  the
         information in this letter was based on what the appellant told his
         current accountants.

     35. The failure by the appellant to lodge his  tax  returns  disclosing
         his dividend income for the relevant financial years brought him  a
         significant financial advantage. There was a prima facie basis  for
         the respondent to suspect there had  been  dishonesty  rather  than
         carelessness  or  ignorance,  and  this  called   for   an   honest
         explanation. The appellant has made bare assertions relating to his
         previous ignorance of the need to submit tax  returns  relating  to
         his  large  dividend  income  and  the  conduct  of  his   previous
         accountants. For the reasons given I do not accept his  assertions.
         I find that the respondent  has  discharged  the  legal  burden  of
         proving that the appellant was dishonest in failing  to  lodge  his
         tax returns disclosing his dividend income to HMRC.

     36. Paragraph 322(5) calls for a balancing exercise (see the extract in
         paragraph 9 above). I take into account the length of time that the
         appellant has resided in the UK,  and  the  contribution  that  the
         appellant has made to the UK economy through his payment  of  taxes
         from his employment and from his company's tax liability,  and  the
         agreement he has now reached with HMRC in relation to his  personal
         dividend income. The dishonesty however was of a serious nature and
         was perpetrated in two separate years.  Undertaking  the  balancing
         exercise I find that the appellant's present is undesirable.

     37. This remains a human rights appeal. The appellant does not meet the
         requirements of paragraph 276B(ii), the immigration rule in respect
         of which  his  human  rights  claim  was  made.  In  assessing  the
         proportionality of the respondent's decision I  take  into  account
         the factors in s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
         Act 2002. I take into account that  the  maintenance  of  effective
         immigration controls is in the public interest. I accept  that  the
         appellant is fluent in English and that  he  is  capable  of  being
         financially independent. These are  however  neutral  factors.  The
         appellant has always been lawfully present in the UK. He  has  been
         in this country since December 2005,  over  18  years.  This  is  a
         significant period and the appellant would have  built  up  private
         life relationships. I accept the appellant has made new friends and
         established a social life,  although  there  are  relatively  scant
         details of the nature and extent of his social life.  I  note  that
         the appellant's parents and brother are British citizens and reside
         in this country. I have considered the statements from each of  the
         appellant's parents which are signed and dated 31 March  2017.  The
         appellant claimed in his statement dated 31  March  2017  that  his
         parents could not reside here without him, but no detailed  reasons
         were provided other than general reference to their  emotional  and
         physical health. The statements from the appellant's parents are in
         similar general form and there is little in the way  of  supporting
         evidence relating to their circumstances. There is no  satisfactory
         evidence before  me  that  there  is  anything  beyond  the  normal
         emotional ties between the appellant  and  his  parents.  I  accord
         weight  to  the  private  life  he  has  established  through   his
         employment and his company.

     38. The appellant is married and has a child born in January  2019  but
         neither his wife nor  his  child  is  a  qualifying  partner  or  a
         qualifying child. There is no evidence before me that there are any
         health or other welfare issues relating to his wife and  child.  It
         is in the child's best interests to remain with  both  his  parents
         given her young age, but there is no  suggestion  that  the  family
         unit would be broken  up  as  the  family  could  all  relocate  to
         Pakistan. The appellant maintains in his statements that he has  no
         close friends or family in Pakistan, that it would be difficult for
         him to find a job or establish a business, and he  claimed  in  his
         oral evidence that he can no longer write in Urdu.  I  reject  this
         last assertion. The appellant entered the UK as a  23-year-old.  It
         is simply incredible that he would have forgotten how to  write  in
         his first language, the language that he grew up speaking and spoke
         during the formative years of his life.  The  appellant  is  highly
         educated and has work experience. There is no reason why  he  could
         not look for employment on return to Pakistan, or that the  welfare
         and safety of his wife and child would be in any way jeopardised if
         the family were required to return to Pakistan.

     39. I have weighed up the extent of the appellant's private and  family
         life in this country, the length of his residence,  the  nature  of
         his  ties  to  his  family  and  his  immediate  family's  personal
         circumstances, including the best interests of his child.  Balanced
         against this is the appellant's dishonesty in  seeking  to  gain  a
         significant economic advantage by dishonestly failing to lodge  tax
         returns relating to his dividend  income.  He  is  a  person  whose
         presence in the UK is undesirable due to his conduct. I  find  that
         the public  interest  in  the  appellant's  removal  outweighs  the
         Article 8 considerations I have considered. I consequently  dismiss
         his human rights appeal.
