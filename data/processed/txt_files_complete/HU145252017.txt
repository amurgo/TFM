Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. Matee, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mrs. Z Young, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")
      Judge Caswell promulgated on 11th June 2018.  The underlying decision
      that was the subject of the appeal before FtT was the decision of the
      Entry Clearance Officer dated 11th October 2017, to refuse the
      appellant's application for entry clearance as the partner of a
      British citizen.


   2. In the decision refusing the application for entry clearance, the
      respondent noted that the appellant is unable to satisfy the financial
      requirements set out at paragraphs E-ECP.3.1 to 3.4 of the immigration
      rules. The appellant relied on the income of the sponsor from two
      jobs.  The respondent interviewed the appellant's sponsor, and one of
      the sponsor's employers. Having done so, the respondent referred to
      the answers given, and concluded that the minimum income requirement
      is not met by the appellant. The respondent did not suggest that the
      income relied upon fell below the applicable �18,600 threshold, but
      made the rather different point that on the evidence, the respondent
      was not satisfied that the financial threshold is genuinely met. That
      was because the respondent had doubts as to the genuineness of the
      employment with Yousif Food Ltd trading as Mama Jane's, following a
      consideration of the answers given during interview.  The respondent
      did not claim in the decision that the appellant had failed to provide
      the specified evidence required under Appendix FM-SE of the
      immigration rules.


   3. The appeal was determined by the FtT Judge on the papers.  At
      paragraph [13] of the decision, the FtT Judge states:


         "Looking at the evidence before me, if I take the appellants case
         of that highest, her sponsor earns �6,143.28 gross per year, which
         is well below the financial requirement of �18,600. In addition,
         there is an absence of specified evidence to support the
         application under Appendix FM-SE. There are no bank statements
         showing the wages received by the sponsor."


   4.  In the grounds of appeal, the appellant refers to the fact that the
      sponsor is working for two different companies, and his combined
      income from that employment, exceeds the relevant threshold.  The
      appellant contends that the FtT Judge appears not to have had regard
      to the sponsor's other employment, which did not appear to be in
      issue.


   5. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge Simpson on 13th August
      2018.  The matter comes before me to consider whether the decision of
      the FtT involved the making of a material error of law, and if so, to
      remake the decision.


   6. Before me, Mrs Young confirmed that the appellant claimed from the
      outset that her sponsor is employed by two separate employers.  The
      appellant's sponsor claimed that he was employed by Yousif Food Ltd
      (t/a Mama Jane's) and received an annual income �6143.28 from that
      employment. He also claimed to have an annual income of �15,882.39
      from employment with Web Help UK. That is a combined annual income of
      �22,025.67, and is capable of satisfying the minimum income
      requirement. However the respondent was not satisfied that the
      sponsor's employment with Yousif Food Ltd (t/a Mama Jane's) is
      genuine, and if that income is discounted, the appellant cannot
      satisfy the minimum income requirement.


   7. Mrs Young accepts, rightly in my judgment, that having had the
      opportunity of considering the decision of the FtT Judge, the Judge
      appears to have reached to the conclusion that the minimum income
      requirement could not be meant because the sponsor's earnings were, at
      their highest, �6,143.28 gross per year.  That however fails to take
      into account the undisputed earnings of the appellant's sponsor of
      �15,882.39 from his employment with Web Help UK.  The Judge also
      refers to there being no evidence to support the application under
      Appendix FM-SE, when that did not appear to be in issue.  She
      concedes, rightly in my judgment, that in the circumstances, the
      decision of the FtT cannot stand.  She concedes that the decision of
      the FtT contains a material error of law and should be set aside.


   8. The FtT Judge was not assisted in determining the appeal by the
      respondent's failure to provide a transcript of the interview that was
      relied upon by the respondent to support the claim that the sponsor's
      employment with Yousif Food Ltd (t/a Mama Jane's) is not genuine, and
      the income relied upon from that employment, must therefore be
      discounted.  There was equally an absence of evidence filed by the
      appellant to address the concerns of the respondent and matters relied
      upon by the respondent, in the decision to refuse entry clearance.


   9. Be that as it may, I must consider whether to remit the case to the
      First-tier Tribunal, or to re-make the decision myself.  It seems to
      me that it is entirely appropriate for a copy of the relevant
      interview records to be filed and served by the respondent, and for
      the appellant to have a proper opportunity to address that evidence.
      Mrs Young, helpfully provided a copy of the interview record to the
      appellant's sponsor at the end of the hearing before me.  I have
      decided that it is appropriate to remit this appeal back to the First-
      tier Tribunal, having taken into account paragraph 7.2 of the Senior
      President's Practice Statement of 25th September 2012.  In my view, in
      determining the appeal, the nature and extent of any judicial fact-
      finding necessary will be extensive.


  10. The parties will be advised of the date of the First-tier Tribunal
      hearing in due course.  In readiness for the hearing of the appeal I
      also direct that:


           1. The respondent shall, within 14 days, file with the Tribunal
              and serve upon the appellant, a transcript of the record of
              the interview with the appellant's sponsor, and the sponsors
              employer, that is referred to in the decision to refuse entry
              clearance.
