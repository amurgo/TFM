Officer

Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellant, a citizen of Nepal born on 16 July 1992, as the
    appellant herein.

2.   She applied to join her husband in the United Kingdom on  16  September
    2013.  Her husband is Nepalese and was granted settlement  as  a  minor
    dependant of his father who was a former Gurkha veteran.

3.   The application was refused  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  20
    November 2013 on the ground that the relationship between  the  parties
    was neither genuine nor subsisting and that the parties did not  intend
    to live together permanently in  the  UK.   The  application  was  also
    refused because the sponsor did not meet the financial requirements  of
    the Rules.

4.   The appellant appealed and her appeal came before  a  First-tier  Judge
    on 21 April 2015.  The judge resolved the issue of the parties being in
    a genuine and subsisting relationship in their  favour  and  there  has
    been no challenge to that aspect of the decision.

5.   Having noted that it was conceded that the  appellant  could  not  meet
    the relevant requirements of the Rules the judge continued:

         "34. The Entry Clearance Officer ought to have  considered  Section
             FM 1.0 and exceptional  circumstances.   It  is  stated  under
             Appendix 4 of the Immigration Directorate instructions that:

                  'Where an applicant for entry clearance as a partner fails
                  to meet the requirements of the Rules  under  Appendix  FM
                  and/or Appendix FM-SC the Entry Clearance Officer must  go
                  on  to  consider  whether   there   may   be   exceptional
                  circumstances.  If the Entry Clearance Officer is  of  the
                  view that there may be exceptional circumstances  in  line
                  with his guidance then he must refer  the  application  to
                  RCU.   Consideration  of  exceptional  circumstances  must
                  include consideration of any factors relevant to the  best
                  interest of the child in the UK'.

         35.  The Entry Clearance Officer should have set out clear  reasons
             as to whether a grant of entry clearance outside of the  Rules
             is appropriate taken into account the guidance and exceptional
             circumstances.  It is clear the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
             this decision did  not  and  effectively  refused  the  matter
             without having regard to those issues.

         36.  I have therefore had to have regard to Article 8 and recognise
             that the code of Immigration Rules are  not  a  complete  code
             circumcising consideration of Article 8 [sic].   The  question
             at the first stage  is  whether  the  appellant  has  arguable
             grounds for establishing @8 grounds notwithstanding  the  fact
             that she fails  under  the  rules.   I  find  that  there  are
             arguable grounds following the two stage approach due  to  the
             genuine  and  subsisting   nature   of   the   marriage,   the
             vulnerability and needs of her  husband  in  the  UK  and  the
             impossibility of him leaving the  UK  to  join  her  in  Nepal
             without his parents who are both UK citizens.

         37.  The legal position summarised at paragraph 10  to  35  of  the
             administrative court case of R  (Ganesabalan)  v  SSHD  [2014]
             EWHC 2712 (Admin) that is now confirmed that it  is  necessary
             for a careful proportionality exercise to be conducted even if
             it is considered that an Appellant does not meet the Rules.

         38.  Furthermore Section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
             Asylum Act 2002 states that the Tribunal must have  regard  to
             whether the  Appellant  speaks  English  and  whether  she  is
             financially  independent.   The   Act   also   enshrines   the
             controversial concept that  there  is  a  public  interest  in
             immigration control.

         39.  I therefore go on to consider  the  Article  8  test  and  the
             questions which I must ask myself  under  R  (Razgar)  v  SSHD
             [2004] 2AC 368 per Lord Bingham:

                  '(i) Will the decision be  an  interference  by  a  public
                      authority with the exercise of the appellant's  right
                      to respect for his private or (as the  case  may  be)
                      family life?

                  (ii) If so, will the decision have  consequences  of  such
                      gravity as potentially to  engage  the  operation  of
                      Article 8?

                  (iii)    If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with
                      the law?

                  (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a Democratic
                      society in the interests  of  the  public  policy  of
                      maintaining immigration control?

                  (v)  If so, is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                      legitimate public end sought to be achieved?'

         40.  There is no test of exceptionality in these circumstances  and
             the first  stage  approach  is  to  see  whether  or  not  the
             Appellant could be granted under the Immigration  Rules  which
             on the evidence before me cannot.

         41.  I find that there is an arguable  case  that  the  Appellant's
             circumstances notwithstanding the fact that she fails to  meet
             the Immigration Rules in relation to financial  provision  for
             her in  the  circumstances  are  somewhat  unusual  given  the
             vulnerability of the  Appellant's  spouse  as  a  person  with
             learning disabilities who is effectively unable to work.

         42.  I find that going through the five stage test as  set  out  by
             Lord Bingham therefore having been satisfied  that  there  are
             arguable grounds because of the health and  welfare  needs  of
             the UK Sponsor and  the  fact  that  this  is  a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship.

         43.  I find that there would clearly be a substantial  interest  in
             interference by the immigration authority with the exercise of
             the Appellant's right to respect for her  private  and  family
             life with her husband.  I find that it would be impossible for
             that relationship to continue as a long distance  relationship
             between the United Kingdom and Nepal  and  that  therefore  it
             would effectively have grave consequences of removing the very
             nature of this marriage which simply cannot  be  conducted  by
             the odd visit and by  electronic  means  of  communication  or
             telephone.

         44.  I find that the Respondent's decision could be said to  be  in
             accordance with the law and necessary in a Democratic  society
             for the maintenance of immigration control as a public  policy
             but the key question is whether or not it is proportionate.

         45.  In considering the Appellant's wife lives on her own in  Nepal
             and that this is a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
             UK husband who is suffering  from  learning  disabilities  and
             clearly has the need for her companionship and love.

         46.  He has visited Nepal on three occasions but that simply cannot
             be maintained at this level of regularity given the  cost  and
             distance involved.  The key question here is that  this  is  a
             genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a  person  who  is
             clearly in need with a family history from the UK Sponsor's of
             extensive service for the United  Kingdom  government  as  the
             context in which this decision is taken.

         47.  That is a very background factor but this is a young  man  who
             but for him having suffered from meningitis would  undoubtedly
             have been in a position to provide for the welfare of his wife
             and would have almost  certainly  had  no  problems  with  the
             financial considerations under the Immigration Rules.

         48.  This case does not clearly fall under  the  Immigration  Rules
             and as the Entry Clearance Officer did not address his mind to
             the exceptional circumstances, provision  of  the  Immigration
             Rules he is clearly at a disadvantage again because of that.

         49.  The Appellant and her husband have had to wait  a  significant
             period of time since they first applied for this matter to  be
             heard which is a further exacerbating feature of this case.

         50.  I find that the Appellant's right as a UK citizen to marry the
             person of his choice is a fundamental principle which he  must
             be  able  to  enjoy  in  the  current  circumstances  of   his
             overwhelming need and that of his wife who is the Appellant.

         51.  I find therefore that the balancing act to be conducted  falls
             clearly  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  and  not   with   the
             maintenance of immigration control on the  peculiar  facts  of
             this case.

         52.  I therefore allow this appeal on a  balance  of  probabilities
             under the Immigration Rules as it is clearly  in  my  view  an
             exceptional case but primarily under Article 8 of the ECHR for
             the reasons set out above."

6.   The Entry Clearance Officer appealed on the following grounds:

         "Ground One: Failing to give adequate Reasons  for  Findings  on  a
                       Material Matter

         2.   The rules concerning Specified  Evidence  are  comprehensively
             set out in Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules.

         3.   The Sponsor is in receipt of benefits, but is not exempt  from
             the financial  requirements  as  defined  paragraph  E-ECP.3.3.
             because  his  benefits  are  not   those   specified   by   the
             aforementioned paragraph.   In  order  to  meet  the  financial
             requirements of the Rules the  appellant's  sponsor  needed  to
             demonstrate a gross income of at least �18,600  per  annum,  or
             savings of �62,500.

         4.   The Judge finds that the ECO should have referred the case  to
             the Referred Casework Unit in line with the guidance  cited  at
             [34].  It is submitted that in allowing the  appeal  under  the
             Immigration Rules at [51] that the Judge has taken on the  role
             of primary decision-maker and that the correct course to action
             would have  been  to  remit  the  case  back  to  the  ECO  for
             reconsideration.

         5.   The Judge has also allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds  at
             [51].  It is respectfully submitted that the Tribunal has erred
             in law in its approach to the  Article  8  assessment  in  this
             case.

         6.   Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) establishes that the Article 8
             assessment shall only be carried out when there are  compelling
             circumstances not recognised by these Rules.  In this case  the
             Tribunal did not identify such compelling circumstances and its
             findings are therefore unsustainable.

         7.   Gulshan also makes clear that at this stage an  appeal  should
             only be allowed  where  there  are  exceptional  circumstances.
             Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 Admin endorsed the Secretary  of  State's
             guidance on the meaning of  exceptional  circumstances,  namely
             ones  where  refusal  would  lead  to  an  unjustifiably  harsh
             outcome.  In this case  the  Tribunal  has  not  followed  this
             approach and thereby has erred.  The Judge has  regard  to  the
             Sponsor's learning difficulties caused by  meningitis,  however
             there are no findings that the Sponsor would be unable to enjoy
             family life with  the  Appellant  in  Nepal,  it  is  therefore
             submitted that the outcome would not be unduly harsh.

         8.   It is respectfully submitted that the Tribunal has  failed  to
             provide adequate reasons why the appellant's circumstances  are
             either compelling or exceptional, neither is the outcome unduly
             harsh, or disproportionate.

         9.   It is submitted that the Judge has erred in law, such that the
             decision should be set aside.

         10.  Permission to appeal is respectfully sought, an  oral  hearing
             is requested."

7.   Mr Lee filed a response on 17 August 2015 in which it was  argued  that
    the grounds had  no  merit  either  individually  or  cumulatively  and
    continued:

         "Remittal

         3.   It is submitted that it was open  to  the  Judge  to  consider
             whether there  were  exceptional  circumstances  as  described
             within Appendix 4 of the Immigration Directorate  Instructions
             as this did not about to  an  exercise  of  a  discretion  but
             rather a  factual  and  legal  finding  as  to  whether  there
             existed, in this case,  exceptional  circumstances.   That  is
             different from the exercise of a discretion.

         4.   In those circumstances the principles in  Secretary  of  State
             for the Home Department v Abdi [1996]  Imm  AR  148  and  Ukus
             (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 00307 (IAC) does not
             apply but the broader jurisdiction of the  Tribunal  described
             in KF (removal  directions  and  statelessness  (Iran)  [2005]
             UKIAT 00109, AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1076  and
             AQ (Pakistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 833.

         5.   In any event it is clear that the Judge's  principal  decision
             was to allow the Appellant's appeal under  Article  8  of  the
             ECHR.

         Failure to Follow Gulshan

         6.   The Respondent alleges that the Judge erred in law by  failing
             to follow the 'gateway' test in Gulshan and that therefore his
             Article 8 conclusions  are  'unsustainable'.   As  Aitkens  LJ
             stated in MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 [?129]:

                  'The Nagre case does not add anything to the debate,  save
                  for the statement that if a particular person  is  outside
                  the rule then he has to demonstrate, as a preliminary to a
                  consideration outside the rule, that he  has  an  arguable
                  case that there may be good grounds for granting leave  to
                  remain outside the rules.  I cannot see  much  utility  in
                  imposing  this  further,  intermediary   test.    If   the
                  applicant cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or
                  there is not a further article 8 claim.  That will have to
                  be determined by the relevant decision-maker'.

         7.   In any event it is clear that the Judge did seek  to  identify
             exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances  and  described   a
             legally  sustainable  approach  at   paragraph   36   of   his
             determination and  correctly  cited  R  (Ganesabalan)  v  SSHD
             [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin) as reflective of  the  correct  legal
             approach at paragraph 37.

         Family Life in Nepal

         8.    The  Judge  did  examine  whether  family  life  between  the
             Appellant and her husband could continue in  Nepal.   However,
             he concluded that this  was  impossible  as  the  Sponsor  was
             reliant on his parents  who  cared  for  him  and  who  as  UK
             citizens would remain  here  [?36]  taking  into  account  his
             particular vulnerabilities [?41].

         Compelling and Exceptional Circumstances

         9.   In R (Devindra Sunasse) v SSHD [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin) Edis J
             summarised the leading cases  on  this  point  and  concluded:
             [?36]:

                  'The law is, as I have said, that the  decision  maker  is
                  entitled to decide that Article 8 considerations have been
                  fully addressed in the  Rules  when  dealing  with  ;stage
                  two'.  If they have, it is enough to say  so.   This  will
                  necessarily involve deciding  whether  there  is  a  'gap'
                  between the Rules and Article 8, and  then  whether  there
                  are circumstances in the case  under  consideration  which
                  take it  outside  the  class  of  cases  which  the  Rules
                  properly provide for.   Whether  these  circumstances  are
                  described as 'compelling' or 'exceptional' is not a matter
                  of substance.  They must be  relevant,  weighty,  and  not
                  fully provided for within the Rules.  In practice they are
                  likely to be both compelling and exceptional, but this  is
                  not a legal requirement.'

         10.  It is submitted, as stated above,  that  the  Judge  correctly
             identified a number of factors, not provided for in the Rules,
             including the Sponsor's vulnerabilities, that  could  properly
             be described as relevant and weighty.  In these  circumstances
             there is no error of law in his decision.

8.    Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that  the  judge's  observations  at
    paragraphs 35 to 35 were unclear and did not add or detract weight from
    the determination.  The judge could have remitted it.

9.    However  the  main  aspect  of  the  appeal  was  that  the  financial
    requirements  were  severely   lacking   and   this   was   a   weighty
    consideration.  She referred to SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ  387.   She
    accepted that the decision had been given two days after the judge  had
    signed the determination.  He had found unusual rather than  compelling
    circumstances.

10.  The appellant failed to comply with the financial requirements  of  the
    Rules.  The Rules did provide for those in receipt of  allowances  such
    as severe disablement allowance.

11.  There were issues about whether the sponsor was indeed unable  to  work
    and reference was  made  to  the  bundle  before  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  Section 117B had not been referred to.  This was a  leave  to
    enter case rather than a leave to remain case.  Family  life  could  be
    maintained in Nepal although the sponsor was vulnerable.  If he was not
    working in the United Kingdom he would  not  be  disadvantaged  by  not
    working in Nepal.

12.  Mr Lee relied on his Rule 24 response.  He submitted that there was  no
    error or no material error in what the judge had said at paragraphs  34
    to 35 of the decision and he was not required to  make  a  decision  to
    remit in the circumstances.  Paragraph 36 of the determination  was  in
    effect an analysis of whether there were compelling  grounds.   He  had
    referred to Section 117B in paragraph 38.  He had then gone through the
    steps  in  Razgar  and  had  identified  grave  consequences  for   the
    relationship if  the  refusal  was  maintained  in  paragraph  43.   He
    referred to the extract from Devindra Sunassee at paragraph  9  of  his
    Rule 24 response.  The judge had found the sponsor to be vulnerable and
    the points made by Ms Brocklesby-Weller in argument about  his  ability
    to work had not featured in the pleaded grounds.

13.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was materially
    flawed in law.  As I have said there  has  been  no  challenge  to  the
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal about the relationship between
    the parties.

14.  In relation to the first point based on paragraphs  34  to  35  of  the
    determination as Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted they  neither  add  nor
    detract to the decision.  As Counsel points out  in  his  response  the
    judge allowed the appeal under Article 8 in any event.  Insofar as  the
    judge was in error in criticising the Entry Clearance Officer in  these
    paragraphs I do not find that the error was material.   I  should  also
    mention that Ms Brocklesby-Weller sought to raise an argument based  on
    the sponsor's ability to work but as Counsel points out  this  did  not
    feature in the pleaded grounds.  Further, a  point  was  not  taken  in
    relation to Section 117B and indeed the judge dealt with  Section  117B
    at paragraph 38 of the determination.   In  relation  to  the  argument
    based on Gulshan and Nagre Counsel refers to  paragraph  37  where  the
    judge cites Ganesabalan.  I note that the judge  refers  to  the  legal
    position summarised at paragraphs 10 to 35 of that case where reference
    is made to many of the reported cases including Nagre and MF (Nigeria).
     It was not necessary for the judge to refer to all  of  the  case  law
    which was properly summarised by Michael Fordham QC sitting as a Deputy
    High Court Judge.  As is accepted the judge  signed  the  determination
    very shortly before the case of SS (Congo) was handed down.  I  am  not
    satisfied that the judge failed to give adequate weight to  the  public
    interest to which he makes reference in  paragraph  38  and  indeed  in
    paragraph 43 he refers to the substantial interest in  interference  by
    the immigration authority with the appellant's protected  rights.   The
    judge found the case to be an exceptional one and I  am  not  satisfied
    that the failure to refer to compelling circumstances raises a material
    error on the facts of the case.  As is argued in  paragraph  7  of  the
    response it  is  clear  that  the  judge  did  seek  to  identify  such
    exceptional or compelling circumstances.  While not every  judge  might
    have reached the same conclusion by the same route as this judge did  I
    am not satisfied that the determination is materially flawed in law  on
    the points as pleaded in the grounds settled on  behalf  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.
