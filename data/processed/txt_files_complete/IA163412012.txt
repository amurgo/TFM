                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing  the  appeal  by  the  appellant  against  the  respondent's
    decision of 5 July 2012 refusing his application for further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.
2.   The  appellant  has  not  attended  the  hearing.   His  statement  and
    skeleton argument was received by the Tribunal on 19 July 2013  and  he
    asked for the appeal to be decided on the papers.  He was notified that
    the matter would remain listed for   hearing  so  that  the  respondent
    could  make submissions.  He could attend if he wished but need not  do
    so.  I am satisfied that the proper  course  is  to  proceed  with  the
    hearing in his absence.

Background

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 12 August 1996.   On  19
    June 2010 he was granted leave to enter as a Tier 4  (General)  Student
    until 14 April 2012.  On 13 April 2012 he applied for further leave  to
    remain in the same capacity.  The  respondent  was  satisfied  that  he
    could meet the requirements of Appendix A relating to attributes as the
    CAS submitted was valid but was not satisfied that he was  entitled  to
    the  relevant  number  of  points  under  Appendix   C   dealing   with
    maintenance.  He had sought to rely on a letter of sponsorship from his
    brother but such financial sponsorship was only accepted from a  parent
    or legal guardian.  The appellant was unable to show that  he  had  the
    prescribed sums available in his own bank statements for  the  relevant
    28 day period prior to his application.  The respondent refused to vary
    the appellant's leave and made a removal decision  under  s.47  of  the
    Asylum, Immigration and Nationality Act 2006.

4.   His appeal was heard before the First-tier Tribunal on 24 October  2012
    and allowed to the extent that it was remitted  to  the  respondent  to
    rectify his decision as the decision to refuse  leave  to  remain  also
    included a decision to remove the appellant under s.47.  The respondent
    was granted permission to  appeal  against  this  decision  and  on  11
    December 2012 her appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal to be determined in accordance  with  the  Tribunal
    determination in Adamally and Jaferi  (section  47  removal  decisions:
    Tribunal Procedures) [2012] UKUT 00414  which  held  that  the  correct
    approach was to determine the variation appeal even though  the  appeal
    should be allowed against the removal decision on the basis that it was
    not in accordance with the law.

5.   The appeal was duly listed for re-hearing on 11 February 2013.  At  [6]
    the judge set out that it had been  clarified  at  the  outset  of  the
    hearing that the only two issues in the  appeal  before  him  were  the
    question of funds and article 8, the matter having already been to  the
    Upper Tribunal on the s.47 issue.  The appellant  was  unable  to  show
    that he was in possession of ï¿½1,600 for a  consecutive  28  day  period
    [21] and the judge went  on  to  consider  the  issue  of  whether  the
    appellant's older brother could be regarded as his legal guardian.   He
    recorded that during the course of closing submissions the  appellant's
    representative conceded that there was no  legal  guardianship  in  any
    formal sense [22] and in these circumstances the judge found  that  the
    respondent was right to refuse the application  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. The judge went on to consider in [27]-[32] whether  there  would
    be a breach of article 8  by  requiring  the  appellant  to  return  to
    Pakistan but found that there would not be.

The Grounds and Submissions

6.   In his grounds  of  appeal  the  appellant  sought  to  challenge  this
    decision and argued that he had always pleaded and considered that  his
    brother had been his legal guardian.  It was also argued that the judge
    had not properly decided the issue of the two notices, the  refusal  of
    further leave to remain and the removal decision,  being  made  on  the
    same occasion and generally that the appellant should not  be  deprived
    of his rights under law.

7.   Permission to appeal was granted for the following reasons:

         "The appellant appealed a decision to refuse him leave to remain as
         a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  First-tier Tribunal Judge J  R
         Jones dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  because  he
         was not  satisfied  the  appellant  scored  sufficient  points  for
         Maintenance (funds) under Appendix C of HC 395.  This  was  because
         the appellant could not rely upon funds from his  brother  who  was
         not his legal guardian.  Further the appellant could not rely  upon
         the funds from the family business as there was no evidence  as  to
         what access the appellant had to such funds.  These were  decisions
         open to  the  judge  on  the  evidence  before  him  and  which  he
         adequately explained.  They did not contain an  arguable  error  of
         law.


         It was conceded on behalf of the appellant at the hearing that  his
         brother was not his legal guardian.


         The respondent also decided  to  remove  the  appellant  under  the
         provisions of s.47 Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.
         The judge made no finding that this decision was not in  accordance
         with the law.  This is an arguable error of law.  Leave  to  appeal
         is granted on this ground only."


8.   In her response to the grounds the respondent  indicated  that  it  was
    conceded that the appeal against the removal decision should be allowed
    on the basis it was not in accordance with the law.  The appellant  has
    submitted a statement and a skeleton argument in support of his  appeal
    accompanied by a letter asking for the appeal to be dealt with  on  the
    papers on the basis of  the  evidence  already  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

9.   His submissions deal not only with the issue of  s.47  but  they  argue
    that the appeal should have been allowed as a whole in the light of the
    fact that the removal decision was unlawful.  They  also  raise  issues
    about circumstances in which his older brother has been supporting him.
     Their father died in 1996 and since then his older brother  has  taken
    over the running of the family business in which the appellant also has
    an interest.  He describes his older brother as his legal guardian  and
    custodian of the inherited/joint business of their father.

10.  However, permission to appeal was only granted on the s.47 issue and  I
    am not satisfied that the appellant's statement and  skeleton  argument
    provide any proper basis for me to re-open the other grounds of appeal.



11.  It is clear in the light of the Tribunal determination in Adamally  and
    Jaferi which has been upheld by the Court of  Appeal  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v Ahmadi [2013] EWCA  Civ  512  that  the
    fact that the removal decision is unlawful does not make the  variation
    decision unlawful and that the  First-tier  Tribunal  should  determine
    that appeal on its  merits  whilst  allowing  the  appeal  against  the
    removal decision.  The judge was clearly aware that the  appeal  should
    have been allowed on that basis and I suspect that the only  reason  he
    did not do so was because he wrongly assumed that the decision had been
    allowed to that extent by the Upper Tribunal.

12.  I am satisfied that the judge erred in law.  I set aside  his  decision
    in respect of the removal decision and substitute a  decision  allowing
    the appeal on the basis that the removal decision was not in accordance
    with the law.  That decision remains to be made by the respondent.   At
    the hearing before me Ms Everett  was  provided  with  a  copy  of  the
    appellant's  statement  and  skeleton  argument   and   doubtless   the
    respondent will take those into account when  making  the  decision  on
    removal but in any event it is  open  to  the  appellant  to  make  any
    further representations to the respondent on that issue.

Decision


13.  The First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  respect  of  the  removal
    decision I set aside that decision and re-make it allowing  the  appeal
    against the decision to remove the appellant on the basis that  it  was
    not in accordance with the law.
