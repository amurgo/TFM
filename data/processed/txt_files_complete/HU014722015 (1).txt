Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr R Singer, counsel, instructed by Paul John & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of South Africa, born on 10 December 1975.
      Her appeal against the respondent's decision dated  18  June  2015  to
      refuse to grant her leave  to  remain  on  human  rights  grounds  was
      dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal in a decision promulgated  on  27
      October 2016.


   2. The appellant appeals with permission from First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Saffer who found that it was arguable that the Judge materially  erred
      '...in making an assumption as to the appellant's  husband  not  being
      entitled  to  British  nationality'.  Although  the  Judge  cannot  be
      criticised for not considering documentary evidence not placed  before
      her, she made an assumption  on  oral  evidence  that  was  manifestly
      wrong.   This  fact  alters  the  legal  matrix  that  needed  to   be
      considered.


The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal


   3. The background to the appeal was summarised by the  First-tier  Judge.
      The appellant entered the UK in April 2002 as a visitor. She submitted
      an application for a student visa which was  refused  as  no  fee  was
      paid. In March 2004 she submitted a further application for a  student
      visa which was granted until 28 February 2005.


   4. Subsequent applications to extend her student visa were refused. On 12
      January 2012 she submitted an application for leave to remain  outside
      the Rules on compassionate grounds. There was no right of  appeal.  On
      17 February 2014  she  was  served  with  an  IS  151A  notice  as  an
      overstayer.


   5. An application for leave to remain under the family and  private  life
      ten year route was refused, as well as certified on 10 March 2015.


   6. Her subsequent application for leave to remain made on 8  April  2015,
      and which was the subject matter of the appeal, was refused on 8  June
      2015.


   7. The appellant stated before the First-tier Tribunal that she  met  her
      partner, Mr Moyo, in June 2012. He was enlisted in the  British  Army.
      They started a relationship and began living together as a couple that
      same year. She moved in to his home in London, SE18.


   8. Her partner has been in the Army since 2011 and on account of his work
      cannot relocate to South Africa.


   9. The flat where they live was purchased in both names. She  received  a
      single adult occupancy discount in respect of her council tax bill for
      2014/2015 as she lived alone whilst her partner was abroad on  a  tour
      of duty.


  10. The appellant said that she has lived in the UK for 14 years  and  has
      no family left in South Africa.


  11. Her partner, Mr Moyo, also attended the hearing and gave evidence.  He
      confirmed their relationship. The Judge  noted  that  he  adopted  his
      witness statement - [21].


  12. Mr Moyo stated that he had been enlisted in the Army in  2011  for  22
      years. He expected to make the British Army his  lifetime  career.  If
      the appellant were returned to South Africa he would not  be  able  to
      leave his job in the army to go with her and if he remains in the army
      they will only allow him a limited time to spend with her there.


  13. In her "consideration and findings" the Judge referred to Appendix  FM
      of the Immigration Rules. This would only allow the  appellant  to  be
      considered on the basis of her family life  if  she  were  seeking  to
      enter or remain in the UK on the basis  of  her  family  life  with  a
      person who is a British citizen, settled here or with limited leave as
      a refugee or a person granted humanitarian protection.


  14. She stated at paragraph [30] that Mr  Moyo  is  a  national  of  South
      Africa and when he enlisted in the British Army in 2011 he would  have
      been granted leave to remain  which  would  continue  as  long  as  he
      remained enlisted. She "believed" that after five years he would  have
      the right to apply for naturalisation. As at  today's  date,  Mr  Moyo
      remained a South African national with limited leave to remain in  the
      UK.


  15. In the light of his immigration  status,  the  Judge  found  that  the
      appellant did not have a relationship with a person who is  a  British
      citizen, settled in the UK or with limited leave as  a  refugee  or  a
      person granted  humanitarian  protection.  Accordingly  the  appellant
      could not succeed under the Immigration Rules in relation to  a  claim
      to family life [31].


  16. She also  found  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the  relationship
      requirements as Mr Moyo does not meet the  definition  of  a  partner.
      Neither she nor Mr Moyo were consistent about the dates  they  started
      living together. She therefore placed no weight on their oral evidence
      regarding their claim of having lived together  for  two  years.  They
      therefore cannot meet the relationship requirements of FM - [34].


  17. The Judge referred to paragraph 276ADE of  the  Rules.  She  concluded
      that the appellant would find little difficulty in  re-integrating  in
      South  Africa.  She  could  not  meet  the  requirements  under   that
      paragraph.


  18. She also considered the appellant's Article 8 rights under  the  Human
      Rights Convention - [41]. She was prepared to accept that they are  in
      a subsisting relationship [46]. There is  family  life  between  them.
      This would be interfered with if she were required to leave the UK.


  19. She considered whether the respondent's  decision  was  proportionate.
      She referred to s.117B of the 2002 Act. The appellant and her  partner
      entered into the relationship at a time when she was  here  illegally.
      In the circumstances she gave little weight to the  relationship.  She
      accepted that the partner is in the British Army and has been enlisted
      for 22 years. That meant that he cannot leave the UK  at  will.  Those
      factors have to be balanced against the fact that  when  they  started
      the relationship they both knew of her immigration status and that she
      was an overstayer.


  20. Even though she accepted that it may not be reasonable  to  expect  Mr
      Moyo to return to South Africa now, she did not find that it would  be
      disproportionate  for  the  appellant  to  return  there  to  make  an
      application for entry clearance. Separation is likely to be for a  few
      months and by the time she is missed she will be back in the UK. There
      will therefore be no severance of their family life which  they  could
      continue during the brief separation by  letter,  telephone,  internet
      contact and even a short visit [54].


  21. She had regard to the decision of R (on the  application  of  Chen)  v
      SSHD   (Appendix   FM   -   Chikwamba   -   temporary   separation   -
      proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 001 in which the Tribunal  held  that
      it would be for the individual to provide evidence that such temporary
      separation  will  interfere  disproportionately  with  the   protected
      rights. She found that the appellant provided no  such  evidence  that
      her return would be for a short period.


  22. With regard to her private life with her  friends,  she  can  keep  in
      touch through emails and telephone calls.


  23. In the circumstances, the Judge found that the appellant had failed to
      produce sufficient evidence that there  are  compelling  circumstances
      rendering her removal disproportionate [55-57].


      The appeal


  24. In  her  grounds  of  appeal  the  appellant  stated  that  the  Judge
      "blatantly failed" to recognise and accept that her partner, Mr  Moyo,
      is a British citizen. The decision  was  therefore  made  on  a  false
      assumption.


  25. Mr Singer,  who  did  not  represent  the  appellant  at  the  hearing
      submitted that there had been a fundamental error of law.  As  at  the
      date of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on 11 October 2016,  Mr
      Mayo was in fact a British citizen. A copy  of  his  British  passport
      confirming that he is a British citizen was issued to him  on  2  June
      2015.


  26. Moreover, Mr Moyo expressly stated in his witness statement before the
      First-tier Tribunal at page 5 of the appellant's bundle that he  is  a
      British national.


  27. Accordingly, it was not correct that his passport had  only  now  been
      produced, identifying that he became a British national  in  2011.  It
      was not correct that evidence of his British citizenship had not  been
      placed before the Judge.


  28. In the circumstances the Judge failed to give anxious scrutiny to  the
      evidence. He submitted that as at the date of hearing, they had  lived
      together for two years. Moreover,  her  partner  is  British.  In  the
      circumstances there are compelling circumstances. If Appendix  FM  was
      now considered she would most likely succeed in an application.


  29. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Norton submitted  that  the  appellant
      made her application on 8 April 2015.  Mr  Mayo's  passport  was  only
      issued in June 2015. Moreover, the Judge also considered the appeal on
      an alternative basis [32]. She found that they  had  not  been  living
      together in a  relationship  akin  to  marriage  for  two  years.  The
      respondent had not accepted that he met the definition of  partner  as
      defined in GEN.1.2 - reasons for refusal paragraph 12.


  30. The Judge did consider whether  there  were  compelling  circumstances
      rendering her removal disproportionate [57]. She took into account the
      Article 8 rights of Mr Moyo. She also accepted that he is enlisted and
      cannot just leave the UK at will. Those factors were balanced  against
      the fact that when the relationship commenced they were aware  of  the
      appellant's immigration status as an overstayer [53].


  31. The Judge was prepared to accept that it  may  not  be  reasonable  to
      expect her partner to return to South Africa now.  However,  it  would
      not be disproportionate for her to return to make an  application  for
      entry clearance.


  32. Mr Norton submitted that in the circumstances, any  error  made  would
      not have been material. The Judge was entitled to find that there were
      no compelling circumstances in the appellant's case.


  33. Mr Norton accepted that Mr Moyo produced his P60 for the tax year to 5
      April 2014 showing that he earned  a  total  of  �21,543.77.  However,
      having regard to the poor immigration history of  the  appellant,  the
      temporary separation envisaged was not disproportionate.


  34. In reply Mr Singer submitted that the appellant  does  currently  meet
      the Rules. Accordingly there are compelling circumstances outside  the
      Rules.


  35. He submitted that the appeal should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal for a fresh decision to be made.


      Assessment


  36. In addition to the submissions at the hearing, I have  had  regard  to
      the skeleton argument before the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  which  the
      appellant contended that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  which
      existed under EX.1.


  37. At paragraph 12 of the skeleton, counsel who represented the appellant
      submitted  that  this  was  not  a  case  like  Chen,   supra,   where
      "nationality is the only factor being pointed to by the claimant."


  38. The Judge was referred to the decision in Mirza  (AP)  v  SSHD  [2015]
      Scot CS  28.  The  Court  made  observations  regarding  the  test  of
      insurmountable obstacles - EX.1. The court held that it is clear  that
      the author of the November letter proceeded entirely on the basis that
      the petitioner's wife should go with him to  live  in  Pakistan.  That
      approach ignores the fact of the  partner's  British  citizenship.  It
      failed to consider the refusal of leave may result in  the  indefinite
      separation of the married couple and whether such  separation  can  be
      justified as a proportionate interference with their fundamental right
      to cohabit as a married couple.


  39. The Court held that a disproportionate decision  or  measure  in  this
      field  is  not  to  be  equiperated   with   the   existence   of   an
      "insurmountable obstacle." That is a phrase that has been used by  the
      European Court of Human Rights as indicating a factor which  might  be
      taken into account in judging whether a decision is disproportionate.


  40. Mr Mayo produced a witness statement at the hearing where he stated at
      its outset that he  is  a  British  national.  He  further  stated  at
      paragraph 15 of his statement that he  did  not  relish  the  idea  of
      leaving a country  of  which  he  is  a  citizen.  He  will  lose  his
      privileges as a citizen. He contended that there  were  insurmountable
      obstacles.


  41. That evidence was not challenged. Indeed, at paragraph 4 on page 1  of
      the reasons for refusal, the respondent herself refers to Mr Moyo  now
      being a British citizen.


  42. I find that the Judge's findings at paragraphs [29] to [30] where  she
      incorrectly assumed that he did not have British citizenship,  amounts
      to an error on a point of law.


  43. I do not find that it is inevitable that the same decision would  have
      been reached had the Judge properly taken into account the fact of  Mr
      Moyo's British citizenship as at the date of application.  During  his
      submissions, Mr Singer submitted that this is an appropriate  case  to
      be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  decision  to  be
      made. Mr Norton did not contend otherwise. I find,  having  regard  to
      the Senior President's Guidelines in this respect,  that  this  is  an
      appropriate case to  be  remitted.  There  will  be  substantial  fact
      finding involved.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law. I set aside the decision and remit  the  appeal  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Hatton Cross) for a fresh  decision  to  be  made
      before another Judge.


      No anonymity direction is made.
