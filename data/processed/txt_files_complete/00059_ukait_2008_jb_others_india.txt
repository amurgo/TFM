In determining whether the  overage  children  of  former  British  Overseas
citizens, who were not able to settle  in  the  UK  while  they  were  still
minors, now have an entitlement under Article 8 to  join  their  parents  in
this country, the criterion is not the "historical wrong" which was done  to
British Overseas citizens and their families in the past.  That is  part  of
the context in which the proportionality of exclusion must be  assessed,  if
the "ultimate  question"  of  Huang  is  reached.   But  first  it  must  be
established whether there is family life, for the  purposes  of  Article  8,
between the parents here and  their  adult  children  abroad,  and,  if  so,
whether the refusal of entry clearance for the latter interferes  with  that
family life sufficiently seriously to engage the  operation  of  Article  8.
Those questions must be answered without reference to the injustices of  the
past.





                                DETERMINATION


1.  This is the reconsideration  of  conjoined  appeals  by  three  siblings
(Jagruti, Gautam and  Bhavna  Veja  Bapodara),  residents  of  Porbandar  in
Gujerat and citizens of India, against  the  respondent's  refusal  on  27th
June 2007 to issue them with entry clearance for settlement  in  the  United
Kingdom with  their  mother,  Savitaben  Rama  Jivabhai  (n�e  Odedra,  'the
sponsor').  The appeals were allowed on Article 8 grounds by an  immigration
judge, Mr A.J. Parker, after a hearing at Nottingham on 27th February  2008,
but on behalf of the respondent an application was made for a review.   This
was granted, and on 16th May 2008 the 'first stage' of  the  reconsideration
came before Senior Immigration Judge Freeman, who held that there  had  been
a material error in the judge's determination, and adjourned the matter  for
a 'second stage' hearing at which the  sponsor  could  give  oral  evidence.
The case is rather a complex one, and as there is no major  factual  dispute
between the parties, we think it will assist comprehension if  we  set  down
the facts, as we understand them, in chronological order.

The Special Quota Voucher Scheme
2.  The sponsor was born in July 1954 in Mombasa.  Her  family  hailed  from
Gujarat, and like many another Asian family in the years after Kenya  became
independent  in  1963,  they  found  life  in  that   country   increasingly
difficult.  The East African Asians largely retained  their  citizenship  of
the United Kingdom and Colonies, and many took up residence  in  the  United
Kingdom,  particularly  in   Leicester.    Alarmed   at   this   large-scale
immigration  (not  so  large,  perhaps,  compared  with  recent   examples),
Parliament hastily passed the Commonwealth Immigrants  Act  in  1968,  which
limited the right of abode in the United Kingdom to British  nationals  with
'patrial'  status.   The  non-patrial  'CUKCs'  from   East   Africa   would
henceforth only be allowed to settle in the  United  Kingdom  if  they  were
lucky enough to be included within an  annual  quota.   Heads  of  household
wishing to come here with their families had to  apply  for  'Special  Quota
Vouchers', and for many years the number of  applications  greatly  exceeded
the number of vouchers available annually, which was 5,000.

3.  Most of the sponsor's relatives have in fact  ended  up  in  the  United
Kingdom.  She has four brothers and a sister settled  here,  as  well  as  a
large extended family.  She herself, however,  married  an  Indian  citizen,
Vejabhai Arsi Bapodara, in 1972, and settled with him in  India.   They  had
four children : Jagruti, born in July 1973; Gautam, born  in  October  1975;
Bhavna, born in August 1982;  and  Bharti,  born  in  April  1986.   On  7th
December 1992, however, the sponsor applied for  a  Special  Quota  Voucher.
In fact, she made three applications, all of them  unsuccessful.   According
to correspondence which has been shown to  us,  the  first  application  was
refused on 4th March 1993  because,  although  the  sponsor  was  a  British
Overseas citizen (a status created by the British Nationality  Act  1981  to
replace non-patrial citizenship  of  the  UK  and  Colonies),  she  was  not
eligible for a Special Quota Voucher.  She was said not to be  the  head  of
her household, this being Vejabhai Arsi Bapodara.  The sponsor averred  that
she was indeed the head of her household, having secured a  divorce  on  8th
April 1992.  The Visa Officer, however,  regarded  this  as  a  "divorce  of
convenience", designed to "secure emigration to the United Kingdom."

4.  Another application was made in December 1993, but was  refused  because
Vejabhai Arsi Bapodara was still regarded as  the  head  of  the  household.
After  the  third  unsuccessful  application,  the  sponsor's  relatives  in
Leicester approached the local MP, Mr Keith Vaz,  who  made  representations
to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.  These were met by a  letter  of  12th
June 1995 from the Migration & Visa Correspondence Unit, which alleged  that
the sponsor had "practised deception" by going through  a  form  of  divorce
which was "initiated solely to gain entry to the United Kingdom."

The divorce
5.  It does not appear that this matter  was  taken  any  further.   At  the
hearing before us, Mr Ahmed handed  up  the  Decree  of  Divorce  which  was
issued by an Assistant Judge at the town of Porbandar  on  8th  April  1992.
The most significant features of it are as follows.  The  husband,  Vejabhai
Arsi  Bapod[a]ra,  and  the  wife,  Savitaben  Ram[a]  Odedra,   are   joint
petitioners, having been separated for four  years  because  of  matrimonial
difficulties.  The sponsor is appointed guardian, and given custody, of  the
four children, and is given permission to take them  with  her  to  the  UK.
The judge has some unkind things to say about  the  sponsor's  husband.   He
"has not cared to look after the maintenance  and  education  of  the  minor
children"  and  is  even  "negligent  towards  development  of   the   minor
children."  Besides, "progress of the minor  children  would  be  better  at
U.K. than village Bapodar", where their  father  resides.   The  judge  even
foresees that if their father  remarries,  "step-mother  would  give  mental
torture  to  the  step-children  and  growth  of  minor  children  would  be
stopped."

British citizenship
6.  The sponsor continued to live with the four children in  the  taluka  of
Porbandar until she came to the United Kingdom as a visitor  in  July  2001.
She did not just stay for a visit, however,  but  stayed  on  in  the  hope,
apparently, of getting indefinite leave to remain.   As  we  understand  it,
the Home Office did not really know what to do with 'BOCs' who came  to  the
United Kingdom ostensibly  for  a  temporary  purpose  and  wished  to  stay
permanently.  Although they were subject to immigration control,  they  were
British nationals, and it was unpalatable to deport them to a country  where
they had been residing, but of which they were not citizens.  It would  seem
that, if the sponsor did make an application for ILR - and  at  the  hearing
before us, she did not think that she did  -  it  was  never  decided.   Any
application was overtaken by the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
2002, which amended the British Nationality  Act  1981  so  that  from  30th
April 2003 British Overseas citizens would be entitled to register  as  full
British citizens, provided  they  had  no  other  nationality  and  had  not
renounced another  nationality  after  4th  July  2002.   The  sponsor  duly
registered  as  a  British  citizen,  and  in  August  2003  she   commenced
employment with D.R. Garments Ltd in Leicester.   (If  we  assume  that  the
sponsor made an in-time application to vary her leave, that would  have  had
the effect of continuing her leave  as  a  visitor  until  such  time  as  a
decision was made.  The conditions attached to that leave, which included  a
prohibition on working, would also have continued.  Not until she  became  a
British citizen would the sponsor have been  able  to  work  lawfully.   The
same would be true, of course, if the sponsor's leave to  enter  had  simply
lapsed, and she became an overstayer.)

Entry clearance
7.  In October 2003 the sponsor obtained a  British  passport,  and  shortly
afterwards her  four  children  (at  that  time  aged  30,  28,  21  and  17
respectively) applied for entry clearance to join her as dependants.   Their
applications were refused on 18th February  2004,  and  their  appeals  came
before an adjudicator,  Miss  Moira  Dawson,  on  20th  January  2005.   The
determination in the case of the oldest child, Jagruti, was handed up to  us
by Mr Walker, who felt (rightly) that it  should  have  been  drawn  to  the
Tribunal's  attention  before  today.   The  adjudicator  records  what  the
appellants told the ECO, namely that they had not seen or  had  any  contact
with their father since the divorce, although their paternal  uncle  visited
them about once a month.  They were  living  in  a  one-roomed  house,  with
running water and electricity, rented from a Mr  Lakhabhai  Odedra.   Gautam
was earning around Rs 2,000/- per month as a farm  labourer,  while  Jagruti
was earning Rs 300-500 per  month  as  a  domestic  servant.   The  sponsor,
however, was said to be sending the children Rs 7,000/- every month (and  in
evidence before the adjudicator, postal  order  counterfoils  were  produced
showing monthly payments of �100 in October, November and December 2003).

8.  In her oral evidence, the sponsor told  the  adjudicator  that  she  had
been the sole breadwinner before she left India, and that she supported  the
household on an income of Rs 2,000/- per month.  From this, the  adjudicator
made the following calculation.  Rs 2,000/- had been enough for a  household
of five to live on, whereas now Gautam  and  Jagruti  were  earning  between
them Rs 2,300-2,500/- a month.  The household  had  now  been  reduced  from
five to four persons.  It followed that enough income  was  being  generated
to maintain the four children, and that they did not need  the  extra  money
being sent by the sponsor in order to survive.  This meant  that  they  were
not "mainly dependent financially" on the sponsor, never mind "living  alone
in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances",  both  of  which  were
required in order to satisfy paragraph 317(i)(f) of the Immigration Rules.

9.  Those requirements  would  not  have  applied  to  the  youngest  child,
Bharti, who was under 18 when she sought entry clearance.  Indeed,  she  was
subsequently admitted for settlement, and  now  lives  with  her  mother  in
Leicester.  The three older children had their  appeals  dismissed,  but  in
May 2006 they applied again, only to be  refused  a  second  time.   Appeals
were lodged, but appear to have been abandoned or withdrawn.   In  May  2007
the applications were made which are the subject  of  the  present  appeals.
By this time the 'reported' case of NH (female BOCs, exceptionality, Art  8,
para 317) India [2006] UKAIT 85 had entered the public domain, and no  doubt
gave the appellants' advisers cause for thinking  that  it  would  be  worth
having another try.  Certainly, the case has loomed large in  the  arguments
before us, and we shall summarize the main features of it now.

NH
10.  The appellant in that case, Navin Halai,  was  aged  18  years  and  10
months when he applied in March 2004 for entry clearance.  In September  the
previous year his mother had registered in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  full
British citizen, having previously been a British Overseas  citizen.   Being
now present and settled in the UK, she was able to 'call'  her  husband  and
son, both Indian nationals, to join her.  The husband eventually  got  entry
clearance, but the son did not, and his appeal was dismissed under rule  317
of HC 395  because  he  was  not  "living  alone  in  the  most  exceptional
compassionate circumstances."  The adjudicator allowed the appeal,  however,
under Article 8, and on reconsideration a  Presidential  panel  upheld  that
decision, noting in particular two "exceptional"  features  (this  was  when
Huang at the Court of Appeal still held  sway).   The  first  was  that  the
appellant was just over 18 when he applied, which made it very difficult  to
succeed under the Rules even  though  he  was  a  student  and  still  fully
dependent, whereas under the Special Quota Voucher Scheme,  which  had  been
abolished in March 2002, the dependent  children  of  voucher  holders  were
admissible up to the age of 25.  The age limit of 25 had also  been  set  in
another Home Office policy, allowing overage children  to  be  admitted  who
had been refused as minors because of the mistaken  belief  that  they  were
not related as claimed.

11.  The second feature  highlighted  by  the  Tribunal  was  the  "historic
discrimination" suffered by Navin Halai's mother.  She had been deprived  of
a right of abode by legislation which  was  racially  discriminatory  -  "an
historical wrong" which  was  acknowledged  by  the  Home  Secretary,  David
Blunkett, during the passage of the 2002 Act - and  she  had  then  suffered
discrimination on account of her sex, since married women  could  not  apply
for Special Vouchers unless their husbands were  incapacitated.   The  panel
regarded this history and context as "of the  utmost  relevance."   All  the
requirements of rule 317, including maintenance and accommodation, had  been
met, save for  "the  most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances."   But
although  there  was  no  question  of   "attempting   to   enforce   rights
retrospectively", the circumstances in which the appellant had  been  unable
to settle here with his mother while he was still under  18  made  the  case
"truly exceptional."

The instant appeals
12.  The three appellants in the present case were each interviewed  at  the
Deputy High Commission on 27th June 2007.  Jagruti said that she  had  never
worked, and despite trying to obtain employment  as  a  domestic,  had  been
unable  to  get  any.   The  sponsor  sent  money,  however,  through  their
landlord, Lakhabhai Odedra.  Gautam said that he  only  did  odd  jobs,  and
would only work eight or ten times a month.  Bhavna said that  she  did  not
work at all, adding that the sponsor would call them on the  telephone  once
a week.  The children's Visa Application Forms indicated  that  the  sponsor
rented a three-bedroom property in  Leicester  which  she  shared  with  her
youngest daughter, Bharti, and that she  had  �6,200  in  her  account  with
Barclays  Bank.   Supporting  documentation  included  the  counterfoils  of
postal orders sent by the sponsor to Jagruti in April, May, June,  September
and December 2004; a cheque for �800 made out to  Jagruti  on  31st  January
2006; and a postal order for �50 made out to Jagruti on 14th June 2006.

13.  The applications were refused under rule 317(i)(f)  and  under  Article
8, and when the appeals were listed for 27th February  2008  an  Appellants'
Bundle was prepared, which includes a statement from the sponsor.  In  this,
she says that she earns about �210  per  week  net  as  a  packer  for  D.R.
Garments and now has �8,405 in Barclays Bank (figures which  are  borne  out
by wage slips and bank statements).  She pays �300  a  month  in  rent,  and
sends �150 a month to the appellants.  There are three assertions,  however,
made  at  paragraphs  7  and  29  of  the  statement,  which  appear  to  be
inaccurate.  The sponsor says that she got married in 1968.  She would  only
have been 14 at the time, and this is contradicted by  the  Divorce  Decree,
which states that she had been married  for  19  years  before  the  divorce
petition was filed in  1991.   Secondly,  the  sponsor  says  that  she  was
divorced in 1990, whereas the decree was issued  in  April  1992.   Thirdly,
the sponsor says that there were three children of the  marriage,  and  that
she is living alone in a three-bedroom house, providing ample space for  the
three appellants.  Bharti has thus been 'airbrushed out of the picture'.

14.   The  documents  provided  in  the  Appellants'  Bundle  include   more
counterfoils and receipts for the postal  orders  sent  in  2004  than  were
provided to the ECO.  In May, June,  July,  August,  October,  November  and
December of that year, postal orders for amounts varying  between  �100  and
�150 were sent to Jagruti.  Much larger sums were sent to  Gautam  via  Euro
Exchange in May and August 2007 : �1,809 followed by �1,208.

15.  Despite this, Immigration Judge Parker did not believe that  sufficient
evidence  had  been  produced  to  show  that  the  appellants  were  mainly
dependent on the sponsor.  He found it "quite surprising that  there  is  no
history of  them  working"  (he  did  not  have  before  him  Miss  Dawson's
determination, which does record a history of working).  In  any  event,  he
held that the appellants were not  living  alone  in  the  most  exceptional
compassionate circumstances, and thus could not succeed under the Rules.

Navin Halai
16.  Turning to Article 8, the judge was puzzled by the discrepancy  between
the sponsor's statement that she was divorced in 1990, and letters from  the
Deputy High Commission referring to Vejabhai Arsi Bapodra  as  head  of  the
household (the judge was not shown the Divorce  Decree  or  the  letters  in
which "a divorce of convenience" was alleged).  He assumed that the  divorce
must have taken place later than 1993.  At all events,  the  judge  observed
that if the sponsor had been eligible for a Special Quota Voucher  in  1993,
the appellants would all have been well under 25  years  of  age  and  would
have qualified for admission as dependent children.  He  quoted  extensively
from Navin Halai's case, which had now been to the Court of Appeal  and  had
the  neutral  citation  number  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1330.   In  the   leading
judgement, Sedley LJ held that the factors which the Presidential  panel  of
the AIT had thought exceptional were just as apt  to  make  the  refusal  of
entry clearance simply disproportionate.  At paragraph 37, he said this :


      "the historical and moral dimensions of the laws which took  away  and
      then, following some remedial acts of  executive  discretion,  finally
      restored to Mr Halai's family a right of a most fundamental kind - the
      right to  belong  -  were  exceptionally,  perhaps  even  uniquely,  a
      legitimate part of the  picture  which  the  AIT  formed  in  deciding
      whether the exclusion of Mr Halai was consistent with art. 8(2).  They
      were entitled to conclude that it was not, and in particular that, but
      for a historic injustice which was now acknowledged, the mother  would
      have been able as of right to bring her youngest  son  here  with  her
      years ago."

17.  Lord Justice Pill, noting that the appellant was not much over 18  when
he applied for entry clearance, and was fully dependent on his sponsor,  who
could accommodate and maintain him adequately in the United Kingdom,  agreed
with the Presidential panel that the history and context of the case,  which
included  the  "historical  wrong"  done  to  British   Overseas   citizens,
particularly females, was "of the utmost relevance."  The appeal  lodged  on
behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer was dismissed.

First-instance decision
18.  Immigration Judge Parker found the present case very similar to  Halai.
 Although Navin Halai was considerably younger when  he  applied  for  entry
clearance, the judge did  not  believe  that  the  appellants'  age  was  "a
determining  factor."   The   appellants,   while   not   mainly   dependent
financially on the sponsor, were still "clearly dependent  on  their  mother
to some extent", and strong family ties existed between  them.   The  appeal
was allowed under Article 8, but this outcome was challenged  on  the  basis
primarily that  the  Court  of  Appeal  judgments  in  Halai  had  not  been
mentioned during the proceedings before the judge,  who  should  have  given
the parties an opportunity to make submissions on the case if he  was  going
to rely on it.  A review was also sought on the basis  that  the  judge  had
made contradictory findings on dependency, which  he  had  not  analysed  in
accordance with Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31, and  had  made  an  unwarranted
assumption about when the sponsor had obtained a divorce.

Error of law
19.   Reconsideration  was  ordered  principally  on  the  point  about   no
opportunity having been given to distinguish Halai.  At  the  'first  stage'
of the reconsideration, on the other hand, Senior Immigration Judge  Freeman
held that the judge had materially erred in assuming that  the  sponsor  was
not divorced when she applied for a Special Quota Voucher, and in  regarding
the age of the appellants as not "a  determining  factor",  if  by  that  he
meant that it was not a factor which  would  help  him  in  determining  the
case.

Scope of review
20.  The senior immigration judge did not specify on the 'pink  sheet'  what
precisely the scope of the 'second stage'  reconsideration  should  be,  and
when the matter came before us the  representatives  addressed  us  on  this
first.  In his latest skeleton argument, Mr Ahmed had  attempted  to  revive
the appeal in respect of paragraph 317 of  the  Immigration  Rules,  but  he
acknowledged  before  us  that,  in  the  absence  of  any  'Reply'  to  the
respondent's application for a review, the appellants could  not  now  argue
that the first-instance judge was wrong to dismiss their appeal  under  rule
317.  In the end it was agreed that we would proceed on  the  factual  basis
that the sponsor was in regular contact with the  appellants  and  regularly
sent them money, albeit they were  not  "mainly  dependent  financially"  on
her.  What had to be decided was the nature of the family life ties  between
the sponsor and appellants for  the  purposes  of  Article  8,  set  in  the
context of the "historical  wrong"  discussed  in  Halai  and  the  previous
attempts to establish family life in this country.

The hearing
21.  We heard oral  evidence  from  the  sponsor,  who  confirmed  that  she
applied for a voucher after getting divorced in April 1992,  and  was  still
sending money to the appellants, whom  she  would  telephone  two  or  three
times a week.  In cross-examination, she  was  asked  why  her  ex-husband's
brother  was  recorded  in  Miss  Dawson's  determination  as  visiting  the
appellants every month.  She replied that her  ex-husband  did  not  get  on
with the children, whereas his brother did.  She went on to tell  Mr  Colyer
that, apart from one occasion when her daughter was ill in hospital  and  he
came by "for two minutes" to see her, her former  brother-in-law  never  saw
the children at all.

22.  In response to questions from me, the sponsor said that when  she  came
to Britain in 2001, she was not intending to  stay  permanently,  but  later
thought that if she did stay, her children would be able to come.  She  then
said that she had not applied for permanent residence  before  applying  for
British citizenship in 2003.   She  could  not  tell  me  why  she  had  not
attempted to regularize her status  during  the  intervening  period.   What
arrangements had she made about the children  in  the  meantime?   She  said
that her son used to look after the daughters,  while  their  landlord  -  a
kindly soul - kept an eye on all of them.

23.  In his closing submissions, Mr Walker contended that there was  not  in
the instant case that  unusual  degree  of  dependency  which  was  held  in
Kugathas to be necessary for family life  in  Article  8  terms  to  subsist
between a parent and her adult children.  He noted the  discrepancy  between
the monthly visits said by the children to have  been  paid  them  by  their
paternal uncle, and the sponsor's assertion that he had only come  by  once.
It might be that the appellants' father had not completely disappeared  from
the scene, as claimed.  In any event, Nalai was readily distinguishable.

24.  Mr Ahmed submitted that the appellant's  divorce,  finalized  in  April
1992, was genuine, and that she should  have  been  issued  with  a  special
voucher as the head of her household in 1993, when the appellants  were  all
under 25.  The fact that they were now  all  over  25  did  not  reduce  the
strength of their claim to family reunion now.  Mr Ahmed drew our  attention
to HG & RG [2005] UKIAT 2, in which a panel chaired by  Ouseley  J  compared
the Special Quota Voucher Scheme, which required  the  children  of  voucher
holders to be under 25, with the Immigration Rules, which did not, and  held
that the latter prevailed over the former.  In any event, we  were  strongly
urged to follow the lead of the AIT and the Court of  Appeal  in  Halai  and
find that the historical wrong done to female  BOCs  such  as  the  sponsor,
combined  with  the  continuing  relationship  of  dependency  between   the
appellants and the sponsor, made  their  enforced  separation  a  breach  of
their Article 8 right to family life.

Discussion
25.  While we recognize that the  Special  Voucher  Scheme  and  its  annual
quotas, designed to restrict the immigration of East African  Asians,  along
with the old-fashioned assumption that the  husband  was  the  head  of  the
household unless he was physically  or  mentally  incapacitated,  amount  to
what is now seen as an "historical  wrong",  we  remind  ourselves  than  an
appeal cannot be allowed under  Article  8  simply  in  order  to  right  an
historical wrong.  That is the job of Parliament, which did in fact  restore
to British Overseas citizens the right of  abode  which  had  been  lost  in
1968.  As well as granting to BOCs  the  entitlement  to  register  as  full
British  citizens,  Parliament  could  have  added  -  but  did  not  -   an
entitlement for the children of former BOCs, of whatever age, to join  their
parents in  this  country  for  settlement  (subject,  perhaps,  to  certain
conditions, such as being unmarried and still  financially  dependent).   Mr
Ahmed comes close to arguing that, at least in the case of the  children  of
married female BOCs, who  could  not  come  here  while  they  were  younger
because their mothers did not qualify for a Special Quota  Voucher,  Article
8 can achieve the just outcome for which Parliament has not made  provision.
 But we must bear in  mind  the  warning  given  by  Hodge  J  in  NH  about
"attempting to enforce rights retrospectively."

26.  Our starting point must be to ask whether family life subsists  between
the appellants and the sponsor for the purposes of Article  8  and,  if  so,
whether the decision under appeal constitutes an interference with it (or  a
denial of the appellants' right to respect for their family  life).   It  is
apparent  at  once  that  there  is  a  factual   difference   between   the
circumstances of Halai's case and those of the present  case.   Navin  Halai
had been living with both his parents in India, and his mother only came  to
the UK when the law changed in April 2003, giving  her  the  opportunity  to
register as a British citizen.  She then returned to India, to  support  the
applications of  her  husband  and  youngest  son  for  entry  clearance  as
dependants.  At that time Navin Halai was just over 18.   He  was  in  full-
time education, and still fully dependent on his  parents.   The  appellants
in the instant case, however, were aged respectively  33,  31  and  24  when
they  applied  for  entry  clearance,  and  were   not   "mainly   dependent
financially" on the sponsor.

27.  The evidence before us does show, we acknowledge, that the sponsor  has
been sending quite a lot of money to the appellants.  For the  last  quarter
of 2003, and for almost all of 2004, the sponsor  sent  postal  orders  each
month amounting to at least �100.  There are no documents relating to  2005,
but in 2006 the sponsor sent a cheque for �800 and a postal order  for  �50.
In 2007, cheques for over �2,000 were sent.  Nevertheless, as found by  Miss
Dawson when determining the earlier appeal in 2005, both Jagruti and  Gautam
had been working, and earning between them more than what  the  sponsor  was
earning when she lived in India with the  appellants  and  had  to  maintain
them all.  Immigration Judge Parker was rightly  sceptical  about  what  the
appellants told  the  ECO  at  their  most  recent  interview,  about  their
difficulty in finding work.  Jagruti contradicted her earlier  interview  by
insisting that she had never worked at all.  It is clear that by this  stage
the appellants realized they needed to play down their ability  to  maintain
themselves.

28.  Another difference between the instant case and Halai is that here  the
sponsor left India at a time when she could not have expected to be able  to
register as a British citizen.  Indeed, two years were to  pass  before  she
could.  Having got leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor,  the
sponsor tells us that she made no attempt to regularize her  stay  until  it
became possible to register for citizenship after 30th April 2003.  She  was
not  working  during  that  period,  and  so  was  unable  to  provide   the
remittances which she began sending  after  she  commenced  work  with  D.R.
Garments in August 2003.  For two years, then, the sponsor was in  Leicester
and the appellants had to make shift for themselves.   Gautam,  the  sponsor
tells us, looked after his  sisters,  while  the  landlord  (who  may  be  a
relative of the sponsor's - they share the name Odedra) kept an eye  on  all
of them.  What is clear is that the appellants did not need their mother  to
be with them.

29.  It is significant, we feel, that the sponsor has  never  been  back  in
the  seven  years  since  she  left  India.   She  has  managed  to  save  a
considerable  amount  of  money.   By  the  date  of  the   hearing   before
Immigration Judge Parker, she had �8,400 in her bank account.  We note  from
a more recent bank statement that the sponsor has transferred  �3,600  to  a
"Tax Haven ISA".  That is no doubt a sensible investment,  but  it  suggests
that the sponsor has more important priorities than  visiting  her  children
in India.  The Court of Appeal in Kugathas cited  with  approval  a  passage
from the Strasbourg jurisprudence : "Relationships between adults, a  mother
and her 33-year old son in the present case, would not  necessarily  acquire
the protection of Article 8 of the Convention without  evidence  of  further
elements of dependency, involving more than the normal emotional ties."   We
do not think that the family life between the sponsor here, who  could  have
paid a visit to India at some time, at least within  the  last  four  years,
but has not, and the appellants, who do receive  generous  remittances  from
the sponsor,  but  who  are  capable  of  maintaining  themselves  and  have
certainly done so in the past, evinces that  unusual  degree  of  dependency
which the Strasbourg jurisprudence requires in  order  for  family  life  to
subsist in Article 8 terms between a parent and her adult children.

30.  True it is that if the sponsor had been issued  with  a  Special  Quota
Voucher in 1993, the appellants would all have been under 25  years  old  at
that  time  and,  being  dependent,  would  have  been  eligible  for  entry
clearance.  That is not to say that  they  would  have  obtained  indefinite
leave to enter, since the Immigration Rules applying at  that  time  to  the
spouses and children of Special  Voucher  holders  required  the  holder  to
provide adequate maintenance and accommodation.  We cannot say  whether,  in
1993 or the next few years thereafter, the sponsor would have been  able  to
provide those things.  What we can say is that, on a net wage  of  �210  per
week at the date of decision, the  sponsor  would  not  have  been  able  to
provide adequate maintenance for the appellants (although  she  was  earning
enough to send remittances to India).   The  sponsor's  three-bedroom  house
can provide adequate accommodation for five  adults  (four  female  and  one
male) in terms of the Housing Act 1985, but the  rent  is  �300  per  month.
Minus the rent, the sponsor would only have had  �135  a  week  left.   That
would not be enough to maintain herself and three adult  dependants,  if  we
take what a comparable  family  would  receive  on  Income  Support  as  the
benchmark.  If, on the other  hand,  the  appellants  envisage  working  and
becoming financially independent once they get here,  it  is  unlikely  that
they can exhibit the unusual degree of dependency highlighted in Kugathas.

31.  Of course, the sponsor was not recognized by the Visa Officer  in  1993
as being genuinely divorced from her husband, and  hence  qualifying  for  a
Special Voucher as the head of a household.  Mr Ahmed  invites  us  to  find
that the divorce was genuine, and hence that the sponsor was wrongly  denied
a  voucher  in  1993.   We  are  not,  however,  in  possession  of   enough
information to make any finding on this, even if it would be appropriate  to
do so.  True it is that the sponsor has  not  "re-married"  her  ex-husband,
but we cannot be sure that he has dropped out of the picture to  the  extent
that the sponsor and appellants maintain.  That  his  brother  should  be  a
regular visitor to the appellants, at least according to their  own  account
(which is contradicted by the sponsor), would be odd if their father  wanted
nothing to do with them.  We can also appreciate  how  the  wording  of  the
Divorce Decree might have aroused the Visa Officer's suspicions,  since  the
divorce was by mutual consent and yet the Assistant Judge went  out  of  his
way to say what a bad lot the husband was, and how much more  beneficial  it
would be to the children if they could accompany their mother to the UK.

32.  Recognizing that  the  ages  of  the  appellants  may  be  seen  as  an
important factor distinguishing their case from Halai, Mr Ahmed  has  prayed
in aid HG & RG for the point that paragraph 252  of  the  Immigration  Rules
(which was deleted in September 2002) did not put any limit on  the  age  at
which the children of voucher holders could be admitted for settlement.   We
do not think this avails the appellants.   The  sponsor  is  not  a  voucher
holder, and the Special  Quota  Voucher  scheme  was  abolished  five  years
before the appellants applied for entry clearance in May 2007.  As HG  &  RG
is now of historical interest  only,  it  may  not  be  inapposite  for  the
present writer, who sat on the panel  of  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal
which heard HG & RG, to  observe  that  the  panel  focused  on  the  second
requirement of rule 252 (that the voucher  holder  should  provide  adequate
maintenance and accommodation for his dependants) rather than on  the  first
requirement (that entry clearance as  the  spouse  or  child  of  a  voucher
holder was needed before  indefinite  leave  to  enter  could  be  granted).
Entry clearance would not be issued unless the  applicant  came  within  the
terms of the Special Quota Voucher scheme, which  required  children  to  be
aged below 25 years.  It  ought  to  be  appreciated  that  the  reason  for
allowing dependent children up to the age of 25 to  take  advantage  of  the
scheme was not an assumption that children up to that age are normally  part
of the 'nuclear family', but  a  recognition  that,  while  the  scheme  was
oversubscribed, it was taking years for some heads  of  household  to  reach
the end of the  queue  for  Special  Vouchers,  during  which  period  their
children might have got well beyond the usual cut-off  age  of  18,  despite
being minors when the application was initially made.



Conclusion
33.  In fine, we find that the instant case is readily distinguishable  from
Halai's case, which is not authority for any general  proposition  that  the
children  of  former  British  Overseas  citizens  must  be   admitted   for
settlement if they have retained close ties with their parents.   Article  8
of the ECHR can do many things, but it is not a vehicle for the righting  of
historical wrongs.  That is for the politicians, and  not  for  the  judges.
The historical wrong done to  BOCs  is,  of  course,  part  of  the  context
against which the proportionality  of  an  immigration  decision  is  to  be
assessed, as was done in Halai.  But first it must be shown  that  there  is
family life for the purposes of Article 8, and that  the  interference  with
it (or lack of respect  for  it)  is  sufficiently  serious  to  engage  the
potential operation of Article 8.  Those hurdles have  not  been  passed  in
the instant case, and so  "the  ultimate  question",  as  Lord  Bingham  has
called it, of proportionality has not been reached.


DECISION

We substitute a fresh decision to dismiss the appeals.
