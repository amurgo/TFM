                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge  L  Murray)  allowing  Bahadar  Lal's  (hereafter  "the
    claimant") appeal against a decision refusing him leave as the  partner
    of a British Citizen.  The Judge found that although the claimant could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, namely Appendix  FM
    and  para  276  ADE  nevertheless  the   claimant's   removal   was   a
    disproportionate interference with her family life and  consequently  a
    breach of Article 8.

 2. On 22  September  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Hodgkinson)
    granted the Secretary of  State  permission  to  appeal  on  the  three
    grounds relied on:

         (1)       that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  apply  s.117B  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (the  "NIA  Act
             2002") on the basis that it did not apply  as  the  claimant's
             family life was established whilst he was here lawfully;

         (2)      that having  found  that  there  were  "no  insurmountable
             obstacles"  to  the  claimant's  family  life  continuing   in
             Pakistan, the Judge was wrong  to  find  that  the  claimant's
             circumstances were such as to outweigh the public interest and



         (3)      that the  Judge  was  wrong  to  find  that  it  would  be
             disproportionate  to   require  the  claimant  to  return   to
             Pakistan to seek entry clearance.

Introduction

 3. The claimant is a Pakistani national who was born on 9 March 1988.   He
    first came to the UK on 24 May 2010 with a student visa valid until  30
    December 2012.

 4. On 26 April 2012, the Secretary of  State  purported  to  curtail  that
    leave to 26 June 2012.  I will return to this shortly but Judge  Murray
    found that that curtailment was ineffective as the Secretary  of  State
    could not prove that the notice had been communicated to  the  claimant
    as required by Syed (Curtailment of Leave - Notice)  [2013]  UKUT  0144
    (IAC).  That finding is not challenged.

 5. On 5 July 2012, the claimant submitted  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a person settled in the UK.  The basis of  that
    claim was that he had married a British citizen who had come to the  UK
    in September 2002 aged 12 from Pakistan.  Both  her  parents  and  four
    brothers lived in the UK.  The claimant married his wife in May 2012 in
    an Islamic ceremony and registered that marriage on 11 June 2012.   The
    Judge accepted that at the time of his application, the claimant had no
    knowledge that the Secretary of State  had  purported  to  curtail  his
    leave.

 6. In a decision dated 11 February 2013, the Secretary  of  State  refused
    the claimant's application for leave as the spouse of a British citizen
    under para 284 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) on the sole
    ground that the claimant's leave had been curtailed to 26 June 2012 and
    consequently he did not have the required limited leave to enter  under
    para 284(i).  As  the  Secretary  of  State  took  the  view  that  the
    claimant, at the time of his application, did not have leave to  remain
    the decision letter states that the claimant had "no  right  of  appeal
    against this refusal".

 7. I interpolate that, in the light of Judge  Murray's  finding  that  the
    curtailment notice was not validly served,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision  was  wrong  in  that  the  claimant  did  in  fact  meet  the
    requirement in para 284(i) and as he had  leave  at  the  time  of  the
    application and, by virtue of s.3C of  the  Immigration  Act  1971,  he
    continued to have leave and had a right of appeal against that decision
    under s.82(2)(d) of the NIA Act 2002.

 8. Perhaps, because of the misleading statement by the Secretary of  State
    in the decision notice of 11 February 2013 that  the  claimant  had  no
    right of appeal, the claimant did not appeal.

 9.  Instead,  the  claimant  sought  a  reconsideration  of  his  previous
    application on 13 March 2013.  On 11 June 2014, he was served  with  an
    IS 151 notice of liability to removal as an overstayer.   Then,  on  30
    June 2014, the claimant  made  a  fresh  application  for  leave  under
    Article 8.  That application was refused in a letter  dated  11  August
    2014 and on that date also the Secretary of State made  a  decision  to
    remove the claimant as an overstayer.

10. It is against that latter decision that the claimant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal in this case.

The Judge's Decision

11. Judge Murray heard  evidence  from  the  claimant,  his  wife  and  the
    claimant's father-in-law.  Judge Murray made a number of findings.

12. First, in relation to the Immigration  Rules,  Judge  Murray  concluded
    that although there was a certain degree of hardship in the claimant or
    his partner living in Pakistan that did not amount  to  "insurmountable
    obstacles" for the purposes of Appendix FM, EX1 or that there were very
    significant obstacles to his integration into Pakistan under  para  276
    ADE.  Consequently, Judge Murray dismissed the claimant's appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.

13. Secondly, however, Judge Murray went onto consider the claimant's  case
    under Article 8.  As I have already indicated, she concluded  that  the
    claimant's leave had never been lawfully curtailed.  At para 34 of  her
    determination Judge Murray said this:

         "34.     Clearly, the question of whether the  Appellant  was  here
             lawfully when he made his application as a spouse is  relevant
             to my assessment of proportionality.  If the Respondent failed
             to validly serve the notice of curtailment of  27  April  2012
             then the Appellant  had  extant  leave  when  he  applied  for
             further leave as a spouse and  the  Respondent  was  wrong  to
             reject that application with no  right  of  appeal.   Further,
             that application should be  considered  as  still  outstanding
             before the Respondent."

14. At para 36, having cited Syed, Judge Murray continued:

         "36.     The notice was served on the Appellant's  former  college.
             Ms Quon confirmed when I asked that she was  unable  to  prove
             postal service.  She had no supporting  evidence  of  service.
             Further, I find  the  Appellant's  account  that  he  did  not
             receive notice of curtailment to be credible.   He was clearly
             in  a  relationship  and  I  accept  that  when  he  made   an
             application on 5 July 2012 he thought he was making an in time
             application.   The  Respondent's  failure  to   consider   his
             application for further leave as a spouse was unlawful."

15. At  paragraph  37,  Judge  Murray  set  out  the  claimant's  financial
    circumstances, in particular  that  the  claimant's  wife  earned  over
    �35,000 per year.  Judge Murray accepted that  their  relationship  was
    genuine and that any application for  entry  clearance  was  likely  to
    succeed.  She said this:

         "37.     The appellant has  submitted  his  wife's  payslips,  bank
             statements and her HMRC annual tax summary for the year  2013-
             2014.  This shows that her total income  from  employment  for
             that year was �35,741.55.   Although  the  evidence  submitted
             cannot be construed as strictly complying with Appendix  FM-SE
             there can be no real doubt that she would meet  the  financial
             provisions of the Immigration  Rules.   I  therefore  consider
             that  her  evidence  that  she  expected  his  further   leave
             application to be granted and not to have to return  with  him
             to Pakistan is credible.  Further and in view of the fact that
             the Respondent has  accepted  that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
             genuine relationship with his  wife  it  is  likely  that  the
             application would have been granted."

16. Then at paragraph  38  Judge  Murray  concluded  that  s.117B  was  not
    applicable for the following reasons:

         "38.      Further,  having  found  that  the  Appellant  was   here
             lawfully,  section  117B  does  not  apply  because   he   has
             established his family life here whilst here lawfully."

17. Finally, Judge Murray reached her ultimate conclusion at  paragraph  40
    that the claimant's removal would be disproportionate as follows:

         "40.     I have found, in the context  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
             that there are no insurmountable obstacles  to  the  Appellant
             and his wife returning to Pakistan.  However, in view  of  the
             fact  that  the  Appellant  should  have   had   his   spousal
             application determined in country,  his  wife  has  employment
             here and I accept on the basis of the  doctor's  letter  would
             suffer a deterioration I  her  mental  state  if  he  were  to
             return, I accept in this case that a temporary  separation  in
             order for the Appellant to apply for entry clearance would  be
             disproportionate."

18. Consequently, the Judge allowed the appeal under Art 8.

Discussion

19. On behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  Mr  Richards  relied  upon  the
    grounds upon which permission to appeal had been granted.

20. As regards s.117B Mr Richards submitted that what the Judge had said in
    paragraph 38 was clearly not right unless the  Judge  meant  that  sub-
    section (4) had no application, namely that "little weight"  should  be
    given to a relationship with a partner if it  was  established  at  the
    time when the person was in the UK unlawfully.

21. Mr Richards submitted  that  the  key  finding  of  the  Judge  was  in
    paragraph 34 where she found that the curtailment notice had  not  been
    properly served and in effect the  claimant's  2012  application  as  a
    spouse which had  been  refused  on  11  February  2013  had  not  been
    correctly  determined.   Mr  Richards  acknowledged  that  the  Judge's
    finding, which was  unchallenged,  meant  that  the  claimant  met  the
    requirement in para 284(i) which was the  sole  basis  upon  which  his
    application had been refused in February  2013  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Mr Richards did not identify any other requirement in para  284
    which the claimant could not meet.   In  particular,  he  accepted  the
    financial evidence that the claimant's partner earned in the  tax  year
    2013-2014 over �35,000.  He did not suggest that  the  Judge's  finding
    that the claimant's relationship with his wife was a  genuine  one  was
    not properly open to the Judge.

22. In the course of his submissions, I raised with Mr  Richards  what  was
    the public interest that outweighed the claimant's circumstances  given
    that his application as a spouse in 2012 had been wrongly  refused  and
    he had been led to believe that he had no right of appeal against  that
    decision.

23. In response, Mr Richards indicated that the  first  ground  of  appeal,
    namely that the Judge had failed to give effect to the public  interest
    factors in s.117B of the NIA Act 2002 appeared  to  have  been  drafted
    without consideration of the Judge's finding in paras 34  and  36  that
    the appellant's leave had not been lawfully curtailed.  In the light of
    that, Mr Richards accepted that the Judge had had two  options  in  the
    light of that finding.  First, she could have set aside  the  Secretary
    of State's decision  as  not  being  in  accordance  with  the  law  or
    alternatively could have  allowed  the  appeal  under  Article  8.   He
    acknowledged that the fact that the Judge had allowed the appeal  under
    Article 8 was probably the tidiest way of disposing of the appeal given
    her findings.

24. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of  the  Secretary  of
    State, I am satisfied that her appeal cannot succeed.

25.  In  reaching  her  finding  that   the   respondent's   decision   was
    disproportionate, the Judge correctly directed herself that, given  the
    claimant could not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  it
    had to be established that there  were  "compelling  circumstances"  to
    outweigh the public interest (see para 31 of her  determination).   The
    claimant's wife had been in the UK since she was 12 years  old.   There
    was medical evidence before the Judge that the claimant's wife suffered
    from depression and anxiety  and  was  in  receipt  of  anti-depressant
    medicine and that her mental state would deteriorate  if  the  claimant
    returned to Pakistan.  Whilst it is also the case that the Judge  found
    that there were not insuperable obstacles to  the  claimant  continuing
    his family life in Pakistan, there were nevertheless  powerful  factors
    which  spoke  in  favour  of  the  claimant's  case.   As  Mr  Richards
    acknowledged, a key finding was that the claimant had, in  effect,  met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules  in  his  spouse  application
    made in 2012.  That, together with the evidence of  the  employment  of
    the claimant's wife and medical evidence concerning her  mental  health
    was taken into account by the Judge in para  40  of  the  determination
    which I have set out above.

26. I do not accept that in para 38 the Judge was saying that the  entirety
    of s.117B of the NIA Act 2002 was not applicable to the  claimant.   It
    seems to me on a proper and careful reading that she was simply stating
    that s.117B(4) was not applicable as the claimant had  established  his
    family life with his wife whilst  he  was  lawfully  here.   The  Judge
    clearly had in mind that there was a public interest which  had  to  be
    balanced, by virtue of s.117B(1) of  the  NIA  Act  2002,  against  the
    claimant's  circumstances  and   only   if   there   were   "compelling
    circumstances" would that public interest be outweighed (see  paras  31
    and 32 of the determination).  However,  as Mr Richards acknowledged in
    his submissions in response to a  question  from  me,  given  that  the
    claimant had wrongly been refused leave to remain as a  spouse  because
    he had, in fact, met the requirements of para 284 the  public  interest
    in this case was not strong.   That was a factor, indeed a  significant
    factor, which the Judge was entitled to take into account as she did in
    para 40 in reaching her conclusion  that  the  claimant's  removal  was
    disproportionate.

27. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the  Judge  was  entitled  to
    reach her finding that Article 8 would be breached if the claimant were
    required to return to Pakistan to live or, indeed, temporarily in order
    to seek entry clearance.  In the latter instance,  given  that  he  had
    already met the requirements of the relevant rule in 2012, and  it  was
    not disputed that he would meet the requirements of the  relevant  rule
    if he made an entry clearance application now, there was  "no  sensible
    reason" to require the claimant to jump through the procedural hoop  of
    leaving the country in order to seek entry clearance (see, SSHD v Hayat
    and Treebhowan [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1054  at  [30(d)]).   The  Judge  was
    entitled to find that was, in all the circumstances,  disproportionate.



28. In truth, this is a case in which the claimant should have been  better
    served by the immigration process.  It is now accepted that  he  should
    have been granted leave under para 284 in 2012/2013 as a spouse. I  see
    no  sound  basis  upon  which  it  can  be  said  that  given  all  the
    circumstances Judge Murray's finding that  the  refusal  to  grant  him
    leave as a spouse now would be a disproportionate interference with his
    family life with his wife is irrational or otherwise  unsustainable  in
    law.

Decision

29. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the
    claimant's appeal under Article 8 stands.

30. Accordingly, the appeal of the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal
    is dismissed.
