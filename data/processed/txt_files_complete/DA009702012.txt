                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CLIVE LANE

                                   Between

                                   [C W D]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica.


   2. The appeal came before me for mention only on 21 September 2015 having
      been remitted to the Upper Tribunal by the Court of Appeal. The  Court
      of Appeal had allowed the Secretary  of  State's  appeal  against  the
      decision of the Upper  Tribunal  and  in  consequence  set  aside  the
      decision of the Upper  Tribunal  which  had  been  promulgated  on  13
      December 2013.


   3.  Both  representatives  (and,  indeed,  the  Court  of   Appeal)   had
      anticipated that the Upper Tribunal would, in turn, remit  the  appeal
      to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  fresh  evidence  and  make
      findings of fact. I agreed and directed that the appeal be remitted to
      the First-tier Tribunal and gave directions to the  administration  of
      the Upper Tribunal to take the necessary steps to  put  my  directions
      into effect. Unfortunately, this did not occur so I therefore  further
      direct that the appeal be listed in the First-tier Tribunal at  Taylor
      House on the first available date with a time estimate of 2 hours (not
      before Judge Aujla or Mrs Street JP). No interpreter is required.



                               Signed


                               Upper Tribunal Judge CLIVE LANE
                               Date 10 July 2016
