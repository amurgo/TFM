Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Chakmakjian of Counsel, instructed by Leonard
                    Cannings Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Iraq, born respectively on [ ]  2002,  [
    ] 2000 and [ ] 2002.  The first and third appellants are first  cousins
    and the second appellant is their uncle.  They left Iraq on 15th August
    2016 and arrived in the UK in  or  about  September  2016.   They  made
    contact with their uncle/half brother, Farhad who lived in  the  United
    Kingdom as a British citizen and claimed asylum on 12th October 2016.

2.   Their claim for asylum is based upon  the  fact  that  ISIS  wanted  to
    recruit them before they left Iraq and that they fear  that  ISIS  will
    kill them if they return.

3.   The respondent in  three  similar  decisions  dated  12th  April  2017,
    refused to grant them asylum or any other protection.  That it was that
    they appealed against that decision, which appeal  came  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Sweet on 31st May 2017.  In a decision  promulgated
    on 7th June 2017 the appeals were dismissed.

4.   A challenge was made to  the  decision  and  leave  to  challenge  that
    decision was granted to the Upper Tribunal.  Thus matters  come  before
    me in pursuance of that grant.

5.   Essentially at the hearing the appellants  relied  upon  their  witness
    statement and also gave some oral evidence.  HM gave evidence that ISIS
    had visited their home  and  spoke  to  his  parents.   Seemingly  ISIS
    returned and kidnapped his father and two  weeks  later  took  his  two
    brothers-in-law.  He was present when his father's body  was  returned,
    after ISIS came to the house again and  his  mother  started  receiving
    letters to the effect that ISIS wanted him to join  them.   He  himself
    had no direct contact with those who visited.

6.   FHM gave evidence ISIS had visited his home, he had not seen them.   He
    was told by  his  mother  that  his  grandfather  and  uncle  had  been
    kidnapped.  SAM also gave evidence ISIS had visited his  home  and  had
    taken his father and also his grandfather's body was  returned  to  the
    house but he did not see any of this.

7.   Essentially each of the appellants speak of visits to the home by  ISIS
    but they were not present at those visits and  had  no  direct  contact
    with ISIS.  During those visits members of the family were removed  and
    killed and it was the intention of ISIS according  to  the  letters  to
    recruit them.  Thus it was that they fled.

8.   The last witness was FF who was the  British  citizen  with  whom  they
    reside .He was not aware that the appellants were coming to the  United
    Kingdom and last spoke to his mother in 2010.  The Judge did  not  find
    the evidence given by the appellants to be credible nor the account  as
    to the journey to the United Kingdom and lack of  contact  with  family
    members .

9.   The first challenge that is made to the decision is that  the  findings
    of credibility largely set out in paragraph 56 thereof lacks reasoning.



10.  It is to be noted in that regard that the respondent,  in  the  various
    decision letters, relies very heavily upon internal inconsistencies  in
    each account as given.  Such inconsistencies are said to relate to when
    and who was taken by ISIS; when the various letters  were  received  by
    ISIS  and  how  many  and  by  whom.   It  was  said  that  there  were
    inconsistencies as to how long the appellants remained in Mosul and why
    it was that they came to leave.  The point being made that none of  the
    appellants seemed to have any first hand knowledge of the events  which
    they describe, albeit that they were  living  with  their  parents  and
    members of their respective  families  who  were  either  kidnapped  or
    killed.  Such a lack of connection  in  such  violent  times  was  said
    lacked to be lacking credibility . Reasons  were  incorporated  by  the
    Judge in the overall comment made at paragraph 56 of the determination.
     Little indication is given as to whether any or some  of  the  account
    was accepted or  not.   It  was  a  very  broad  brush  comment  as  to
    credibility and lacked reasons as to why such adverse  comments  should
    be made.

11.  The circumstances in which the appellants came to  the  United  Kingdom
    was also found to lack credibility and reasoning is provided for  that.
    Given the expense that would have been incurred in funding the  journey
    to the United Kingdom, it is reasonable to expect that the  appellants'
    families would wish to have kept in  contact  with  them.   It  is  not
    considered credible that no attempts  had  been  made  to  contact  the
    family in Iraq. However no particular comment as to the credibility  or
    otherwise of FF has been made.  It was his claim  that  the  appellants
    simply arrived in the United Kingdom without his knowledge, armed  with
    his telephone number and made contact with him.  There is no particular
    finding as to whether that is or is not accepted by the Judge.   Is  it
    to be argued that so much expense was employed upon  moving  the  three
    appellants to the United Kingdom on the pure off chance that they might
    happen to meet up with their sponsor or  was  it  the  case  that  that
    contact  had  been  made?   Indeed  the  question  arises  as  to   the
    credibility of  the  account  that  none  of  the  appellants  had  any
    telephone numbers or points of contact with  their  own  family  having
    left Iran or indeed that FF had  had  no  contact.   Thus  there  being
    partial findings as to credibility but perhaps not  as  full  as  might
    have been required.  The important consideration clearly is whether  or
    not the appellant had family members to whom they can return.

12.  I do find that credibility is not as clearly as expressed  for  reasons
    given and I find merit therefore in that challenge.

13.  The second challenge being as to the issue of asylum.  In  that  regard
    Mr Chakmakjian relies  heavily  upon  the  way  in  which  matters  are
    expressed in paragraph 58 of the determination, namely as follows:-

         "I accept that there is some  objective  evidence  that  ISIS  uses
         child soldiers in Iraq and they are at risk from that  organisation
         however, as I am not satisfied that they have had exposure to  ISIS
         I do not uphold their claims".


    He  submits  that  that  is  a  clear  finding  that,   regardless   of
    credibility, there is an acceptance based on  the  background  evidence
    that the appellants are at risk from ISIS.   Given  the  acceptance  of
    that risk, the live issue is whether or not the appellants can relocate
    to another part of Iraq.  In that connection the decisions made focused
    upon the possible return to Baghdad, as the appellants  have  no  prior
    connection with the AKR.  It is conceded in the refusal  letters  that,
    if adequate reception arrangements cannot  be  established,  then  they
    qualified for limited leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  an
    unaccompanied asylum seeking child.  Mr Chakmakjian submits that  there
    was a clear acknowledgement by the respondent that internal  relocation
    was not possible; that  in  any  event  the  appellants  could  not  be
    returned under the policy.  In those circumstances he submits that  the
    ingredients for refugee status have been met and accordingly the  Judge
    was in error in not awarding that status in the decision.  Mr  Wilding,
    on behalf of the respondent, invites me to read paragraph  58,  of  the
    determination  in the light of paragraphs 56 and 57 and   submits  that
    that statement in paragraph 58 lacks a degree of clarity,  particularly
    given the findings that the Judge has made.  He also  relies  upon  the
    preceding paragraph to that dealing with reception  arrangements  which
    provides as follows:-


         "Adequate care and reception arrangements should  be  available  to
         the child, such as a family home where the child was cared for  and
         has lived previously".


    It was considered that there is a distinction between  the  Immigration
    Rules relating to adequate reception arrangements and the  requirements
    for removal from the United Kingdom to take place.  He accepts that the
    lack of adequate reception facilities is a powerful factor to be  taken
    into account in assessing whether internal relocation is possible or is
    unduly  harsh.  Although  family  tracing  was  not  employed  in  this
    particular case there was every reason, upon a proper analysis  of  the
    matter, for the Judge not to come  to  a  conclusion  that  there  were
    family and support available to the appellants.

14.  As the case of AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT  00544  indicates
    on the question of ability on whether  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  on
    return, there needs to be a proper fact-sensitive  analysis  which  was
    not conducted in this case at all by the Judge.

15.  Mr Chakmakjian submits that it is entirely open to a  Judge  to  reject
    the credibility of a specific account but nevertheless find there to be
    a general threat.  He submits that  there  was,  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing no mechanism to return, there was  no  analysis  by  the  Judge
    required.

16.  Although his arguments may seem to be attractive,  the  difficulty   is
    to understand  where  the  risk  to  the  appellants  can  be  properly
    focussed.

17.  If for example there was a general risk of recruitment  from  ISIS  but
    in this particular village or area there were no visits by ISIS and  no
    attempts to recruit the appellants,   it  is  difficult  to  understand
    what is the risk that they face.  The test is of course one of  a  real
    risk and not simply a fanciful one.  If the  appellants  have  not  had
    exposure to ISIS, on what basis can  it  be  found  that  they  face  a
    realistic risk that in the future they will?  It seems to me that it is
    important for the Judge to give reasons for that conclusion, if  indeed
    that be his or her finding.

18.  In terms of the analysis of the safety or ability  to  return  is  also
    the question of documentation as well  as  family  and  other  support.
    None of this was conducted by the Judge.

19.  The challenge was that the Judge erred in law in  failing  to  consider
    the issue of humanitarian protection.  Although the appellants had been
    granted leave to remain it was a requirement under AA  (Article  15(c))
    Iraq CG that the real risk upon  return  to  Baghdad  be  analysed  and
    decided upon at the time of the hearing and  not  postponed.   In  that
    regard the decision of the respondent also fell into error, as did  the
    Judge.  There is an acceptance by both parties that that is the  proper
    challenge to be made.

20.  Once again Mr Chakmakjian seeks to  go  further  to  persuade  me  that
    actually, on the facts of the case the Judge should  have  allowed  the
    appeal on the basis of humanitarian protection.  It was not in  dispute
    that at the time there was a widespread risk of violence in  Mosul  and
    that a return to Baghdad could not be made  on  policy  grounds.   Once
    again it seemed to me that there had been no analysis by the  Judge  of
    the issue of return and no indication as to whether the returnees would
    be  able  to  obtain  civil  identification  (CSID  or   any   detailed
    consideration as to the risk on returning to Baghdad).

21.  The fourth challenge is to Article 8 and once  again  it  is  incumbent
    upon the Judge to  make  findings  based  upon  the  situation  at  the
    hearing.  The fact that there  is  no  immediate  risk  of  removal  is
    clearly a factor to be taken into consideration.   The  appellants  are
    entitled to have their whole circumstances and situation considered  as
    at the time of the hearing, reference to the support that they have  in
    the United Kingdom as against the lack of support that  they  may  have
    elsewhere should that be a finding that has been made.

22.  In the circumstances I find that it is not inevitable upon  the  facts,
    as placed before the First-tier Tribunal at the hearing, for  there  to
    be the  grant  of  asylum  or  humanitarian  protection  regardless  of
    credibility although it is to  be  acknowledged  that  the  factors  in
    support of the grant of humanitarian protection were strong ones.

23.  The point that of course is now made, in response to the  challenge  by
    the respondent ,is that the liberation of Mosul is a further avenue  of
    return that was not present at the hearing itself.  Such  a  return  is
    not however part of the original decision of the respondent  and  would
    require in any event a fact-sensitive consideration.

24.  In all the circumstances I find that the decision should be  set  aside
    and that it should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo
    hearing with no findings of fact preserved.

25.  No doubt the First-tier  Tribunal  will  give  such  directions  as  is
    considered to be appropriate, including  updated  background  evidence.
    It may be desirable in these circumstances  to  have  a  full  skeleton
    argument  submitted  as  to  the  issues  of  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection that have been canvassed.  It may be that it is also for the
    respondent to grapple with the issue of humanitarian protection in  the
    light of dealing with return as at the date of hearing and not upon the
    expiry of discretionary leave.

26.  In that  regard  I  direct  that  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be listed as soon as  possible  so  that  none  of  the
    appellants lose the  protection  that  they  currently  have  of  their
    discretionary leave and their minority status.  One will become  18  in
    May 2018 and his discretionary leave will expire when he  is  17�.   It
    seems to me to be fundamentally  unfair  to  delay  matters  so  as  to
    deprive the appellants of that advantage  which  they  enjoyed  at  the
    hearing, which was a proper factor  which  should  have  probably  been
    taken into account at that hearing.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
