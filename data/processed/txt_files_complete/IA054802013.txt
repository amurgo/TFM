For the Appellant:     Ms S Sharma, of Counsel instructed by ICS Legal
For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of India born on 5 October 1933 appeals,  with
    permission, against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Walters who in a determination promulgated on 28  June  2013  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State  to
    refuse indefinite leave to remain as the dependent parent of  a  person
    present and settled in Britain  under  paragraph  317  of  HC  395,  as
    amended.

2.   The appellant's evidence was that in 1989  her  elder  son  Raghavendra
    bought land and built a house on it.  The appellant, her  husband  (who
    died in 1997), Raghavendra, his wife  and  child  and  the  appellant's
    younger son, Rajiv,  lived  together  in  the  house.   In  2000  Rajiv
    obtained work in Bangalore and the appellant moved  with  him  to  live
    there.  Rajiv married and in 2005 came to Britain to work.

3.   Although the appellant came  to  Britain  as  a  visitor  in  2006  she
    returned to India when she learnt that she was not entitled  to  remain
    here.  Rajiv had intended to return to India but he did not do  so  and
    is now resident here with his immediate family.

4.   When the appellant returned to India she lived in Raghavendra's  house.
      Rajiv  had  agreed  with  Raghavendra  that  he  would  pay  for  the
    appellant's food - approximately Rs.1,000 a month and  would  also  pay
    for all her medical treatment.  Rajiv had also told Raghavendra that he
    would stay in Britain for approximately two or three years.

5.   In 2009 Raghavendra expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangement  and
    it was Rajiv's evidence that he had offered Raghavendra money but  that
    had been refused.

6.   The appellant claimed that she was abused  by  Raghavendra's  wife  and
    that he had hit her and tried to strangle her in October 2011.  She had
    then spent two months with her brother as an emergency  measure  before
    returning to live at Raghavendra's house on 28 November 2011.

7.   On 3 March 2012 the appellant arrived in Britain  as  a  visitor.   She
    made an application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  dependent
    relative on 2 June 2012.

8.   The application was refused on the basis that  the  appellant  had  not
    shown that she was wholly or mainly dependent on Rajiv, had  not  shown
    that she had no other relatives in her own country to  whom  she  could
    turn for financial support and that her rights under  Article  8  would
    not be infringed by her removal.

9.   The appellant appealed that decision and Judge Walters  heard  evidence
    from both the appellant and from her son Rajiv, the  sponsor.   He  set
    out his findings of fact in paragraph 7 onwards of  the  determination.
    He noted the evidence from Rajiv that in February 2012 he had tried  to
    negotiate with Raghavendra so that the appellant could continue to stay
    with him but that Raghavendra  had  refused.   That  had  prompted  the
    appellant to apply for the visitor visa.

10.  In paragraph 22 the judge stated that he accepted  that  the  appellant
    was assaulted by Raghavendra but stated that:-

         "This  was  an  isolated  incident.   I  do  not  accept  that  the
         appellant's brother would have sent her back to Raghavendra's house
         if he believed she was in danger of further assault.  I also  noted
         that no further assaults actually took place".


11.  In paragraph 24 he noted that the appellant had  said  in  her  witness
    statement that she received ï¿½40 per month (Rs.3,200) in dividend income
    and that she estimated that she received between Rs.30,000 and 40,000 a
    year.  He then went on to say in paragraphs 25 onwards:-

         "25.  Unfortunately  the  evidence  on  this  point  has  not  been
             satisfactorily  proved.   The  documentary  evidence  of   the
             appellant's dividends over the last 12 months should have been
             produced and also the capital value of her  shares.   That  is
             necessary  in  order  to  determine  whether  or  not  she  is
             financially wholly or mainly dependent on Rajiv.


         26.  In Rajiv's witness statement he sets out the years in which he
             travelled to India.  He says that he financially supports  his
             mother by giving her cash when he  gets  there.   The  witness
             statement says that he made no journey to India in  2011  (and
             presumably he gave her no cash that  year).   He  details  his
             other visits being in 2006, 2008 and 2009 and states that  the
             amount of cash given to his mother  varied  between  Rs.20,000
             and 30,000 on each of those visits.


         27.  There are therefore no remittance advices showing the movement
             of funds from Rajiv to the appellant.


         28.  The appellant has a bank account but  the  statement  produced
             only runs from 1 November 2011 to 12 December 2012.


         29.  The bank account statement shows two deposits  from  Rajiv  to
             the appellant.  The first is on 5 January 2012 for  Rs.40,000;
             and the second is on 13 February 2012 for Rs.38,000.


         30.  The appellant was asked about these in her evidence  and  also
             about a withdrawal (the  amount  is  obscured)  but  from  the
             balance it would appear to be about  Rs.70,000  in  favour  of
             'Akbar  Travels'  on  unknown  date  in  February  2012.   The
             appellant confirmed that that  sum  had  been  paid  to  Akbar
             Travels for her air ticket to the UK.


         31.  No satisfactory evidence has therefore been produced  to  show
             the movement of funds between Rajiv and the appellant.  If, as
             he claims, he gave a cash sum to his mother on each  visit  he
             made to India, then I would have expected those cash  sums  to
             have appeared in bank statements.


         32.  I therefore found that  the  financial  evidence  produced  is
             wholly inadequate in  demonstrating  that  the  appellant  was
             financially wholly or mainly dependent on Rajiv when  she  was
             in India.


         33.  I accepted the  evidence  from  the  appellant's  brother  and
             sister-in-law that they would be unable to financially support
             the appellant."

12.  The judge therefore found that the appellant could  not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules.

13.  In assessing the rights of the appellant under Article 8  of  the  ECHR
    he found that family life existed between the appellant and  Rajiv  and
    his family in the  UK  and  he  accepted  that  Rajiv  had  financially
    assisted in the maintenance of the appellant while she  was  in  India.
    He went on to say:-

         "I simply found that it has not been satisfactorily proven that the
         appellant was financially, wholly or mainly dependent on him".


14.  Having found that family and  private  life  rights  were  engaged  and
    having noted that the appellant could not succeed under  the  Rules  he
    considered the proportionality of the removal  of  the  appellant.   He
    noted that the appellant had had two heart attacks, the second of which
    had been when the appellant visited Rajiv in February 2006.  He noted a
    report from Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust  recommending  that
    the appellant be investigated on return to India but stated  there  was
    no evidence that that had happened.  He  also  noted  a  letter  of  18
    February 2013 in which the appellant's general practitioner in  Britain
    had stated that the  appellant  would  find  it  difficult  to  perform
    cooking, cleaning and shopping.

15.  He noted that Rajiv had bought property here, his daughter was in full-
    time education and their review had said he would not be happy  if  his
    mother returned to India to live in rented accommodation possibly  with
    the assistance of domestic servants.

16.  In paragraph 47 he stated:

         "Considering these finances and the low cost of living in India,  I
         did not accept that  accommodation  could  not  be  found  for  the
         appellant near her brother and a domestic servant employed to  look
         after her.  Nor did I accept that a return to  Raghavendra's  house
         is out of the question.  I did not  accept  Rajiv's  evidence  that
         Raghavendra has never asked for more money to help look after their
         mother.  He is  a  bank  clerk  and  his  financial  resources  are
         obviously  far  less  than  Rajiv's.   A  more  generous  financial
         contribution towards the appellant's upkeep  from  Rajiv  would,  I
         find, greatly improve the relationship."


    He therefore concluded that it would not be disproportionate to  remove
    the appellant.


17.  Grounds of  appeal  referred  to  the  fact  that  the  sponsor  had  a
    profitable business and a home here and asserted  that  the  judge  had
    accepted that the cost of living in India was low.   They  then  argued
    that the test of proportionality "must be given in understanding  where
    the decision reached a legitimate  aim"  -  a  claim  which  I  do  not
    understand.  The grounds  appeared  to  state  that  the  appellant  be
    accommodated and maintained without recourse to public funds  and  that
    she would  continue  to  seek  medical  treatment  in  Britain  without
    recourse to public funds matters which were ot questioned. .

18.  The grounds also stated that bank statements had  been  provided  which
    confirmed that the appellant  was  maintaining  his  mother  with  cash
    withdrawals when he visited India and appears to suggest that the  fact
    the judge had indicated that he should continue paying for all  medical
    fees, clothing, cash and cash bonds enabling the assistance of "pay  to
    day care" as  well  as  taking  full  responsibility  for  renting  the
    appellant a flat and have full-time care for her and to be  responsible
    for transportation, communication and all other expenses and additional
    costs indicated that the judge had  accepted  that  the  appellant  was
    financially dependent on the sponsor as she could not afford to rent  a
    house and pay for a maid servant on her own.

19.  The grounds went on to state that the judge was wrong to indicate  that
    he considered the appellant could return to Raghavendra's  house  given
    that Raghavendra had been violent  towards  her  and  referred  to  the
    suggestion by the judge that further accommodation should be found  for
    the appellant.

20.  It was also claimed there was an error in law in the  findings  of  the
    judge on the credibility of the sponsor and the appellant.

21.  As to the claim that there were exceptional  circumstances  -  in  this
    case - reference was made to the letter from Maidstone NHS in 2006.

22.  Ms Sharma at the hearing before me relied on  the  grounds  of  appeal.
    She emphasised that the sponsor and the appellant had lived  away  from
    Raghavendra for five years and that it had only been intended that  the
    appellant would live with Raghavendra for a short period.  She  further
    argued that it would  be  disproportionate  for  the  appellant  to  be
    removed when the sponsor was able and willing to support her.   It  was
    wrong for the judge  to  expect  the  sponsor  to  provide  a  separate
    household for the appellant in India.

23.  With regard to the issue of the Immigration  Rules  she  accepted  that
    there was only one bank statement but referred to a copy of a  dividend
    in the appellant's name at page 148 of the bundle which indicated  that
    that holding was in joint names.  She stated that the sponsor  had  put
    assets in his mother's name as a way of supporting her.  Moreover,  she
    referred to the evidence of the emotional support given by the  sponsor
    to the appellant.

24.  She stated there was a cultural bias towards a son giving  support  for
    his mother and that that should have been taken into account.

25.  She was unable to give me any evidence relating to the cost  of  living
    in India or of average earnings there.

26.  I asked her what errors of law there were in  the  determination.   She
    stated that the judge had not taken into account the medical  treatment
    here had been paid for  by  Rajiv.   Moreover,  the  judge  had  placed
    insufficient weight on the assault on the appellant by Raghavendra.

27.  With regard to the issue of the Article 8 rights of the  appellant  the
    judge had failed to take into account the additional  costs  of  buying
    accommodation in India.  Moreover he had not placed  sufficient  weight
    on the oral evidence that  funds  were  transferred  to  India  by  the
    sponsor.

28.  In reply Ms Holmes argued that the conclusions of the judge were  fully
    open to him on the  evidence.   No  evidence  that  the  appellant  was
    supported by the sponsor was placed before him.  There was no  adequate
    trail to show the money from Rajiv going into the appellant's account.

29.  With regard to the issue of the appellant's rights under Article  8  of
    the ECHR she argued that the judge was entitled to reach the conclusion
    that it was relevant no further assaults had taken  place  against  the
    appellant after the one assault by Raghavendra in 2011.

30.   She  asked  me  to  find  that  the  judge's  decisions  on  both  the
    appellant's claim under the Rules and that under Article 8 of the  ECHR
    were fully open to the Judge.

31.  The issue before me is whether or not there was any material  error  of
    law in the determination of the Immigration Judge.  In this case I find
    that the judge did consider all the evidence before him  and  that  the
    conclusions he reached were fully open to him.

32.  The reality is that he did not have before him (and neither did I)  any
    evidence relating to the cost of living in India  or  average  earnings
    against which the income of Rs.30,000 to  40,000  per  year  which  the
    appellant said that she received from dividends would  be  insufficient
    for her needs in India.  Moreover the judge was  entitled  to  conclude
    that there was insufficient evidence to show  that  the  appellant  had
    been supported in India by the sponsor.  In paragraph 25 he stated that
    documentary evidence of the  appellant's  dividends  should  have  been
    produced and also the  capital  value  of  her  shares.   That  was,  I
    consider, a fair comment as was the conclusion of the judge  that  that
    would be necessary in order to determine whether or not  the  appellant
    was financially wholly or mainly dependent on Rajiv.   Moreover,  there
    was no evidence before  the  Immigration  Judge  to  show  money  being
    transferred by Rajiv into his mother's account in  India  or  the  sums
    which he stated he had given to her over the years being  deposited  in
    her account at times which coincided with his visits. The claim in  the
    grounds that bank statement showing the money received  from Rajiv  was
    incorrect.

33.  The judge did refer to  the  deposits  in  January  and  February  2012
    totalling Rs.78,000 but quite correctly noted that about Rs.70,000  had
    been paid out to Akbar Travels some time in February 2012, noting  that
    the appellant had said that that had been paid to Akbar Travels for her
    air ticket.

34.  In all I consider that the judge was entitled to reach the  conclusions
    which he did.

35.  Ms Sharma endeavoured to claim that the fact that the judge had  stated
    that Rajiv could arrange accommodation for the appellant in  India  and
    pay for a maid indicated that he believed that the appellant was wholly
    or mainly dependent on the sponsor was incorrect.  The reality is  that
    the judge considered the situation of the appellant on return to  India
    as part of his exercise in assessing whether or  not  her  removal  was
    disproportionate.   He  concluded  that  her  removal  would   not   be
    disproportionate.  That, I consider, was again  a  decision  which  was
    open to him.

36.  I consider that  the judge, again, reached conclusions which were  open
    to him.

37.  The reality is that the  necessary  evidence  showing  the  support  by
    Rajiv of his mother was not before the judge.  It may well be that  the
    evidence of the bank accounts both of the appellant and of the  sponsor
    can be produced and might show that  money  had  been  transferred  and
    indeed there might be evidence of share certificates showing  that  the
    dividends which the appellant received came  from  holdings  which  had
    either been transferred to her by Rajiv or were in joint  names.   That
    evidence however has not been produced.  No doubt, if  it  were  to  be
    produced, the Secretary of State might consider again  the  appellant's
    position.  I would add that it is clear  from  the  evidence  that  was
    produced that Rajiv did pay for the appellant's medical care  when  she
    was here in 2006.

38.  I note finally the point that Ms Sharma indicated  that,  in  India  it
    was the custom for sons to look after widowed mothers.  I  accept  that
    that is the case but of course it is the case that Raghavendra  is  the
    eldest son and that that is an obligation which would at least  equally
    fall on him.  I also consider  that  it  was  a  fair  comment  of  the
    Immigration Judge to state that he found it difficult  to  accept  that
    Raghavendra would not ask for additional sums so that he could  provide
    further support for the appellant.

39.  For the above reasons I find there is no material error of law  in  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge and that his decision dismissing
    this appeal on immigration and human rights grounds will stand.
