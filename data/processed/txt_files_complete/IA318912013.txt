Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Kannangara, Counsel for Jade Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Steven Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Ghana  born  on  22nd  July  1984.   She
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated  10th  July  2013
    refusing her an EEA residence card as the extended family member of  Mr
    Nazir Tchelenon, a German national living in the United  Kingdom.   Her
    appeal was heard by Judge of First-tier Tribunal Stokes and allowed  in
    a determination promulgated on 15th May 2014.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fisher on 25th  June  2014.
    The grounds assert that the judge erred in law by concluding  that  the
    Appellant had evidenced prior dependency on the basis that the  Sponsor
    had remitted funds for school feels and additional expenses  associated
    with her education.  The judge also found that the Appellant  had  been
    living with her mother prior to her departure for  the  United  Kingdom
    and that her mother had always supported  her  financially  until  that
    point in time.  Judge Fisher found that the payment of school fees  and
    associated  expenditure  does  not  establish  that   the   Appellant's
    essential needs were being met by her Sponsor and  that  the  Appellant
    was in fact dependent on her mother before she came to the UK.

 3. On 19th August 2014 the Appellant appeared before me and I  found  that
    there was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination.  I found that based on what was  before  the  judge  the
    Sponsor was not responsible for the Appellant's essential needs but was
    responsible  for  supporting  the  Appellant  through  her   university
    education.

 4. The evidence given by the Sponsor at that hearing contradicted much  of
    what was before the judge.

 5. Because of the material error of  law  I  set  the  First-tier  Judge's
    decision aside.  I directed a second stage hearing  before  me  on  all
    issues.

 6. The  Appellant  took  the  stand  and  asked  that  her  statement  and
    supplementary statement be used as evidence for the hearing.

 7. Her representative questioned her and she said that she  had  lived  in
    Kumasi and attended secondary school and the  polytechnic  there.   She
    said she had lived in the family home of her Sponsor.

 8. She was asked how she was supported  and  she  said  that  her  Sponsor
    supported her.  It was put to her that in the First-tier  determination
    it is stated that she  told  the  Tribunal  that  her  mother  used  to
    financially support her when she was in Kumasi.  She said if  she  ever
    ran out of money the Sponsor would give her money.  She said  he  would
    give her top-ups if she needed them.

 9. She was asked about going to Accra  when  her  studies  in  Kumasi  had
    ended.  She was asked where she had stayed there and she said  she  had
    stayed on campus and that her mother was also in Accra.  She  said  her
    mother stayed too far away from her college for her to stay  with  her.
    She said she had then done her national service at the polytechnic from
    2008 to 2009 and had then  done  voluntary  service  as  a  teacher  in
    Kumasi.

10. She was referred to money transfers in 2011 and 2012 and it was put  to
    her that some of the slips show the  beneficiary's  name  as  different
    from her name.  She said they are all made out to  her  but  there  are
    some typing errors.  She was asked how she collects the money when  her
    Sponsor sends it to her from the United Kingdom and she said  she  goes
    to the transfer office to collect the money.  She said she  just  needs
    to mention her Sponsor's name and her name to get the money.

11. The Presenting Officer questioned her asking her if Samila  and  Samira
    are different people.  She said they are not.  She  said  her  name  is
    Samira and Samila is just a typing mistake.  She was asked if  she  has
    other family members with that name and she said she has not.

12. It was put to her that at the First-tier hearing she told the  Tribunal
    that her mother gave her around ï¿½100 a month.  She said her mother gave
    her this if she asked for it but her mother was not the main  provider.
    At paragraph 11 of the determination it  is  written  that  her  mother
    financially supported the Appellant in Kumasi until she came to the UK.
     She said that her cousin was the main provider as her mother does  not
    have much money.  She said if  the  money  from  her  Sponsor  had  not
    arrived on time she would get money from her mother.  This is different
    to the evidence she gave at the First-tier hearing.

13. The Appellant was asked when she had been studying in  Kumasi  and  she
    said from 2003 and then in  2004  and  2005.   She  said  she  did  her
    national service from 2008 to  2009  and  then  spent  one  year  doing
    voluntary service.  She said that lasted until 2010.

14. In paragraph 26(b) of the determination it is stated that the appellant
    thought her Sponsor's financial support began in 2010.   The  Appellant
    said that is not correct.  It was put to her if  that  is  correct  her
    mother must have supported her  until  2010.   She  said  that  is  not
    correct.  She said her Sponsor supported her when she was at  secondary
    school as well as later.

15. The Appellant was referred to the  supplementary  bundle  and  she  was
    asked if she had finished her Bachelors Degree.  She said she got a 2:1
    pass.

16. The Appellant was asked about her visit to the United Kingdom  in  2012
    on a visit visa.  This visa was granted on appeal and the determination
    was promulgated on 30th May 2012.  At paragraph  11  Judge  Dineen  who
    heard the case states, "The Appellant has done well in  her  education.
    She is currently engaged in pursuing a course for a Bachelors Degree in
    Procurement Management at Greenhill College in Accra."  It was  put  to
    the Appellant that Judge Dineen appeared to think that she  was  coming
    to the United Kingdom for a visit while she was studying in Ghana.  She
    said she completed her Degree in December 2011 but the  last  time  she
    attended a lecture was in June.  She said  she  then  had  to  write  a
    project but she did not require to go to any more lectures.  She  could
    not remember when  she  finished  her  lectures.   She  said  had  been
    studying at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration
    (GIMPA).  She said this is also called the Greenhill College.

17. The Appellant said she came to the United Kingdom on  1st  August  2012
    and she was asked how she managed to submit her final report if she was
    in the United Kingdom in August.  She said she had  actually  completed
    her studies in December 2011 and then had done her project from January
    until June 2012 but she had no classes.  She said she had not  gone  to
    the graduation because she had been in the  United  Kingdom.   She  was
    asked if she had intended to return for her studies and  she  said  she
    needed a certificate and had paid the fees and had  had  to  return  to
    pick up the certificate.

18. The Appellant was asked when she had lived with her  Sponsor  in  Ghana
    and she said that after her GCSEs, which she finished in 2000, she went
    to Kumasi.  She said in 2001 she started at  senior  secondary  school.
    She was asked if she has any documents to show that she was  in  Kumasi
    in 2000.  She said she has her school results for 2001 to 2003.   There
    is a letter in the supplementary bundle from  Aduman  Secondary  School
    and some results from Kumasi Polytechnic.

19. There was no re-examination.

20. A second witness took the stand being the Sponsor, Nazir Tchelenon.  He
    asked that his two statements be used as evidence for the hearing.   He
    was asked how the Appellant was supported financially in Shona  and  he
    said that when she came from Accra to stay with his mother  in  Kumasi,
    (which was not long after he went to Germany) she relied on his mother.
     He said his father had a lot of responsibilities so he,  the  Sponsor,
    supported his mother and therefore supported the Appellant.  He said he
    sent her money and he was asked if she got any other financial support.
     He said he was the main Sponsor.  He said she could not ask his father
    and so she depended on him and his mother.

21. The witness said that when money is transferred officially a fee has to
    be paid so he used to give money to friends to take to  the  Appellant.
    At the First-tier hearing it was stated  that  he  sent  money  to  the
    Appellant's mother.  The witness said he does not remember that but  at
    Ramadan he would send her money.  He said her mother was not  her  main
    supporter.  He said her mother is a petty trader.  He was asked why she
    could not ask his father for money and he said she is related to him on
    his mother's side, not his father's side.  He was asked why his  mother
    was not relying on his father and he said there are a lot  of  siblings
    and he did not have enough money to give her.  He said that his  father
    did not know he was sending money to his mother.  He said his father is
    polygamist.

22. The Sponsor was asked when he left Kumasi to go to Germany and he  said
    that  was in late 2000.  It was put to him that the Appellant  did  not
    start secondary school until 2001 and he was asked if that is when  she
    moved to his parents' house and he said she moved in 2000.  He said she
    had been living in the same house as him for some months before he left
    for Germany.  He was asked if he has any documents to tie him  to  that
    address and he says he has not.  It was put to him that it  is  in  the
    Appellant's interest to say that he lived there as if he did  not  live
    there she is unlikely to succeed in her claim.  He said  that  in  2010
    and 2012 when he visited Ghana he stayed at that address.  He  said  he
    supported the Appellant when she was at Kumasi Polytechnic but  it  was
    put to him that at the First-tier hearing that is not what he told  the
    Tribunal.  At that hearing the Appellant said she  thought  he  started
    supporting her in 2010.  It was put to him that she said that was  when
    she started to do her Degree.  This is in the determination but he said
    it is not correct.  He said he was not in the  hearing  room  when  she
    said this and he thought the Presenting Officer had told  him  she  had
    been unable to remember when he started sending money to her.  He  said
    there are receipts in 2005 and 2006 so the Appellant knew at the First-
    tier hearing that he was supporting her then,  so  why  would  she  say
    2010.

23. The witness was asked who Samila is and he said that is  the  Appellant
    and that her proper name is Samira.  He said there is always a code  on
    the receipts and if you give the code you get the money  even  if  your
    name is spelt wrongly.  He was asked if he sent money to  other  family
    members and he said he did not and there is no one in his family called
    Samila.

24. It was put to him that at the First-tier hearing it is written that  he
    sent money to the Appellant's mother.  He said that is not correct.

25. At the previous hearing it was put  to  him,  the  Appellant  said  her
    mother gave her ï¿½100 a month when she was in Kumasi.  He was asked what
    the money he gave her was for and he said  it  was  not  just  for  her
    education, it was for her essential needs and  he  had  not  known  her
    mother was giving her money.  He said he had thought he  was  the  only
    person giving her money and that she was solely dependent on him.

26. It was put to him that if he only started giving her money in 2010 this
    money was purely for her university education.  He said that is not the
    case and has never been the case.  He said the money was  for  clothing
    as well as for her education.

27. The witness was asked about the school year in Ghana and when  it  ends
    and he said he does  not  know  when  junior  school  ends,  he  cannot
    remember.

28. It was put to the witness that the Appellant came to the United Kingdom
    on a visit visa in  2012.   He  was  asked  if  she  had  finished  her
    university education at that time and he said  when  she  came  to  the
    United Kingdom she was in her final year and she  graduated  that  year
    but had been unable to attend the graduation  ceremony.   He  said  she
    came to the United Kingdom in August 2012.

29. There was no re-examination.

30. The Presenting Officer made his  submissions  relying  on  the  refusal
    letter of 10th July  2013.   I  was  asked  to  consider  the  previous
    determinations.  He submitted that the evidence is muddled.

31. He submitted that it is not clear when the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor
    lived in the same household he submitted that in 2000 they did not live
    together.  There is no documentary evidence which supports this and all
    the appellant is relying on is vague oral evidence.  He submitted  that
    the oral evidence is self-serving and should be given little weight.

32. With regard to dependency he submitted that this is the live  issue  in
    this  appeal.   He  referred  to  paragraph  10   of   the   First-tier
    determination promulgated on 15th May 2014.  In this  paragraph  it  is
    stated that the Appellant's mother gave her around ï¿½100 per month.   At
    paragraph 11 it is stated that her  mother  financially  supported  her
    while she was living in Kumasi until she came to  the  United  Kingdom.
    At paragraph 26(b) he submitted that  the  Appellant  states  that  the
    Sponsor's financial support began in  2010.   He  submitted  that  this
    corresponds with her studies at Accra but it contradicts her  Sponsor's
    evidence.  He  states  that  he  has  supported  her  since  2006.   At
    paragraph 26(b) reference is made to receipts for remittances  in  2005
    and 2006 from the Sponsor to the Appellant.  In this  paragraph  it  is
    written that  the  Appellant  collected  this  money  in  Accra,  which
    suggests that she was living with her mother during  this  period.   In
    spite of this the Sponsor is now stating that he is  the  sole  Sponsor
    and he gave money to the Appellant and  to  his  mother.   The  Sponsor
    states that her mother might have given the Appellant some money if she
    needed it.  He submitted that there are inconsistencies throughout this
    evidence.

33. I was referred to my error of law determination.  Paragraph  26  states
    "Due to  the  fact  that  the  evidence  given  today  by  the  Sponsor
    contradicts much of what was before the judge."  The Presenting Officer
    submitted that that is the case and based  on  what  was  before  Judge
    Stokes there is not sufficient evidence of dependency by the  Appellant
    on the Sponsor.

34. I was referred to the case of Lim  (EEA  dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  437
    (IAC). The Presenting Officer submitted that if  the  remittances  only
    started in 2010 when the Appellant started going to  university  it  is
    difficult to see how this Appellant  has  been  dependent  on  her  EEA
    Sponsor in terms of the EEA Regulations.

35. I was asked to dismiss the appeal.

36. Counsel for the Appellant made his submissions  submitting  that  there
    has been prior dependency in this case.  The issue is  whose  household
    the Appellant was living in and he submitted  that  she  lived  in  the
    Sponsor's household for a few months before he left Ghana and  went  to
    Germany.  He submitted that the Sponsor then visited Ghana in 2010  and
    2012 and stayed in the same house  in  Kumasi  as  the  Appellant.   He
    submitted that the sponsor's parents live in that house.  He  submitted
    that there are no discrepancies in the evidence.

37. Counsel referred to the Sponsor's evidence.  The sponsor states that he
    is the person who is  financially  supporting  the  Appellant.   I  was
    referred to the transfer slips in 2005 and  2006  showing  money  being
    given to the Appellant by the Sponsor.  He submitted that  the  Sponsor
    used to send money  to  his  mother  and  she  would  use  it  for  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant then  went  to  the  polytechnic  and  I  was
    referred to paragraph 11 of the Appellant's supplementary statement  in
    which she states that she and her cousin stay in the same  family  home
    when he visits Ghana.  He submitted that  when  the  Appellant  was  in
    Kumasi attending the polytechnic from 2005 until 2008 the  Sponsor  was
    sending her money.  He submitted that all of this  is  consistent  with
    the Sponsor's evidence.

38. Counsel submitted that the Sponsor was sending money to his mother.  He
    gave a reasonable explanation of why his father was unable  to  support
    her - he had polygamous marriages.  He  submitted  that  the  Appellant
    could not obtain money from the Sponsor's father as she is only related
    to the Sponsor on her mother's side.

39. Counsel submitted that when the Appellant was  in  Kumasi  she  was  at
    senior secondary school and her mother was in Accra.  I  was  asked  to
    take into account the documents from Kumasi dated 2003 and 2004 and  he
    submitted that she went to the polytechnic in 2005.  He submitted  that
    it is not correct that her mother sent her ï¿½100 a month.  He  submitted
    that the Appellant's evidence is that when the Sponsor's money was  not
    enough she would get money from her mother.  I was asked to give weight
    to the Sponsor's evidence when he stated that he  thought  he  was  the
    only person who supported her.   He  submitted  that  at  least  twenty
    percent of the Appellant's living expenses were paid  by  the  Sponsor.
    He submitted that this claim comes within the  Regulations  and  I  was
    asked to give considerable weight to the transfer slips dated 2005  and
    2006.  I was also asked to give weight to the Sponsor's  evidence  that
    he would give money to friends to take to the  Appellant  and  that  he
    sent her clothes as well.

40. Counsel submitted that the Sponsor came  to  the  United  Kingdom  from
    Germany in 2010.  He submitted that if I do not accept that  she  falls
    within the Regulations and even if I find  she  was  supported  by  her
    mother, she became dependent when she started her military  service  in
    Accra.  I was referred to the money transfers in 2011 which  were  sent
    to Accra.  The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2012.

41. Counsel submitted that even if I found that dependency started in 2010,
    this was two years before the appellant came to the United Kingdom  and
    she therefore was dependent on her Sponsor in 2010.

42. I was referred to the said case of Lim which refers to essential needs.
     Counsel submitted that education  is  an  essential  requirement.   He
    submitted that secondary  education  is  free  in  Ghana  so  when  the
    Appellant states that she was financially supported by her mother,  her
    mother was not paying any  course  fees  while  she  was  at  secondary
    school.  He submitted that the money she got from the Sponsor  in  2010
    was for her material and essential needs.

43. Counsel submitted that the judge at the First-tier hearing thought that
    the Appellant was living with her mother in Accra but she was  not  she
    was living in a hostel.  I was referred to paragraph 26(b) of the First-
    tier determination in which this is stated.  He submitted that this  is
    an error of fact.  He submitted that the money  from  the  Sponsor  was
    sent to her for her fees and her living expenses.  I  was  referred  to
    the transfer slip for payments made in 2011 and 2012 and I was asked to
    take into account the overall picture and find that the  Appellant  was
    supported by the Sponsor before she came to the United Kingdom as  well
    as in the United Kingdom.  Counsel submitted that there is  irrefutable
    evidence of dependency from 2010.

44. I was referred to the visit visa appeal determination in 2012.  Counsel
    submitted that in 2011 three visit visas were refused but the appeal in
    May 2012 was allowed.  I was asked to accept that before the  appellant
    came to the United Kingdom she had completed everything in  her  Degree
    apart from her project and had no classes to attend.

45. Counsel submitted that there are no discrepancies in the  evidence  and
    that essential support was given to the Appellant by  her  Sponsor  and
    her appeal should be allowed under the Regulations.  He submitted  that
    the Appellant is an extended family member of an EEA  national  and  is
    entitled to a residence card.

Determination

46. The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the standard  of  proof  is
    the balance of probabilities.

47. I am first of all considering the visit visa determination, promulgated
    in May 2012.  The Sponsor gave evidence at that hearing and  he  stated
    that he would be paying for her  visit  to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Sponsor indicated to the judge during that hearing that  the  Appellant
    was currently engaged in pursuing a course for a  Bachelors  Degree  in
    Procurement Management at Greenhill  College  in  Accra.   The  Sponsor
    stated that because she was doing well he would give her  a  treat  and
    let her have a visit to the United Kingdom.  He stated  that  he  would
    pay the cost of her airfare and would pay for anything she did  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He stated that the Appellant's intention was to return
    to Ghana at the end of the visit as she  had  every  reason  to  return
    there because she was doing well educationally in  Ghana  and  had  the
    prospect of employment there.  He said that she lived in a family  home
    with a large number of family members.

48. Then we have the First-tier determination, relating to her  application
    for an EEA residence card, which was  allowed  by  Judge  Stokes.   Her
    application was as a family member of Mr Tchelenon,  an  EEA  national.
    For success in this application the Appellant had  to  show  she  is  a
    relative of an EEA national, in this case a cousin, and she had to show
    dependency on that EEA national in the country she comes from, as  well
    as in the United Kingdom.  Based on the evidence before Judge Stokes he
    found that her application met the terms of Regulation 8  of  the  2006
    Regulations.  He found that the  Appellant  should  be  issued  with  a
    residence card.  The Respondent appealed that decision and I  found  on
    5th September 2014 that there was an error of law in the  determination
    in that the evidence before the judge indicated that  the  Sponsor  had
    not been responsible for the Appellant's essential  needs  although  he
    was responsible for her university education.  I  also  found  in  this
    determination that the evidence given to me at the  Upper-tier  hearing
    was different from the evidence given to Judge Stokes.

49. There are a number of contradictions in the Appellant's  evidence.   At
    the hearing before Judge Stokes she stated that she thought the Sponsor
    started to support her financially in 2010. The only  receipts  showing
    sums paid by the Sponsor to the Appellant before that were two receipts
    in 2005 and three in 2006.  Then there is a gap until September 2011.

50. Although the appellant stated she was living in the Sponsor's  father's
    household in Kumasi when she was at secondary and tertiary school,  she
    stated that she was receiving financial support from her  mother.   She
    then pursued a course for a Bachelors Degree in Procurement  Management
    at Greenhill College in Accra.  The  judge  found  that  she  would  be
    living with her mother  at  that  time  and  being  supported  by  her,
    particularly as her mother had always financially supported  her  until
    she arrived in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant and the  Sponsor  are
    now saying that that is not the case.  She was staying in a hostel when
    she was in Accra.  It is clear that the judge took the Appellant at her
    word when she said the Sponsor had started supporting her in 2010.   He
    then considered the receipts after that time, of funds sent to  her  by
    the Sponsor.  At paragraph 26(c) Judge Stokes states that there was  no
    mention at her visit  visa  appeal  in  2012  that  the  Appellant  was
    financially dependent on her Sponsor, only that he was funding the cost
    of her travel and would  pay  for  her  accommodation  and  maintenance
    during her visit to the UK.  This is significant.

51. It is not credible that  Judge  Stokes  could  have  misunderstood  the
    evidence about her mother supporting her or that when she started doing
    her Bachelors Degree she was supported by her mother  and  living  with
    her mother.  If she had stated at that hearing that she was staying  in
    a hostel in Accra the judge would not have come to the  conclusions  he
    did, so it seems that the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  are  trying  to
    embellish their evidence to show that the Appellant  was  dependent  on
    her Sponsor in Ghana and is still dependent on him.  Based on these two
    determinations I do not believe that is the case.

52. In my error of law determination in September 2014 I  have  noted  that
    Judge Stokes found that the Sponsor's remittances to the Appellant were
    required for school fees and additional expenses  in  relation  to  her
    education.   The judge found that that was sufficient  for  her  to  be
    granted her residence permit but I found this to be an  error  of  law.
    The issue is prior dependency and in  Judge  Stoke's  determination  he
    found  that  the  Sponsor  also  supported   the   Appellant's   mother
    financially but the sponsor is stating that that is not  the  case.   I
    found it credible that the Sponsor remitted funds to the Appellant  for
    school fees and additional  expenses  relating  to  her  education  but
    university costs and school fees are not essential needs.  Based on the
    evidence before Judge Stokes essential needs such as food, clothing and
    accommodation were provided by the Appellant's mother.   I  found  that
    the remittances in 2005  and  2006  were  too  remote  to  be  relevant
    relating to prior dependency before the Appellant came to the UK.   The
    Sponsor stated that friends took money to the  Appellant  but  none  of
    these friends came to court to give evidence and none of  them  gave  a
    statement.

53. The evidence given before me at  the  error  of  law  hearing  and  the
    evidence given before me today  are  substantially  different  to  that
    given to Judge Stokes.  Based on what was before me this Appellant  was
    not dependent on her Sponsor before she came  to  the  United  Kingdom.
    There is no prior dependency although there is present dependency.  The
    Appellant and the Sponsor are both bolstering the case in an attempt to
    show prior dependency but I find the changes in  the  evidence  give  a
    lack of credibility to the evidence throughout this claim.

54. Much of  the  evidence  given  before  me  in  August  2014  and  today
    contradicts the evidence given to Judge Stokes.  There is  insufficient
    evidence to show prior dependency.

Determination

55. Because of the contradictory evidence from both witnesses  there  is  a
    lack of credibility to this Appellant's claim.  I find that this  claim
    cannot meet the terms of the EEA Regulations.

56. The burden of proof has not been discharged.   This  Appellant  is  not
    entitled to an EEA residence card as the extended family member  of  Mr
    Nazir Tchelenon.

Notice of Decision

57. I dismiss the appeal.

58. Anonymity has not been directed.
