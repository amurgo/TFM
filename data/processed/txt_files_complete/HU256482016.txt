For the respondent:          Mr I. Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's  decision  dated  09  November
    2016 to refuse a human rights claim. The appellant  did  not  meet  the
    'Eligibility' requirement for leave as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM
    because his wife was not a British citizen and was not settled  in  the
    UK. It would be reasonable to expect the appellant's wife and child  to
    live with him in Pakistan or Bangladesh (her country of nationality).


Error of law

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey ("the judge") dismissed the appeal  in
    a decision promulgated on 21 June 2018. It is not necessary to set  out
    the decision in any detail given that the parties agree that the  judge
    erred in law for the following broad reasons:

      i) The judge failed to consider the fact that the appellant's wife had
         ILR at the date of the hearing. This changed the assessment of  the
         requirements under the rules.


     ii) As a consequence, the judge failed to consider  paragraph  EX.1  of
         Appendix FM.


    iii) The judge failed to conduct a structured approach to  his  findings
         under the rules or outside the rules. The findings that  were  made
         were inadequate.


     iv) The Upper Tribunal observed that no findings were made in  relation
         to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
         ("the NIAA 2002") and in particular to the test of 'reasonableness'
         under section 117B(6).

3.    The Upper Tribunal agreed with the parties that the decision  involved
    the making of an error of law and that the First-tier Tribunal decision
    should be set aside.

Remaking

4.    Mr Jarvis accepted that the situation had moved on  since  the  First-
    tier Tribunal hearing. The couple now have a second child, who is  also
    a British citizen. Since the appellant's partner is in  the  middle  of
    her PhD studies he found that it was not right to  pursue  an  argument
    that the family should be  separated.  He  submitted  that  the  appeal
    should be remade and allowed.

5.    It is not necessary for me to go into  the  same  detail  as  I  would
    normally do in remaking the  decision  given  the  concession  made  on
    behalf of the respondent. There has never been  any  dispute  that  the
    appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with his  partner
    or the children. The couple were living together in a relationship akin
    to marriage for a period of at least two years before the date  of  the
    application. It is accepted that the appellant's partner has  now  been
    granted Indefinite Leave to Remain and is therefore settled in  the  UK
    for the purpose of the 'Relationship' requirement contained in Appendix
    FM. That requirement is not limited to the  date  of  the  application.
    Because  the  appellant  was  an  overstayer  he  does  not  meet   the
    'Immigration Status' requirement and can only rely on paragraph EX.1 of
    Appendix FM. Mr Jarvis submitted that this should include consideration
    of  whether  there  are  'insurmountable  obstacles'  to   the   couple
    continuing  their  family  life  outside  the  UK  and  whether  it  is
    'reasonable' to expect the two British children to leave the UK.

6.    It is in the interests of the  children  to  be  brought  up  by  both
    parents in the UK where they can benefit from the advantages  of  their
    citizenship. Separation from one  or  other  parent  is  not  in  their
    interests. The interests of the children are  a  primary  consideration
    although not the only consideration. Significant weight should be given
    to  the  interests  of  British  children  or  those  who   have   been
    continuously resident in the UK for a period of at least  seven  years.
    Although the appellant has not had leave to remain  since  30  November
    2008, and there are some question  marks  surrounding  his  immigration
    history, the respondent accepts that any public interest considerations
    are outweighed by the individual  circumstances  of  this  case.  I  am
    satisfied that the interests of the two British children are such  that
    it is not reasonable to expect them to leave  to  the  UK  to  maintain
    their  family  life  with  both  parents.   The  appellant  meets   the
    requirements of paragraph EX.1 of the immigration rules, which is  said
    to reflect the respondent's position on where a fair balance is  struck
    under Article 8 of the European Convention.

7.    I conclude that the removal of the appellant would be  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
    of law

The decision is set aside
