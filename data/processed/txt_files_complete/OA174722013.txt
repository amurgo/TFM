                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 20th July 1990 is a citizen of  Bangladesh.   The
    Appellant was represented by Mr Brown of Counsel.  The  Respondent  was
    represented by Miss Johnstone, a Home Office Presenting Officer.



Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had made application for entry clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of Mr Fahem under Appendix FM of the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Respondent had refused that application  for  a  number  of
    reasons as outlined in paragraph 3 of the judge's  determination.   The
    Appellant had appealed that decision and her appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge McAll sitting at Manchester on 4th July 2014.   The
    judge had dismissed the appeal under both the Immigration Rules and  on
    human rights grounds.

 3. The Appellant had made application to appeal  that  decision  and  that
    application was initially refused  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Murray on 25th September 2014.  The judge gave full  reasons  for
    his  decision  to  refuse.   The  application  was  then  repeated  and
    permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Bruce
    on 20th February 2015 on the basis that it was  arguable  the  Tribunal
    had failed to consider the nature of the marriage within an appropriate
    cultural context under GA [2006] UKAIT 00046.

 4. The Respondent had opposed the appeal but somewhat unusually within the
    response letter had themselves pointed to  what  was  said  to  be  two
    separate errors of law made by the judge in terms of his  consideration
    of an English language certificate and maintenance generally.  In  many
    ways therefore this was an application made by both  parties  asserting
    an error of law had been made by the judge.  Directions were set for me
    consider firstly whether an error of law had been made and  the  matter
    comes before me in accordance with those directions.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

 5. Mr Brown submitted in terms of the Grounds of Appeal that the judge had
    failed to consider the cultural background of the parties in accordance
    with the guidance in GA Ghana [2006] and Goudey [2012] UKUT 00041.   It
    was submitted that the demonstration of contact was sufficient to  show
    that the marriage was subsisting.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

 6. Miss Johnstone submitted that no error had been made by  the  judge  in
    his conclusion that this was not a genuine and subsisting marriage.  In
    terms of essentially a cross-application it was  submitted  that  as  a
    result of the two refusal letters and the review letter  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager it was entirely clear that two matters had  been  put
    in  issue  namely  whether  the  Appellant  met  the  English  language
    requirement and secondly maintenance and the proof of documentation  in
    support of income.  It was submitted the judge had not dealt adequately
    or at all with those two matters.

 7. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision to consider
    the submissions and the documents provided.



Decision and Reasons

 8. It was agreed evidence in this case that a  valid  marriage  had  taken
    place between the Appellant and the Sponsor on 28th March 2012.  It was
    further agreed that  following  that  marriage  the  parties  had  been
    together until the Sponsor returned to the UK on 14th April 2012.   The
    issue taken by the Respondent was that there was  an  insufficiency  of
    evidence of direct or indirect contact since April 2012 to  demonstrate
    that this was a subsisting marriage.

 9. The date of decision in this case is 1st July  2014.   The  application
    had been made as early as May 2013 and  although  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal was dated 4th August 2013 that did not decide on all
    issues because the Entry Clearance Officer in this case (as occurred in
    many cases) postponed a decision on the financial income  threshold  to
    await an outcome of the appeal in the  case  of  MM.   The  second  and
    concluding refusal letter and the Entry Clearance Manager's review took
    place on 1st July 2014.

10. The judge had found for reasons given at paragraphs 17 to 25 that  this
    was not a subsisting marriage.  In particular at paragraph  21  he  had
    found that the Appellant had failed  to  establish  that  she  had  had
    regular contact with the Sponsor since  the  date  of  their  marriage.
    That, on the evidence available was inaccurate.  There was evidence  of
    indirect contact and evidence of financial  support  for  a  period  of
    about twelve months from August 2013 to about May 2014.  Further  there
    had been a visit to the Appellant in Bangladesh for a six  week  period
    in September/October 2013.

11. It is in respect of this visit that the grounds criticise the judge for
    not considering GA  on  the  basis  that  had  the  marriage  not  been
    subsisting then within the culture of Bangladesh the parties would  not
    have lived together.  In GA at paragraph 14 the Upper Tribunal stated:-



         "An Immigration Judge when  the  subsistence  of  a  marriage  will
         plainly have to bear in mind the  cultural  context  and  the  wide
         differences that exist between individual  lifestyles,  whether  by
         choice, or by circumstances, or by  economic  necessity.   He  will
         also be able to put the claim into the context of  the  history  of
         the relationship and to assess whether  and  to  what  extent  this
         illuminates the nature of the  parties'  present  relationship  and
         future intentions."

    Quite understandably  there  is  no  expansion  on  that  loose  phrase
    cultural context and it seems clear from paragraph 14  of  GA  and  the
    context in which it was written that  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  merely
    stating the point that whilst it may be difficult to assess what is  in
    the minds of individuals that is nevertheless a task for an Immigration
    Judge to perform.  The culture of a particular country or  race  is  an
    extremely difficult matter.   On  the  one  hand  there  are  no  doubt
    individuals, and there may be many,  who  defy  cultural  expectations.
    Secondly to assume that all or most individuals fit into the stereotype
    of a perceived culture is potentially patronising and speculative.

12. In this case it was agreed that the Appellant and Sponsor  had  entered
    into an arranged marriage in 2012 and that at the time of the Sponsor's
    visit to Bangladesh in September/October 2013 they remained married and
    the visit came a few months after the Appellant's application  to  join
    her husband in the UK.  The fact that the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  may
    have lived together in September/October 2013 at a time when  they  are
    lawfully married seems hardly worthy of note and the Grounds of  Appeal
    are merely speculative and misconceived.

13. However the judge in this case does not appear to have taken any or any
    proper account of that visit and seems to be demanding a rather  strict
    and significant level of evidence  to  demonstrate  continuing  contact
    between the parties over what is a  relatively  short  period  and  set
    against the accepted background that the parties had entered  into  and
    remained within a valid legal marriage.  There was an error of law made
    in the judge failing to adequately take account of the  visit  and  the
    evidence of  contact  available  and  to  give  that  due  weight  when
    considering the question of subsistence of the marriage.

14. The Respondent raises two features within the  decision  in  submitting
    the judge made errors of law unrelated to the above matter.  Firstly it
    is said the judge failed to take account of  the  relevant  Immigration
    Rules in  Appendix  FM  relating  to  proof  of  the  English  language
    requirements.  It was agreed evidence that the Appellant had  taken  an
    English language test at a test centre in Bangladesh,  but  because  of
    general concerns as to the reliability of that particular  test  centre
    the Respondent had not validated that test but instead had offered  the
    Appellant an opportunity of taking a fresh test free  of  charge.   The
    Appellant had  availed  herself  of  that  opportunity  and  the  judge
    referred to an email sent by the  Appellant's  solicitors  claiming  to
    enclose a photocopy of the relevant test certificate.   The  Respondent
    in their response state that that certificate was neither seen  by  the
    Presenting Officer or judge and referred to the  email  being  sent  in
    July 2014 and accordingly that was evidence postdating the decision  in
    August 2013.  The judge had relied on the email and the Appellant's own
    evidence to conclude that the test certificate had  been  sent  to  the
    Respondent.  Whilst it is understandable the  judge  would  assume  the
    certificate had been attached to the email there was no  evidence  that
    the Appellant had passed the test to the appropriate level required nor
    had either the Respondent, Presenting Officer, or  the  judge  seen  an
    original certificate and to that extent the Appellant had not  complied
    with the Immigration Rules and it was an error for the  judge  to  have
    found that she had done so.  The point made by the Respondent that  the
    test  certificate  postdates  the  date   of   decision   is   entirely
    misconceived.  Firstly, as indicated above the decision  in  this  case
    was only concluded on 1st July 2014 and  in  any  event  in  the  Entry
    Clearance  Manager's  review  letter  he  had  explicitly  invited  the
    Appellant to retake a test free of charge, and in  those  circumstances
    to refuse to accept any evidence proffered from that test would be both
    unfair and dishonest.  At  the  hearing  before  me  I  was  shown  the
    original test certificates.  As I  indicated  to  the  parties  at  the
    hearing if I found errors of law had  been  made  in  this  case  which
    necessitated a rehearing it would be a matter of  good  sense  for  the
    Respondent prior to that hearing to examine the  original  certificates
    to see whether that remained an issue.

15. Secondly, the Respondent notes that  the  judge  provided  no  adequate
    reason for accepting the remarkable increase in the Appellant's  salary
    just prior to the application and thereby allowing him  to  succeed  on
    the income  threshold  and  by  inference  the  presentation  documents
    required under Appendix FM-SE for the requisite  period  prior  to  the
    date of application.

16. The date of application in this case was May 2013 and it was  therefore
    necessary for the Sponsor to demonstrate at the date of application  he
    had an annual income of �18,600 or more.  Further under Appendix  FM-SE
    it was necessary for him  to  produce  the  required  documentation  to
    support that claimed income for the six month period prior to the  date
    of application.  It appears  plain  when  looking  at  the  Appellant's
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the documents provided
    by the Appellant did not cover the relevant six  months  prior  to  the
    date of application.  Furthermore the P60 for the tax year  April  2013
    to April 2014, namely the year after the Appellant's application and at
    a time when the Appellant it is said had had a substantial increase  in
    salary discloses an income of �16,032.87.

17. Unfortunately the  judge  dealt  very  superficially  with  the  income
    requirements under Appendix FM and the documentary  requirements  under
    Appendix FM-SE.  This was a case where both the claimed level of income
    and the available supporting documentary evidence  as  required  needed
    careful examination.  There has been an inadequate examination of  that
    income level and supporting documentation which on the face of it would
    seem to suggest that at the relevant time the Sponsor  failed  to  meet
    the income  threshold  and  that  documents  produced  in  support  are
    documents that postdate the relevant period required under Appendix FM-
    SE.

18. For all the above reasons I find that material errors of law were  made
    in this decision such that the decision as a whole is  rendered  unsafe
    and needs to be remade afresh.

Notice of Decision

I find that material errors of law were made in this case and set aside  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal and direct that this  decision  is  made
afresh.
