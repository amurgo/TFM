Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO). However, for  the
   purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the ECO as the respondent and
   Ms Heydari as the appellant, reflecting their positions as they  were  in
   the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, born on 6 September  1992.  On
   15 August 2012 she applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a
   partner under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM of the immigration rules.
   Her application was refused on 12 November 2012 on the grounds  that  she
   could not meet the financial requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.1  since
   her sponsor's gross annual income  was  below  that  required  under  the
   rules.

3. The appellant lodged an appeal against  that  decision,  stating  in  her
   grounds of appeal that her husband had since obtained a new job  and  was
   earning well above the gross annual income required under the rules.

4. The appellant's appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal on 23  January
   2014 and was allowed in a determination promulgated on 6  February  2014.
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray heard oral evidence from the sponsor who
   provided details of  his  employment,  which  consisted  of  working  for
   Domino's Pizza from 14 July 2011 until October 2012;  for  Swindon  Kebab
   House from 1 November 2012 until the end of April 2013;  and  as  a  taxi
   driver from 1 May  2013.  He  also  explained  that  his  wife  was  from
   Afghanistan but was resident in Pakistan. He had met her in Pakistan  and
   was with her for six months at the time he married her and for two  weeks
   when she put in  her  application,  but  had  otherwise  never  lived  in
   Pakistan. He was from Afghanistan and had come to the United  Kingdom  in
   2004 and become a British citizen in 2008. He could not live in  Pakistan
   because there was genocide against his people, the Hazara,  although  his
   wife was Hazara but, being a woman, had not had problems.

5. The judge found that the sponsor's gross annual income  at  the  relevant
   time was below the threshold required in the rules and that the appellant
   was  therefore  unable  to  meet  the  financial  requirements   of   the
   immigration rules. She could not be satisfied,  on  the  evidence  before
   her, that the appellant was able to meet the lower  gross  annual  income
   threshold suggested by Blake J in MM v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
   Department [2013] EWHC 1900. However she allowed the appeal under Article
   8 on the grounds that the sponsor could not reasonably move  to  Pakistan
   to enjoy his family life there because the situation for the  Hazaras  in
   Quetta was extremely dangerous and it would unduly harsh to expect him to
   relocate to Pakistan.

6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had  failed  to   identify   compelling
   circumstances not recognised by the rules, pursuant to  the  guidance  in
   Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT
   640 and that the outcome of the  respondent's  decision  was  not  unduly
   harsh.

7. Permission to appeal was granted on 15 April 2014.

Appeal hearing and submissions

8. The appeal came before me on 18 July 2014. There  was  no  appearance  by
   the sponsor or any other party on behalf of the appellant. However, in  a
   letter dated 14 July  2014,  the  sponsor  made  written  submissions  in
   response to the grant  of  permission,  submitting  that  the  judge  had
   identified compelling circumstances.

9. I considered there to be no reason why the appeal could  not  proceed  in
   the sponsor's absence, as he was clearly aware of the  hearing  date  and
   had put forward written submissions. I heard submissions from Ms  Everett
   who referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  MM  (Lebanon)  &
   Ors, R (on the  application  of)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ 985 confirming the  lawfulness  of  the
   provisions in the rules relating to the required level  of  gross  annual
   income. She submitted that, in concluding that  compelling  circumstances
   existed not sufficiently recognised under the rules and in  allowing  the
   appeal on that basis, the judge ignored the fact that she had found  that
   the  appellant  would  have  been  able  to  meet  the  income  threshold
   considered by Blake J in MM [2013] to be proportionate if he had produced
   the correct documents and that he could therefore have simply  re-applied
   with the correct documents. She asked me to find that there was therefore
   an error of law in  the  decision  and  that  it  should  be  re-made  by
   dismissing the appeal.

Consideration and findings

10. There is no challenge to the judge's finding that  the  appellant  could
   not meet the requirements of the immigration rules and it is  indeed  the
   case that she could not, on the basis of the evidence before the judge in
   regard to her husband's gross annual income at  the  relevant  time.  The
   Court of Appeal in MM has confirmed the lawfulness of the rules  in  that
   respect and overturned the judgment of  Blake  J  in  the  Administrative
   Court in regard to his findings on the ultra vires nature  of  the  rules
   and with respect to Article 8.

11. The respondent challenges the judge's findings on Article  8,  asserting
   that she failed to identify compelling circumstances justifying the grant
   of entry clearance outside the rules. It is the case that she did in fact
   refer to certain circumstances which she found to be  compelling,  namely
   the danger faced by the Hazara in Quetta. However I do not  consider  her
   findings in that respect to be sustainable for two reasons. Firstly,  her
   findings failed to address the evidence that the  sponsor  had  lived  in
   Quetta for six months at the time of his marriage without any significant
   problems, but in any event referred only to Hazaras in Quetta and  failed
   to consider the possibility of  the  appellant  being  able  to  maintain
   family life with her husband in another part of  Pakistan.  Secondly,  in
   concluding that the outcome of the respondent's  decision  was  that  the
   sponsor would be required to live in Pakistan in order that  family  life
   be maintained, she failed to consider that it was in  fact  open  to  the
   appellant to make  a  fresh  application  supported  by  the  documentary
   evidence demonstrating her ability to meet the financial requirements  of
   the rules in the light of her husband's new gross  annual  income,  which
   was claimed to be well in excess of the ï¿½18,600 threshold.

12. For those reasons I find that the  judge  erred  in  law  and  that  her
   decision has to be set aside. In re-making the decision, it seems  to  me
   that the appeal falls to  be  dismissed  on  all  grounds  for  the  same
   reasons. The appellant was not able to meet the immigration rules at  the
   date of the respondent's decision to refuse entry clearance. It cannot be
   said that there are arguably good grounds for  granting  entry  clearance
   outside  the  rules  or  that  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
   sufficiently recognised under the rules, when  it  is  claimed  that  the
   appellant can now meet the financial  requirements  of  the  rules,  with
   respect to her husband's income, and that she can  simply  make  a  fresh
   application to join him in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, I dismiss the
   appeal on human rights grounds as well as under the immigration rules.

DECISION

13. The making of the decision  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside and
   to that extent the appeal made by the  ECO  is  allowed.  I  re-make  the
   decision and substitute a decision dismissing Ms Heydari's appeal on  all
   grounds.
