Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Subramanium instructed by Lambeth Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Ghana and his date  of  birth  is  5  May
    1975.  He entered the UK illegally on 30 December 2007.  On  16  August
    2013 he made an application  for  a  residence  card  pursuant  to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulation 2006 on  the  basis  of
    his marriage to a French national, Maureine M A Mbika  Houbba.   It  is
    the appellant's case that he and his wife married by proxy in Ghana  on
    15 March 2013.   The application was refused by the Secretary of  State
    in a decision of 27 November 2013.  The decision maker did  not  accept
    that the marriage was recognised in Ghana or  that  the  appellant  had
    established that he had a durable relationship with the sponsor.

2.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and his appeal was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Kanagararatnam in a decision that was promulgated on 11 September  2014
    following a hearing on 12 August 2014.  Permission was granted  to  the
    appellant to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  on
    24 October 2014 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Levin.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the  appellant  attended.
    The sponsor did not attend and the Judge asked the appellant  questions
    about this.  The Judge recorded the evidence at  [4]  and  [5]  of  his
    determination as follows:

         "4.  At he hearing the  appellant  was  present  and  after  having
             confirmed his name and address was asked by his representative
             why his sponsor spouse was not at the hearing.  He stated that
             his mother-in-law had had a fall and had to receive  emergency
             treatment, he relied on a ticket found within  the  bundle  of
             documents and asked about his own passport, stated that  there
             were copies of the passport at  pages  37  and  38  while  the
             passport itself was with the Home  Office.   Asked  about  the
             proxy marriage, he said both parties, he had,  celebrated  the
             marriage been living  with  his  spouse  since  January  2013.
             Asked why her document had stated that they  had  been  living
             together only since May, he said she comes and goes  but  only
             settled later.  Asked whether Ghanaian  proxy  marriages  were
             accepted under French law, he said they were  not.   Referring
             to the customs he said the bride and groom meet and the  bride
             and groom's family come up with certain items,  they  normally
             ask for cash, drinks or clothes.  Asked what they requested in
             this instance, he said it was �1,000 cash.  Asked when he  had
             given the money, he said he had given the money to his father,
             he had sent it at different  times,  sometime  in  2013.   His
             father had to borrow some money as well.  Asked how much money
             he sent, he said he sent �300 while his father had  to  borrow
             �700.  Asked about celebrations  he  said  his  family  had  a
             celebration around March, asked for evidence on the  occasion,
             he said they did not take photographs  as  his  wife  was  not
             happy with the photos.  Asked why his wife had gone to see her
             mother, he said she had a fall which occurred around  the  end
             of July, she had to go to hospital as she had  broken  a  leg.
             Asked about the  hospital  record,  he  said  there  was  non-
             available up to now.  She however had broken her leg, he later
             added that it was twisted.  Asked in  re-examination  when  he
             spoke to his wife last, he said it was on Sunday.


         5.   I then asked the  appellant  who  was  present  at  the  proxy
             marriage and he said both parents were present  at  the  proxy
             marriage.  I asked him if anyone was nominated  as  his  proxy
             and he said no one had nominated for him or his  wife.   There
             were no photographs taken.  Asked where in Ghana he lived,  he
             said he lived in Accra.  Asked about  his  religion,  he  said
             that  he  was  a  Christian  and  that  the  denomination  was
             Pentecostal.  I asked him if his pastor was aware of the proxy
             marriage and he said he was.  Asked whether both the  families
             were Pentecostal, he said they were.  Asked about his marriage
             vows, he said  in  a  customary  marriage  they  do  not  have
             marriage  vows.   He  worshipped  at  the  victory  believer's
             church, which was international."

4.   The Judge went on to  make  findings  at  [8],  [9]  and  [10]  of  the
    determination as follows:-

         "8.  The burden of proof is on the appellant and  the  standard  of
             proof is on the balance of probabilities.   In  this  instance
             the appellant would have to establish that he is in a  genuine
             and legal marriage  with  the  appellant  or  that  he  is  an
             extended family member who is in a durable  relationship  with
             his EA national party who is exercising treaty rights.  I have
             heard the evidence of the appellant and note with some concern
             that the sponsor is not present at the hearing.   Produced  is
             an unsigned witness statement by the appellant, which  appears
             to have been sent  to  the  legal  representative  by  e-mail.
             Asked as to why his sponsor's wife  was  not  present  at  the
             hearing, the appellant stated that  his  mother-in-law  had  a
             fall and had broken her leg.  He said it was an  accident  and
             she had to receive emergency treatment in the hospital.  There
             were no hospital records although there was a ticket  at  page
             34 dated 2nd August 2008.


         9.   In considering  the  validity  of  the  marriage  between  the
             appellant and his EEA sponsor, it is the appellant's  evidence
             that they entered into a proxy marriage.   I  have  considered
             the law relating to proxy marriages and am able to accept that
             in accordance with the principles  of  Lexloci  in  accordance
             with CB Brazil [2008] UKAIT 00080, which sets our the required
             compliances as to  the  celebration  and  form  sufficient  to
             recognise it in Ghana in this instance.   I  have  noted  that
             there is a disillusion of the previous marriage and that there
             are registration documents, which  of  course  may  be  freely
             available in Ghana in accordance with the objective  evidence.
             My concern, nevertheless relates to the validity of the  proxy
             marriage.  It is the appellant's evidence that proxy  marriage
             in this instance was celebrated by the families.   He  however
             said no one was nominated as a proxy by him or his  wife.   He
             also stated that no photographs were taken of the  celebration
             as his wife does not like photographs.  He had no evidence  to
             offer as  to  the  celebration  of  what  would  have  been  a
             customary celebration.  Asked about the  gifts  exchanged,  he
             said they would ask for money and  in  this  instance  it  was
             �1,000 and in cross-examination said he had  sent  �300  while
             his father had to borrow �700.  He could not clearly  remember
             the time he sent the money or what other gifts were exchanged.
              His evidence on a customary marriage which would normally  be
             celebrated with a feast  was  vague  and  did  not  appear  to
             observe any of the customs.  Upon  my  asking  him  about  his
             faith, he said he was a Christian of a Pentecostal persuasion.
              He went on to say that both he and  his  partner  were  of  a
             Pentecostal persuasion and that  he  attended  an  evangelical
             church.  When I asked him about the  marriage  vows,  he  said
             that there were no marriage vows in a customary  marriage.   I
             find that the appellant has not been  able  to  reconcile  the
             conflict between his faith and customary marriages in addition
             to being unable to provide any form  of  evidence  as  to  the
             proxy marriage or the celebration.  Considering  the  lack  of
             the evidence before me, I do not find that a valid marriage in
             accordance with the customs have taken place in Ghana.


         10.  In considering whether the appellant  is  an  extended  family
             member of his EEA national partner, the appellant  has  failed
             to demonstrate that the parties have cohabited.  Having stated
             initially that they began living together in June 2013,  later
             in cross-examination he stated that she  comes  and  goes  and
             that they  had  settled  subsequently.   I  am  therefore  not
             satisfied that the appellant has demonstrated to the  required
             standard that he is in a durable  relationship  with  his  EEA
             national partner to demonstrate that he is an extended  family
             member."

5.   The Judge found that there had been no  valid  marriage  in  Ghana  and
    that the relationship was not durable and he dismissed the appeal under
    Regulations 7 and 8 of the 2006 Regulations.

The Grounds Seeking Permission to Appeal and Oral Submissions

6.   The grounds of appeal were clarified by  Mr  Subramanium  who  conceded
    that as a result of the Tribunal decisions in Kareem (proxy marriages -
    EU law) [2014] UKUT 00024 and TA  &  Others  (Kareem  explained)  Ghana
    [2014] UKUT 00316, any error of law in relation to reg 7  of  the  2006
    Regulations is not material because there was no evidence that a  proxy
    marriage is recognised under French law.

7.   Mr  Subramanium  argued  that  the  Judge's  findings  in  relation  to
    durability are unsafe because the Judge did not take into  account  the
    extensive  documentation  including  the  marriage  certificate   which
    established that a proxy marriage had taken place between  the  parties
    and that the Judge took into account irrelevant considerations  at  [9]
    where the Judge found that the appellant had not been able to reconcile
    the conflict between his faith and customary marriage.

Conclusions

8.   There are a number  of  reasons  why  the  Judge  did  not  accept  the
    durability of the relationship.  He did not accept the validity of  the
    proxy marriage. He noted that no one was nominated as a proxy  for  the
    appellant  or  his  wife,  that  registration  documents  are   readily
    available in Ghana, that no  photographs  had  been  submitted  of  the
    celebration and that the appellant's evidence was vague about gifts and
    the normal celebrations for customary  marriages.   The  Judge  made  a
    finding about the appellant's faith.  If this was an irrelevant  matter
    to take into account it is not in my view material because it was  only
    one of a number of reasons why the Judge did not accept that  here  had
    been a valid proxy marriage.  It was in no way a  determinative  factor
    in relation to the durability of the relationship and it did not make a
    material difference to the outcome of this appeal.

9.   There is no reason to suggest that the Judge did not take into  account
    the documents in support of the appeal  contained  in  the  appellant's
    bundle.  However it is clear for the reasons that the Judge  gave  that
    he did not  find  that  it  was  reliable.   There  is  no  articulated
    challenge to the Judge's findings at [10] of  the  determination.   The
    Judge did not have the  benefit  of  hearing  oral  evidence  from  the
    sponsor and I note that there was no application by  the  appellant  to
    adjourn the proceedings to enable the sponsor to attend.  The sponsor's
    witness statement was in my view insufficiently detailed.  There was an
    appellant's bundle consisting of 80 pages  to  which  the  Judge  makes
    reference at [3} of the determination indicating that he had  taken  it
    into account.

10.  There is no reason to believe that  he  did  not  do  so.   It  is  not
    necessary for the Judge to make findings on  each  piece  of  evidence.
    The Judge made findings on material areas of conflict.  His findings in
    relation to durability are reasoned, lawful and sustainable.  There  is
    no material error of law and the decision to dismiss the  appeal  under
    the 2006 Regulations, Regulation 7 and Regulation 8 is maintained.
