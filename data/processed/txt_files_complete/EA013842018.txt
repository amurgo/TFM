For the Appellant:     Mr Rashid, Counsel instructed by Carlton Law
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on the 14th March 1975. She
    appeals with permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Shand) to dismiss her appeal.

 2. The Appellant had brought an appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  against
    the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant her a permit confirming  a
    'retained' right of residence under the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 ('the Regs').  The reason  that  the  Respondent
    gave for his decision (set out in a letter dated the 16th January 2018)
    was that his previous grant of a  family  permit  notwithstanding,  the
    Respondent now believed that the Appellant's  marriage  to  her  French
    husband was a sham. As a marriage of convenience is no marriage at  all
    as far as the Regs are concerned, the application was refused.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself [at ï¿½16] as follows:

         "In relation to marriages of convenience there is no burden at  the
         outset for an applicant to demonstrate that his marriage to an  EEA
         national is not one of convenience.  The burden of proof is on  the
         respondent to adduce evidence  justifying  a  reasonable  suspicion
         that the marriage was entered into for the predominant  purpose  of
         securing residence  rights.   Only  once  the  respondent  has  put
         forward such evidence does the burden shift to  the  appellant  and
         the burden on the appellant is an evidential rather than  a  formal
         legal burden. (Papajorgi (EEA Spouse  -  marriage  of  convenience)
         Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC)).  The  standard  of  proof  is  the
         balance of probabilities".

 4. It then identified the following matters as giving rise to a reasonable
    suspicion on the part of the Respondent.  The Appellant could give only
    superficial evidence about her husband's family.  There was no credible
    explanation as to why the Appellant had not met her in-laws during  her
    three-year marriage.  The Appellant had stated that she and her husband
    both wanted children but despite having difficulties in conceiving they
    had not consulted a doctor about this.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    satisfied that these reasons  were  sufficient  to  give  rise  to  the
    'reasonable  suspicion'.   In  doing  so,  at  paragraph  18   of   the
    determination, it noted that  the  Appellant's  representative  at  the
    hearing had not disputed that the reasonable suspicion  test  had  been
    met.  It was then for the Appellant to meet this evidential  challenge.
    In order to do so she gave oral evidence.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal was not impressed.  It  found  the  Appellant's
    evidence to be hesitant and vague.  It found that the Appellant  sought
    to evade questions being put to her.  It found  numerous  discrepancies
    in her evidence.  It was, for instance, unimpressed that the  Appellant
    was not able to immediately name the witness  to  her  wedding.   After
    some hesitation she had managed to give his first name, but was unaware
    of his surname.  This was despite the fact  that  she  claims  to  have
    shared a house with this gentleman for some time  after  the  marriage.
    Further, at her interview the Appellant had suggested that her  in-laws
    had failed to attend the wedding because it was too expensive;  at  the
    hearing, she was unsure about whether her husband has in  fact  invited
    them, and explained  their  absence  by  referring  to  "transport"  or
    "work".   The  Appellant's   credibility   was   further   damaged   by
    inconsistencies  arising  in  respect  of  a  witness  who  provided  a
    statement for the hearing, Mr Anthony Membu.  Mr Membu stated  that  he
    had got to know the Appellant and her husband when they  lived  in  the
    same property in Clapham Park,  London:  "we  became  acquaintances  as
    neighbours".  At the hearing, the Appellant revealed that Anthony Membu
    was a relative of hers.  When this inconsistency was  put  to  her  the
    Appellant attempted  to  explain  it  by  saying  that  they  were  two
    different Anthony Membus.  The Tribunal rejected  this  is  nonsensical
    and was left in no doubt that it is a lie.  Having  considered  all  of
    the evidence, the first-tier Tribunal found the  legal  burden  on  the
    Respondent to be made out and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

 6. I deal with each of the appellant's grounds in turn.

 7. First, it is submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  direct
    its enquiry to the parties' intentions at the  inception  of  marriage.
    Mr Rashid submitted that the only thing that mattered was  whether  the
    Appellant and her husband had entered into the  marriage  with  genuine
    intentions.   He  submitted  that  none  of  the   reasoning   in   the
    determination was logically capable of going to that issue.

 8. Mr Rashid is of course correct to say that it is the moment of marriage
    that should be the focus of any enquiry.  That is not to say,  however,
    that evidence relating to the subsistence of the marriage  is  entirely
    irrelevant.  If an applicant is quite unable to  provide  any  detailed
    information about her spouse, or give consistent evidence  about  their
    lives together, or produce any reliable witnesses in corroboration, the
    Tribunal is plainly entitled to take those matters  into  account  when
    evaluating the credibility of the marriage  overall.   Where  Appellant
    has been found to be devoid of credibility, as this Appellant has,  the
    First-tier Tribunal is entitled to draw inferences about her intentions
    at the time that the marriage was entered into.

 9. The second ground is the complaint that the First-tier Tribunal appears
    to have overlooked the fact that  the  Appellant  had  previously  been
    issued with a family permit under the Regulations.  It is right to  say
    that this information appears nowhere in the determination.  I am  not,
    however, persuaded that this was of any particular significance in  the
    context of this appeal.  The fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    granted the Appellant a residence permit only  established  one  thing:
    that at that date on the evidence available it was  accepted  that  she
    was the wife of the EEA national concerned.  The Secretary of State was
    not bound ad infinitum to the view he took of  that  application.   The
    Secretary  of  State  is  perfectly  entitled  to  reach  a   different
    conclusion, on the basis  of  different  evidence,   in  respect  of  a
    subsequent application.  No estoppel arises here. Nor was this a  case,
    as suggested by Mr Rashid, where the Secretary of State  was  bound  by
    his own concession of fact. Each application is to assessed on its  own
    merits, and if, in a later  application  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    access to more information  than was available to him  the  first  time
    round, it is plainly right that he take that information into account.

10. The third ground relates  to  the  approach  taken  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to the burden and standard of  proof.   I  have  set  out  the
    Tribunal's self-direction above; I note that Mr Rashid  took  no  issue
    with it.  He submitted however that  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in  its
    findings about what might legitimately found a 'reasonable  suspicion'.



11. The written grounds suggest that the matters identified in the  refusal
    letter were in themselves insufficient to  discharge  this  burden.   I
    reject that.  I  have  read  the  interview  record  myself  and  I  am
    satisfied that it was reasonably open to the decision maker to conclude
    that the applicant knew very little about her husband  or  his  family.
    She did not know why he had come to live in England; she was unable  to
    say whether his parents worked or what their ethnic origins  were;  she
    did not know whether his sister was in education,  or  whether  he  had
    grandparents.  She was unsure about the name  of  the  witness  to  her
    marriage ceremony.   She was unable to say what her  husband  did  with
    his money.  It is also notable  from  the  interview  record  that  the
    applicant frequently  had  to  have  questions  repeated  or  for  very
    straightforward questions to  be  clarified.   More  significantly  the
    purposes of this appeal, it is clear from the  determination  that  the
    Appellant's representative before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  expressly
    conceded that that burden was discharged.  That, in  itself,  dispenses
    with this ground.

12. I should add that this concession also deals with  a  point  Mr  Rashid
    sought to make in his  oral  submissions,  considerably  widening  this
    ground of appeal. Mr Rashid questioned why the Respondent  had  invited
    the Appellant for interview in the  first  place.   He  suggested  that
    absent any evidence of wrongdoing, there was no justification  for  the
    interview in the first place.   I note for the record that this  ground
    was also  hopeless.  I  was  shown  no  policy  to  indicate  that  the
    Respondent will only invite applicants to interview once  a  reasonable
    suspicion  has  been  formed;  the  processes  and  systems  that   the
    Respondent has in place are, within reason, a matter for him.

13. Having read the interview, and the record of proceedings as recorded in
    the determination, I am wholly satisfied that the Respondent,  and  the
    First-tier Tribunal were entitled, on  the  evidence  before  them,  to
    conclude that the Respondent had discharged the legal burden and  shown
    this marriage to be a sham.

    Decisions

14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.

15. There is an order for anonymity.
