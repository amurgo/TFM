Representation:

For the  appellant:            Mr  J  McGirr,  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer
For the respondent:    Mr R Maloney, instructed by M K Sri & Co

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State of  the  Home  Department
      against the determination  of an Adjudicator (Dr  R  Kekic)  allowing
      under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights an  appeal
      by Mrs Rajanayagam (the claimant), a citizen of  Sri  Lanka,  against
      the decision by the Secretary of State on 15 September 2001 to refuse
      to grant leave to enter the United Kingdom.

2.    The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  20  August  2001  and
      applied for asylum at Heathrow airport on arrival.   She said she had
      flown from Colombo to Singapore, using a false passport.    She  said
      she had stayed in Singapore for 1 month and then flown to the  United
      Kingdom.   At her screening interview she said she  had  not  applied
      for asylum in any other  country  because  she  wanted  to  join  her
      husband in the United  Kingdom.   She  said  she  had  left  her  own
      passport in Sri Lanka.  A Statement of Evidence  Form  was  submitted
      and an  asylum  interview  was  held  on  21  August  2001,  but  her
      application  was  refused  for  reasons  given  in  letters  dated  7
      September 2001 and 16 August 2002.    At her screening interview  the
      claimant said she had married her husband, a citizen of Sri Lanka who
      had left that country in 1995, in Madras, India, on 23 January  2001.
      She said it was a marriage arranged by her parents and that  she  met
      her husband at the wedding.   Her husband had  exceptional  leave  to
      remain in the United Kingdom, but had  travelled  to  India  for  the
      marriage.   She agreed that her parents had arranged the marriage  in
      order to help her to get to the United Kingdom.

3.    The appeal before the Adjudicator was heard on 16 December 2002,  and
      her  determination  was  promulgated  on  23  December  2002.     She
      dismissed the claimant's asylum appeal, but allowed the appeal  under
      Article 8 of the European Convention.   There is  no  appeal  against
      the dismissal of the asylum appeal.

4.    The Adjudicator noted that the claimant's marriage had been  arranged
      to enable her to leave Sri Lanka, although she said she viewed it  as
      a genuine marriage and expected it to last.   At paragraphs 45 and 46
      of her determination, the Adjudicator said:

      "45.  Article 8 was also relied upon.    The  appellant  married  her
           husband in India  in  January  2001.    She  then  sought  entry
           clearance to join him but this was refused as  her  husband  was
           not a UK resident and only had exceptional leave to remain.   It
           is argued that since her arrival here she has lived with him and
           that they have established a family life; indeed  the  appellant
           is expecting a baby in February 2002.  (sic).


        46. There was no challenge to the fact that  the  couple  had  been
           living together since the appellant's arrival  in  August  2001.
           In contrast to immigration rules and previous Home Office policy
           concerning persons in a relationship akin to marriage, there  is
           no fixed time  limit  before  a  relationship  can  be  said  to
           constitute family life.   I am therefore satisfied that a family
           life has been established; the appellant's pregnancy is  obvious
           proof of that.  This is a matter which I find I am able to  take
           into account as the Secretary of State was aware of the marriage
           at the time of decision, the marriage pre-dated the  appellant's
           entry into the United Kingdom and the pregnancy, whilst  a  post
           decision fact, clearly relates to the  marriage  and  must  have
           been a foreseeable fact..."


5.    The Adjudicator then referred to authorities and continued:

      "51.  At the time of the marriage the appellant was outside the UK and
           had no reason to believe that she would not be permitted to join
           her husband.   Her husband is unable to return to Sri  Lanka  as
           he came here as an asylum seeker and indeed has been  granted  4
           years ELR.    This expires in January 2004.   He is not entitled
           to submit an application for residence until that time and it is
           not known how long the application would take to  be  processed.
           Assuming it is granted and is not simply extended, the appellant
           could then make an application to join him in the  UK.      That
           would also take time to be processed.   Meanwhile they would  be
           forced to live apart and their child, which is due in  February,
           would spend the first few years of his life without the presence
           of his father.

       52.  I accept Mr Cottrell's submission that the appellant has  sought
           to  circumvent  the  immigration  rules  but  given   that   the
           appellant's child will be adversely affected through no fault of
           its own, I find that removal cannot be right.    The factors  in
           favour of allowing the appellants to remain in the  UK  outweigh
           the adverse factors....

       54.   The  appellant's  husband   cannot   return   to   Sri   Lanka.
           Therefore, if the couple are to continue  to  conduct  a  family
           life it cannot be in the appellant's country of origin.    There
           is no evidence that any other country would grant  residence  to
           the couple.

       55.  There are currently real obstacles in the way of  the  appellant
           pursuing from abroad an application for  entry  clearance  as  a
           spouse.  The application could not be made for at least  another
           18 months and even then it is not certain that  the  appellant's
           husband would  be  granted  ILR.    Given  the  length  of  time
           involved, I find that a  removal  decision  would  amount  to  a
           disproportionate measure, since its  consequence  could  be  the
           prolonged or possibly permanent separation of the couple.

       56.  Whilst I fully accept that it is legitimate for the  Immigration
           Authorities in the interests of  the  maintenance  of  effective
           immigration control to require certain applicants to  apply  for
           entry clearance from abroad, I  find  that  in  the  exceptional
           circumstances of this case there  is  a  real  risk  that  entry
           clearance would not be granted,  accordingly  the  couple  would
           face insurmountable obstacles to continuing  their  family  life
           either in Sri Lanka or in the UK."

6.    The grounds of appeal submitted on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
      State complain that the Adjudicator erred by stating in paragraph
      51 that the claimant's husband cannot return to Sri Lanka  as  he
      has been granted exceptional leave to remain;  he  has  not  been
      recognised as a refugee and there is no  barrier  preventing  him
      from returning; the Adjudicator should  have  considered  whether
      there were  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  his  return;  the
      Adjudicator had speculated on the husband's  possible  status  at
      the end of his exceptional leave and on the possible  outcome  of
      an application for entry clearance that had not even  been  made;
      that the Adjudicator had not given proper reasons for her finding
      in paragraph 55 that an application could not  be  made  for  "at
      least another 18  months",  and  again  had  not  considered  the
      possibility of the husband's return to Sri Lanka.

7.    We heard submissions  from  both  representatives.    Mr  Maloney
      invited us to uphold the Adjudicator's decision.

8.    We were told that the claimant's husband's status remains  as  it
      was at the time of the Adjudicator's decision: he has exceptional
      leave to remain until January 2004 but has not been recognised as
      a refugee.   A child has been born to the couple  and  were  told
      that another child is expected.

9.    We are quite clear that the grounds of appeal in  this  case  are
      made  out.    The  Adjudicator  appears  to  have   ignored   the
      distinction between  exceptional  leave  to  remain  and  refugee
      status.   Her statement at  paragraph  51  of  the  determination
      that:       "At the time  of  the  marriage  (the  claimant)  was
      outside the UK and had no reason to believe that she would not be
      permitted to join her husband" is simply incorrect.  At the  time
      of the marriage, and at all subsequent times, her husband was not
      settled in the United Kingdom but  only  had  exceptional  leave.
      Similarly, there is no basis in law or fact for the Adjudicator's
      statement at paragraph 54  that  the  claimant's  husband  cannot
      return to Sri Lanka and that if the couple  are  to  continue  to
      conduct a family life it cannot be  in  her  country  of  origin.
      Further, there is  no  evidential  basis  for  the  Adjudicator's
      statement  at  paragraph  55  that  there  are  "currently   real
      obstacles in the way of the (claimant) pursuing  from  abroad  an
      application  for  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse".    The   same
      criticism must be made of the observation at  paragraph  56  that
      "the couple would face  insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing
      their family life either in Sir Lanka or in  the  UK."    Neither
      the claimant nor her husband is a refugee.   There was and is  no
      evidence that either of them  could  not  return  safely  to  Sri
      Lanka.   The fact that  the  husband  has  exceptional  leave  to
      remain does not mean that he cannot return to  Sri  Lanka.    The
      Adjudicator  has  in  our  judgment  based  her  decision  on   a
      fundamental misperception of the  factual  and  legal  situation.
      Her decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 of the  European
      Convention must be regarded as unsustainable.

10.   For these reasons  the  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  is
      allowed.
