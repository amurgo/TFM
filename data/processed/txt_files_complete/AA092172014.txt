Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant,  who  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  has  been  granted
      permission to appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      (a panel comprising Designated Judge McClure and  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Meyler: "the panel"), promulgated on 11 March 2015, by which her
      appeal against refusal of her asylum claim was dismissed.


   2. A detailed recital of the claim is, of course, set out in the decision
      under challenge but, for present purposes, the  following  summary  of
      the appellant's claim will suffice. The appellant, in respect of  whom
      a number of different dates of  birth  have  been  provided,  is  from
      Lahore. Her father died many years ago but her mother,  four  brothers
      and two sisters remain in Lahore. The appellant was  educated  to  the
      age of 16 after which she helped out at home but did not work  and  so
      was supported by her family. In 2005 she met a man named [WA] who  had
      lived in the United Kingdom for some years and  who  had  returned  to
      attend the family wedding of mutual friends in Pakistan at which  they
      met. A few days later he  proposed  that  they  be  married  and  live
      together in the United Kingdom. Initially, the appellant's mother  was
      against the match, because this man  was  Sunni  and  the  appellant's
      family were Shia. However,  she  consented  to  the  match  after  the
      appellant had threated suicide. A telephone Nikah ceremony took  place
      on 18 January 2007.

   3. The  appellant  remained  living  with  her  family  in  Lahore  while
      arrangements were made to secure her entry clearance to  move  to  the
      United Kingdom. These arrangements were attended to  by  a  friend  of
      [WA]. On 7 May 2008 an application was made on the appellant's  behalf
      as a family visitor. In that application, on the basis of  a  passport
      obtained from an agent that was in the appellant's  name  but  with  a
      different date of birth, it was said that she was married not to  [WA]
      but to someone entirely different, one [MH]. Mr Karnik raises an issue
      of whether or not the appellant was aware of the deception employed in
      making this application, which is discussed below. The application was
      refused but an appeal was  successful  so  that  entry  clearance  was
      granted and the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 9  December
      2009, some 2 ï¿½ years after the Nikah ceremony.

   4. The appellant's life in the United Kingdom  was  very  different  from
      what she had expected.  Her  husband's  home  was  a  "badly  derelict
      house". Six months later they moved to a flat above a vacant shop, but
      it was not much better. She was badly treated by her husband. He raped
      her frequently, beat her and tried  to  persuade  her  to  work  as  a
      prostitute. He brought men to the flat and asked the appellant to have
      sex with them, but she refused to do so. In  May  or  June  2012  [WA]
      left, saying he would be away for  8  days  but  never  returned.  The
      appellant, who had been locked up in the  house  and  not  allowed  to
      leave managed, two weeks later, to attract  the  attention  of  a  man
      working outside and persuaded him to break into the house so that  she
      could leave. She came across a girl speaking Urdu who took  her  to  a
      Law Centre and subsequently provided her with somewhere to  live,  but
      the staff in the Law Centre said that in the absence of evidence  they
      could not help her. The appellant contacted her family in Pakistan but
      they said they wanted nothing to do with her, because she had "brought
      shame upon their Shia culture". Her brothers told her  that  she  must
      not return to Pakistan and if she did "if your husband does  not  kill
      you, we will kill you".


   5. The panel carried out a very detailed analysis of the  evidence.  This
      is set out between paragraphs 15 to 44 of their decision.  They  found
      that  the  appellant  was  aware  that  her  circumstances  had   been
      misrepresented in the application for entry clearance so that her  use
      of deception damaged her credibility generally. If the  appellant  was
      not married to [MH], as was asserted in the visa  application  and  in
      pursuing a successful appeal, then she secured that entry clearance by
      deception. It follows that if, on the other hand, she was  married  to
      that person, although her evidence is clear that she was not, then her
      evidence of being married  to  [WA]  could  not  be  true.  The  panel
      examined the documentary evidence offered  in  support  of  the  Nikah
      ceremony with [WA] but found that no weight  could  be  given  to  it.
      Letters from the Registrar and the Mosque, generated  in  response  to
      written requests from the appellant's solicitors,  lacked  credibility
      because both were written  on  un-headed  paper',  bother  were  in  a
      strikingly similar format and both contained the  same  error  in  the
      address  to  which  they  were  sent,  that  being   the   appellant's
      solicitors.


   6. The panel made clear that they did not hold against the appellant  her
      delay in claiming asylum

   7. The  panel  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  was  a  victim  of
      trafficking. In arriving at that conclusion the panel had regard to  a
      number of factors:


           "... the lengthy courtship prior to the marriage, the  exclusive
           cohabitation as a married couple  for  two  and  a  half  years,
           albeit a very abusive and coercive relationship, and the failure
           to force the appellant  into  prostitution  despite  having  had
           ample opportunity are all strong evidence that runs counter to a
           finding that the purpose of the marriage and trip to the UK  was
           for the purpose of exploitation.  We  therefore  find  that  the
           appellant was not trafficked by [WA]."


      Nor did the panel accept that [WA] himself was part of  a  trafficking
      network. There was nothing to suggest he had been  involved  with  any
      other women. The  circumstances  of  his  living  conditions  did  not
      suggest that he was making money from prostitution. A period  of  over
      five  years  had  elapsed  between  proposal  of  marriage   and   the
      appellant's arrival in the United Kingdom. The appellant was 38  years
      old at the date of the marriage. Although [WA] asked the appellant  to
      have sex with men he brought to the flat, she was able to refuse to do
      so.


   8. After having conducted that lengthy analysis of the evidence the panel
      arrived at some clear findings of fact. There was no  continuing  risk
      from [WA]. He had abandoned the appellant and had simply lost interest
      in her. Since the appellant had escaped from the flat there  has  been
      no contact between them and no suggestion of any  attempted  reprisals
      against her  family.  The  panel  were  satisfied  that  [WA]  had  no
      continuing interest in the appellant.


   9. The panel made also a clear and reasoned  finding  of  fact  that  the
      appellant would not be rejected by her family, should  she  return  to
      Lahore. Although the appellant's mother had been against the marriage,
      she and  the  appellant's  brothers  attended  the  ceremony  and  the
      appellant remained living with her family for almost three years after
      that. Therefore, there was no reason to suppose  that  she  could  not
      return to live with her family in  Lahore  where  there  would  be  no
      reasonable likelihood of any continuing hostility  from  [WA]  or  his
      family members.


  10. In granting permission to  appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lewis
      considered that two grounds might be arguable. The first was that  the
      panel may have erred in  not  considering  the  possibility  that  the
      appellant was unaware of, and so not complicit in, the deception  used
      in securing entry clearance as a visitor by falsely  representing  her
      marital status. The second ground he considered may  be  arguable  was
      that the panel may have erred in deciding  that  no  weight  could  be
      given to the documentary evidence relied upon in respect of the  Nikah
      marriage.  However, he recognised that, even if those errors could  be
      established, it may represent a  pyrrhic  victory  for  the  appellant
      because:


           "The Tribunal identified multiple credibility issues.  So,  even
           if grounds 1 and 2 should prove to have given rise to errors  of
           law, they may not have been material..."


  11. In his submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Karnik added a third
      challenge to the decision of the panel, that being that they erred  in
      respect of their assessment of risk on return as a lone  woman,  given
      that  the  appellant  on  return  would  be  seen  as  "a  potentially
      destabilising element".


  12. Mr Karnik submits that the panel  did  not  specifically  address  the
      possibility that the appellant was unaware of the false statement that
      had been made in her application for entry clearance as a visitor.  In
      fact the panel said that it was "highly unlikely" that  the  appellant
      knew nothing about what had been said in the  application.  That  they
      did not carry out a more detailed discussion of that issue  is  wholly
      unsurprising. The appellant's case is that, having married  [WA],  she
      expected to move to a new life with him in the United Kingdom. It must
      have been apparent from the time that  was  passing  that  there  were
      obstacles to achieving that. The services of an agent were secured  to
      obtain a passport that contained the appellant's name  and  photograph
      but not her correct date of birth and entry clearance  as  a  visitor,
      after a successful appeal  of  the  refusal  by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer.  As the appellant may  well  have  been  asked  questions  by
      immigration officers or others it is  impossible  to  see  what  would
      motivate a decision not to equip her with the ability to  deliver  the
      "correct" answers, in relation to both the stated date  of  birth  and
      name of her husband, especially as, if  not  so  equipped,  she  would
      provide answers that would cause difficulty and expose  the  deception
      that had been used. This is particularly so as she made clear that she
      travelled alone.


  13. In any event, given the findings of fact considered  above,  including
      that there was no continuing interest on  the  part  of  [WA]  and  no
      reason to suppose that the appellant would not be able  to  return  to
      live with her family in Lahore, even if it were considered  to  be  an
      error of law for the panel not to specifically examine the possibility
      that the appellant had no knowledge of the deception  practiced,  that
      would be immaterial since the outcome  would  plainly  have  been  the
      same.


  14. The position is  the  same  in  respect  of  the  second  ground.  The
      appellant relied upon letters from The Registrar and Mosque in  Lahore
      confirming that the proxy marriage ceremony did  in  fact  take  place
      between the appellant and [WA] on 18  January  2007.  The  panel  felt
      unable to rely upon these  two  letters  as  to  the  truth  of  their
      contents for the reasons set out at paragraph 23  of  their  decision.
      Neither was written on headed notepaper, as  might  be  expected  from
      official sources; the appearance of the two letters was similar,  both
      in terms of font and layout; both letters, although  purportedly  sent
      by different organisations and so  presumably  prepared  by  different
      persons, contained the same error in the address  of  the  appellant's
      solicitors to which they were being sent, that error  being  to  state
      the address as [ ] Cheethamhill Road rather than as it appeared in the
      letter to which they were responding which was [ ] Cheetham Hill Road.




  15. However, even if it were the case that the panel should have  accepted
      that the letters should have been accepted as evidence of  that  which
      was asserted, so that the proxy marriage was established, once  again,
      it is impossible to see how the outcome of the appeal could have  been
      any different. The assessment of risk on return was carried out on the
      basis that there was a history of a failed marriage to [WA]  but  that
      he had lost interest in the appellant and so would not be motivated to
      seek her out should she return to Pakistan.


  16. The third ground pursued by Mr Karnik fares no better. He submits that
      the panel erred in failing to assess risk on return of  the  appellant
      as a lone woman after her marriage had failed in the  United  Kingdom.
      On the findings of fact made, the appellant would be  returning  as  a
      mature woman to live with a family that  had  accepted  her  marriage,
      even though it had now failed and I cannot identify  anything  at  all
      that was advanced before the First-tier Tribunal that was  capable  of
      establishing any arguable risk of the appellant being  regarded  as  a
      destabilising element.


      Summary of Decision:


  17. The First-tier Tribunal made no error of law and so their decision  is
      to stand.


  18. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
