                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1.     The applicant is a national  of  Iran.   On  14  April  2014  he  was
    granted permission  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Perkins  to  apply  for
    judicial review of a decision  of  the  respondent  of  11  April  2013
    refusing to accept that the  previously  considered  material  and  the
    further submissions amounted to a fresh claim.

2.   The applicant claimed to have arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  14
    January 2008.  He claimed asylum the next day and this was refused  and
    an appeal against that decision was dismissed  on  18  May  2010.   The
    judge who heard his appeal found him to lack credibility to the  extent
    that no credence was to be attached to:

    (a)  his account of the events relating to him in Iran that he  claimed
         had brought him to the adverse attention of the authorities;


    (b)  the reasons claimed by him for leaving that country, and


    (c)  the specific risks that he claimed that he would face on return at
         the hands of the authorities.


3.   The applicant put forward an expert report by Professor Joff� and  also
    relied on three pieces of case law: SB (risk on return - illegal  exit)
    Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053; BA (demonstrators  in  Britain  -  risk  on
    return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 37 (IAC) and SA (Iranian Arabs - no general
    risk) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 41.

4.   The respondent commented, with regard to SB,  that  the  applicant  did
    not fall under any of the risk categories identified in the summary  in
    SB, and the Immigration Judge had not accepted that he had come to  the
    adverse attention of the authorities in Iran.

5.   As regards BA, the respondent commented that this case  reaffirmed  the
    principles of SB and found that someone would not be  at  risk  due  to
    leaving Iran illegally and being returned from the United Kingdom.

6.   With regard to SA, the respondent noted that no amendment was  said  to
    be required to the risk factors for  those  returning  to  Iran  having
    exited illegally as identified in SB.

7.   With regard to Professor Joff�'s report, it was noted that this  report
    had been compiled for another case and was not based on the  particular
    facts of the applicant's case.  It was noted that  in  the  email  from
    Professor Joff� giving permission to use the report he had said by  way
    of warning that the court/Tribunal tended to hate generic reports.  The
    respondent went on to say that as such  it  was  considered  that  this
    report was a piece of objective evidence  regarding  the  situation  in
    Iran.  However it was also considered that there were country  guidance
    cases as  outlined  above  in  the  letter,  that  concluded  that  the
    applicant could return to Iran.  It was considered that  a  substantial
    amount of background evidence was considered  by  the  Tribunal  before
    deciding those cases.  The respondent went on to say:

         "Therefore it is not considered  that  the  report  from  Professor
         Joff� is sufficient to warrant departing from the findings  of  the
         country guidance case law for Iran or  that  an  Immigration  Judge
         would place any weight on a non-specific report."


     It was then said that for the above reasons it was considered that  the
    applicant had not established that he could not return to Iran  and  it
    was considered that these submissions if placed before  an  Immigration
    Judge would not create a realistic prospect of success.

8.   It was common ground that the essential issue  before  me  was  whether
    the respondent had erred in her treatment of Professor Joff�'s  report.



9.   At the outset it was necessary to address an  application  made  by  Mr
    Hansen for a stay in  the  proceedings.   There  were  pending  appeals
    before the Court of Appeal in MA (Iran) (C4/2014/0227)  and  RA  (Iran)
    (C4/2014/0437) which were Cart judicial reviews which would  come  back
    to the Upper Tribunal for a substantive hearing, and there was also the
    case of  KK  (Iran)  C2/2014/3044,  in  which  Beatson  LJ  stayed  the
    application for permission to appeal pending the decision of the  Court
    of Appeal in MA and RA.  Mr Turner opposed the application on the basis
    essentially that if permission had been  granted  in  a  Cart  judicial
    review bearing in mind the very high threshold, there  was  clearly  an
    issue to be argued out before an Immigration Judge in the instant  case
    and in addition the applicant had Professor Joff�'s report.

10.  I refused the application.  I  understand  from  Mr  Hansen's  skeleton
    argument that MA and RA were listed for hearing on 4  to  5  March  but
    that date has now been vacated due to lack of judicial availability and
    accordingly it is uncertain when the matter might be resolved.  In  any
    event the instant application does not involve a determinative decision
    in the case, but no more, if I am with Mr Turner, than quashing of  the
    respondent's decision which would lead to an appeal  hearing  before  a
    First-tier Judge in due course.

11.  Mr Turner adopted his skeleton argument and developed  points  made  in
    it.  He argued that the adverse credibility findings of the Immigration
    Judge were irrelevant and what was at issue were the points set out  in
    Professor Joff�'s report.  The applicant had the two  risk  factors  of
    being a Kurd and being Iranian and that was sufficient.   The  question
    was whether the respondent was rationally  entitled  to  conclude  that
    Professor Joffe's report was not a piece of evidence such as to lead to
    a realistic prospect of success.  The decision-maker accepted that  the
    report was objective evidence but gave it  no  weight  because  of  the
    three country guidance decisions.  Of those three, SB was decided on  6
    May 2009 and was based on reports of which the latest  was  dated  2009
    and the earliest went back to 2001.  Kurdish ethnicity had not  been  a
    relevant factor.  BA was concerned with  individual  circumstances  and
    demonstrations and SA was concerned with Iranian  Arabs.   It  was  the
    case therefore that SB was essentially the  respondent's  justification
    for saying what she had said.  There was a lack of anxious scrutiny.

12.  Professor Joff�'s report  was  very  detailed.   He  quoted  from  more
    recent background evidence than was considered in SB, for  example  the
    US State Department Report of 2010, and he addressed in detail not only
    the general situation of human rights in Iran but also the situation of
    the Kurds and the position with regard to return to Iran.   The  report
    had not properly been addressed  by  the  respondent  in  the  decision
    letter and her decision was therefore flawed.

13.  In his submissions Mr Hansen argued that  the  respondent's  addressing
    of  Professor  Joff�'s  report  was  within  the  range  of  reasonable
    responses open to her.  The adverse findings of the  Immigration  Judge
    were not irrelevant since the putative judge  would  start  with  those
    findings and that was on the basis that the  applicant  was  incredible
    and had no political profile at all including as  a  Kurdish  activist,
    and had never  come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the  authorities.
    Although SB had been decided in 2009, its findings had been endorsed in
    both SA and BA, which were both decided in  2011.   A  judge  would  be
    obliged to  apply  the  findings  in  the  country  guidance  cases  in
    accordance with the Practice Directions on country guidance cases.

14.  It was also relevant to note that Professor  Joff�'s  report  had  been
    prepared for a very different claimant, a  person  who  was  a  Kurdish
    political activist and member of the KDPI.  There were  relatively  few
    references in Professor Joff�'s report post-dating BA.  Such  as  these
    were, for example the US State Department Report of 2012, merely stated
    that Iran was not a happy place for human rights but  did  not  address
    the situation of failed asylum seekers  or  Kurds.   Professor  Joff�'s
    conclusions were not justified by the underlying material  and  report.
    For example the focus on  the  evidence  he  set  out  was  on  Kurdish
    political  activists  and  Kurdish  political  parties.   On  a  proper
    analysis of the report the risk  to  Kurds  was  to  Kurdish  political
    activists.  The evidence was  consistent  with  the  Iran  COIR  of  26
    September 2013 and also the Iran OGN of October  2012,  both  of  which
    made it clear that there is no risk to an Iranian Kurd  purely  on  the
    basis of his or her ethnic origin but they might be  at  risk  if  they
    were known or suspected to be members of Kurdish political parties.  It
    was clear from the OGN that there was no general risk of persecution or
    ill-treatment for Iranians facing enforced return.  With regard to what
    was said in Mr Turner's skeleton concerning AK  (Turkey)  [2004]  UKAIT
    00230, clearly there was a need to engage with the report, but that had
    not been a fresh claim case but a decision concerned with  the  quality
    of Tribunal decision  making.   Line  by  line  rebuttal  of  Professor
    Joff�'s report was not required.  The later material referred to in  Mr
    Turner's  skeleton  could  not  impact  on  the  rationality   of   the
    respondent's decision.  It was a question of Professor  Joff�'s  report
    only and the decision was a lawful one.

15.  By way of reply Mr Turner  argued  that  the  authorities  quoted,  for
    example, in the OGN were 2008  authorities  and  also  the  OGN  quoted
    remarks  of  Iranian  authorities   whose   materiality   had   to   be
    questionable.  The issue was one of perception of a person as a  failed
    Kurdish asylum seeker rather than whether they actually had a  history.
    The three country guidance authorities were either too old  bearing  in
    mind the more recent evidence of  Professor  Joff�  or  concerned  with
    different categories of Iranians potentially at risk.   They  were  not
    dispositive of the issue.  The respondent had failed to have regard  to
    a material factor.

16.  I reserved my judgment.

17.  I have set out above what the respondent had to  say  in  her  decision
    letter about Professor Joff�'s report.  I turn now to the report itself
    which is dated 30 September 2012.  As was pointed out by Mr Hansen,  it
    is a generic report, so far as it is of relevance  to  this  applicant,
    having been  prepared  for  a  different  applicant.   Professor  Joff�
    addresses the poor human rights record of  the  Iranian  Government  in
    some detail.  He quotes for example  at  page  11  from  the  US  State
    Department Report of March 11, 2010 on the deterioration of  the  human
    rights situation in Iran and an absence of improvement in the following
    year.  There is then a section, beginning at page  17  of  the  report,
    concerning Kurds in Iran.  Professor Joff�  sets  out  the  history  of
    Kurds in the region and the problems that they  have  experienced  over
    time.  As regards the current situation, on which his comments begin at
    page  26,  he  refers  to  collective  discrimination  by  the  central
    authorities and cites a number of examples  of  specific  incidents  of
    activists being imprisoned and killed.  There is also a section in  the
    report, beginning at page 32, on returns to Iran.  At paragraph  95  he
    says that Kurds who have fled Iran are frequently suspected  of  having
    had political reasons for doing so and  are  treated  accordingly.   He
    notes a report of 2011 from which it appears that in recent  years  the
    Iranian authorities assume that all asylum seekers who are returned  to
    Iran have engaged in anti-regime activities whilst  abroad,  especially
    in spreading false information about the Islamic Republic.  He comments
    at paragraph 97 that the developments set out  in  previous  paragraphs
    suggest that persons returned to Iran as failed asylum seekers now face
    an enhanced threat of being considered a priori  to  have  defamed  the
    Islamic Republic whilst  abroad  and  therefore  face  a  significantly
    increased threat of conviction seemingly on  the  basis  of  having  to
    prove lack their lack of guilt rather than the converse.

18.  In his summary at page 35, Professor Joff� says at  paragraph  (ii)  as
    follows:

         "I have sought to amass evidence above that the Iranian regime does
         severely discriminate against its  Kurdish  minority,  collectively
         and individually, simply because they are  Kurdish.   I  have  also
         sought to show that  such  discrimination  is  so  severe  that  it
         amounts to persecution."


     He goes on to quote from a report of the  Irish  Refugee  Documentation
    Centre, dated 5 January 2012, that when Kurds are returned to  Iran  as
    failed asylum seekers they face  serious  and  real  threats  to  their
    personal safety and security as a result.

19.  I agree with Mr Turner that the three country guidance cases are  to  a
    large extent concerned with different  risk  factors  from  those  that
    exist in this case.  None of those cases deals with risk on return of a
    Kurd who is a failed asylum seeker.  Although there is  endorsement  of
    the conclusions in SB in the later decisions of BA and  SA,  I  do  not
    think it was properly open to the respondent to conclude that Professor
    Joff�'s report was not sufficient to warrant departing from the country
    guidance  findings.   Country  guidance  is   authoritative   where   a
    subsequent appeal depends upon the same or similar evidence,  but  this
    is different, more recent evidence.  Also, the view  expressed  by  the
    respondent in the decision letter that an Immigration Judge  would  not
    place any weight on a non-specific report is, in my  view,  irrational.
    Professor Joff�'s report does, as Mr Turner has argued, address risk to
    Kurds not only on the basis of political activism but  also  simply  by
    dint of being Kurds.  The passages I have quoted above bear  that  out.
    Though Mr Hansen is right to say that  the  putative  First-tier  Judge
    would have to start from the position that the applicant  is  a  person
    with no credible history, the fact is that Professor Joff�'s report  is
    a generic report and does contain and refer  to  evidence  which  would
    have to be considered seriously by the putative First-tier Judge.  That
    evidence would of course fall to be considered together with such other
    matters as the COIR and the OGN.  But the addressing of the  report  in
    the relevant paragraph in the decision letter is  in  my  view  legally
    flawed in that it  betrays  an  absence  of  anxious  scrutiny  in  its
    consideration of that report in the context of the  applicant's  claim.
    Accordingly,  the  application  succeeds.   I  quash  the  respondent's
    decision on the basis of its illegality.

20.  I will hear the parties on any consequential matters, including  costs,
    when this decision is handed down.  ~~~~-~~~~
