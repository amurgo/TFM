   The words "provided to"  in  paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)  (9)  of  Appendix  A
   (Attributes for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants) have the same meaning  as
   "available to."  Whilst the Rule has now been amended to this effect, the
   previous wording of the Rule did not give rise to any absurdity or  doubt
   in construction.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. Ms Kiran Fayyaz (hereinafter  "the  Appellant")  appeals  against  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal  ("the  FtT")  promulgated  on  27
      November 2013.  This  appeal  was  heard  together  with  three  other
      appeals, those of Hazrat Waqas Durrani,  Parvaiz  Akhter  and  Chandni
      Maqbool.[1]  These appeals  were  heard  together  because  they  have
      certain common features.  Fundamentally, the factor which  unites  all
      four cases is that  they  raise  issues  of  construction  of  certain
      aspects of the provisions of the Immigration Rules  which  govern  the
      acquisition of the status known as "Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant".
      For convenience, we shall describe this  as  "entrepreneurial  migrant
      status". We would add that  these  four  cases,  while  comparable  in
      certain respects, are not identical.


   2. This Appellant, in common with the other three litigants,  applied  to
      the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (hereinafter  "the
      Secretary of State") for this status.  All of  the  applications  were
      refused on the  ground  that  they  were  non-compliant  with  certain
      requirements  of  the  Rules.   Each  of  the  refusal  decisions  was
      challenged by appeal to the FtT.  The appeals of this Appellant and Mr
      Durrani were dismissed.  This  Appellant  and  Mr  Durrani  have  been
      granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal, contending that the FtT
      erred in law in dismissing their appeals.  The appeals in the cases of
      Ms Maqbool and Mr Akhter were allowed.  The distinguishing feature  in
      their cases is that their  applications  for  entrepreneurial  migrant
      status had been made as partners of the proposed business  enterprise.
       The Secretary of State has been granted permission to  challenge  the
      decision of the FtT in their cases before this Tribunal.


   3. Accordingly, there are four inter-related appeals  altogether.   While
      the case management  decision  to  list  and  hear  all  four  appeals
      together was vindicated, time and cost undoubtedly having  been  saved
      thereby,  we  have  decided,  in  the   interests   of   clarity   and
      comprehension, and taking  into  account  distinguishing  as  well  as
      common features,  to  prepare  separate  determinations.   We  further
      consider that this segregation is likely to be of  greater  assistance
      to the Court of Appeal in two cases in which permission to appeal  has
      been granted, namely Secretary of State for the Home Department - v  -
      AI (Pakistan) and Others [2014]  EWCA  Civ  173  and  UT  (India)  and
      Another - v - Secretary of State for the Home Department C5/2014/0212.




   4. Permission to appeal in the aforementioned cases  was  granted  on  11
      February 2014 and 23 April 2014.  We have been provided with the grant
      of permission  to  appeal  in  each  case.   In  the  first  case,  AI
      (Pakistan), Sullivan LJ stated:

         "[4] ....  It was common ground that the documents relied  upon  by
             the Appellant  did  not  comply  with  paragraph  41-SD(a)  as
             literally interpreted .....


         [9]  The Upper Tribunal (decided) that  the  requirements  of  sub-
             paragraphs (a) and (b) and possibly (c) were cumulative ....


         [10] In my judgment that does raise an important point of principle
             as to the proper interpretation of the Rules which potentially
             affects a number of would be Tier One (Entrepreneur)  Migrants
             who are relying on third party rather than their own funds."



     In the second case, UT (India), in granting permission to appeal  Moses
      LJ stated:

         "There  is  a  lack  of  coherence  in  the  way   the   evidential
         requirements are being interpreted which requires clarification."

   5. We have given consideration to whether our  decisions  in  these  four
      appeals should be deferred until determination of the two  appeals  to
      the  Court  of  Appeal.   Making  the  best  prediction  possible,  we
      acknowledge that the decisions in AI (Pakistan)  and  UT  (India)  may
      have some bearing on how the present appeals should  be  decided.   On
      the other hand, the two grants of permission to appeal to the Court of
      Appeal are of recent vintage and we are alert to the delays which  may
      ensue.  Furthermore, the uncertainty  for  these  litigants,  who  are
      attempting to plan their futures and who have already  had  to  endure
      not insubstantial delay, will merely be exacerbated if  we  put  their
      appeals on hold for a period  which  will  be  of  more  than  minimal
      dimensions.  We also take into account that if there is a challenge to
      any of our decisions in these appeals, the ultimate resolution in  the
      wake of promulgation of the Court of Appeal decisions  should  not  be
      unduly delayed.  Finally, we are mindful  of  the  strictures  of  the
      Court of Appeal in AB (Sudan) - v - SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 921, at  [24]
      - [32].  The central theme of  these  passages  is  expressed  in  the
      following pithy statement of Jackson LJ:


          "[32] In my view the power to stay  immigration  cases  pending  a
          future appellate decision in other litigation  is  a  power  which
          must be exercised cautiously and only when, in  the  interests  of
          justice, it is necessary to do so."

      His Lordship added:


          "It may be necessary to grant a stay if  the  impending  appellate
          decision is likely to  have  a  critical  impact  on  the  current
          litigation."


   6. What is required of the court or tribunal seized of a stay issue is  a
      reasonable, balanced forecast made on as fully  informed  a  basis  as
      possible and giving effect to the values and principles  enshrined  in
      the  overriding  objective.   Adopting  this  approach,  applying  the
      principles in AB (Sudan) and having given the parties  an  opportunity
      at the hearing to make representations  on  this  discrete  issue,  we
      consider that all of these appeals  should  be  decided,  rather  than
      delayed.  We are satisfied that this course is more likely to  promote
      the efficient and expeditious administration of justice.

The Immigration Rules

   7.  The  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  the  Appellant's
      application  had  to  satisfy  are  contained  in   paragraph   245DD,
      paragraphs 35 - 43 of Appendix A (in particular paragraph  41-SD)  and
      Table 4 of Appendix A.  As these are somewhat bulky and unwieldy, they
      are reproduced in an appendix  hereto.  While  any  summary  of  these
      lengthy and intricate provisions will  inevitably  be  inadequate,  we
      attempt the following overview.

   8. Paragraph 245DD and its sister provisions may properly be viewed as  a
      self-contained   code   within   the   Immigration   Rules   governing
      applications for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The scheme of  these  provisions  is  that  a
      person who has, or has last been granted, entry clearance or leave  to
      enter or remain in a specified guise  may  apply  for  Entrepreneurial
      Migrant Status. There is no dispute  between  the  parties  about  the
      meaning of paragraph 245DD of the  Rules.  Every  applicant  for  this
      status must comply with all of  the  requirements  pertaining  to  the
      particular  application.   A  failure  to  comply  with  any  of   the
      applicable requirements results in refusal.  One of  the  requirements
      is  that  the  applicant  must  have  a  minimum  of  75  points,   or
      "attributes".  The acquisition of the necessary points is governed  by
      Tables 4, 5 and 6 in Appendix A.  In all of these appeals, Table 4  is
      the focus of the contentious issues.


   9. During  the  hearing,  both  parties  concurred  with  the  Tribunal's
      suggestion that the detailed requirements  prescribed  in  this  self-
      contained  code,  particularly  in  Table  4,  have  two  identifiable
      purposes.  The first is to  ensure  that  the  person  or  partnership
      concerned is making a bona fide application for  the  desired  status.
      The second is to establish  that  the  proposed  business  venture  is
      financially viable.  Compliance  with  the  relevant  requirements  of
      Table 4 is necessary in order to secure 25 of the requisite 75 points.
       Under Table 4, there are four possible mechanisms for scoring the  25
      points concerned.  The first is that the applicant has "access to"  at
      least �200,000.  Pursuant to the other three mechanisms, the applicant
      must have "access to" at least �50,000.  Under all four mechanisms the
      applicant must comply with the relevant requirements of paragraphs  41
      and 41-SD.  These require the production of "specified documents".  As
      stated in paragraph 41-SD(a), the purpose of the  specified  documents
      is "to show evidence of the money available to invest" in the proposed
      venture.  This theme is also expressed in  paragraph  41(a)  and  (b),
      which states that the specified documents must be  provided  "to  show
      cash money to the amount required" and "to show that the applicant has
      permission to use the money to  invest  in  a  business  in  the  UK".
      Paragraph 41(c) is concerned with the source of the finance:  it  must
      be "either  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial  institution  or  is
      transferrable to the UK".  By paragraph 41(d), the money must  "remain
      available to the applicant until such time  as  it  is  spent  in  the
      establishment or running of the applicant's business  or  businesses".
      We consider that the provisions of paragraph  41  inform  the  correct
      construction of what follows, namely paragraph 41-SD and its elaborate
      regime.


  10. The interconnecting nature and operation of paragraph 245DD, Table  4,
      paragraph 41 and paragraph 41-SD is apparent from the opening words of
      the latter, which are:

         "The specified documents  in  Table  4  and  paragraph  41  are  as
         follows: ......"


      This is followed immediately by paragraph 41-SD(a):


         "The specified documents to show evidence of the money available to
         invest are one  or  more  of  the  following  specified  documents:
         ......."


      This is followed by three separate provisions within which a series of
      requirements  is  rehearsed.   These  provisions   contemplate   three
      different scenarios:


        i) The necessary funds are held in a financial institution  outside
           the United Kingdom.


       ii) The necessary funds are held in a financial institution  in  the
           United Kingdom.

      iii) The provider of the funds is a "Venture Capital" firm,  a  "Seed
           Funding Competition" or a "UK Government Department".


      These are clearly disjunctive scenarios, or categories, as the parties
      accepted in argument.  It is the first of these three which has  given
      rise to the main issue canvassed before us in the three  appeals.   We
      shall describe this as "the first category".


  11. The requirements relating to the "specified documents"  in  the  first
      category are detailed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i). We shall describe this
      for convenience as "section (i)".  Within this category  provision  is
      made for two possibilities, which are  not  mutually  exclusive.   The
      first is that the necessary funds are provided in whole or in part  by
      the applicant.  The second is that they are provided in  whole  or  in
      part by a third party.  We draw attention to the opening words in this
      category, contained in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i):

         "A letter from each financial institution  holding  the  funds,  to
         confirm the amount of money available  to  the  applicant  (or  the
         entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions in  paragraph
         52 of this Appendix).  Each letter must: ........."

      There follows a schedule of 11 disjunctive requirements.  Thus, in the
      first category, the "specified document" is a letter from the relevant
      financial institution or  institutions  which  must  accord  with  the
      requirements listed to the extent that these are applicable.  We  have
      added the qualification "to the  extent  that  these  are  applicable"
      because it  is  clear,  for  example,  that  requirement  (8)  has  no
      application in a case (such as the present)  where  the  applicant  is
      dependent exclusively on third party funding.

  12. The requirements in category (i) which have given rise to  controversy
      are those contained in sub-paragraphs (6) and (8)  -  (10)  inclusive.
      The contentious requirements are that the letter must:

         "(6) state the applicant's name and his team partner's name if  the
             applicant is applying under the provisions in paragraph 52  of
             this Appendix ....


         (9)  confirm the amount of money provided to the applicant from any
             third party (if applicable) that is held in  that  institution
             .....


         (10) confirm the  name  of  each  third  party  and  their  contact
             details, including their full address including  postal  code,
             landline phone number and any email address ...."

      There is also some controversy about the word "applicant" in  category
      (i):


         "A letter from each financial institution  holding  the  funds,  to
         confirm the amount of money available  to  the  applicant  (or  the
         entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions in  paragraph
         2 of the Appendix)."

      This is followed by the words "Each letter must ..." and the  11  sub-
      paragraphs mentioned above.


  13. Where the provider of the necessary funds is a "third party", category
      (i) of paragraph 41-SD(a) of  the  Rules  is  not  exhaustive  of  the
      requirements relating to the "specified documents". This is clear from
      the opening words of paragraph 41-SD(b), which are:

         "If the applicant is applying using money from a  third  party,  he
         must provide all of the following specified documents ....."

      This is followed by two further and separate categories of  "specified
      documents" (i) and (ii).  The use of the word "AND" makes  clear  that
      these are cumulative, not alternative, requirements.   Thus,  where  a
      third  party  funder  is  involved,  the  requirements  pertaining  to
      "specified documents" are more rigorous.  The two additional specified
      documents which must be provided with the application are:


        i) Per paragraph 41-SD(b)(i), an original  declaration  from  every
           third party that they have made  the  money  available  for  the
           applicant to invest in a business in the United  Kingdom.   This
           declaration  must  have  the  contents  specified  in  the  sub-
           paragraphs which follow.


       ii) Per paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii), a letter from a legal representative
           (described in the shorthand "legal letter" in some places).

      The aforementioned letter must  comply  with  four  stipulations.  The
      first is that it must confirm that the signatures of  the  signatories
      of each third party declaration are authentic.  Secondly, it  must  be
      an  original  letter.   Thirdly,  its   author   must   be   a   legal
      representative permitted to practise in the country  where  the  third
      party or the money is located.  Fourthly,  the  letter  "must  clearly
      show", to the extent applicable, the information and matters  detailed
      in   the   seven   sub-paragraphs   which   follow.     The   parties'
      representatives  agreed  with  this  Tribunal's  analysis   that   the
      requirements enshrined in columns (i) and (ii)  are  freestanding  and
      cumulative.  We would add that none of the four appeals generates  any
      issue relating to the construction of any of these provisions.

The Secretary of State's Decision

  14. The completed application form disclosed  that  the  Appellant  is  of
      Pakistani nationality, aged 23 years at the material time.    She  was
      the holder of a United Kingdom Biometric Residence Permit,  issued  in
      September 2010 and scheduled to expire on  27  August  2012.  She  had
      originally entered the United Kingdom pursuant to a visa issued in May
      2009, as a student.  This remained her immigration status. Section  3A
      of the application is concerned  with  points  and  "attributes".   In
      completing this section, the Appellant indicated that she was applying
      as a sole entrepreneur.  She  represented  that  she  was  relying  on
      "funds held overseas ....  third party funding".  Paragraph G6 of  the
      form states:

         "The applicant must provide a letter of permission from each  third
         party providing funds together with a letter from a  legal  advisor
         confirming the validity of the permissions."

      The form then makes provision for attaching each of  these  documents.
      In completing this discrete section, the Appellant stated that she was
      submitting a "Letter of Permission from third party  funds  provider".
      She did not  complete  the  box  adjacent  to  the  words  "Letter  of
      Confirmation from a legal advisor".  In completing paragraph G10,  she
      represented that she was submitting a letter from  the  "Allied  Bank"
      and that the "amount of money available" was �693,011.  It  is  common
      ground that the Appellant  had  to  demonstrate  the  availability  of
      minimum funding  of  �200,000.   In  response  to  paragraph  J1,  the
      Appellant stated that "all the funds are disposable in the UK".  In  a
      later passage in the form,  under  the  heading  "Attributes",  it  is
      stated:


         "In order for an extension application to be approved the applicant
         must score 75 points in the Attributes  section.  If  they  do  not
         score 75 points the application will be refused.  In addition,  the
         applicant must score 10 points in each of the English language  and
         maintenance sections."


      These latter two requirements are prescribed by the Immigration  Rules
      and give rise to no controversy in this series of appeals.

  15. The final two pages of the application form (Section 7) consist  of  a
      "Summary Sheet".  In completing  this  discrete  part,  the  Appellant
      indicated the following:

      (a) She was claiming 25 points for  having  access  to  the  requisite
           funding and was providing an affidavit for this purpose.


      (b) She was claiming a further 25 points in respect  of  the  relevant
           financial  institution  and  was   providing   a   bank   letter
           accordingly.


      (c) She was claiming 25 points for the money being disposable  in  the
           United Kingdom and was providing an affidavit accordingly.

    This discrete part of the form broadcasts the following warning:


         "Failure to submit required evidence is likely to lead to  refusal
    of the application."

  16. Bearing in mind the issues raised in this appeal, it is  necessary  to
      draw attention to  only  two  of  the  documents  submitted  with  the
      Appellant's application for entrepreneurial migrant status.  The first
      is the document entitled "Declaration of Availability  of  Funds  used
      for an Application for Entrepreneur Status".   This  is  addressed  to
      UKBA.  In it, the named person "solemnly declares" the following:

      (i) He is a national and resident of Pakistan.


      (ii)    He has available funds of �693,011 in the Allied Bank (Lahore,
           Pakistan), specifying the account number.


      (iii)   He "will make the said money available to" the  Appellant  for
           the purpose of investing in business in the United Kingdom.


      (iv)    The Appellant is a family friend and the investor has  "agreed
           to invest the mentioned money in a business  of  his  choice  on
           business terms".

    The declaration also contains particulars of the investor's address and
    telephone.  On its face, it was executed and witnessed in the  presence
    of a lawyer.

  17. The second of the accompanying documents on which attention is focused
      bears the title "Account Maintenance Certificate".  This  recites,  in
      material part:

         "This is to certify that Mr  [XY]  is  ............................
         [sterling]   Account   [number   ..............]    since    [date]
         ..................... the current balance of account is �693,011."

      Particulars of the account holder's name, the account number  and  the
      date of commencement are provided. The document further states that it
      is "issued on specific request of the client".  On  its  face,  it  is
      signed by the Customer Services Manager of Allied Bank Limited.

  18.  On  7  February  2013,  some  six  months  after  submission  of  the
      Appellant's  application,  UKBA  communicated  in  writing  with   her
      solicitors.  The communication  indicated  that  the  application  was
      being processed and continued:

         "Unfortunately we are unable to continue as  your  client  has  not
         submitted the required documentation.  As such  we  are  requesting
         that your client submits an original bank  letter  from  the  third
         party account (Allied Bank) that  states  her  name,  how  much  is
         available from the account, the regulatory body for  the  bank  and
         that the money is disposable in the United Kingdom.   This  request
         for  the  documents  is  therefore  being  made  under   the   UKBA
         flexibility provision.  You should  also  note  that  the  required
         documents should meet the  full  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

         [Emphasis added.]

    This request elicited a response from the Appellant to UKBA, by  letter
    dated 12 February 2013, attaching a letter dated 8 February  2013  from
    the Allied  Bank  of  Lahore,  Pakistan.   The  latter  identified  the
    relevant account number and stated:


         "We refer to the above and your recent request to provide a  letter
         confirming the balance amount and the transfer of the  same  to  Ms
         Kiran Fayyaz (26/08/1988) who is residing in  the  UK  for  her  to
         invest the same in her business venture.  As per our Bank Policy we
         can only confirm  the  available  funds  and  the  availability  of
         transfer to the UK upon the request of the Account Holder.  In view
         of that we hereby confirm that the available balance of  the  above
         mentioned Account is �320,098.27 as  at  08/02/2013  and  the  same
         amount can be instantly transferred to any Bank Account  holder  in
         the United Kingdom upon your request."

     The letter was  signed  by  a  person  describing  himself  as  "Branch
Manager".

  19. Chronologically, the next material event was the Secretary of  State's
      refusal decision, contained in a letter dated 13 May 2013. The  stated
      reasons for the refusal were twofold.  First, it was stated  that  the
      Appellant had failed to provide a  letter  from  the  Allied  Bank  of
      Pakistan which, inter alia, specified -

         "...... the name of each third party  and  their  contact  details,
         including their full address including postal code, landline  phone
         number and any email address."

     The second reason for refusal was expressed in these terms:

         "In  addition,  no  Legal  Letter  has  been  submitted  with  your
         application as required under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules."

           "Legal Letter" is understood as a term of art:  see the  relevant
      description in [13] above. Having rehearsed these two defects  in  the
      application, the decision letter stated:

         "As a result of the above you have not demonstrated that  you  meet
         the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  to  be  awarded  points
         under provision B of Table 4 of the Immigration Rules."

    Continuing, the letter explained that while the Appellant  had  claimed
    25  points  in  respect  of  "funds   held   in   regulated   financial
    institutions" and "funds disposable" in the United Kingdom", by  virtue
    of the aforementioned failures to comply with the Rules  she  qualified
    for an award of no points in  both  respects.  This  was  described  in
    argument as the "domino" effect.  The letter concluded:


      "Therefore you do not satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
      Rules and it has been decided to refuse your application ....  as  you
      do not meet the requirement at paragraph 245DD(b)."


FtT decision

  20. It would appear from the determination of the FtT that the Appellant's
      appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal decision proceeded  on
      two grounds.  First, it  was  argued  that  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules (outlined above) pertaining to the  letter  required
      from the third party funder's bank are tainted by  absurdity  and  are
      unlawful in consequence:  [11]  of  the  Determination.   Second,  the
      Appellant  challenged  the  failure  to  apply  to   the   "evidential
      flexibility" mechanism in respect of the missing letter from the legal
      representative (the "legal letter").  The Judge  rejected  the  second
      ground in the following terms:

         "[10]    The fact is that having received the  letter  from  Allied
         Bank dated 07/02/2013, no further evidence could have  resulted  in
         success for the Appellant."

    As regards the first ground, the Judge rejected the absurdity argument.
     He reasoned that the "crux" of the relevant requirements  is  that  an
    applicant must demonstrate access to the requisite  level  of  funding,
    describing this as "purpose driven". The Judge's omnibus conclusion  is
    formulated in these terms:


          "[18] In the absence of the mandatory  evidence  from  the  Allied
          Bank and no reliable evidence that the funds are available, I  see
          no reason for the SSHD to have sought any further evidence because
          the application was bound to fail."


    The rationale for this conclusion appears to have been the Judge's view
    that the third party funder should properly have transferred the  funds
    to the Appellant's bank account in  the  United  Kingdom,  whereby  the
    availability  of  the  finance  would  have  been   demonstrated.    He
    considered the Secretary of State's decision to have been in accordance
    with the law.

The Issues

  21. The two fundamental issues in the further appeal to this Tribunal  are
      unchanged.  Most of the argument was devoted to the absurdity  ground.
      This ground focuses on the "specified documents" requirements relating
      to the necessary letter from the  third  party  financial  institution
      listed in category (i) of paragraph 41-SD(a) of the Immigration Rules.
       The contentious  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)  are  those
      enshrined in sub-paragraphs (6),  (9)  and  (10).   These  three  sub-
      paragraphs prescribe that the  necessary  letter  from  the  financial
      institution holding the funds must:

      (a) state the applicant's name;

      (b) confirm the amount of money provided to  the  applicant  from  any
        third party that is held in such institution; and

     c) confirm the name of each third party  and  their  contact  details,
        including their full address,  to  include  postal  code,  landline
        phone number and any email address.

      The Appellant's arguments were based on an  acknowledgement  that  her
      application was governed by paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)  and  paragraph  41-
      SD(b)(i) and (ii).

  22.  It  was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  that  a   literal
      interpretation of the  three  requirements  in  paragraph  41-DS(a)(i)
      under scrutiny  produces absurd results.  Thus, it was contended that,
      giving effect to the principle in Stock - v - Jones [1978] 1 WLR  231,
      this Tribunal would  be  justified  in  departing  from  the  apparent
      meaning of the words in question.  Counsel's submissions drew  to  our
      attention a series of decisions which have held that  the  Immigration
      Rules should be construed less strictly  than  a  statute,  reaffirmed
      most recently by the Supreme Court in Mahad  -  v  -  Entry  Clearance
      Officer [2009] UKSC 16.  In that case, Lord Brown  exhorted  that  the
      Rules be construed:

         ".... sensibly according to the natural and ordinary meaning of the
         words used, recognising that they are statements of  the  Secretary
         of State's administrative policy".

     We are also mindful  of  the  statement  of  Bingham  J  in  R  -  v  -
    Immigration Tribunal, ex parte Shaikh [1981] 3 All ER 29, at 35:


         "....  It is, in my judgment, incumbent  upon  anybody  seeking  to
         give effect to these Rules to read what they say  and,  so  far  as
         possible, give effect to the language used, unless of  course  that
         leads to absurdity or  inconvenience  so  gross  as  to  have  been
         clearly outside anyone's contemplation."

      This approach, which was common ground between  the  parties,  imports
      the Stock - v - Jones principle to  the  exercise  of  construing  the
      Immigration Rules.

  23. The specific contentions advanced on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  with
      reference to the contentious requirements  listed  in   paragraph  41-
      SD(a)(i) were:

      (a) In requirement (6), the word "applicant's" should be  deleted  and
           substituted by "account holder's", with deletion of all  of  the
           words following "name" where this first appears.


      (b) In requirement (9), the words "provided to the applicant from  any
           third party (if applicable)" should be deleted  and  substituted
           by "available to the account holder".


      (c) In requirement (10), the words "third party" should be deleted and
           substituted by "account holder".


      This  exercise,  it  was  submitted,   would   involve   a   purposive
      construction and is necessary to avoid absurdity or anomaly.

24. The second ground of appeal entails, in substance,  a  contention  that
    the Secretary of State's failure to make  an  "evidential  flexibility"
    request was unlawful.  After some bilateral  vacillation,  the  parties
    were agreed that the following version of paragraph  245AA  applied  to
    the Appellant's application for entrepreneurial migrant status:

         "(a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents  must  be  provided,  the  UK  Border
             Agency will only consider documents that have  been  submitted
             with  the  application  and  will  only   consider   documents
             submitted after the application where they  are  submitted  in
             accordance with subparagraph (b).


         (b)  If the applicant has submitted:


              i) a sequence of documents and some of the  documents  in  the
                 sequence have  been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                 statement from a series is missing);


             ii) a document in the wrong format; or

            iii) a document that is a copy and not an original document

             The  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the  applicant  or   his
             representative in writing and  request  the  correct  documents
             ....

         (c)  The UK Border  Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
             specified document has  not  been  submitted  (for  example  an
             English language certificate  is  missing),  or  where  the  UK
             Border Agency does not anticipate that addressing the  omission
             or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to  a  grant
             because the application will be refused for other reasons."

     [our emphasis]

      The remaining provisions of paragraph  245AA  are  immaterial  in  the
      present context.  For completeness,  we  add  that  the  Tribunal  was
      informed  that  while  paragraph  245  AA  has  been  the  subject  of
      subsequent amendments, on 13 December 2012 and  1  October  2013,  the
      provisions  rehearsed  above  governed   all   of   the   applications
      culminating in this series of appeals.

Our Conclusions

  25. The Appellant's absurdity argument is confined to the first of the two
      reasons  proffered  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  refusing   her
      application. We remind ourselves that the ingredients  of  this  first
      reason for refusal were that the letter from the Allied Bank  was  (or
      letters  were)  non-compliant  with  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
      enshrined  in  sub-paragraph  (10)  of  paragraph  41-SD(a)(i).   This
      discrete requirement prescribes that the bank letter contain specified
      particulars relating to the third party  funder:  name,  full  address
      including postal code, landline phone number and  any  email  address.
      The first communication (labelled "Account  Maintenance  Certificate")
      from the Allied Bank contained the name of  the  third  party  funder.
      However, neither of the two communications contained any of the  other
      prescribed particulars viz the third party funder's address,  landline
      phone number and  any  email  address.  While  the  "Declaration"  (or
      affidavit) of the third party submitted with the application contains,
      inter alia, his address and cell phone number, it was not argued  that
      this sufficed to satisfy requirement (10) in section (i).  Plainly, it
      did not do so.

  26. It is tolerably clear that the bank was not requested to  provide  the
      second,  third  and  fourth  items  of   information   prescribed   by
      requirement (10) in section (i).  This is apparent  from  the  opening
      paragraph of its letter dated 08 February 2013.  We  acknowledge  that
      the  "evidential  flexibility"   request   contained   in   the   UKBA
      communication of 07 February 2013 to the  Appellant's  solicitors  did
      not specify precisely that  these  three  items  of  information  were
      required.   Rather, the express request was  for  an  original  letter
      from the Allied Bank stating the Appellant's name, the amount of money
      available to her from the account, the regulatory body  for  the  bank
      and confirmation that the money was disposable in the United  Kingdom.
      However, the letter did not purport to detract from, dilute  or  waive
      the requirements of the Rules and  the  contrary  was  not  contended.
      Moreover, the UKBA request for an original letter from the Allied Bank
      contained the admonition:

         "You should also note that the required documents should  meet  the
         full requirements of the Immigration Rules."

      In the event, only three of the four items  of  information  expressly
      requested were provided.  The remaining item, which can be  linked  to
      requirement (5) in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i), namely confirmation that the
      bank is regulated by the appropriate body, was not provided.

  27. The ingredients of the  first  refusal  reason  were,  therefore,  the
      failure  of  the  Pakistani  Bank  to  provide  in   either   of   its
      communications the full address, landline phone number and  any  email
      address of the third party funder. The conclusion that the requirement
      in the Rules that the bank letter contain this  information  does  not
      give rise to any absurdity or anomaly is, in our  view,  easily  made.
      This conclusion is driven by two considerations.  The  first  is  that
      there is no evidence  lending  weight  to  the  Appellant's  argument.
      Evidence of absurdity could conceivably  have  been  provided  by  the
      Appellant, her solicitors, the bank or the third party funder.   There
      is no evidence from any of these sources.  The second consideration is
      that, viewed purely objectively and  in  the  abstract,  there  is  no
      detectable absurdity  or  anomaly.   The  requirement  that  the  bank
      provide this information does  not  give  rise  to  any  ascertainable
      insurmountable hurdle or impossibility.  On the contrary,  we  readily
      infer that the information in question would be easily available  and,
      further, that a genuine third party funder would be willing to provide
      it to the bank and to authorise its disclosure  to  the  Secretary  of
      State. The Appellant's absurdity argument is further confounded by the
      evidence of a fully compliant bank letter (albeit provided  belatedly)
      in two of the related  appeals,  the  combined  cases  of  Akhter  and
      Maqbool: see [9] of our determination in  those  cases.   Furthermore,
      there  was  no  contention  or,  more  important,  evidence  that  any
      provision of Pakistani banking law OR internal bank rule on regulation
      OR bank/customer contract  precludes  disclosure  of  the  information
      required by the Rules and we have no warrant for making  an  inference
      to this effect.  Thus the first ground of appeal must fail.

  28. Having regard to the Secretary of State's  reasons  for  refusing  the
      Appellant's application, the submissions relating to the  construction
      of the words "provided to" in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i), sub-paragraph (9)
      do not arise.  Notwithstanding, we consider  it  appropriate  to  make
      clear our view that this discrete argument has no merit.  It is  trite
      that in construing these words  the  whole  of  the  context  must  be
      considered.  This includes  Appendix  A,  Table  4,  which  repeatedly
      employs the terminology "access to" a minimum sum of money.   This  is
      repeated in the opening words of paragraph 41.  In paragraph 41(b) and
      (c), the language includes "permission to use the money to invest in a
      business in the UK" and  "transferrable  to  the  UK".   In  paragraph
      41(d),  the  phraseology  is  "available  to".  This  is  repeated  in
      paragraph 41-SD(a)(i).  In sub-paragraph (8) of the latter, one  finds
      the words "available from".  In paragraph  41-SD(b)(i),  the  language
      used is "available for".  In our view, it  is  clear  that  the  words
      "provided to" in sub-paragraph (9)  of  paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)  denote
      "available to".  We note, in passing, that this discrete provision  of
      the Rules has now been amended to this effect.  While  this  amendment
      serves the interests of maximum clarity, we do not  consider  that  it
      was necessary to remove any  doubt  or  obscurity  or  to  remedy  any
      absurdity.

  29. We have outlined the gist of the  second  ground  of  appeal  in  [24]
      above.  The argument advanced in support  of  this  ground  was  that,
      viewed through the lens of paragraph 41-SD, the letter from the  legal
      representative required by paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii) forms  part  of,  in
      the language of paragraph 245AA(b)(i), a "sequence of  documents"  and
      is  to  be  considered  a  document  omitted  therefrom.    While   we
      acknowledge the resourcefulness of this  argument,  we  are  satisfied
      that this provision of paragraph 245AA does not contemplate or embrace
      a case such as the present  where  the  single  document  required  by
      paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii) has not been provided with the application.  In
      our judgement, this document does  not  form  part  of  any  sequence.
      Rather, its provision is decreed by a freestanding requirement.  It is
      one of several documents which, in a case such  as  the  present,  are
      prescribed by  the  Rules.   To  characterise  these  documents  as  a
      "sequence" is to distort the ordinary and natural meaning of this word
      and to neglect the context. It  also  fails  to  give  effect  to  the
      evident intention underlying  paragraph  245AA.  We  consider  that  a
      document dictated by a substantive requirement of the Rules,  even  if
      one of several, is not  contemplated  by  the  intention  and  purpose
      underpinning paragraph 245AA. If any reinforcement of this  conclusion
      is needed, it is provided by the example of a bank  statement  missing
      from a series.  Its correctness is reaffirmed beyond  peradventure  by
      sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 245AA, which states unequivocally  that
      where a "specified document" has not been submitted  UKBA  "will  not"
      request same.  The "legal letter", where  required  (as  here),  is  a
      discrete, separate  "specified  document".   Accordingly,  the  second
      ground of appeal must fail.

Decision

  30. While our analysis and  reasoning  are  rather  different  from  those
      adopted by the FtT, we conclude that the appeal must be dismissed.

31.  We dismiss the appeal and affirm the decision of the FtT.
