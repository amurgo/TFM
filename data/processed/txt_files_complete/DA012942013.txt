Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Jacobs, Counsel, instructed by BMAP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  The  Secretary  of  State  appeals   with   permission   against   the
    determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  (First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Dineen and Mr D R Bremmer JP sitting as  a  panel)  promulgated  on  22
    January 2014 allowing Mr Kassi's appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent made on 18 June 2013 to make a deportation order against him
    pursuant to Regulation 19(3)(b) of the Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006  ("the  EEA  Regulations").   For  the  sake  of
    clarity, I refer to Mr Kassi as the claimant.

 2. The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom in March 2002  and  in  2004
    married Ms Etien, a Belgian  national.  He  was  later  issued  with  a
    residence card on the basis that he was the spouse of an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights.  That card was issued on 6 February 2006  and
    was renewed on 26 July 2006 for a period of five years.

 3. The claimant's marriage to Ms  Etien  failed  in  2008  and  they  were
    divorced in 2009.  The claimant had by then been in employment with the
    Post Office from April 2008; that continued until 2011.

 4. During the first marriage the  claimant  had  a  relationship  with  Ms
    Mandeng, a French national, and they had a child who was born in France
    on 12 August 2004.  The claimant began to live with Ms Mandeng  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2008; they were married on 20 November 2010 and had a
    second child, born 5 January 2011.

 5. On 31 May 2012 the claimant was convicted of conspiracy  to  steal  and
    three counts relating  to  the  possession  of  identity  documents  in
    connection with the conspiracy and was on 26 September  2012  sentenced
    to a period of two years and nine months' imprisonment.   The  offences
    were committed while he was an employed by the  Royal  Mail  as  a  van
    driver responsible for delivering high value postal items.

 6. It is the claimant's case that he had acquired the permanent  right  of
    residence in the United Kingdom through a combination of  residence  as
    the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights (whilst  married
    to Ms Etien) and as a  person  who  had  retained  right  of  residence
    subsequent to his divorce by virtue of Regulations 10(5) and  10(6)  of
    the EEA Regulations. It  is  not  in  dispute  that  Ms  Mandeng  is  a
    qualified person and thus at the date of decision the claimant was (and
    continues to be) the spouse of an EEA national.

 7. The Secretary of State did not accept that the claimant was entitled to
    the enhanced level of protection applicable to those who have  acquired
    the permanent right of residence given the lack of  evidence  that  the
    claimant had so done.  She concluded that his removal was proportionate
    and would be so, even were he to have acquired the right  of  permanent
    residence.

 8. On appeal the First-tier Tribunal found:-

      i) that the claimant's marriage to his first wife had  lasted  for  at
         least three years prior  to  divorce  proceedings;  that  they  had
         resided in the UK for at least one year during the duration of that
         marriage; and, accordingly [37] that the claimant  had  resided  in
         the United Kingdom as a family member in accordance  with  the  EEA
         Regulations as at the date of termination  of  the  first  marriage
         [38];

     ii) the claimant met the requirements of Regulations 10(5) and  (6)  of
         the EEA Regulations and  is  therefore  a  family  member  who  had
         retained the right of residence [39]; fulfilled the requirements of
         Regulation 15(1)(f);  and was thus entitled to a permanent right of
         residence;

    iii) that accordingly, a decision to  remove  him  could  not  be  taken
         except on serious grounds of public policy or public security; and

     iv) that there was a low risk  of  him  reoffending,  that  he  was  of
         previous good character and was unlikely  to  fall  under  the  bad
         influence of others in future; that a previous conviction does  not
         in itself justify a decision to remove him;

      v) that  taking  into  account  the  claimant's  family  and  economic
         situation, it was his best interests that his  children  remain  in
         the United Kingdom; that it would not be  in  their  interest  that
         they relocate to the Ivory Coast; that  there  was  a  genuine  and
         substantial relationship between them;

     vi) that the claimant had lived in the United Kingdom for a significant
         period of time, had been employed and was socially  and  culturally
         integrated in the  country;  that  he  had  limited  ties  to  Cï¿½te
         d'Ivoire [43]; and, accordingly, it would not be  proportionate  to
         remove him particularly in view of the low risk of his reoffending;
         and,

    vii) that [46] they would reach the same conclusion if the claimant  did
         not have the permanent right of residence;

   viii) removing the claimant would be  in  breach  of  Article  8  of  the
         European Convention on Human Rights.

 9. The Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  this
    decision on the grounds that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  give  any
    adequate reasons for findings on a material matter in that they had:-

      i) failed to make any findings of whether the  claimant  had  met  the
         requirements of Regulation 10(5),as he could only have  retained  a
         right of residence if he could demonstrate that he was pursuing  an
         activity which would make him a worker or self-employed were he  an
         EEA national; was a  self-sufficient  person;  or  was  the  family
         member of a person who is a worker;

     ii) failed to make any or adequate findings that claimant's deportation
         was in accordance with the law;

    iii) erred in  concluding  that  the  claimant's  deportation  would  be
         contrary to regulation 21 (5) that even if  the  claimant  did  not
         have permanent residency,  as his offence involves a serious breach
         of trust in his role and the Tribunal had failed to engage with the
         severity of his offending; and

     iv) failed to make reasoned findings in respect of Article 8.

10. Permission to appeal was granted on  12  February  2014  by  First-tier
    tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth.

Submissions

11. Mr Avery submitted for the Secretary of State that although  there  was
    evidence before the  Tribunal  that  the  claimant  had  been  employed
    continuously since before his first marriage was dissolved until  2011,
    there was insufficient evidence that the first wife had been exercising
    treaty rights at all material times and that while it  was  clear  that
    she had at  times  been  working,  this  was  not  sufficient  to  show
    continuity.

12. Mr Avery submitted also that the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  take  into
    account the seriousness of the offence when  assessing  proportionality
    although he did accept there was no challenge to the  finding  of  fact
    that the appellant presented a serious threat.

13. For the  claimant,  Mr  Jacobs  submitted  that  there  was  sufficient
    material before the Tribunal to allow it to conclude that the  claimant
    had been the spouse of a qualified  person  up  to  the  point  of  his
    divorce; that  there  was  sufficient  material  to  show  he  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 10 (6) of the 2006 Regulations and  thus  had
    been entitled to conclude that he had acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence.

14.  Mr  Jacobs  submitted  also  that  the  Tribunal  had  given  adequate
    consideration to the various factors in the claimant's favour and  even
    on the less stringent test, had given adequate reasons for why  it  was
    disproportionate to remove the claimant.

The Law

15. The powers of the Secretary  of  State  to  deport  (  or  exclude)  an
    individual who is ( or is a family member of) an EEA national  are  set
    out in the EEA Regulations which, so far as they are relevant, provide:

         19.  ...

          (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), an  EEA  national  who  has
         entered the United Kingdom or the family member of such a  national
         who has entered the United Kingdom under these Regulations  may  be
         removed if-

         (a) that person does not  have or ceases to have a right to  reside
         under these Regulations; or

         (b) the Secretary of State has decided that the person's removal is
         justified on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public  security  or
         public health in accordance with regulation 21.

         ...

         21.  (1)  In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         ...

         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

16. The claimant's case is that he had  acquired  permanent  residence,  an
    applicant must meet the requirements  of  Regulation  15  of  the  2006
    regulations which provides, as is relevant here:


    15.- Permanent right of residence

    (1) The following persons shall acquire the  right  to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom permanently-

         ...
       (f) a person who-
         (i) has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with these
  Regulations for a
         continuous period of five years; and
         (ii) was, at the end of that period, a family member who has
         retained the right of residence

17. The retention of the right of residence is governed  by  regulation  10
    which, so far as is relevant, provides:


    10. ,,,


    (5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-
         (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or of an
    EEA national with a
         permanent right of residence on the termination of the marriage or
         civil partnership of that person;
         (b) he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with these
        Regulations at the
         date of the termination;
         (c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
         (d) either-
             (i) prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the
            termination of the marriage or
             the civil partnership the marriage or civil partnership had
             lasted for at least three years and the parties to the
             marriage or civil partnership had resided in the United
             Kingdom for at least one year during its duration;

Discussion

18. The claimant's case is that during his marriage to  Ms  Etien,  he  had
    been the spouse of a qualified person; and, after his divorce, that  he
    was a family member who had retained the right of residence; that  both
    periods were in accordance with the EEA Regulations; and,  accordingly,
    at the end of the five year period commencing with his marriage  to  Ms
    Etien, he had acquired permanent residence.

19. The effect of the EEA Regulations is that the claimant needed  to  show
    that his residence here had,  until  the  point  of  divorce,  been  in
    accordance with the regulations which requires him to show that she had
    been at all material times a  qualified  person  by  exercising  Treaty
    Rights. Further, he also needed to show that he was a  person  who  had
    retained the right of residence as defined in regulation 10.

20. Mr Jacobs was unable to direct me towards any material relating to  the
    continuity of Ms Etien's employment up  to  the  date  of  divorce.   I
    accept that the respondent must at several points have been  satisfied,
    as was the Immigration Appellate Authority on an earlier occasion, that
    the claimant's first wife had been a qualified person, but that is not,
    without more, a sufficient basis for concluding that  the  requirements
    of the EEA Regulations had been met.

21. Further, all of the requirements in regulation 10 (5) (a) to (d) had to
    be met in order for him to be treated as a person who had retained  the
    right of residence. While there  is  no  challenge  to  the  Tribunal's
    finding that the claimant met the requirements of regulation 10 (5) (d)
    and there is substantial evidence from Royal Mail that the claimant did
    fulfil the requirements of paragraph  10(6)  of  the  EEA  Regulations,
    there claimant also needed to show that  he  met  the  requirements  of
    regulations 10 (5) (a) to (c). There is no indication that the Tribunal
    considered these requirements, nor is there evidence that Ms Etien  was
    a qualified person up until their divorce

22. There is there is nowhere in the material before me  evidence  relating
    to the whole of the period prior to the divorce nor is it explained  in
    the determination how the Tribunal concluded that the  requirements  of
    paragraph 10(5) (b) in respect of  the  continued  exercise  of  treaty
    rights by Ms Etien had been shown.

23. It was therefore not open to the Tribunal to conclude that the claimant
    had acquired a right or permanent residence. That is  not,  however,  a
    sufficient basis  to  set  aside  the  determination,  given  that  the
    Tribunal found that they would have allowed the appeal  in  any  event,
    had they had to consider the appeal on the stricter test applicable  to
    those who had not acquired

24. In this case there is no challenge by the respondent to the  Tribunal's
    finding that the appellant presented a low risk of reoffending which is
    a significant finding with respect  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant presents a "genuine present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    to the  interests  of  public  policy".   Further,  there  is  no  real
    challenge to the Tribunal's finding that the appellant is  of  previous
    good character, that he  would  be  unlikely  to  fall  under  the  bad
    influence of others in the future and that  it  would  not  be  in  his
    children's best interests either for them to be removed to Ivory  Coast
    or for them to be separated from him.  These were all considered to  be
    significant factors weighing in his favour. The Tribunal gave  adequate
    and sustainable reasons for these findings.

25. It is clear from the determination that the Tribunal were aware of  the
    sentencing remarks and the basis on which  the  claimant  he  had  been
    convicted [12] that they were aware of the seriousness of the  offence.
    The submission that the seriousness of the offence, or the fact that it
    involved an abuse of trust should be  taken  into  account  is  without
    merit; these are not relevant considerations within Regulation 21(5) or
    (6).

26. While Mr Avery submitted they are factors to be taken into  account  in
    assessing likelihood of re-offending, that is not what was  pleaded  in
    the grounds of appeal; there was no challenge to the Tribunal's finding
    on that matter.

27. There is no challenge to the  Tribunal's  findings  of  fact  that  the
    appellant has spent a significant period of time in the United Kingdom,
    had been in employment here, and is socially and culturally  integrated
    into the country. I  am  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal  gave  adequate
    reasons for reaching their conclusion that, particularly  in  light  of
    their unchallenged assessment of  the  low  risk  of  reoffending,  the
    claimant's appeal fell to be allowed under the EEA Regulations, even on
    the lower test applicable to  those  who  had  not  acquired  permanent
    residence.

Conclusion

28. Accordingly, although the Tribunal erred in finding that the  appellant
    had acquired the permanent right  of  residence,  that  error  was  not
    material as they gave sufficient, adequate and  comprehensible  reasons
    for concluding why, on the lower  test  applicable  to  those  who  are
    family member of EEA  nationals  who  are  qualified  persons,  it  was
    disproportionate to remove the appellant  having  had  regards  to  the
    provisions of Regulations 21(5) and (6) of the  2006  Regulations.  For
    these reasons I uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Summary of Conclusions

      1) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
         making of an error of law and I uphold it.
