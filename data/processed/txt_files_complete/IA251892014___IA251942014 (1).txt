                            DECISION AND REASONS

    History of Appeal

 1. The 1st Respondent, who was born on 23rd March 1991, is a  national  of
    the Philippines.  The 2nd Respondent, who is her son, was born on  18th
    November 2007 and is also a  national  of  the  Philippines.   The  1st
    Respondent met her British husband in the United  Kingdom  in  February
    2012.  She subsequently returned to the Philippines and  re-entered  as
    his fiancï¿½e on 13th September 2013, bringing her son with her.  The 1st
    Respondent married her husband in the United Kingdom on  13th  February
    2014.

 2. On 25th February 2014 the Respondents applied for leave  to  remain  as
    dependents of the 1st Respondent's husband.  When doing so, they relied
    on paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  their
    sponsor had had a period  of  unemployment  since  November  2013  and,
    therefore, they could not meet the income requirements of Appendix  FM.
    The Appellant refused their applications.

 3. They appealed and their appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    O'Rourke.  In a decision and reasons, promulgated on 23rd January 2015,
    he dismissed their appeals under  the  Immigration  Rules  but  allowed
    their appeals under the European Convention on Human Rights.

 4. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal on 19th March 2014.  She
    asserted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had not directed himself to
    the correct approach to Article 8 outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    had, therefore, ignored her  view  on  the  appropriate  threshold  for
    proportionality.   In  addition,  she  asserted  that  the   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had erred when he found the  only  sub-sections  117B(1)
    and (3) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  were
    relevant to their appeal.  She also noted that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had relied on the case of MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900  despite  the  fact  that  it  had
    already been overturned by the Court of Appeal.  Finally, she  asserted
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had misdirected himself  as  to  the
    ratio of Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2008]
    UKHL 40 as there  had  been  no  concession  on  her  part  that  entry
    clearance was bound to be granted if the Respondents were to return  to
    the Philippines and there was  no  evidence  that  the  sponsor  was  a
    refugee from there.

 5. Upper Tribunal Judge Deans refused permission to appeal on  17th  March
    2014 but permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  on  4th
    June 2015.  She found that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge had misdirected himself in failing to have adequate regard to the
    whole of section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 and had also relied on MM and misapplied the ratio in Chikwamba.

 6. Counsel for the Respondents had submitted a Rule 24  notice  in  reply,
    dated 19th June 2015.

    Error of Law Hearing

 7. The Home Office Presenting Officer began his oral submissions by noting
    that the Respondents had not established that there  were  entitled  to
    leave to remain under the Immigration Rules, including paragraph  EX.1.
    He also noted  that  in  Singh  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 74 the Court of Appeal endorsed the approach
    in R on the application of Nagre v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).

 8. In addition, he submitted that in The Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department v SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA Civ  387  the  Court  of
    Appeal found that an Applicant had to meet the requirements of Appendix
    FM-SE.and referred to paragraph 25 of The Queen on the  application  of
    Agyarko v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440.  He also  noted  that  the  Respondents'  immigration  status  was
    precarious, as found in AM (S117B) Malawi [2015]  UKUT  260.   He  then
    submitted that the  Respondents  needed  to  establish  that  temporary
    separation would give rise to a breach of Article 8.   They  could  not
    just assert that Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2008] UKHL applied regardless of their circumstances.

 9. Counsel for the  Respondents  then  replied.   He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant had not been granted permission to appeal on the "two  stage"
    approach and that the case of Singh had not been promulgated until 12th
    February 2015 and, therefore, it could not amount to an  error  of  law
    for the First-tier Tribunal Judge to not refer to it.  He also asserted
    that AM was promulgated after the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision
    and reasons and that this was a family life case and not a private life
    case.  He then submitted that Chikwamba did apply as the Appellant  had
    made a concession, as recorded in paragraph  11(i)  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision and reasons.

10. He added that any errors made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge were not
    material and that it was not reasonable to expect  the  Respondents  to
    return to the Philippines.  He also continued to rely on EB (Kosovo)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41.

11. At paragraph 21 of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision and reasons
    he correctly referred to the obligation to take into  account  sections
    117A-D of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  when
    considering Article 8.2 of the European Convention on Human Rights  and
    he  copied  these   provisions   into   his   decision   and   reasons.
    Subsequently, at paragraph 22 he stated that "only s117B(1) and (3) are
    relevant in this matter and they have already been considered  in  this
    determination".  In her grounds of appeal the Appellant submitted  that
    this was an error of law  as  sub-section  117B(5)  was  also  engaged.
    Upper Tribunal Judge Coker gave permission to appeal on this ground  on
    the basis that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  failed  to  have
    adequate regard to the whole of s.117B.

12. In relation to sub-section 117B(1) the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    already noted in paragraph 18 that as the Respondents  could  not  meet
    the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  interference  with  their
    family life rights  was  legitimate  as  it  was  for  the  purpose  of
    controlling immigration.  He did not explicitly state that  immigration
    control was in the public interest but  this  was  an  inference  which
    could be read into his reference to Razgar.

13. At paragraph 11 of his decision and  reasons  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge noted that by the time of the hearing the  1st  Respondent  could
    meet the income threshold and that her husband had  been  a  scaffolder
    all of his working life.  Therefore, it is clear that he had considered
    sub-section 117B(3).

14. The Appellant submitted in her grounds of appeal  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge should also have taken into account sub-section 117B(5).
     However, this states that "little weight should be given to a  private
    life established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
    status is precarious" and in paragraph 8 of his  decision  and  reasons
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had noted that the  Respondents'  appeals
    were on the basis of family and not private life. As a  consequence,  I
    do not find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in his approach to
    section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

15. The Appellant also appealed on the basis that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in law by referring to an extract  from  MM  and  others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin).
    The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  clearly  referred  to  this  case  in
    paragraph 23(i) of  his  decision  and  reasons  when  considering  the
    question of proportionality.  In  particular,  he  found  that  "it  is
    unreasonable to expect the sponsor to live in the Philippines.  He is a
    UK citizen and has lived here all [his] life and applying MM it is  not
    reasonable to expect him to leave the UK to be with his wife".

16. However, in paragraph 3 of his  decision  and  reasons  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had noted that the parties had accepted that at the date
    of the Appellant's refusal the Respondents  did  not  meet  the  income
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The  Respondents
    had also applied for leave to remain in reliance on paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM and been refused leave on this  basis.   This  should  have
    been the starting point for considering Article 8 outside the Rules and
    not the extract from MM.

17.  In  paragraph  29  of  Nagre,  Mr.  Justice  Sales  found  that  after
    considering the Rules and if there remains an arguable case that  there
    may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the  Rules  by
    reference to Article 8 it will  be  necessary  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under the new rules to require the grant of such leave.  (I  have  also
    noted that subsequent to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision  and
    reasons the Court of Appeal endorsed this approach in Singh.)

18. I have noted that permission to appeal was  not  granted  on  the  "two
    stage" approach but the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  reliance  on  the
    decision of MM in the High Court required me to consider  the  approach
    subsequently taken by the Court of Appeal in  Article  8  cases.   This
    approach required the First-tier Tribunal Judge to  take  into  account
    the fact that the Respondents had also applied  for  leave  relying  on
    paragraph EX.1.  It was  not  disputed  that  the  1st  Respondent  had
    established a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  her  husband.
    But the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to consider  whether  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside  the  United
    Kingdom.  In the light of Nagre and subsequent cases she  had  to  show
    that there were additional and compelling circumstances over and  above
    there being insurmountable obstacles to her husband  returning  to  the
    Philippines with her.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge's  reasons  failed
    to take this into account and merely applied a test of reasonableness.

19. Before both the First-tier Tribunal Judge and myself  the  Respondents'
    counsel argued that Lord Bingham in EB (Kosovo) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41 and Sedley LJ in VW  (Uganda)  v
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  5  had
    established an  alternative  domestic  test  of  reasonableness.   This
    argument was fully explored  and  rejected  by  Mr.  Justice  Sales  in
    paragraphs 46  to  48  of  Nagre.   I  adopt  his  reasoning  in  those
    paragraphs and, in particular, note that he found that "contrary to the
    submission of ... I do not think that it is right to try to  read  Lord
    Bingham's statement in EB (Kosovo) as a canonical  formulation  of  the
    test to be applied.  The basic point he  made  was  that  the  domestic
    courts should seek to follow the general approach to the application of
    Article 8 in immigration cases to be  identified  from  the  Strasbourg
    case law.  His reference to what could  reasonably  be  expected  of  a
    spouse was a loose, compendious summary of how the ECtHR tends to  look
    at the issue, rather than a detailed and  authoritative  expression  of
    the approach to be adopted, arrived at after a careful analysis of  the
    relevant Strasbourg case law".  He also found that  nothing  in  Sedley
    LJ's judgment in  VW  (Uganda)  qualified  this  interpretation  of  EB
    (Kosovo).

20. In addition, he failed to take into account the decision by  the  Court
    of Appeal in The Queen on the application of  Agyarko  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440  where  Lord  Justice
    Sales found that "the mere fact that ...  is  a  British  citizen,  has
    lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence
    might find it difficult and may be reluctant to re-locate to ...  could
    not constitute insurmountable obstacles to his doing so".

21. In paragraph 23(ii) of his decision and reasons the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge also found that it was 'pointless' applying Chikwamba to send the
    Respondents back to the Philippines, simply for  the  purpose  of  them
    applying to enter UK to rejoin the sponsor.  In her grounds  of  appeal
    the  Appellant  asserted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   had
    misdirected himself as there did not appear to  be  any  concession  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State that entry clearance was bound  to  be
    granted.  I accept that paragraph 11(I) of  the  decision  and  reasons
    notes that it was accepted by the Appellant had the 1st Appellant could
    now meet the income threshold which was the sole basis upon  which  her
    application had been refused.

22. However, the First-tier Tribunal Judge made  no  findings  of  fact  in
    paragraph 11 of his decision and reasons about whether a short  absence
    abroad in order to apply for entry clearance now that  she  would  meet
    the income threshold would amount to a  breach  of  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention  on  Human  Rights  even  though  counsel  for  the
    Respondents appears to have submitted that this absence may affect  the
    2nd Respondent's education and may take some  time.   The  judgment  in
    Chikwamba clearly indicates that a judge must consider whether  on  the
    particular facts of the case a temporary separation would give rise  to
    a breach of  Article  8.   This  approach  was  recently  confirmed  in
    paragraph 38 of R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary  separation  -
    proportionality) IJR 00189 (IAC) where Upper Tribunal Judge Gill  found
    that "if it is shown by an individual (the burden  being  upon  him  or
    her) that an application for  entry  clearance  from  abroad  would  be
    granted and that there would be significant  interference  with  family
    life by temporary removal, the weight to  be  accorded  to  the  formal
    requirement of obtaining entry clearance is reduced".

23. Unfortunately in this case the First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  make
    any findings of fact which would have enabled him  to  apply  Chikwamba
    correctly.

24. For all these reasons I am satisfied that there were material errors of
    law in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision and reasons and that it
    should be set aside in its entirety. I am also satisfied that, as there
    will need to be a complete  re-hearing,  this  is  a  proper  case  for
    remission to the First-tier Tribunal.




    Directions

    1.   The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de  novo
    hearing.

    2.   The appeal should not  be  re-listed  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O'Rourke.
