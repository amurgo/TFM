                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Hodson (counsel), instructed by Elder Rahimi,
solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Schaerf, promulgated  on  17  November
2015, which allowed the Appellant's appeal under Article 3 of  the  European
Convention on Human Rights, and under the Immigration Rules.

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 1st  October  1985  and  is  a  national  of
Vietnam.

4.    In March 2004 the appellant was trafficked into the UK for Labour.  He
escaped from traffickers in 2006 or 2007. On 22 December  2009  he  came  to
the attention of the respondent who served a notice of liability to  removal
as an illegal entrant. In  mid-February  2013  the  appellant  submitted  an
application for indefinite leave to remain outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
On 27 September 2013 the respondent refused that application. On 15  October
2013 the appellant appealed against that decision.

5.    On 25 March 2014 the appellant claimed asylum. On  21  July  2014  the
respondent refused  his  claim,  but  the  decision  was  not  sent  to  the
appellant until 26 June 2015. On  31  March  2014  the  competent  authority
concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that  the  appellant
was a victim of human trafficking,  and  on  21  July  2014  the  respondent
confirmed that the competent  authority  had  conclusively  found  that  the
appellant had been trafficked.

6.    The appellant appealed against both the decision of  27  October  2013
and the refusal of his claim for asylum dated 21 July 2014.

The Judge's Decision

7.    The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  Designated  Judge
of the First-tier Tribunal Shaerf ("the Judge") allowed the  appeal  against
the Respondent's decision on article 3 ECHR  grounds  and  under  parargraph
276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

8.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  8  December  2015  Judge  Parkes
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    "The Judge's reasons appear  to  accept  the  evidence  of  the  expert
    without reference to the evidence cited by the Secretary  of  State  in
    the  Refusal  Letter.  As  such  the   findings   made   are   arguably
    insufficiently reasoned and it is arguable that the  decision  was  not
    open to the Judge on the basis of the evidence available."

The Hearing

9.    Mr Tarlow, for the respondent, moved the grounds of  appeal.  Although
there are three grounds of appeal, he drew matters clearly into  focus  when
he told me that the Secretary of State's position is  that  there  has  been
inadequate consideration of the appellant's ability to  return  to  Vietnam.
He told me that there was evidence before the Judge of a  supportive  return
package from "refugee action" which would enable the appellant to return  to
Vietnam and obtain the documents  that  he  needs  to  re-establish  himself
there. He told me that the Judge placed undue weight  on  an  expert  report
and did not consider the background materials relied on by  the  respondent.
He argued that the decision is inadequately reasoned because the  Judge  did
not  balance  each  strand  of  background  material  before  reaching   the
conclusion that greater weight can be placed on the expert report. He  urged
me to set aside the  decision  and  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  the
appellant's appeal.

10.   Mr Hodson, for the appellant,  adopted  the  terms  of  the  rules  24
response served on 2 February 2016. He told me that at  [40]  and  [41]  the
Judge considers the experts report & notes that no  challenge  is  taken  to
the expert's qualifications and experience. At [41] the Judge does not  just
consider the expert report but considers other  background  evidence  before
reaching a conclusion that there  is  a  lack  of  support  for  victims  of
trafficking in Vietnam. He reminded me that between [26] and [36] the  Judge
records the submissions  that  were  made  to  him.  He  told  me  that  the
decision, when read as a whole, cannot be viewed as  inadequately  reasoned;
that the Judge has given careful consideration to the  background  materials
before concluding that he can place reliance on  the  expert  report,  which
(he told me) is carefully referenced and  detailed.  He  told  me  that  the
facts as the Judge found them  to  be,  when  viewed  against  the  reliable
background information, could only  lead  the  Judge  to  the  view  of  the
appellant's return would breach his rights in terms of article 3  ECHR,  and
that there are very significant obstacles to reintegration into Vietnam.  He
urged me to dismiss the appeal and to allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

11.   There is no great  dispute  about  the  facts  in  this  case.  It  is
accepted that the appellant is an orphan who was trafficked from Vietnam  to
be used as slave labour. It is beyond dispute that  the  appellant  has  now
been in the UK for more than  10  years.  No  challenge  is  raised  to  the
Judge's finding that the appellant's asylum appeal  does  not  succeed.  The
focus in the appeal before me is on whether or not the Judge has  considered
all of the background materials, and whether or not he  has  given  adequate
reasons for placing significant weight on a report prepared by Prof Seddon.

12.   At [14] the Judge correctly  sets  out  the  burden  and  standard  of
proof. At [15] the Judge lists the documentary evidence placed  before  him.
Between [21] and [25]  the  Judge  summarises  the  Home  Office  presenting
officer's submissions. In the last sentence of [21] the Judge  records  that
the Home Office presenting officer "... did not  make  any  submissions  why
Prof Seddon's report should not be accepted in whole or in  part."  At  [40]
the Judge records  "the  respondent  made  no  challenge  to  Prof  Seddon's
qualifications or to the content of his expert  report."  Neither  of  those
findings of the Judge are challenged.

13.   It is not disputed that there were other background  materials  before
the Judge including the details of the  assistance  on  offer  from  refugee
action. Between [21] and [36] the Judge  records  the  submissions  made  by
both parties' advocates. No challenges  is  taken  to  the  quality  of  the
summary of submissions contained there. The  Judge  records  in  detail  the
background materials he was referred to.

14.   The details of the voluntary assisted return  reintegration  programme
operated by refugee action is contained at  paragraphs  34  and  35  of  the
reasons for refusal letter sent to the appellant on  26  June  2015.  It  is
there that the summary of what is contained on a  website  is  rehearsed  by
the respondent. In so far as that is evidence it is  the  only  evidence  of
the reintegration programme relied on by the  respondent  which  was  placed
before the Judge.

15.   In this appeal what the respondent  really  asks  is  why  didn't  the
Judge provide reasoning in the decision  for  preferring  the  detailed  and
unchallenged expert report which he found to be consistent  with  183  pages
of background materials placed before him, to  31  lines  contained  in  two
paragraphs of the reasons for  refusal  letter  setting  out  a  summary  of
reintegration programme which the respondent said the appellant "... may  be
eligible for".

16.   In Detamu v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 604 the Court of Appeal said that  it
was an error of law to give no weight to the report of  an  expert  who  had
clearly indicated his expertise and the sources for his information.  In  FS
(Treatment of Expert evidence) Somalia [2009] UKAIT 00004 the Tribunal  held
that Immigration Judges have a duty to  consider  all  the  evidence  before
them when reaching a decision in an even handed  and  impartial  manner.  In
assessing the evidence before them they must  attach  such  weight  as  they
consider appropriate to that evidence. It may on  occasions  be  appropriate
to reject the conclusions reached by an expert. What is crucial  is  that  a
reasoned explanation is given for so doing.

17.   The Judge has not taken an incorrect approach to the expert  evidence.
The Judge clearly considers the expert's qualifications and the  content  of
the expert report. At [14] he notes that the respondent raises no  challenge
to any aspect of the expert's report. At [41] he summarises  the  background
evidence & finds that it is consistent with  the  expert's  report  and  the
expert's conclusions.

18.   It is clear from the decision that at the First  tier  the  respondent
did not place reliance on paragraph 34 and 35 of  the  reasons  for  refusal
letter, and did not argue that the  availability  of  an  assisted  return's
package rendered the expert report redundant.

19.   It is clear from a careful reading of the decision that  having  taken
account of the background materials and the expert  report  the  Judge  drew
the conclusion that the support systems available  in  Vietnam  are  limited
and that the appellant faces "...destitution and a  lack  of  capability  to
access the limited support systems". In doing so the Judge  clearly  rejects
the respondent's  argument  that  the  provision  of  travel  documentation,
assistance with flight arrangements and a potential payment of up  to  �1500
is enough  to  overcome  the  difficulties  highlighted  in  the  background
materials and the expert report.

20.   The Judge's finding that  the  appellant  would  face  destitution  if
returned  to  Vietnam  is  sufficient  to  support  a  conclusion  that  the
appellant's article 3 ECHR rights  would  be  breached  by  return,  and  is
clearly sufficient for finding that there are very significant obstacles  to
the appellant's reintegration into Vietnam.

21.   The Judge's fact-finding exercise cannot be faulted.  The  conclusions
reached by the Judge are conclusions which were manifestly open  to  him  to
reach on the facts as he found them to be.

22.   In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside)  [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)
the Tribunal held that the Upper Tribunal would not  normally  set  aside  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection  of
law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and the relevant  Country
Guidance has been taken into  account,  unless  the  conclusions  the  judge
draws from the primary data were not reasonably open to him or her.

23.   I find that the Judge's decision, when  read  as  a  whole,  sets  out
findings that are sustainable and sufficiently detailed and based on  cogent
reasoning.

CONCLUSION

24.   No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

25.   The appeal is dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
stands.
