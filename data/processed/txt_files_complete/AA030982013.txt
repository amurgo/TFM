                                   Between
                             Mr Nieruban Xavier
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born 24  August  1988.  Upper
      Tribunal  Judge  Eshun  granted  permission  to  appeal  against   the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Hussein, who  had  dismissed  the
      appellant's appeal on Refugee Convention, humanitarian protection  and
      human rights grounds.


   2. On 19 September 2013 DUTJ Woodcraft sent a notice indicating that  his
      preliminary view was that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal
      contained an error of law and that the appeal should  be  remitted  to
      the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard  along  with  the  appellant's
      brother's appeal [AA/02172/2013], on the 19 November 2013. He  invited
      submissions from the parties by 11 October 2013, should they object to
      such a course. Neither party responded.

   3. Having considered  the  circumstances  of  this  case  for  myself,  I
      conclude that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  the  matter
      claimed  in  ground  five  of  the  grounds  of  application  i.e.  by
      unlawfully excluding relevant evidence from  his  consideration;  such
      evidence being the appellant's brother's  passport,  asylum  interview
      records and bank statements.  Although  the  appellant's  brother  was
      permitted to give oral evidence, the  exclusion  of  such  potentially
      corroborative documentary evidence was in breach of the principles  of
      natural justice on the facts of the instant case.

   4. I therefore set aside the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      and, as indicated would be the case in Judge Woodcraft's notice, remit
      the appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal [noting that  there  having
      been no objection to such course and having first considered the terms
      of the Senior President of the Tribunals' Practice Statement  of  25th
      September 2012].


Decision



The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
error of law and is set aside. The appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for determination.
