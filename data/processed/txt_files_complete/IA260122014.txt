Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Alim, instructed by Yaqub & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the USA and she entered the UK on a  visa
    dated 8th October 2011  as  the  fianc�e  of  Kevin  Rixon,  a  British
    citizen.   She  married  him  on  10th  December  2011  and  lodged  an
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  spouse  on
    23rd January 2012.  At the hearing before me both Ms Isherwood  and  Mr
    Alim agreed  that  the  applicable  Rule  in  the  first  instance  was
    paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules as the decision came  under  the
    transitional provisions of the  Immigration  Rules,  particularly  Rule
    280.  Should the appellant fail to succeed under those Rules then  Rule
    277A under Appendix  FM  should  apply.   The  respondent  refused  the
    application on 10th June 2014.

 2. Under paragraph 287 the respondent found that  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor did not have the funds to maintain  or  accommodate  themselves
    adequately and that the appellant had failed to provide a life  in  the
    UK test.  The appellant was also refused under Appendix FM paragraph R-
    LTRP(d)(iii) and paragraph EX.1.  It was not accepted that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the return to the USA.  Nor was it accepted
    that the appellant had severed all ties including the social,  cultural
    and family ties with the USA.

 3. A previous determination by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Britton  which
    allowed  the  appeal  was  set  aside  following  an  application   for
    permission to appeal by  the  respondent  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    impossible to tell from  the  decision  whether  the  appeal  had  been
    allowed under the Rules or on Article 8 grounds.

 4. At the hearing before me a  large  bundle  of  evidence  was  submitted
    ranging from pages 1 to 243 and a continuing bundle of 1 to 69.

 5. I  was  also  supplied  with  Yarce  (adequate  maintenance:  benefits)
    Colombia [2012] UKUT 425 (IAC),  Dube  (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]  UKUT  90
    (IAC) and R (on the application of  Oludoyi  &  Ors)  [2014]  UKUT  539
    (IAC).

 6. Both the appellant and her  husband  sponsor  attended  and  gave  oral
    testimony and adopted their statements.

 7. Ms Isherwood conceded that there was evidence that  the  appellant  had
    submitted a life in the UK test.  It was agreed by the  representatives
    that I should consider the old Rules, in particular paragraph 287 which
    I have set out below:

         "287.    (a)  The requirements for indefinite leave to  remain  for
             the spouse or civil partner of a person present and settled in
             the United Kingdom are that:

                  ...

                  (iv) there will be adequate accommodation for the  parties
                      and any dependants without recourse to  public  funds
                      in   accommodation   which   they   own   or   occupy
                      exclusively; and

                  (v)  the parties will be able to maintain  themselves  and
                      any dependants adequately without recourse to  public
                      funds; and

                  (vi) the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge
                      of the  English  language  and  sufficient  knowledge
                      about life in the United Kingdom, in accordance  with
                      Appendix KoLL."

 8. Further to Section 85(4) on an appeal under Section 82(1) the  Tribunal
    may consider any matter which it thinks relevant to  the  substance  of
    the decision,  including  a  matter  arising  after  the  date  of  the
    decision.  The date of the hearing before me is the relevant  date  for
    evidence.

 9. On balance I consider that a very full picture of the  finances  of  Mr
    Rixon were set out in the bundle before me and this  included  evidence
    of  his  recently  acquired  job  with  Hays  Recruiting  Experts.   He
    confirmed in his oral evidence that he had  obtained  work  in  January
    2015 and earned �624.75 per week, which was the equivalent  of  �414.73
    per week and indeed for the purposes of calculation in  this  appeal  I
    conclude that the income is the equivalent of a calendar monthly income
    of �1,802.66.  There was much discussion  as  to  whether  this  income
    could be taken into account bearing in mind that Ms Isherwood made  the
    point that the job was only a temporary (indeed he would not be able to
    comply with the strict  evidential  requirements  in  relation  to  the
    financial aspects of the Immigration  rules  now  in  force  hence  the
    reliance on EX.1).  Nonetheless Mr Rixon had held the  appointment  for
    approximately three months and produced at the hearing itself a further
    wage slip dated 15th April showing continuing income and I accept  that
    he is currently in employment and I accept his oral  evidence  which  I
    found to be candid that all contracts issued stated that they were  for
    the purposes of one to three months and that he had every  prospect  of
    his employment continuing.  In fairness this must be the same  for  all
    those employed and self-employed.  There can never be a guarantee  that
    work  will  continue.  That  said  Mr  Rixon  had  been  in  continuous
    employment until his recent spate of unemployment and with  his  skills
    and experience I accept that, on the balance of probabilities he  could
    continue to be engaged in gainful employment.

10. I also take into account the fact that the appellant herself is a piano
    teacher and that she had been told by her previous solicitors that  she
    was not allowed to work after she submitted her application for further
    leave to remain.   She  had  subsequently  been  told  by  her  current
    solicitors that she was indeed able to work and she had  now  lined  up
    students that she could take to teach piano.  She maintained  that  she
    would earn a living of approximately �500 per week but even  if  I  did
    not take into account her income at all I accept the evidence that  the
    couple do have an income of approximately �1,800 per month.   As  Yarce
    confirmed it was important that the resources available would  meet  or
    exceed  the  relevant  income  support  level  by  the  United  Kingdom
    government following KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065.

11. Yarce really referred to maintenance benefits and as Mr Rixon confirmed
    he had not claimed any benefits for his wife since he had lost his  job
    in August  2013  with  the  Ford  Motor  Company.   It  was  from  that
    redundancy that the problems of this couple stemmed.

12. I note that the appellant carries the legal burden of proof in that she
    meets  the  relevant  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  I
    understand Ms Isherwood's argument that the availability  of  a  credit
    card facility should not be taken  into  account,  in  particular  that
    there needed to be an application made for the facility to be used  and
    it was not a voluntary payment.  That said, as it states in Yarce, much
    depends on the credibility of the appellant's sponsor and  third  party
    generally and as to the specifics of the actual payments.  I  hold  the
    credit card facility to be neutral.  This is because evidence was given
    that there were still credit card debts outstanding to the  sponsor  in
    the sum of approximately �11,000 but the schedule drawn up by Mr  Rixon
    and which could be cross referenced and  counter-checked  by  the  bank
    statements showed that he had  paid  a  level  of  �71,000  since  2012
    against his credit card facilities and no doubt with the assistance  of
    his income and savings.  I accept that this shows Mr Rixon is  able  to
    maintain a certain financial discipline and was able to meet the  level
    of his commitments to the five different credit card companies  but  it
    is not a requirement of KA that I take into  account  those  particular
    debts.  That said, the level of his savings is now  in  the  region  of
    �3,000.  To support his financial contentions Mr Rixon  produced,  what
    appeared to be a completed set of bank statements from  the  Nationwide
    from February 2012 to January 2015.

13. In the circumstances of this particular couple I accept that they  have
    been able to live together since Mrs Rixon came to the UK in  2011  and
    they have claimed no  benefits  for  the  appellant  herself  and  have
    managed to pay a considerable amount of their credit card repayments.

14. On this basis I accept that the appellants have sufficient income  with
    which to pay their rent which is �750 per month and their  council  tax
    �125 per month with income to cover the income benefit that they  would
    receive as a couple over the age of 18  which  was  assessed  at  being
    �497.68 per month at the 2014 to 2015  rate.   Mr  Rixon  confirmed  in
    evidence that the amount superfluous to that  would  easily  cover  any
    payments required on his credit card.  He did not use the cards to live
    on and the overall outstanding debt was reducing.

15. As such I conclude  the  appellant  is  able  to  cover  the  rent  and
    therefore there is satisfactory accommodation.  As  the  appellant  has
    been accommodated since her arrival to the UK and  Mr  Rixon  confirmed
    that  he  had  only  ever  claimed  single  housing  benefit,  which  I
    understand he was not  doing  at  present,  I  find  that  the  housing
    requirement is fulfilled.

16. Even if this were not the case I conclude that under paragraph 277  the
    appellants would  be  considered  under  the  new  Appendix  FM  Rules.
    Essentially it was  argued  that  the  appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM  and  in  particular  R-LTRP.1.1,  and  the
    requirements  of  EX.1(d).   In  these   circumstances   insurmountable
    obstacles means there are very significant difficulties which would  be
    faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.

17. The couple married on 10th December 2011 and the appellant was  granted
    leave to remain until 23rd January 2014.  Her husband was employed full
    time until his contract with Ford came to an end when the plant  closed
    down. The appellant has a son, Jake, born  on  26th  February  1991  in
    Sacramento, USA, who does not plan to live in the  United  Kingdom  but
    the appellant gave evidence that she had no relatives in the  USA  that
    she could rely on.  She confirmed in  oral  evidence,  which  I  accept
    owing to her candour, that her relatives in the USA  were  not  wealthy
    but when asked whether she and her husband could not  relocate  to  the
    USA she stated that her husband would have difficulty in finding a  job
    but more tellingly confirmed that his health insurance would be also an
    issue.  She gave evidence as did Mr Rixon that the couple had consulted
    the US Embassy and there were strict entry requirements to the USA  not
    least that there would be a requirement  of  health  insurance  without
    which there are heavy fines.  Mr Rixon gave evidence that  he  suffered
    from type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure as a result of stress, but
    which is currently treated under the NHS, and I accept that the  couple
    would have great difficulty in accessing healthcare to which  Mr  Rixon
    is entitled as a British citizen.  I conclude that  this  would  be  an
    insurmountable obstacle to him leaving the UK for the USA and  enabling
    the parties to set up home together.  As Mr Rixon  stated  there  would
    also be financial entry requirements.  The fact is that the couple have
    to date made their life in the UK and have complied substantially  with
    the Immigration Rules.

18. Should Mrs Postelle-Rixon, the appellant, be required to return to  the
    USA and make an application outside the Rules now she would be  subject
    to the much more stringent financial requirements  which  were  not  in
    place when  she  initially  came  to  the  UK  and  made  her  previous
    application.

19. I therefore find that the appellants can succeed  both  under  the  old
    paragraph 287  and  therefore  in  fact  the  application  of  the  new
    Immigration Rules under Appendix FM is  not  appropriate.   That  said,
    even if they were I find that the appellant can succeed under those new
    Rules.

20. Further to the judgment in Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74   there  are
    factors which have not been taken into  account  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, not least the health of Mr Rixon.

21. I therefore have made an assessment by applying the five stage test  in
    Razgar.  It is clear that the appellants have established a family life
    together and have done so since 2011.  Mrs Rixon has been in the UK now
    for nearly four years, having married in  2011.   She  has  established
    both a family life and  a  private  life  and  the  threshold  for  the
    engagement of that life is low.  I find that  the  refusal  is  not  in
    accordance with the law because Mrs Rixon has met the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.

22. On the face of it, the Immigration  Rules  have  a  legitimate  aim  in
    themselves in that the decision is necessary for the protection of  the
    economic wellbeing of the country and for the protection of the  rights
    and freedoms of others through the maintenance of immigration  control.
    However, the key question for the  Court  is  whether  the  measure  is
    necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to  the  legitimate
    aim pursued.  I have given weight to the position of the  secretary  of
    State as expressed  through  the  Immigraiton  Rules  Shahzad  (Art  8:
    legitimate aim) [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)  and  take  note  that  R(MM
    (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 confirmed  the  validity  of  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules in spousal cases.

23. I come to an assessment of proportionality and here I must have  regard
    to Section 117B. In considering the public interest question, which  is
    whether the interference  with  the  right  to  respect  for  someone's
    private of family  life  is  justified,  I  must  have  regard  to  the
    following:

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
             the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that  is
             established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.

24. It is clear that Mrs Rixon speaks English as she is a USA national  and
    her first language is English.  This in turn will allow her to  develop
    her piano tuition lessons  in  order  that  she  is  not  a  burden  on
    taxpayers.  She has shown that she has  integrated  into  society.    I
    have found above that she is not financially dependent on the state and
    is not and has never been a financial burden on the state. She does not
    appear to have had significant health issues or NHS intervention.  When
    she lawfully entered the UK, under immigration control  and  regulation
    she (through her sponsor)  was  assessed  as  being  able  to  maintain
    herself financially at the time and in the future.

25. Mr Rixon has demonstrated that  he  has  provided  adequately  for  the
    maintenance and accommodation of Mrs Rixon throughout her stay  in  the
    UK and has shown that in the four years that she has been here that she
    has been financially independent of the state. EB (Kosovo) [2008]  UKHL
    41 detailed the principles enunciated  in  Huang  which  included  that
    member states of the Convention have a duty not only  to  refrain  from
    unjustified interference in protected Article 8 rights but  a  positive
    duty to show respect for it.  It was recognised that human  beings  are
    social animals and that they depend heavily  socially  emotionally  and
    financially on their family.  EB Kosovo espoused 'that it  will  rarely
    be proportionate to uphold an order for removal of a spouse if there is
    a close and genuine bond with the other spouse and that  spouse  cannot
    reasonably be expected to follow the removed spouse to the  country  of
    removal'  but  that  what  was  needed  was  a  'careful  and  informed
    evaluation of the facts of the particular  case'.   I  have  undertaken
    such an evaluation in this case and consider that should the  appellant
    be returned to  the  USA  there  would  be  serious  prejudice  to  the
    fundamental Article 8 rights of the both the appellant and her  husband
    Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39.  In particular bearing in  mind  the
    loss of the protection of the health treatment  to  which  the  sponsor
    would be entitled to by virtue of his citizenship  of  this  country  I
    find that it would not be reasonable to expect the sponsor to relocate.
     I also take into account that the sponsor has lived all  his  life  in
    the United Kingdom, that the appellant does not fall foul of any of the
    suitability criteria in the Immigration Rules.

26. As stated in Huang 'In  an  article  8  case  where  this  question  is
    reached, the ultimate question for the appellate immigration  authority
    is whether the refusal of leave to enter or  remain,  in  circumstances
    where the life of the  family  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  be
    enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account of all  considerations  weighing
    in favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of  the  applicant
    in a  manner  sufficiently  serious  to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
    fundamental right protected  by  article  8.  If  the  answer  to  this
    question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must
    so  decide.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  appellate   immigration
    authority, directing itself along the lines indicated in this  opinion,
    need ask in addition whether the case meets a test of exceptionality.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because of the extent of the evidence produced and  the  complexity  of  the
case.
