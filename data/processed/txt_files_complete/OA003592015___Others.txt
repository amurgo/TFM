                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, ISLAMABAD
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. The appellants are nationals of Pakistan.  They appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal against decisions of the respondent on 9  December  2014,
    paying the fee appropriate to  an  appeal  without  a  hearing.   Judge
    Anthony dismissed the appeals.  The appellants now have  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal granted on the ground that  Judge  Anthony  had
    mistaken the decision against which the first appellant  appealed,  and
    had accordingly  taken  into  account  material  not  relevant  to  the
    decision under appeal.

 2. On 16 October 2015 I wrote to the parties' representatives as follows:-

         "I have reviewed the file in this case in the light of the grant of
         permission to appeal.  I propose to determine that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal erred in law and remit the  appeals  for  a  new  decision
         (without a hearing) by a different First-tier Tribunal Judge.   Any
         proposals to the contrary will be considered if received within  14
         days of the date of this letter."

 3. Neither party  has  raised  any  objection  to  the  course  of  action
    proposed.  The appellants have  courteously  sought  that  there  be  a
    hearing when the matter returns  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Their
    sponsor indicates that he will pay any supplementary fee necessary.  He
    will need to get in touch with the First-tier  Tribunal  and  make  the
    necessary arrangements  under  art  3(4)  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011.

 4. So far as concerns the  present  appeal,  my  decision  is  that  Judge
    Anthony erred in law.  I set his decision aside and remit  the  appeals
    to the First-tier Tribunal for determination by a different judge.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
