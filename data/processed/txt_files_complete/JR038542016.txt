                                                                  Respondent



                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr P  Lewis,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Kidd
Rapinet LLP, on behalf  of  the  Applicant  and  Mr  W  Irwin,  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 11 April 2017.


Decision: the application for judicial review is refused




   1. These judicial review proceedings, issued on 8  April  2016,  seek  to
      challenge the respondent's decisions, dated 8 January 2016, to  refuse
      the principal applicant indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 migrant
      and  on  23  February  2016  to  refuse   his   application   for   an
      administrative review of the earlier decision.



Procedural history

   2. The applicants  are  nationals  of  India.  The  principal  applicant,
      hereinafter referred to as the applicant, was born on  16  April  1982
      and the second applicant is his wife, Beant Kaur Dhillon  born  on  26
      June 1980.

   3. The applicant entered the United Kingdom with  entry  clearance  as  a
      student, granted from 21 February 2007 and valid until 1 January 2010.



   4. On 27 September 2008, the applicant successfully applied for leave  to
      remain as a Tier 1 (Highly Skilled) migrant and was granted  leave  to
      remain in that capacity until 5 November 2010. On 26 August 2010,  the
      applicant sought further leave to remain under the Tier 1 route.  That
      application was refused with no right of appeal.

   5. On 29 October 2010, the applicant successfully applied  for  leave  to
      remain under Tier 1 and was granted leave to remain  until  7  January
      2013. The basis of  this  application  was  that  the  applicant,  who
      described himself as a software engineer, was  working  full-time  for
      Flavors of India as  a  business  manager  and,  also  provided  event
      management services in a self-employed  capacity.  He  explained  that
      during the 12-month period from 1 October 2009 until 30 September 2010
      his gross earnings from employment were �14,598.16 and his net profits
      from self-employment were �26,515,00. He thus qualified for 25  points
      for previous earnings of over �40,000.

   6. On 11 December 2012, the applicant successfully  applied  for  further
      leave to remain under Tier 1 and was granted leave to remain  until  7
      January 2016. The basis of this application was that the applicant was
      working full-time for Flavors of India as a  General  Manager  and  he
      also provided catering  and  event  management  services  in  a  self-
      employed capacity. He explained that during the 12-month period from 1
      November 2011 until 31 October 2012 his gross earnings from employment
      were  �32,864.48  and  his  net  profit   from   self-employment   was
      �10,434.26. He qualified for 25  points  for  previous  earnings  over
      �40,000.

   7. On 16 December 2015, the applicant applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
      remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) migrant, in person,
      at Sheffield Premium Service Centre and was interviewed the same  day.
      The Home Office handed the applicant a letter also dated  16  December
      2015 which requested the following original documents  to  enable  the
      respondent to make a prompt decision on his case. The documents sought
      were SA302's for the 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 tax
      years as well as  P60's  from  any  paid  employment  or  a  full  tax
      breakdown for the required periods from HMRC.

   8. The applicant replied to the letter of 16 December 2015, on 6  January
      2016. He provided SA302's for all but the 2009/2010 financial year. He
      explained that there was no SA302 for 2009/2010  because  he  was  not
      registered with HMRC as self-employed until after that financial  year
      ended.  The applicant added  that  he  had  requested  his  employment
      history from HMRC from 2009 until 17 December 2015 and it had come  to
      his  attention  that  his  earnings  from  employment  for  the  years
      2011/2012 and 2012/2013 were incorrect. The applicant attributed  this
      error to the failure  of  his  employer's  bookkeeper  to  record  the
      applicant's employed earnings on the tax returns for the said years.

   9. In his letter of 6 January 2016, the applicant said that he approached
      his previous employer who had confirmed the miscommunication  and  had
      rectified the position by making the appropriate PAYE tax and National
      Insurance contributions to HMRC. The applicant enclosed two supporting
      letters.

  10. The first letter was signed by Jasmeet  Singh  from  JS  Gulati  &  Co
      Chartered  Accountants  &  Advisors,  the   applicant's   accountants,
      confirming that amended tax returns had been  filed  with  HMRC  on  6
      January 2016 for the years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

  11. The second letter was headed The  Zane  Partnership  and  contained  a
      signature to the same effect but no name of a signatory. It is  useful
      to  note  at  this  juncture  that  The  Zane  Partnership  were   the
      applicant's accountants in relation to his 2010 application. The  Zane
      Partnership letter  confirmed  that  the  applicant  was  employed  at
      Flavors of India and earned �24,785 for "Tax year  2012"  and  �24,846
      for "Tax year 2013." The Zane Partnership letter further  stated  that
      it was aware "that due to some miscommunication our client, Flavors of
      India had submitted part-payroll information with us and as  a  result
      an incorrect end of year PAYE return was filed with  HMRC  initially."
      The letter  also  confirmed  that  on  the  applicant's  request,  the
      position had been  rectified;  correct  returns  were  now  filed  and
      additional tax and National Insurance  contributions  had  been  paid.
      There were no enclosures with that letter.

  12.  The applicant raised a further issue with his finances in his  letter
      of 6 January 2016. Essentially  he  explained  that  his  net  taxable
      income from self-employment  for  the  2010/2011  financial  year  was
      reduced to �1,280 owing to  "various  expenses,  which  were  incurred
      after" the 2010 Tier 1 application was made.

  13. The Secretary of State refused the settlement application on 8 January
      2016 under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules. As this  is  one
      of the general grounds for  refusal,  the  requirements  of  paragraph
      245CD(b) of the Rules were also not met.

  14. Specifically, the  applicant  was  said  to  have  been  deceitful  or
      dishonest in his dealings with HM  Revenue  &  Customs  (HMRC)  and/or
      United Kingdom Visas and Immigration  (UKVI)  because  on  29  October
      2010, in support of  his  previous  Tier  1(General)  application,  he
      declared the sum of �41,113.16 in earnings from two sources of  income
      during the period 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010.  The  applicant
      had been awarded 25 points for earnings on that basis.

  15. The respondent stated that HMRC  records  showed  that  the  applicant
      declared income of only �10,014.00 for the  2009/2010  financial  year
      and �16,280.00 for the 2010/2011 financial year.

  16. The respondent also referred to the Tier 1 (General) application  made
      on  11  December  2012,  where  the  applicant  declared  the  sum  of
      �43,298.00 in earnings from two sources of income during the period  1
      November 2011 to 31 October 2012. The applicant had  accordingly  been
      awarded 25 points for earnings.

  17. The HMRC records showed that the applicant declared �23,516.00 for the
      2011/2012 financial year and  �9999.96  for  the  2012/2013  financial
      year.

  18. In refusing the application, the Secretary of  State  referred  to  an
      interview  conducted  with  the  applicant  on  16  December  2016  at
      Sheffield Premium Service Centre. It was also said that the  applicant
      was  given  an  opportunity  to  provide  further  documentation   and
      information to explain the discrepancies after the interview.

  19. The respondent acknowledged that, after the interview,  the  applicant
      had declared his claimed earnings to HMRC  but  considered  that  this
      retrospective declaration was not sufficient to satisfy the  Secretary
      of State that he had not been previously deceitful or dishonest in his
      dealings with HMRC and/or UKVI. The respondent reviewed the transcript
      of his interview, the documents provided  at  the  interview  and  the
      explanation provided for the discrepancies in  earnings  but  did  not
      accept that a professional registered accountant from what appeared to
      be a reputable chartered accountancy firm would make a mistake on  the
      applicant's tax return given that he had provided  all  his  invoices,
      bank statements and evidence of expenses. It was considered  that  the
      amount the applicant declared to HMRC was the amount  he  demonstrated
      as income on the documents he provided to the accountant.

  20. In addition, the respondent considered  the  applicant's  claim  in  a
      letter dated 6 January 2016 that "various expenses" incurred after the
      2010 Tier 1 application was submitted on 29 October 2010, reduced  his
      net taxable income to �1,280 (the gross amount being  �33,830.00)  and
      concluded that she was not satisfied that  the  earnings  declared  to
      UKVI were correct.

  21. The respondent reached the conclusion that  there  had  been  a  clear
      benefit to the  applicant  by  either  failing  to  declare  his  full
      earnings  to  HMRC  to  reduce  his  tax  liability  or   by   falsely
      representing his earnings to UKVI to enable him  to  meet  the  points
      required to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

  22.  The respondent considered  that  it  would  be  undesirable  for  the
      applicant to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  because  he  had  been
      deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HMRC/UKVI for the  reasons
      given and his application was refused under paragraph  322(5)  of  the
      Rules, with reference to paragraph 245CD(b).

  23. The applicant sought  administrative  review  of  the  above-mentioned
      decision on 23 January 2016. In that application, he  emphasised  that
      his self-employed earnings for the 2010 application covered the period
      from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010, whereas the  financial  year
      extended from April 2010 until April 2011. Thus, he had been  required
      to produce interim accounts, which his accountants  "would  have  been
      required to confirm" accurately reflected the  financial  position  of
      his business at the time they were prepared.  It  was  said  that  the
      business incurred significant expenses in the  six  months  after  the
      interim accounts were prepared. He offered to provide details of these
      expenses if requested.

  24. The administrative review application reiterated what was said in  the
      letter of 6 January 2016 and criticised the respondent for  having  no
      regard to the unequivocal acceptance by Chartered accountants  of  the
      error made by the applicant's former employer. It was  said  that  the
      employer was the only potential beneficiary of the failure to disclose
      the earnings.

  25. The result of the administrative review was that the earlier  decision
      was maintained. The respondent commented that it was  the  applicant's
      responsibility, as opposed to that of his employer or accountants,  to
      ensure that earnings declared to HMRC corroborated with those  claimed
      in his applications. It was not considered credible that his  employer
      would not declare his  employed  earnings  to  HMRC.  The  applicant's
      previous earnings were not considered to be genuine and therefore  the
      original caseworker was not obliged  to  exercise  discretion  in  his
      favour.

  26. A pre-action protocol letter dated 10 March 2016 succinctly challenged
      the respondent's conclusion that the applicant acted  in  a  deceitful
      manner and argued that her decisions were unlawful.

  27.  The  Secretary  of  State's  response  to  the  pre-action   protocol
      correspondence essentially maintained the earlier decisions.

  28. The grounds of this application did not clearly  identify  any  public
      law failings but it can be said that it was argued that  the  decision
      of 8 January 2016  was  unlawful  because  the  respondent  failed  to
      consider material matters; failed to discharge the burden of proof and
      was not entitled to conclude that the applicant's failure  to  declare
      his earnings to the HMRC amounted to conduct rendering it  undesirable
      for the applicant to remain in the United Kingdom.

  29. As for the administrative review decision of  23  February  2016,  the
      grounds  argued  that  the  caseworker  failed  to   acknowledge   the
      explanation provided by the applicant; that there was no justification
      for the respondent's assertion that  it  was  not  credible  that  the
      employer would not declare the appellant's earnings correctly and that
      there had been no reference made to  a  letter  from  that  employer's
      bookkeeper. The consequences of  the  respondent's  decision  for  the
      applicant and his family were described as catastrophic.

  30. The respondent's acknowledgement  of  service  together  with  summary
      grounds of defence was received on 23 May 2016 and indicated that  the
      entire claim was contested.  It  was  contended  that  the  respondent
      correctly applied the law based  on  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
      applicant; that there was no arguable error of law  and  the  decision
      could not be considered unlawful on Wednesbury unreasonable grounds.

  31. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Lindsley  on  20  June
      2016 for the following reasons;

"It is arguable that the respondent has not made a  lawful  decision  as  to
whether the applicant was deliberately deceptive and therefore  fell  to  be
refused (indefinite) leave to remain pursuant to  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
Immigration Rules as it is arguable that proper consideration has  not  been
given to the acceptance by the Zane Partnership Chartered  Accountants  that
the applicant's employer (Flavors of India) had misreported his earnings  to
the Inland Revenue so that they appeared lesser than  they  truly  were  and
that this (now corrected) underpayment cannot arguably therefore  rationally
be evidence of the applicant's dishonesty."

  32. The respondent's detailed grounds of defence filed on 31 August  2016,
      can be summarised as follows. The respondent continued to rely on both
      impugned decisions, which were lawful and  permissible.  It  was  said
      that the respondent gave  proper  consideration  to  the  accountants'
      letter along with all the evidence provided by the applicant.  It  was
      noted that the applicant admitted that the figures  declared  to  UKVI
      and HMRC did not match. Furthermore, the explanation  put  forward  by
      the applicant was considered inadequate for a plethora of reasons  set
      out in the detailed grounds. The  respondent's  position  was  that  a
      dishonest and or cavalier approach  to  the  accuracy  of  information
      provided to HMRC or the respondent and a failure to ensure all tax was
      paid was  conduct  or  evidence  of  character  showing  that  it  was
      undesirable to grant indefinite leave to remain to the applicant.

  33. Skeleton arguments were filed on behalf  of  the  applicants  and  the
      respondent prior to the previous listing of this matter on 17 February
      2017, the contents are not reproduced  here  as  they  were  developed
      during oral submissions.


Submissions

  34. By way of preliminary matters, Mr Irwin indicated  that  he  would  be
      relying on R (Giri) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 784. In  addition,  neither
      counsel had seen the record of the applicant's  interview  which  took
      place at Sheffield Premium Service Centre on 16 December 2015  but  it
      appeared that nothing turned on this matter.

  35. During his submissions, Mr Lewis emphasised that permission  had  been
      granted because the Secretary of State erred in failing to have regard
      to the applicant's explanation for the  inconsistency  and  failed  to
      apply rigorous scrutiny to his evidence, with devastating consequences
      for the applicant.

  36. For the first time, Mr Lewis argued that the  figures  stated  in  the
      decision letter in relation to the application made on 29 October 2010
      were incorrect and that there were no discrepancies.

  37. In answer to the respondent's statement in the detailed  grounds  that
      the applicant misrepresented his earnings to HMRC, he took me  to  the
      2009/2010 P60 [B42 of the consolidated bundle] and asked  me  to  note
      that the applicant's total income  from  employment  was  �10,000.  Mr
      Lewis then referred to the P60 for 2010/2011 [B43], which gave a total
      amount of �15,000. With the net profit for the applicant's business at
      �1,280 shown at B50. He submitted that these documents showed that the
      applicant's total income was �16,280 as he had declared to HMRC.

  38. Moving onto the applicant's claim that his  net  taxable  income  from
      self-employment as declared in the first application was reduced  from
      �33,380 to �1,280 owing to "various expenses," Mr Lewis submitted that
      it was relevant that this was the  applicant's  first  application  to
      extend his leave under Tier 1 and interim accounts had to be prepared.
      He conceded that the interim accounts were not included in the bundle.
       Nonetheless, he referred me to a page from the  applicant's  covering
      letter in relation to his previous application  for  leave  to  remain
      (submitted on 28  October  2010)  [B59],  which  referred  to  audited
      figures showing  a  net  profit  from  self-employment  of  �26,515.00
      between 1 October 2009 and 30 September 2010. Mr Lewis explained  that
      the profit and loss account [B50] showed the full year accounts from 1
      June 2010 to 31 March 2011 and that  payments  to  subcontractors  had
      subsequently reduced the profits declared to UKVI. The  applicant  had
      explained, owing to these  significant  expenses  his  overall  profit
      reduced significantly. While the Secretary of State said that this was
      dishonesty, the employment and self-employment figures were consistent
      with his declared earnings. Furthermore, it was a nascent business and
      unexpected expenses were entirely reasonable. There was  therefore  no
      basis to properly assert that he was dishonest.

  39. Mr Lewis then addressed the allegation of deception  relating  to  the
      application of 11  December  2012.  He  referred  to  the  applicant's
      declaration of net profits of �10,434.26 in  his  covering  letter  to
      that application [B67]. He submitted, for the  first  time,  that  the
      applicant declared more earnings to HMRC than UKVI rather  than  less,
      in that he declared total profits  of  �11,850.  This,  he  contended,
      undermined  the  respondent's  argument   that   the   applicant   was
      exaggerating to UKVI and under reporting to HMRC.

  40. Notwithstanding his previous submissions, Mr Lewis accepted that there
      were discrepancies between the  amounts  declared  for  employment  in
      relation to both the 2010 and 2012 applications but submitted that the
      applicant provided a reasonable, plausible, explanation. While it  was
      said that  the  applicant  should  have  realised  that  there  was  a
      difference between the P60's and wage slips  and  his  declaration  to
      UKVI, those documents reflected the earnings paid  into  his  account.
      Furthermore, no issue had been taken with the documents provided  with
      the application. It was unreasonable for the respondent to state  that
      the  applicant  should  have  realised   the   inconsistencies.   Upon
      discovering  the  matter,  he  raised  it  with  his  employer,  whose
      bookkeeper confirmed there was a discrepancy.

  41. Mr Lewis maintained that there was a total failure by the Secretary of
      State to engage with a  clear  and  plausible  explanation  which  was
      corroborated by a professional. The applicant took  steps  to  rectify
      the situation and again, Mr Lewis submitted, there was a total failure
      by the respondent to have any regard to this. It was  not  implausible
      that a bookkeeper employed by the applicant's employer, as opposed  to
      the applicant's own accountant, would make such an error

  42. I asked Mr Lewis about the absence of any evidence  of  the  applicant
      approving the self-assessments prepared by his own accountant prior to
      them being sent to HMRC. He stated that he had taken  instructions  on
      this and the applicant said that the  employer's  bookkeeper  had  the
      relevant information for access to the  tax  returns  online  and  had
      access to details of the applicant's employed earnings. Thus, the only
      figure the applicant supplied  were  his  self-employed  earnings  and
      those figures were  correctly  reported.  He  submitted  that  it  was
      entirely reasonable for the applicant to defer to the  bookkeeper.  He
      suggested that it was speculative to say that  the  applicant  had  an
      incentive to under report his earnings to HMRC given that  he  was  of
      good character, had built up a business and enjoyed significant  self-
      employed earnings.

  43. Mr Lewis concluded by contending that much of the earnings declared by
      the applicant were entirely consistent, except for  the  reduction  in
      self-employed earnings for one period owing to unanticipated  payments
      to subcontractors. He contended there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
      sustain a dishonesty allegation. In relation to the suggestion in  the
      detailed grounds that the applicant had been cavalier in  the  way  he
      presented his figures, he argued that this was not the case  and  that
      proper accounting procedures had been followed.  In  any  event,  this
      was not the Secretary of State's case previously and if it was now her
      case, there had been a failure to have regard to factors which went in
      the applicant's favour.

  44. Mr Irwin submitted that it was not only open to the Secretary of State
      to conclude that paragraph 322(5) of the Rules was applicable, but  it
      was inevitable. He contended that Mr Lewis  was  mistaken  in  arguing
      that there were  fewer  discrepancies  and  that  the  applicant  over
      reported his income to HMRC. This was because, as he put it, Mr  Lewis
      was comparing "apples and pears" owing to the differing dates  of  the
      financial year and the 12-month periods relied upon by  the  applicant
      in support of his Tier 1 applications.

  45. Mr Irwin argued that the applicant had conflicting  aims  in  that  he
      wanted to show UKVI that he had an income of over �40,000 per year but
      also wanted to limit the extent of his income to HMRC.  The  applicant
      made the  2010  application  relying  mainly  on  his  income  in  the
      preceding calendar year, which spanned two financial years.  This  was
      reflected in the documents submitted for the application.

  46. Mr Irwin referred me to the two P60's showing a total of  �25,000  for
      employment as well as the self-assessment tax  calculation  for  2010-
      2011 of �1,280, giving a total income of just over �26,000 declared to
      HMRC for two financial years, as opposed to the �41,113.16 declared to
      the respondent for a 12-month period shortly before  the  application.
      He submitted that a discrepancy of  that  amount  required  a  lot  of
      explanation.

  47. Addressing the explanation given involved  taking  me  to  the  letter
      accompanying the 2010 application, where Mr Irwin  asked  me  to  note
      that the applicant's self-employment began in June 2010, just 4 months
      before the application was made. During those 4 months, the  applicant
      claimed to have a turnover of  �29,090,  sales  costs  of  �1,345  and
      expenses of just �1,230, leaving him with net profit  of  �26,515.  By
      contrast, the accounts prepared for  tax  purposes  gave  a  different
      picture. The profit and loss account at B50 showed  that  the  profits
      were considerably reduced by expenses. The applicant  was  asking  the
      Tribunal to believe that in the first 4 months of  his  business,  his
      expenses were only �1,230 against revenues of around �29,000, but that
      in the following 6 months until the end of March 2011, the revenue was
      just �7,000 with expenses of around �30,000. Mr Irwin  described  this
      as inherently implausible and argued that it was open to the Secretary
      of State to doubt that the applicant had painted an  accurate  picture
      to either UKVI or HMRC.

  48. Mr Irwin asked me to take into consideration that it was asserted that
      all  the  various  expenses  arose  after  the  2010  application  was
      submitted, yet no invoices nor any other evidence was produced  either
      in response to the decision letter,  as  part  of  the  Administrative
      Review application or even in these proceedings.

  49. Mr Irwin then addressed the 2012 application. He asked me to note that
      HMRC records  showed  that  all  declared  income  from  both  sources
      amounted to �23,516 for the 2011/2012 financial  year.  The  following
      financial year, �9,999 was declared. This was against the  applicant's
      assertion that in just 12 months,  between  1  November  2011  and  31
      October 2012, he earned over �40,000.

  50. Responding to Mr Lewis's submission that the applicant had,  in  fact,
      over represented his income to HMRC, Mr Irwin took me to the  covering
      letter for 2012 application [B68] where  the  applicant  stated  total
      earnings of �43,298.74  and  provided  gross  salary  and  net  profit
      figures.  The problem with this argument was that the  self-assessment
      tax calculations for 2011/2012 showed profit from  self-employment  of
      �11,850 but Mr Lewis was comparing that figure to the  net  profit  of
      �10,434,26 declared to UKVI. These figures were not comparable because
      the 2011/2012 financial year covered months not  covered  in  the  12-
      month period relied upon by the applicant which began  on  1  November
      2011.

  51. Mr Irwin argued that the real problem for the applicant  was  that  in
      his 2012-2013   tax calculation, he had declared no income from  self-
      employment, only employed income. Yet in the short tax return for  the
      same financial year (prepared on 19 November 2015 by JS Gulati &  Co),
      the applicant stated that his business turnover was  �4,650  until  it
      ceased trading on 31 January 2013 and he claimed no business expenses.
      Mr Irwin submitted that both the figures in the original  and  amended
      tax returns for 2012/2013 were inconsistent with one another  as  well
      as with the figures provided to UKVI for that period. Mr Irwin took me
      to the 2012 application, where the  applicant  had  listed  each  paid
      invoice, paying attention to entries dating between 8 April  2012  and
      28 October 2012, showing turnover in excess of �20,000.

  52. It was common ground that  there  had  been  an  under-declaration  of
      employed income and that there were  also  discrepancies  between  the
      P60's and sums declared  to  UKVI.  In  response  to  the  applicant's
      explanation that a bookkeeper was to blame, Mr  Irwin  submitted  that
      this was not a credible explanation,  in  the  context  of  the  other
      discrepancies. The applicant had provided no evidence as to how  self-
      assessment tax returns were submitted which were inconsistent with the
      P60's submitted to UKVI. All efforts to reconcile  the  position  came
      about only after the Secretary  of  State  started  raising  questions
      regarding the application for indefinite leave to remain.

  53.  Mr  Irwin  addressed  the  applicant's  claim  that  an   independent
      professional organisation had confirmed that  the  discrepancy  as  to
      employed earnings was down to Flavors of India.  He asked me  to  note
      that  The  Zane  Partnership  prepared  the  applicant's  accounts  in
      relation to his self-assessment and thus it appeared that, as at 2011,
      there had been a direct relationship between  the  applicant  and  the
      Partnership because they were his accountants too.  Mr  Irwin  decided
      not to press this particular point, in view of the other discrepancies
      identified by the respondent.

  54. Mr Lewis sought and received additional time  to  discuss  Mr  Irwin's
      submissions with  his  instructing  solicitors.  He  argued  that  the
      respondent had been wrong to approach the application with  suspicion.
      While appearing somewhat perplexed following Mr  Irwin's  submissions,
      Mr Lewis asked me to take into consideration that the figures provided
      by the applicant in support of the 2012 application to UKVI  showed  a
      turnover of �55,755.26 and expenses of �45,321. He also  asked  me  to
      note that expenses of over �5,000 were declared  in  the  amended  tax
      return which offset the declared turnover of �4,560 and thus there was
      no income for self-employment for the 2012/2013 financial year.

  55. Mr Lewis argued that  the  applicant  declared  a  total  turnover  of
      �59,210 to HMRC, which far exceeded what he  said  to  UKVI  in  2012.
      Thus, referring to his earlier submissions, there were two significant
      figures over reported to HMRC and not under reported.

  56. Otherwise, Mr Lewis emphasised  that  the  applicant  had  experienced
      interim costs at an early stage  of  his  business  which  he  clearly
      identified as additional expenses from the construction  industry.  As
      to the figures regarding salary, his explanation was  consistent  with
      that given by the accountants. The  fact  that  the  applicant  shared
      accountants with the employer did not impugn the firm. He concluded by
      stating that the Secretary of  State  was  not  justified  in  finding
      dishonesty.

  57. Mr Irwin wished to make a further point owing to the content of Mr
      Lewis's submission that the applicant over reported his turnover to
      HMRC. He asked me to be aware that the critical thing was that Mr
      Lewis was referring to 24 months of turnover shown in the amended tax
      returns, while what was asserted in the application to UKVI was that
      in just 12 months, the applicant turned over around �57,000.

  58. Mr Lewis wished to add nothing in response.

Discussion

  59. The issue to be decided is not whether the applicant either made false
      representations or whether it is undesirable for him to remain in  the
      United Kingdom in the light of his conduct but whether the  respondent
      was entitled to reach those conclusions.

  60. The following passage [19H] from R(Giri) v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  784
      provides relevant guidance;

"The key point is that the statute confers the power  on  the  Secretary  of
State, or the immigration  officers  acting  on  her  behalf,  to  make  the
decision whether to  grant  or  refuse  leave  to  remain.  It  is  for  the
Secretary of State or her officials, in the exercise of that  power  and  in
reaching their decision, to determine which provisions of  the  Rules  apply
and whether relevant conditions are satisfied....; it is not a situation  in
which their powers depend on some precedent  fact  the  existence  of  which
falls for determination by the court itself."

  61. The applicant's settlement application was considered under  paragraph
      245CD of HC 395, the relevant part of which is set out here:-


           245CD. Requirements for indefinite leave to remain

           To qualify for indefinite leave to remain, a Tier 1 (General)
           Migrant must meet the requirements listed below. If the
           applicant meets these requirements, indefinite leave to remain
           will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these
           requirements, the application will be refused.
           (b) The applicant must not fall for refusal under the general
           grounds for refusal (except that paragraph 322(1C) shall not
           apply if the applicant meets the conditions in (f)(i)-(iii)
           below), and must not be an illegal entrant.
  62. The discretionary, general ground of refusal: in this  case  were  set
      out in paragraph 322:-

           (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to
           remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct
           (including convictions which do not fall within paragraph
           322(1C), character or associations or the fact that he
           represents a threat to national security;
  63. In his October 2010 application for leave to  remain,  made  when  the
      applicant claimed to have  set  up  his  business  in  June  2010,  he
      declared  turnover  of  just  over  �29,000,  and  a  net  profit   of
      �26,515.00. That  figure,  added  to  the  claimed  employed  earnings
      enabled him to be awarded 25 points. It was only on  6  January  2016,
      that the applicant brought to the respondent's attention that his  net
      profit for that period was just �1,280. His explanation being that  he
      had provided accurate interim figures at the time of  his  application
      but there had been unexpected  expenses  after  that  application  was
      made.

  64. The respondent considered and  rejected  the  applicant's  explanation
      regarding the vastly different figures and was fully  entitled  to  do
      so. The applicant's claim that he  had  less  than  �3,000  costs  and
      expenses in the  first  4  months  but  expenses  of  �30,000  in  the
      following 6 months (with net profit of just �7,000) is implausible  by
      itself.  Furthermore,  that  claim  is  entirely  unsupported  by  any
      detailed account  of  these  expenses,  let  alone  evidence  such  as
      invoices.  The Secretary of  State  was  therefore  justified  in  not
      accepting these belated, vague and unsupported claims.

  65. The applicant accepts that there were  discrepancies  in  the  claimed
      income declared to UKVI and HMRC for the financial years 2011/2012 and
      2012/2013  and  states  that  his  employer's  bookkeeper  failed   to
      correctly record his employed earnings in  the  relevant  tax  returns
      because the incorrect figures  had  been  provided  by  the  employer.
      Permission was granted because it was  considered  arguable  that  the
      respondent did not give proper consideration to the evidence contained
      in  The  Zane  Partnership  letter  that  the   applicant's   employer
      misreported his earnings

  66.  The respondent was also entitled to reject this explanation  for  the
      following reasons.

  67. Firstly, the explanation was put forward some years after  the  events
      in question and only after the applicant was interviewed and  required
      to provide further evidence prior to his settlement application  being
      considered.

  68. Secondly, it is reasonable to expect that the applicant would  spot  a
      significant discrepancy between what his stated income was said to  be
      in the tax return and what was said to UKVI, when  compared  with  his
      P60's, especially when the level of his income was of vital importance
      to his status in the United Kingdom.

  69. Thirdly, it is not plausible that  a  reputable  firm  of  accountants
      would fail to submit the correct information on not just one  but  two
      occasions or that the applicant would fail to spot the  error  on  two
      occasions.

  70. Fourthly, there was no evidence from Flavors of India  in  support  of
      the  allegation  that  they  had  fed  incorrect  information  to  the
      accountants/bookkeeper.

  71. Fifthly, the letter from The  Zane  Partnership  was  unimpressive  in
      content, in that it contained no name of a signatory, no telephone  or
      email contact details and  provided  a  vague  explanation  referring,
      implausibly to "some miscommunication."  That letter made no reference
      to the nature  of  any  evidence  regarding  the  applicant's  claimed
      employed income which had been sent to the Partnership.

  72. Sixthly, the applicant is ultimately responsible for  the  content  of
      his self-assessment tax returns and yet there was no  evidence  as  to
      how it was that these returns were approved prior to  being  submitted
      to HMRC, replete with mistakes as they were.

  73. Lastly and perhaps less  importantly,  the  applicant  used  the  same
      accountant as Flavors of India at the time of the 2010 application and
      thus the respondent cannot be criticised for treating the  claim  that
      the accountants or bookkeeper had been misled as  to  the  applicant's
      genuine income, with circumspection.

  74. The additional evidence provided by the applicant  in  an  attempt  to
      explain the earlier discrepancies  introduces  further  discrepancies.
      While claiming turnover of over �20,000 from self-employment  for  the
      2012/2013 financial year to UKVI, the original tax calculation sent to
      HMRC for that year shows no turnover or  income  from  self-employment
      and the amended tax return submitted in November 2015, shows  turnover
      of just �4650. In these  circumstances  the  Secretary  of  State  was
      entitled to conclude that the applicant was either being untruthful to
      UKVI or HMRC.

  75. In conclusion,  the  Secretary  of  State  was  further  justified  in
      reaching the conclusion that  the  applicant's  conduct  in  providing
      false information to either UKVI or HMRC, or indeed both,  meant  that
      it was undesirable for him to be permitted to  remain  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

  76. This application is dismissed.

I make  an  order,  therefore,  that  the  judicial  review  application  be
      dismissed.

A decision to the effect notified above will be formally made at  a  hearing
on a date to be fixed ("the adjourned hearing"),  and  the  judicial  review
application will thereupon be dismissed.   The  adjourned  hearing  will  be
"the hearing at which  the  decision  is  made"  for  the  purposes  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  ("the  Rules")  (see  the
Notification below).



In the meantime, the parties are to liaise and attempt  to  agree  an  order
consequential on such decision and dismissal. If they are unable  to  do  so
within 7 days after the date of receiving this Notice  they  must  within  7
days thereafter notify the Tribunal in writing of that fact,  and  file  and
serve in writing any applications and representations they may  have  as  to
costs and permission to appeal. Any such applications will be dealt with  at
