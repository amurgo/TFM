Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Z Nasim, Counsel instructed by Milestone Chambers

For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. The appellants seek, with permission, to appeal  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hosie who dismissed their appeals.  They  had
    appealed the Secretary of State's  refusal  of  the  first  appellant's
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and
    his wife and child's, (the second and third  appellants')  applications
    as the dependants.

 2. The applications were  made  on  8th  August  2014  and  the  decisions
    refusing their applications were made on 8th October  2014  further  to
    paragraph 245DD of the Immigration  Rules,  specifically  245DD(b)  and
    paragraph 319C(b) in  relation  to  the  first  appellant's  wife,  and
    paragraph 319H(b) in relation to the appellant's son.   The  appellants
    are citizens of India born on 16th September 1979, 27th July 1984 and [
    ] 2007 respectively.

 3. The first appellant's application was refused by  the  respondent  with
    reference to Appendix A under which the appellant was required to score
    75 points in relation to attributes and with specific reference to  the
    requirements under paragraph 41-SD and 46-SD of Appendix A.

 4. In summary  the  respondent's  rejection  of  his  application  was  as
    follows.  The appellant stated he had access to  �50,000  held  in  his
    name to invest in a business in the UK as specified under provision (d)
    in the first row of Table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  He
    had only supplied a business bank letter and business bank  statements.
     The evidence did not meet the  criteria  specified  under  Appendix  A
    because the bank letter and bank statements were in  the  name  of  his
    business and not in his own name.  This did not  confirm  that  he  had
    access to these funds.  Secondly, the  appellant  had  not  provided  a
    third  party  declaration  accompanied  by  a  letter  from   a   legal
    representative to confirm that he had access  to  those  funds.   As  a
    result he did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c)(i)  of
    Appendix A.  As his funds were held in a  business  bank  account  they
    were not classed as invested funds. Paragraph 45 of Appendix A  of  the
    Immigration Rules stated that where an applicant was relying  on  funds
    which had already been invested, the specified documents  listed  under
    paragraph 46-SD must be  submitted.   The  appellant  had  submitted  a
    business bank letter, a business bank  statement,  accountant's  letter
    and accounts, and an HMRC bill but the accounts he provided  failed  to
    demonstrate that he had invested �50,000 into a UK business.

 5. Secondly, as he was applying under provision (d)  of  Table  4  he  was
    required to demonstrate he met the following additional criteria:

         "(d) The applicant:

             (i)  is applying for leave to remain,

             (ii) has, or was lasted granted, leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study
                  Work) Migrant, and

              iii) since before 11th July 2014 and up to  the  date  of  his
                   application, has been continuously  engaged  in  business
                   activity which was not, or did not amount to  ,  activity
                   pursuant to a contract of service with a  business  other
                   than  his  own  and,  during  such   period,   has   been
                   continuously:

                          1) registered with HM Revenue &  Customs  as  self
                             employed, or

                          2) ...

             (iv) [since before 11 July 2014 and up  to  the  date  of  his
                  application,  has  continuously  been   working]   in   an
                  occupation  which  appears  on  the  list  of  occupations
                  skilled to National Qualifications Framework  level  4  or
                  above, as stated in the Codes of Practice in  Appendix  J,
                  and provides the specified evidence  in  paragraph  41-SD.
                  "Working" in this context means that the core service  his
                  business provides to its customers or clients involves the
                  business delivering a service in  an  occupation  at  this
                  level.  It excludes any work involved  in  administration,
                  marketing or website functions for the business, and

             (v)  has access to not less than �50,000."

 6. At this point in the refusal letter the Secretary of State also  stated
    "you have demonstrated that you satisfy (i), (ii), and (iii) above" and
    that the appellant had provided a job title listed in Appendix J but it
    was stated that the appellant had not complied  with  requirement  (iv)
    above with reference to paragraph 41-SD(e), because he had not provided
    the evidence specified in paragraphs 41-SD(e)(iii) and (iv).

 7. It was submitted that in relation to 41-SD(e)(iii) the evidence he  had
    submitted in relation to marketing material was not acceptable  because
    the business card  did  not  state  the  services  which  his  business
    provided, whilst evidence from Facebook was not acceptable  as  it  was
    social media and therefore not a local or national form of advertising.



 8. Secondly, the evidence was  not  acceptable  as  it  did  not  cover  a
    continuous period commencing before 11th July 2014  up  to  no  earlier
    than three months before  the  date  of  his  application  because  the
    leaflet, business card and Facebook printouts provided were  not  dated
    whilst the newspaper advert  was  not  dated  before  11th  July  2014.
    Although he had provided domain name  ownership  evidence  before  11th
    July 2014 the domain was registered to Md Nazir Ahmed.

 9. Furthermore the evidence he had submitted in relation  to  the  trading
    contract was not acceptable as it did not  cover  a  continuous  period
    commencing before 11th July 2014 up to no  earlier  than  three  months
    before the date of his application.   This  was  because  the  contract
    provided with Swift Mobile Valeting was  dated  5th  May  2014  but  no
    contract had been provided which was dated within three months  of  his
    application date which was 8th August 2014.

10. Additionally  the  contract  between  his  business  and  Swift  Mobile
    Valeting was not acceptable because it did not state  the  duration  of
    the contract.

11. He had not provided any evidence that he qualified for points under any
    of the other provisions in the first row of Table 4.




12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeal on the basis of  the
    evidence provided to satisfy Table A (d)(iv) with  reference  to  41-SD
    paragraph (e)(iii) and (iv).

13. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    Judge had not allowed the appeals on the basis  that  the  respondent's
    decision was not in accordance with the law as the Secretary  of  State
    had not applied paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules and  that  the
    Rules under paragraph 245 AA were discretionary. The judge  had  failed
    to take into account new evidence.   Secondly the judge  had  erred  in
    treating the date of application as the 'cut off' point for considering
    the evidence since the appellant had not provided 'new evidence'.   The
    appellant was rather 'explaining' the evidence already provided. In any
    event the judge had  not  taken  into  account  Section  85(4)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  It was also asserted that
    the judge had failed to consider Article 8.

14. Permission was granted on the basis that it was arguable that the judge
    may have erred in specifically refusing  to  take  into  account  some,
    unspecified, evidence, so concluding that the  appellant  failed  under
    the Immigration Rules. He did not give reasons for  rejecting  evidence
    that elsewhere in the  decision  the  judge  himself  refers  to  as  a
    continuum of evidence all of which was material.

15. At the hearing before me, Mr Nasim submitted that the judge  seemed  to
    accept that the appellant  met  the  Immigration  Rules  and  suggested
    particularly at paragraph 23 that the judge found  that  the  appellant
    was entitled to rely on the funds.  The position was that there was  no
    new evidence put into the frame.  Even if it were  the  case  that  the
    question of access to funds had been raised, the Statement  of  Changes
    in relation to HC 628  suggested  that  it  was  now  possible  for  an
    applicant to rely on funding available to the applicant's business  and
    indeed there was a letter from the accountant.   That  said,  Mr  Nasim
    made it clear that he relied on paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) which was whether
    the funding was available to the applicant.  He was not relying on  the
    bank account in relation to the  applicant's  business  which  was  not
    formally a company.  Even if that were not  the  case,  the  judge  was
    correct at paragraph 23 of the decision and should have considered  the
    evidential flexibility Rule at paragraph 245AA.  The respondent  should
    have given the appellant the opportunity to address the  omission.   At
    this point I referred the parties to paragraph 41-SD(c)(i).   Mr  Nasim
    submitted that documents E1 to E2 were evidence that merely omitted the
    applicant's name but this was evidence  that  could  easily  have  been
    obtained, and indeed was identifiable from the remaining  documentation
    within the file presented to the respondent with the application.

16. There was also reference within the decision, [paragraphs 24  and  25],
    that at Table 4(d)(iv), the appellant has to  show  that  he  has  been
    continuously working in an approved occupation.  Mr Nasim  pointed  out
    that this business plan was in fact produced to the respondent and  the
    judge was in error at paragraph 25 stating that that was not the  case.
    This was evidence that was before  the  respondent.   There  were  also
    promotional leaflets in the bundle.  It was the  appellant's  claim  at
    the hearing before me that the respondent had sent  back  the  business
    plan together with other documentation and indeed on  the  Home  Office
    file there was a letter from Farringdons Solicitors  dated  6th  August
    2014 referring to the documentation which included the business plan.

17. Mr Nasim also submitted that paragraphs 23 and 26 of  the  decision  by
    Judge Hoshi were inconsistent.  The contract provided to the respondent
    was dated 5th May but commenced on 16th May 2014.  I note that there is
    an incorrect date cited within the decision.

18. I asked Mr Nasim if the business cards were dated,  and  they  appeared
    not to be.  The appellant had, however, set up a  website  before  11th
    July 2014 as required by the Rules, and he had also adduced evidence in
    relation to Facebook before 11th July 2014 but this was rejected by the
    respondent.  That documentation did have a date of 25th  July  2014  on
    it.

19. Ms Sreeraman submitted that under Table 4 of Appendix A at  sub-Section
    (d) he needed to show that he had access to funds  and  this  would  be
    evidenced in line with the requirements at paragraph 41-SD(a)(i).   The
    documents must state the appellant's name and indeed at 41-SD(c)(6) the
    documents must state the appellant's name.  The judge had  stated  that
    the funding requirement was made out but even if the judge had made  an
    error in the finding at 23, she was not under an  obligation  to  allow
    this appeal and Ms Sreeraman referred to paragraph 245AA(c).  There was
    no name on the documents.

20. There were further omissions in relation to paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) and
    (iv).  The Facebook evidence was not acceptable and did not comply with
    mandatory requirements.  The domain name  was  not  registered  to  the
    appellant and the advertising material did not fall in  line  with  the
    Regulations and the contract did not cover the correct dates because it
    was dated 5th May and was not within the three months specified time of
    the application.  The judge was entitled to find that the appellant had
    not met the requirements.

21. Mr Nasim stated that the appellant maintained that he had submitted the
    invoices and the website images were sent in with the  application  and
    these had not been considered.

22. It would appear  to  me  that  the  judge  although  directing  himself
    correctly in relation to Ahmed & another (PBS  admissible  evidence)  v
    SSHD [2014] UKUT did not consider that some of  the  documentation  was
    before the respondent when in fact  it  was.   For  example  the  judge
    identified that the business plan was not before the Secretary of State
    when in fact it was [paragraph 25].  Ms Sreeraman accepted the business
    plan was before the Secretary of State.  That  error  of  fact  was  an
    error of law.

23. I do not accept that paragraph 245AA(b) applies such that there  is  an
    onus on the  Secretary  of  State  to  contact  the  applicant  or  his
    representative in writing and request the correct documents.  That is a
    matter for the Secretary of State and  within  the  discretion  of  the
    Secretary of State.  There is  no  doubt  however  that  the  unaudited
    accounts provided by the chartered certified  accountants  showed  that
    the first appellant was trading as Claringdons Accountant and  Business
    Consultancy and therefore this confirmation could  have  been  obtained
    from other elements of the documentation provided with the application.
     In that instance I  find  that  there  is  no  error  in  the  judge's
    conclusion at paragraph 23 in relation to access to funds.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge heard the appeal, directed himself with respect  to
    Ahmed and he found at paragraph 26 of his decision that

    'The first appellant has shown that he �50,000 was held in the  UK  and
    disposable at the date of the application in terms of paragraph (d) (v)
    of Table 4 Appendix A'.

    No challenge was made in relation  to  this  finding  in  the  Rule  24
    response submitted by the Secretary of State.  I therefore  accept  the
    Judge's finding in this respect.

24. Turning back to the requirements under  Table  4  section  (d)  it  was
    accepted by the respondent and as  recorded  at  paragraph  24  of  the
    determination, that the applicant:

      i) was applying for leave to remain,

     ii) has or was granted leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant, and



    iii) that since before 11th  July  2014  and  up  to  the  date  of  his
         application has been  continuously  engaged  in  business  activity
         which was not or did not amount to activity pursuant to a  contract
         of service with a business other than  his  own  and,  during  such
         period has been continuously

         (1)  registered with HM Revenue and Customs as self-employed, or

         (2)  registered with Companies House as the director of  a  new  or
             existing  business.   Directors  who  are  on  the   list   of
             disqualified directors provided by Companies House will not be
             awarded points.

25. The judge at paragraph 24 noted that  the  notice  of  refusal  by  the
    Secretary of State accepted that paragraphs (i) (ii) and (iii)  of  (d)
    were met and that continuous business activity for the required  period
    has been satisfied.

26. The key contention comes in relation to Table 4 (d) (iv) which  I  have
    cited above and which needs to be read with Appendix A,  paragraph  41-
    SD(e):

         "(e)     If the applicant is applying under the provisions  in  (d)
             in Table 4 he must also provide:

             (i)  his job title,

             (ii)     the Standard Occupational Classification  (SOC)  code
                  of the occupation that the applicant has been  working  in
                  since before 11 July 2014 or 6 April 2015 (as applicable),
                  up to the date of his application, which  must  appear  on
                  the list of occupations skilled to National Qualifications
                  Framework level 4 or above, as  stated  in  the  Codes  of
                  Practice in Appendix J,

             (iii)    one or more  of  the  following  specified  documents
                  showing that the business was active before 11  July  2014
                  or 6 April 2015  (as  applicable)  and  that  it  remained
                  active throughout the period leading up to the date of his
                  application (if the applicant or his entrepreneurial  team
                  member does not own the  domain  name  of  the  business's
                  website, then the evidence in (2) may not be provided, and
                  he must instead provide  one  or  more  of  the  documents
                  specified in (1),(3),(4) or (5)):

                  (1)   advertising   or   marketing   material,   including
                      printouts  of  online  advertising,  that  has   been
                      published  locally  or  nationally  and  showing  the
                      applicant's name (and the name  of  the  business  if
                      applicable) together with the business activity,  or,
                      where his business is trading online confirmation  of
                      his ownership of the domain name  of  the  business's
                      website,

                  (2)   article(s)  or  online  links  to  article(s)  in  a
                      newspaper   or   other   publication   showing    the
                      applicant's name (and the name  of  the  business  if
                      applicable) together with the business activity,

                  (4)  information from a trade fair, at which the applicant
                      has had a stand or given a presentation to market his
                      business, showing the applicant's name (and the  name
                      of the business  if  applicable)  together  with  the
                      business activity, or

                  (5)  personal registration with a UK trade body linked  to
                      the applicant's occupation; and

             (iv)     one or more  of  the  following  specified  documents
                  showing that the business was trading before 11 July  2014
                  up to no earlier than three months before the date of  the
                  application:

                  (1)  one or more contracts for service. If a  contract  is
                      not an original the applicant must  sign  each  page.
                      Each contract must show:

                      (a)   the  applicant's  name  and  the  name  of  the
                           business,

                      (b)   the  service  provided   by   the   applicant's
                           business;

                      (c)  the name of the party or parties involved in the
                           contract and  their  contact  details,  including
                           their  full  address,  postal   code,   telephone
                           contact number and any email address; and

                      (d)  the duration of the contract or, or

             (2)  one or more original letters from UK-regulated  financial
             institutions with which the  applicant  has  a  business  bank
             account, on the institution's  headed  paper,  confirming  the
             dates the business was trading during the period  referred  to
             at (iv) above

27. Under (iii) the respondent asserted that the appellant had to provide a
    specified  document  covering  either  together   or   individually   a
    continuous period commencing before 11th July 2014  up  to  no  earlier
    than three months before the date of his  application.   One  of  those
    requirements was advertising or marketing material including  printouts
    of online advertising that had been published locally or nationally.

28. The fact is that the respondent had already  accepted  in  relation  to
    (d)(iii) that since before  11th  July  2014  the  appellant  had  been
    continuously engaged in business activity  and  indeed  was  registered
    with HM Customs as self-employed.  If that were the case it would  seem
    remarkable that the appellant would produce business cards which  could
    not be construed by the respondent as referring to a period  commencing
    before 11th July 2014.  It should be clear from  the  rules  identified
    above that the appellant  does  not  have  to  produce  evidence  of  a
    continuous period of three months. There is no requirement in the rules
    which were applicable at the date  of  decision  that  the  appellant's
    business cards should be dated.

29. There was a letter on file from Farringdons Solicitors dated 8th August
    2014 and which Ms Sreeraman accepted, which  specifically  referred  to
    documentation showing the appellant purchasing a domain name  and  with
    screenshots of the  material,  published  business  leaflets  which  he
    circulated locally in his community.

30. The appellant's case is  that  he  also  submitted  invoices  with  the
    application which were not referred to and which could, taken  together
    with the remaining  marketing  and  advertising  material,  could  show
    material with his name and dates on it.  Indeed, even if that were  not
    the case, the business cards  read  with  the  Facebook  documentation,
    identifies his name and business  and  the  promotional  leaflets  were
    stated to be published in the  community  (thus  locally)  and  satisfy
    Table 4(d)(iii) that the appellant has  been  continuously  engaged  in
    business activity.  The Facebook documentation and  which  was  in  the
    respondent's bundle and thus was before the Secretary of State  at  the
    date of decision cites that it was created on 1st April  2014  and  the
    date of 25th July is also identifiable on  the  face  of  the  document
    (although in very  small  print).   Paragraph  (iii)  states  that  the
    documents can be taken either 'together or individually'.  The business
    card together with Facebook  advertising  and  the  business  plan  and
    promotional leaflets do identify the appellant's name and can be dated.
     I am satisfied that paragraph (e)  (iii)  is  fulfilled  as  the  rule
    refers to 'one or more of the following specified documents'  and  that
    those documents can be read together. The rule under Table 4(d)(iii) is
    not that there must be three months of trading but that there should be
    trading before 11th July 2014 and up to the date  of  his  application.
    The Facebook advertising of the business predates the  11th  July  2014
    and the respondent accepted in the notice of refusal that the  business
    was continuously trading to the date of application on 8th August 2014.

31. I turn to Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) which requires "one  or  more  of  the
    following documents showing trading which must cover  (either  together
    or individually) a continuous period before 11th July  2014  up  to  no
    earlier than three months before the date of his application:  (1)  one
    or more contracts for service".

32. It was asserted that the contract provided was not  acceptable  because
    the contract provided with Swift Mobile Valeting was dated 5th May 2014
    and no contract had been provided which was dated within  three  months
    of his application date which was 8th  August  2014.  Additionally  the
    contract between  his  business  and  Swift  Mobile  Valeting  was  not
    acceptable because it did not state the duration of the contract.

33. What this does not state is that the appellant must show  a  continuous
    period of trading for three months up to 11th July 2014.   It is  clear
    that the contract does relate to a period of trading which  carries  on
    from 16th May 2014, which is within the three month time limit  of  the
    application (8th August 2014), and as the judge found at  paragraph  27
    the contract was ongoing until it was terminated.   Thus  the  duration
    was specified.  The contract did not have to be time limited  according
    to the rules applicable as at the date  of  the  decision.   The  judge
    stated

    'he has provided a contract with Swift mobile valeting and Claringdons.
     This contract is dated 5 May 2014.  This does not mean  it  cannot  be
    taken into account because it predates the period under  consideration.
    The commencement date is 16 May 2015 and the contract is ongoing  until
    it is terminated.  This was evidence  which  was  before  the  decision
    maker.' (The judge in fact identified it as 2015 but I find this was  a
    typing error as the contract commences from 16th May 2014)

34. I find that there was an error of law for the reason given above in the
    decision of Judge Hosie but I retain the findings  as  indicated  above
    and I set that decision aside the First-tier Tribunal  decision  and  I
    allow the appeals under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because of the complexities within the evidence.
