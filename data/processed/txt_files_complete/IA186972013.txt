                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Keith Kimnell and a  lay  member),  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 13 - 14 April, to   a  deportation  appeal  by  a  citizen  of
    Portugal, born 27 March 1994.

 2. On 24 August the writer gave permission  to  appeal  in  the  following
    terms:

     a) The point on the appellant's continuity of residence, and hence the
        need, or lack of it, for 'imperative grounds' for his removal under
        the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 [the  EEA
        Regulations] is clearly arguable, in the light of Onuekwere  [2014]
        EUECJ C-378/12 and MG [2014] EUECJ  C-400/12.  This  was  the  main
        point on which the first-tier panel allowed the appeal.
     b) The appellant is arguably a foreign criminal under  ss.  117C-D  of
        the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, by  his  sentence
        of 12 months' detention and training for robbery in  2011.  If  so,
        the panel needed specifically to consider whether he met exceptions
        1 or 2; and, if not, whether there were 'exceptional and compelling
        circumstances' for a claim under article 8 to succeed  outside  the
        Rules, under MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  and  authorities
        since then.
     c) The panel's approach to police intelligence evidence  was  arguably
        too strict, in the light of V [2009] EWHC 1902 (Admin).
     d)  The  public  interest  involved  in  removing  someone  with   the
        appellant's repeated criminal convictions and with what is said  to
        be his history of gang membership, arguably justifies,  by  analogy
        with Virk & others [2013] EWCA Civ 652 , allowing the  Home  Office
        to withdraw what, in the light of the authorities referred to,  was
        clearly a mistaken concession on (a).

 3. As Mr Norton accepted, the crucial point is (a).  While  the  appellant
    had a very bad record for someone of his age, as the  very  experienced
    first-tier panel noted, it could not be suggested that they were  wrong
    in taking the view that there were  no  'imperative  grounds'  for  his
    removal, if 'reg. 21 (4) of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 [the EEA Regulations] applied  to  him.  The  relevant
    part reads:

      A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative  grounds  of
      public security in respect of an EEA national who -

      a)      has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
           at least ten years prior to [sic] the relevant decision ...

 4. In dealing with that point, the panel said no more than this:

       ... the respondent accepts that the appellant has been present in the
       United Kingdom  for more than ten years and that a decision to deport
       may not be taken against him except for "imperative grounds of public
       security" ...

    While they did refer to a second supplementary decision  letter  of  30
    December 2013, this was not of  course  in  the  original  Home  Office
    bundle, and there was nothing to bring it  to  the  writer's  attention
    till the present hearing. Neither the original letter of 19  June,  nor
    the first supplementary decision letter of 2  July  2013  conceded  any
    period of qualifying residence for this appellant at all, so  that  the
    basis for the respondent's concession before the panel seemed  to  have
    been no more than accepting on the facts that the  appellant  had  been
    here over ten years, without considering the quality of his residence.

 5. If that had been the case, it is common ground that this Tribunal would
    have been entitled to consider the case, not on such a mistaken view of
    the law, but on the correct up-to-date one, as  set  out  in  Onuekwere
    [2014] EUECJ  C-378/12  and  MG  [2014]  EUECJ  C-400/12,  and  further
    explained in MG (prison-Article 28(3) (a) of Citizens Directive) [2014]
    UKUT 392 (IAC). However, the terms of the second supplementary decision
    letter, at paragraphs 28 - 29, suggest  otherwise.  The  decision-maker
    begins by accepting that the appellant had acquired a  permanent  right
    of residence, on completion of five years' stay.  This  turned  out  to
    have been wrong, in the light of Onuekwere (paragraph 32); but that  is
    not the question with which we are concerned.

 6. The decision-maker went on to accept that the appellant had  been  here
    for at least ten years; but continued that the  Home  Office  took  the
    view that

       ...  you  do  not  automatically  [our  emphasis]  qualify  for   the
       protection of imperative grounds of public security.

    They went on to consider the factors set out in  Tsakouridis  (European
    citizenship) [2010] EUECJ C-145/09, and concluded at 29:

       Having assessed all these factors, the Home  Office  takes  the  view
       that you meet the integration criteria, as set out in Tsakouridis. As
       a result, it is necessary  to  establish  that  your  deportation  is
       warranted on imperative grounds of public security.

 7. While the approach taken in Tsakouridis  has been  further  refined  in
    Onuekwere  and MG, Mr Norton was unable to  refer  us  to  anything  in
    those decisions that show there was anything positively  wrong  in  the
    Tsakouridis approach  (by  the  way,  the  only  one  in  the  European
    jurisprudence available to the decision-maker at the time of  writing).
    In the circumstances, the panel were fully entitled to  take  the  Home
    Office concession about the  need  for  imperative  grounds  of  public
    security at face value, and it follows from what we have said at 3 that
    this appeal must be dismissed.

 8. However, we should not leave it without making two final points:

     a) this appellant should not imagine  that  his  European  citizenship
        gives him a charmed life  in  this  country,  so  far  as  criminal
        convictions are concerned: if he acquires any more,  following  his
        eventual release at the conclusion of  these  proceedings,  then  a
        future decision-maker may have not only to re-assess the degree  of
        his integration into this country, but to consider whether  further
        repeated offences do not amount to  imperative  grounds  of  public
        security for his removal; and

     b) Home Office decision-makers and tribunals should now consider cases
        of this kind in  the  light  of  Onuekwere   and  MG  ,  noting  in
        particular the difference in approach (see Onuekwere  paragraphs 27
        and 32) between five-year cases, where  the  qualifying  period  is
        irretrievably broken by imprisonment;  and  ten-year  cases,  where
        periods of imprisonment do not count towards the qualifying period,
        but may not irretrievably break it.
