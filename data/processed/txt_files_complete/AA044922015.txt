Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Maqsood, International Immigration Advisory
                       Service
For the Respondent:          Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant claims to be a national of Myanmar born in 1977.  He made
    a claim for international  protection  stating  he  feared  persecution
    there on account of his ethnic origin. The Appellant claims to be  from
    the Rohingya ethnic minority.


 2. The Respondent did not accept the Appellant's claims in respect of  his
    nationality and ethnicity; the principle reason for this  was  that  he
    had arrived in the UK on  what  appeared  to  be  a  valid  Bangladeshi
    passport.  The asylum claim was thereby rejected and a decision made to
    remove the Appellant under s10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 3. The Appellant duly appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  the  matter
    came before Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge McClure.

 4. The determination notes that the Appellant called  three  witnesses  to
    speak to his ethnicity and nationality. The  Respondent  had  not  been
    given any notice that  these  witnesses  were  to  be  called,  so  the
    Presenting  Officer  was  given  some  time  to   prepare   for   cross
    examination. That yielded  a  result  insofar  as  the  Respondent  was
    concerned: the gentlemen who claimed to be the President of the  Arakan
    Rohingya Organisation UK was  shown  to  be  a  failed  asylum  seeker,
    thought to be from Bangladesh [ï¿½42]. The  determination  addresses  the
    evidence of this witness at paragraph 57, and for the reasons  advanced
    by the Respondent, little weight was attached to it.

 5. A second witness was identified as a Mr  Nur  Huda.  Mr  Nur  Huda  was
    brought from a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh to live  in  the  UK
    under the 'Gateway' programme. The sum of his evidence was that he  had
    seen the Appellant in the camps; their  fathers  had  been  neighbours.
    This evidence is also addressed at paragraph 57, and  it  would  appear
    that the Tribunal attached little weight to it on the grounds  that  it
    was based on hearsay, Mr Nur Huda recounting information given  to  him
    by his father.

 6. The third and final witness is identified at paragraph 41 as a  Mr  Dil
    Mohammed. He is the Chairman of the Bradford Rohingya Community and was
    also transferred to the UK under the  'Gateway'  programme.  He  stated
    that his organisation had interviewed the Appellant and  his  wife  and
    finding them both to speak fluent Rohingya  were  satisfied  that  they
    were of that ethnicity, and were from Myanmar.  The determination makes
    no findings about the evidence of that witness. This  omission  is  the
    central ground of appeal advanced before  me.  Where  a  witness  gives
    evidence, it is incumbent on the Tribunal to make clear findings on it:
     see for instance MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT  00641
    (IAC).  I am satisfied that the failure to evaluate the testimony of Mr
    Dil Mohammad, and to weigh it in the balance, was an error of law.

 7. For the reasons which I explained to Mr Maqsood at hearing, this  error
    is not however such that the decision must be set aside.

 8. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom with a prima facie  genuine
    passport, issued by the authorities in Bangladesh. Unless and until  it
    is established that this document does not confer  any  rights  to  the
    citizenship - or protection of - that country, there was  no  error  of
    law in the First-tier Tribunal treating that document as  probative  of
    the Appellant's Bangladeshi nationality. Where  an  asylum  seeker  has
    more than one country of nationality, or is entitled to  such,  Article
    1A(2) of the Refugee  Convention  does  not  apply  unless  it  can  be
    demonstrated that he faces a real risk of harm in both  countries:  see
    for instance R v Special Adjudicator, ex p Abudine [1995] Imm AR 60  at
    63,  RR (refugee - safe third country) Syria [2010] UKUT 422 (IAC),  KK
    and ors (Nationality: North Korea) Korea CG [2011] UKUT 92 (IAC).

 9. The Appellant does not  deny  that  his  passport  was  issued  by  the
    Bangladeshi authorities. He explains that he and his family were living
    in the UAE and in common with other Rohingya in the  diaspora,  had  no
    papers with which  to  prove  their  identity.  Needing  some  form  of
    identification in order to remain living and working  in  the  UAE  the
    Appellant applied for a Bangladeshi passport. He states that  in  order
    to ensure that the document was issued  he  gave  biographical  details
    which were not true. Although his passport has been renewed  more  than
    once in the past, he now asserts that the Bangladeshi authorities  have
    refused to renew it again, because they cannot verify the details  that
    he originally supplied. There is no electronic record of  him  existing
    as a Bangladeshi national. That may or may not be the case.  There  was
    however no documentary evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to prove
    this to be so. Where there is prima facie evidence of dual  nationality
    the burden lies on the applicant to show that he is not entitled to the
    protection of either nationality. Where nationality  is  disputed  that
    burden will ordinarily only be discharged with the production  of  some
    evidence: see for instance MA(Ethiopia) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 289.  In
    that case the Court of Appeal held that the applicant would be expected
    to act bona fides and take reasonable steps to enable his or her return
    to the country in question. In that case this required the claimant  to
    attend the Ethiopian  embassy,  tell  them  the  truth  and  request  a
    passport. If a claimant  does  this,  and  is  refused,  that  will  be
    sufficient to demonstrate that he or she cannot access  the  protection
    of that country.


10. This is the difficulty faced by the Appellant.   He has now  carried  a
    Bangladeshi passport for many years. The Tribunal  cannot  know  or  be
    expected to guess at what the reaction of the  Bangladeshi  authorities
    might be if furnished with the information put forward in this  appeal.
    They may deny  the  Appellant  protection;  they  may  be  prepared  to
    overlook the assertion that he supplied false  information  and  simply
    treat him as a national. What is certain is  that  in  the  absence  of
    evidence from the Bangladeshi authorities the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    not just entitled to dismiss this appeal, it was obliged to.

11. For the reasons set out above I need not address the remaining  grounds
    of appeal as they relate to asylum. Ground 4 makes complaint about  the
    way in which the Tribunal addressed Article 8. It is submitted that the
    Tribunal failed to consider  the  best  interests  of  the  Appellant's
    children, one of whom, being born  in  the  UK  is  "stateless".  These
    arguments turn on the  same  framework  applied  above.  The  child  in
    question has been born to a father who is entered  the  UK  carrying  a
    valid Bangladeshi passport, and a mother  who  entered  on  an  equally
    valid Pakistani document.  If the Appellant wishes to demonstrate  that
    his child is stateless, some evidence of the same must be supplied.







    Decisions

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any error such
    that it should be set aside. The decision is upheld.


13. I was  not  asked  to  make  a  direction  for  anonymity  and  in  the
    circumstances I see no reason to do so.
