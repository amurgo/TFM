                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Peter Jorro, Counsel instructed by Roelens
solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Paul Duffey, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the respondent's refusal on
    two occasions to grant her entry clearance to settle with her  son  and
    his family in the United Kingdom, on two separate occasions.  She is an
    Indian citizen and is now 78 years old.



Background

 2. The appellant wishes to join her son and daughter-in-law in the  United
    Kingdom.  She was married for 44 years,  living  with  her  husband  in
    Coimbatore for all that time. Before his death, she was a sociable  and
    happy soul, gentle by nature, innocent and occasionally child-like, who
    took great comfort from her marriage and her husband's company.

 3. In 2005, their only son, who had come to the United Kingdom some  years
    earlier to study, married and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    wedding was in India, but his home is here.  The sponsor and  his  wife
    now have two sons, one born in 2006 and one in 2012.

 4. In May 2012, the appellant visited the United Kingdom to  see  her  son
    and his  children.   In  November  2012,  her  husband  died,  and  the
    appellant discovered his body.  She was badly  affected.   She  is  now
    described as withdrawn, pessimistic, heavily depressed  and  completely
    changed, having lost all interest in life and things around  her.   Her
    niece in India has been helping look after the appellant, but  she  has
    her own domestic problems, with a seriously disabled  daughter  and  an
    alcoholic husband.  She says that she cannot  continue  to  assist  her
    aunt.

 5. The sponsor has visited India to try to help his mother, on a number of
    occasions, but her progress was very slow.  He is the appellant's  only
    child and her siblings in India are all elderly, with  difficulties  of
    their own.  He has paid his  father's  funeral  costs  and  significant
    additional costs arising out of  these  applications,  legal  expenses,
    travel to India, loans his father had taken out  for  home  improvement
    and so on.  The sponsor and his wife have recently bought  a  house  in
    the United Kingdom and the loans may have been to assist them, but  now
    his father is dead, he has had to pay them back himself.

 6.  Her  doctor  in  India  referred  the  appellant   to   a   consultant
    psychiatrist, Dr Selvaraj at the Vazhikatti Mental Health Centre.   The
    monthly cost of the medical care she now needs is about �450  a  month,
    and in addition, she needs help with daily personal care and  emotional
    support.  At present, the sponsor's wife's parents were  receiving  the
    funds he sent (about �300-�500 a month) and paying her  medical  bills.
    There was equity in the appellant's home  in  India  of  about  �90,000
    which could be realised if she joined her son in the United Kingdom.

 7. The sponsor did not consider that a paid carer could  provide  for  the
    appellant's needs; she  expected  her  only  son  to  look  after  her.
    Nursing homes in India are only for those whose families have  rejected
    them, which would increase her depression rather than  alleviating  it.
    As it was, the appellant had ceased to keep her home  clean,  lost  her
    appetite, and her niece had to do all the cleaning and cooking  and  so
    on.  She experiences psychomotor retardation, as a result of which  she
    is effectively housebound, inherently linked to her  depressive  state.
    The appellant spends all day in her bedroom, emerging  for  just  10-15
    minutes a day to pray.



First-tier Tribunal decision

 8. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  in  a  long  and  carefully  reasoned
    decision,  accepted  the  evidence  as  to   the   appellant's   severe
    depression, lasting for at least 2 years and likely  continuing,  after
    her husband's death.  He accepted that the witnesses  were  honest  and
    well meaning, and that 'there  is  clearly  a  dependence  between  the
    appellant and her son, exacerbated  enormously  by  the  death  of  her
    husband in 2012'.

 9. He considered that the appellant's circumstances could not  be  brought
    within the Rules, having regard to Appendix FM EC-DR.

10. Nor did he consider the circumstances to be such  that  the  respondent
    should consider exercising her Nagre discretion outside the  Rules  and
    he dismissed the appeal.

Permission to appeal

11. The appellant sought permission to appeal.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Rintoul  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had  not  correctly  applied  the
    provision of E-ECDR 2.5  and  the  'required  level  of  care'.   Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rintoul considered that there  was  less  merit  in  the
    appellant's argument that there were compelling  circumstances  outside
    the Rules for which a grant  of  entry  clearance  should  be  made  on
    Article 8 grounds.

Rule 24 Reply

12. The respondent in her reply argued that the Judge's  interpretation  of
    the meaning of 'care' in the Rules was open to him.  The Reply sets out
    the relevant Rule, then continues thus:

         "5.  It is the preliminary view of the respondent  that  the  Judge
         was entitled to conclude that the need  the  support  for  everyday
         tasks was not applicable to the concept  of  emotional  support  or
         recovery.  The conclusions of the Judge at paragraph 73 are open to
         him following his careful analysis of the rule.

         6.   It is clear that the requirements of the rule are  limited  to
         the concept of assistance with everyday tasks.   The  rule  is  not
         intended to go further than this."

13. That was the basis on which the appeal came before me.

Upper Tribunal hearing

14. At the hearing, I had the benefit  of  a  skeleton  argument  and  oral
    submissions from Mr Jorro, and also submissions from Mr Duffey for  the
    respondent Entry Clearance Officer.

15. In his skeleton argument, Mr Jorro argued that the 'required  level  of
    care' must be taken to include both the specific nature of the  illness
    and the cultural context of the society in which such care  is  needed.
    In the appellant's case, that should be taken to include the  emotional
    and practical support which could only be provided by the sponsor,  his
    wife and children, and the cultural expectations that such  care  would
    be provided to a widow by her only son. The appellant contends that  in
    concentrating on 'functional care' rather than the extended  definition
    contended for by the appellant, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

16. The skeleton argument then  sets  out  the  medical  evidence  at  some
    length, emphasising the opinion of the  appellant's  doctors  that  her
    son's care is required for her wellbeing (see [11]  in  the  skeleton).
    The appellant rejects the respondent's contention that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's interpretation was open to it, and argues  that  the  appeal
    should be allowed on this basis alone.

17. Turning to the Nagre/SS (Congo) point, the appellant contends that  the
    Rules are not Article 8 complaint and  that  the  question  is  one  of
    Razgar proportionality.  It is not reasonable to expect the sponsor and
    his British citizen wife and children to go to live in  India  to  care
    for his mother there.  The appellant will not be a burden on the United
    Kingdom taxpayer and accordingly, failure to allow the  appeal  outside
    the Rules is also an error of law.

18. In his oral submissions, Mr Jorro accepted that there was no  authority
    on the interpretation of this particular rule.  He sought leave to rely
    on the unreported decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb in Timiro Nour
    Osman [2013] UKAITUR OA.18244.2012, in which the interpretation  of  E-
    ECDR 2.5 is considered at [30]-[33]

         "30. No definition of "long-term personal care to perform  everyday
         tasks" is contained within the Immigration Rules. The reference  to
         "personal care" is to be distinguished from "medical" or  "nursing"
         care and would appear to mean that the care that has to be provided
         is  "personal"  rather  than,  for  example,  support  provided  by
         mechanical aids or medication. The need is for "personal" care,  in
         other words, care provided by another person. The  "personal  care"
         must  be  required  "long-term"  rather  than  on  a  temporary  or
         transitional basis. And, further, the provision  of  care  must  be
         necessary in order that an individual may perform "everyday tasks".



         31.  The relevant IDI (dated 13 December 2012) at para 2.2.1  gives
         by way of  example  of  "everyday  tasks"  that  an  individual  is
         incapable of "washing, dressing and cooking". Those  are  obviously
         aspects of an individual's life  properly  described  as  "everyday
         tasks" but that phrase has a wider meaning which would include, for
         example,  the  management  of  an  individual's  bodily  functions,
         difficulties with mobility and communication. Other  activities  of
         daily living will also be  included  within  the  phrase  "everyday
         tasks".

         32.  Thirdly, E-ECDR 2.5 requires an individual to  establish  that
         the "required level of care in the country where they  are  living"
         cannot be obtained even with the practical and  financial  help  of
         the sponsor because either it is  not  available  or  there  is  no
         person in that country who could reasonably provide it or it is not
         affordable. Consequently, if the sponsor  can  provide  a  relative
         with the finances which will deliver the "required level  of  care"
         in the relative's own country then the  requirements  of  the  Rule
         will not be  met  unless  the  "long-term  personal  care"  is  not
         available and no one in the  individual's  country  can  reasonably
         provide it.

         33.  This latter  requirement  undoubtedly  imposes  a  significant
         burden of proof upon an individual to show that the required  level
         of care is not available and no one can reasonably  provide  it  in
         the individual's country. An example where that latter  requirement
         might well be satisfied would be where the "required level of care"
         needed requires a particular type of carer,  for  example  a  close
         family member, none of whom live in the individual's  country.  The
         evidence would have to establish, in such a case, the  need  for  a
         particular type of carer such as a family  member  and  not  simply
         that the individual required personal care from  someone.  In  many
         circumstances,  the  "required  level  of  care"  to  perform  such
         everyday tasks as cooking, washing,  and  to  assist  mobility  are
         likely to be capable of being performed not just by family  members
         who do not live in that individual's country. But,  it  is  equally
         possible to contemplate, having regard to  cultural  factors,  that
         needed "personal care" involving intimate  or  bodily  contact  may
         require a gender-specific carer from the individual's family.  What
         is the "required level of care" and who may  appropriately  provide
         it will depend upon the circumstances and the evidence in any given
         case."

19. In the Nour Osman case, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set
    aside and remade, on similar facts to those  of  this  appeal,  in  the
    appellant's favour.  In relation  to  the  second  ground,  Mr  Jorro's
    arguments mirrored those in his  skeleton  argument  and  do  not  need
    further expansion here.

20. For the respondent, Mr Duffey relied on the Secretary  of  State's  IDI
    "Family members  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Rules:  Adult  Dependent
    Relatives":

         "2.2.2   Unable to receive  the  required  level  of  care  in  the
         country where they are living

         The Entry Clearance Officer needs to establish that  the  applicant
         has no access to the required level of care in  the  country  where
         they are living, even with the practical and financial help of  the
         sponsor in the United Kingdom.  This could be  because  it  is  not
         available and there is no person in that country who can reasonably
         provide it, or because it is not affordable.  The evidence required
         to establish this is set out below.  If the required level of  care
         is available or affordable, the application should be refused.

         2.2.3    No person in the country who can reasonably provide care

         The Entry Clearance Officer should consider whether there is anyone
         in the country where the applicant is  living  who  can  reasonably
         provide the required level of care. This  can  be  a  close  family
         member:  son,  daughter,  brother,  sister,   parent,   grandchild,
         grandparent, or another person who can provide care  e.g.  a  home-
         help, housekeeper, nurse, carer, or care or nursing  home.   If  an
         applicant has more than one close relative  in  the  country  where
         they are living, those relatives may be able to pool  resources  to
         provide the required care.  The Entry Clearance Officer should bear
         in mind any relevant cultural factors, such as in  countries  where
         women are unlikely to be able to provide support. "

21. At 2.2.5, example scenarios are given,  which  include  a  70-year  old
    person living alone in India, who is becoming frail and  forgetful  and
    whose daughter sends money for her mother to  pay  someone  to  do  her
    cleaning; and an 85-year  old  living  in  Afghanistan,  who  has  poor
    eyesight, has had a series of falls, and a hip replacement,  but  whose
    only son sends money to enable his father to pay a carer to  visit  and
    help him wash and dress and cook for him.  Neither of these examples is
    said to meet the criteria, because the required level of  care  can  be
    arranged in the country of origin by paying someone to provide it.

22. At 2.3.3, the evidence expected is set out:

         "2.3.3   Evidence that the  applicant  is  unable,  even  with  the
         practical and financial help of the sponsor in the United  Kingdom,
         to obtain the required level of care in the country where they  are
         living:

         Evidence that the required level of care:

          a) Is not, or is no longer, available in the  country  where  the
             applicant is living.  This evidence should be from  a  central
             or local health authority, a local authority, or a  doctor  or
             other health professional.  If  the  required  care  has  been
             provided through a private  arrangement,  the  applicant  must
             provide details of that arrangement and why it  is  no  longer
             available.

          b) Is not, or is no longer, affordable in the country  where  the
             applicant lives.  If payment was made for arranging this care,
             the Entry Clearance Officer should ask to see records, and  an
             explanation of why this payment cannot continue.  If financial
             support has been provided by the sponsor or other close family
             in the United Kingdom, the Entry Clearance Officer should  ask
             for an explanation of why this cannot continue or is no longer
             sufficient  to  enable  the  required  level  of  care  to  be
             provided."

23. Mr Duffey observed that the First-tier Tribunal had not made an express
    finding  that  Kugathas  dependency  existed  in  this  case.   As   to
    compelling  circumstances  outside  the  Rules,  it  was  difficult  to
    establish that here since the Rules covered all of the  matters  relied
    upon for the exercise of the respondent's discretion outside the Rules.
     At present, day-to-day  care  was  being  provided  and  although  the
    appellant would undoubtedly prefer her family to care for her, that was
    not the test.

24. In reply, Mr Jorro argued that the meaning of 'required level of  care'
    was a matter of law not fact and that the appeal was on all fours  with
    the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb in Nour Osman.  It  was  not
    open to the Home Office to limit the scope of the Rules in her guidance
    as she had sought to do. He asked me to consider giving guidance on the
    interpretation of E-ECDR and to find that there was indeed family  life
    between the appellant and her son, such that Article 8  was  applicable
    and the proportionality test should be applied.

Discussion

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  turns  on  the  provisions  of
    paragraph E-ECRD 2.5 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended):

         "E-ECDR.2.5. The applicant or, if the applicant and  their  partner
         are the sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner,
         must be unable, even with the practical and financial help  of  the
         sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in the country  where
         they are living, because-

         (a)  it is not available and there is no person in that country who
             can reasonably provide it; or

         (b)  it is not affordable."

    The issue in this appeal is the meaning of 'the required level of  care
    in the country where they are living'.

26. I have considered the submissions and the First-tier Tribunal decision,
    which is carefully reasoned and has full regard to  the  narrowness  of
    the new Rule and the difficulties in its interpretation.  It  is  clear
    that the Judge was aware that the effect of the decision was harsh, and
    that he reached the conclusion he did reluctantly, after  very  careful
    reflection on all of the evidence and arguments before him.

27. It is right that, like the appellant in Nour Ahmed, this appellant  and
    her medical advisers consider that it would be preferable  for  her  to
    live in the United Kingdom with her son.  That decision  is  unreported
    and is not binding upon me.  I recall that at paragraph 33,  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Nour Ahmed held that 'What is the "required level of  care"
    and who may appropriately provide it will depend upon the circumstances
    and  the  evidence  in  any  given  case'.   Contrary  to  Mr   Jorro's
    submissions, the 'required level of care' is a question of fact, on the
    evidence before the fact-finding Tribunal.

28. In this appeal, the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that
    the appellant's care is being paid for by the sponsor, and her niece is
    doing her cooking and cleaning and so forth, while her son's parents-in-
    law receive money her son sends, and pay her medical bills.  There  was
    no evidence to show whether a paid carer could be found,  or  how  much
    that would cost: that possibility had not yet been considered.

29. I am not persuaded that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law.  It
    was open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to make findings of fact  and
    then to apply the natural meaning of the Rule, and  conclude  that  the
    'required level of care' was available.

30. I therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  decline
    to reopen this decision.

DECISION

31. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.




    Date:    25 January 2016   Signed   Judith AJC Gleeson
