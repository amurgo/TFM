                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Wilson
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 20th June, 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 19th May 1979.   He  applied
    to come to the UK as the wife of Joanne Ahmed  but  was  refused  entry
    clearance on the grounds that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that he had a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  his
    Sponsor nor that he intended to live permanently with her in the UK.

 3. There was a considerable amount of evidence before him  in  support  of
    the Appellant's case.  Most of the evidence of contact by telephone was
    postdecision.  The judge said:

         "At the hearing it was submitted on the Appellant's behalf  that  I
         should  take  account  of  all  telephone   communication   records
         including all postdecision records as appertaining to  the  refusal
         decision.  I do not uphold this submission because irrespective  of
         any  other  considerations  as  to  law  in  this  matter  and  the
         interpretation of Section 85A of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002, I find that the telephone  records  were  entirely
         new evidence of calls arising after the date of  the  decision  and
         that they did not appertain to the circumstances at the time of the
         decision.  This is because  having  regard  to  the  whole  of  the
         evidence I  cannot  be  satisfied  that  this  was  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship  or  that  the  parties  intended  to  live
         together permanently in the UK."

 4. I am satisfied that the judge erred in law for the following reasons.

 5. First, the judge was in error in  his  interpretation  of  postdecision
    evidence.  In DR (ECO postdecision evidence)  Morocco*  Ousely  J  held
    that,  whilst  evidence  of  postdecision  facts  were  precluded,  the
    admission of further evidence adduced in order to  establish  what  the
    true picture was at the time the decision was made, was not.

 6. Second, in deciding to exclude the postdecision evidence because he was
    not satisfied  that  the  couple  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship, the judge did not have proper regard to the whole of  the
    evidence in reaching his conclusions.  He declined to consider relevant
    evidence on the grounds that he had already reached a conclusion.

 7.  Third,  I  am  also  satisfied  that  he  erred  in  relation  to  his
    consideration of the oral evidence.  The Sponsor's two  daughters  gave
    evidence as to the Appellant's  and  their  mother's  intentions.   The
    judge stated that their evidence was not relevant, but it  clearly  was
    potentially supportive of the Appellant's claim and ought to have  been
    considered.

 8. Fourth, the judge appeared  to  cast  doubt  on  the  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's visits to Iraq but that was not  a  matter  in  dispute.  The
    Entry Clearance Officer accepted that the visits had taken place.

 9. Fifth, the judge referred to the Appellant's  and  Sponsor's  chequered
    history  of  relationships.   Whilst  he  was  entitled  to  make  that
    observation in respect  of  the  Sponsor,  who  is  now  in  his  third
    relationship with a British national, there is nothing in the Sponsor's
    history which could properly be described in such terms.

10. Finally, the judge said that the photographs which  had  been  produced
    were unexplained and he could not know what the pictures were  intended
    to signify.  However the  Sponsor's  witness  statement  explained  the
    circumstances  of  her  visits  to  Iraq  and  her  contact  with   the
    Appellant's family there.

11. I am satisfied that, cumulatively,  these  errors  render  the  judge's
    findings unsafe so that the decision  will  have  to  be  re-made.  His
    decision is set aside. I was informed that the Sponsor is presently  in
    Iraq visiting her  husband  and  therefore  the  appeal  could  not  be
    concluded today.  It was therefore adjourned to 11th December 2014.

The resumed hearing

12. I heard oral evidence from the Sponsor, Joanne Ahmed and her  daughters
    Lauren and Natalie Steward.  All confirmed their witness statements and
    the strength of the relationship.  None of the evidence was  challenged
    by Mr Diwnycz who observed that the witnesses presented  themselves  as
    people who knew their own minds and he was happy  to  accept  that  the
    Sponsor was wholly devoted to the Appellant.  He did  however  rely  on
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  refusal  and  his  belief  that   the
    Appellant's intentions were  not  as  stated  by  him  because  of  the
    previous serial applications that he had made.

The Factual Basis of the Applications

13. The history of this matter is as follows.  The Appellant came to the UK
    in August 2001 and claimed asylum.  He was refused and  the  subsequent
    appeal was dismissed.  He became appeal rights exhausted  on  22nd  May
    2002 but no removal decision was made.

14. The Appellant began a relationship with a British citizen in March 2001
    and in  July  2004  they  married.   The  marriage  broke  down  almost
    immediately, in October 2004.  No immigration application was ever made
    on the basis of that relationship.

15. In September 2005 the Appellant  and  Sponsor  met  and  they  began  a
    relationship.  It lasted for a little over six months and broke down in
    May 2006. It is the evidence of all parties that  the  couple  remained
    friends and kept in touch after their relationship ended.  In  November
    2006 the Sponsor began a relationship with another man, and in February
    2007 the Appellant began a relationship with another woman.

16. He was removed from the UK in March 2010.

17. The Appellant made  a  fianc�  application  in  March  2011  which  was
    subsequently refused  in  September  2011  and  in  October  2011  that
    relationship ended.  From the end of 2011  the  Sponsor  and  Appellant
    resumed more frequent contact and in May 2012 she visited him in  Iraq.
    They became engaged and married in September 2012.

18. The Entry Clearance Officer, unsurprisingly, was  very  concerned  that
    the Appellant appeared to be using the Sponsor as a way of returning to
    the UK, particularly since in the Entry Clearance Manager's review,  it
    refers to three marriages with GBR nationals  and  relationships  which
    appear to have been running concurrently.

19. I am satisfied that the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  is  mistaken.   The
    Appellant has been married once before to a British  national,  and  it
    did not result in a marriage application.  He did subsequently apply to
    come to the UK as a fianc� but that  relationship  broke  down  shortly
    after the refusal and was not pursued to appeal. I am  satisfied  that,
    contrary to the view of the Entry Clearance Manager, the  relationships
    described were not simultaneous. At the time  that  the  Appellant  was
    engaged to another woman he was friends with the Sponsor but they  were
    not in a romantic relationship. Nevertheless his history was clearly  a
    sufficient basis for legitimate concerns to be raised.

20. I am satisfied that they are  misplaced.  No  credibility  issues  were
    raised with the oral evidence by the Presenting Officer today.

21. So far as the relationship with the Sponsor is concerned, the  evidence
    is unchallenged. The couple had a relatively brief relationship between
    2005 and 2006 and thereafter remained on friendly terms and reunited in
    2012. Natalie Stewart, the Sponsor's daughter, said that  she  kept  in
    touch from 2005 to 2010, after the initial split, because she  remained
    close  friends  with  him,  and  she  had   known   about   his   other
    relationships. I am satisfied that the Sponsor and her family  retained
    good contact after the initial relationship finished. Indeed, there can
    be no other logical explanation for the Sponsor to have visited Iraq in
    that year.

22. Subsequent contact casts light on the circumstances as they were at the
    date of decision. The Sponsor has visited the Appellant in Sulaymaniyah
    six times, in April and September 2012, March and  September  2013  and
    February and September 2014.   The  evidence  was  that  she  had  some
    legitimate anxiety  for  her  safety.  In  spite  of  that,  all  three
    witnesses said that the Sponsor  fully  intended  to  settle  with  the
    Appellant in Iraq if the appeal was  dismissed.   There  is  also  very
    strong evidence of telephone contact, almost  daily  contact,  and  the
    oral evidence from the two daughters who say that  they  are  in  touch
    with him by Skype, email etc.

23. This is a relatively long-lived relationship.  The  couple  have  known
    each other for  almost  ten  years.   The  best  person  to  judge  the
    Appellant's intentions is the Sponsor; I have  no  doubt  that  if  her
    daughters had any anxiety abut whether their mother was being used  for
    the purpose of obtaining a visa they would not have volunteered to give
    evidence in the appeal.

Decision

24. The original judge erred in law and his decision has  been  set  aside.
    It is remade as follows.  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
