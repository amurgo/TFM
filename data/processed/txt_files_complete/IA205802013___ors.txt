                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This  determination  refers  to  the  principal  appellant  as  "the
       appellant"; the other cases depend on hers.  She appeals  against  a
       determination by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Agnew,  dismissing  her
       appeal  against  refusal  of  a  Tier   1   (Entrepreneur)   Migrant
       application.


    2. At ï¿½13 the judge based  her  decision  on  guidance  issued  by  the
       respondent  about  "evidential  flexibility"   regarding   documents
       submitted in the "wrong format".

    3. This  case  did  not  turn  on  guidance  but  on  paragraph  245AA,
       incorporated into the Rules on 6 September 2012.  It did not involve
       a document in the "wrong format" - 245AA(b)(ii) -   but  a  document
       which  "does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified  information"  -
       245AA(b)(iv).

    4. Such a situation gives the decision maker discretion to request  the
       correct documents.   The  appellant  had  already  been  called  for
       interview and written to about aspects of her application which  she
       was able to put right.  The point on which she  failed,  absence  of
       her  name  from  her  business  advertisement,  was  part   of   the
       application from the time it was made but was never raised prior  to
       the refusal.  Discretion should have called for the appellant to  be
       given an opportunity on a point which  she  could  justifiably  have
       thought by that stage not to be an issue, and which should have been
       seen as likely to be capable of rectification.   The  appellant  was
       able to produce in the FtT  an  advertisement  which  did  meet  the
       requirements of the Rules by including her name.


    5. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
       appeals, as brought by the appellants to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
       are allowed under the Immigration Rules.
