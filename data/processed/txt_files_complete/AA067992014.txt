Representation:
For the Secretary of State:  Ms Everett
For the Respondent:    Mr Collins


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey. The appellant first  entered  the
    United Kingdom on January 8, 2012 and on arrival  she  claimed  asylum.
    She  attended  a  substantive  interview  on  January  18,  2012.   The
    respondent refused her application on July 22, 2014  and  at  the  same
    time took a decision to remove her from the United Kingdom  by  way  of
    directions under paragraph 10A of Schedule 2  to  the  Immigration  Act
    1971.

 3.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Callender Smith
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on December 12, 2014 and  in  a
    decision promulgated on December 31, 2014  he  allowed  the  appeal  on
    asylum grounds and under articles 2 and 3 ECHR.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal  on  January  8,  2015  and  on
    January 20, 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Levin gave permission
    to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the FtTJ  had  erred
    by failing to explain why the respondent  had  lost  the  case  and  by
    failing to consider the medical evidence in the round.

 6. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as  set  out  above.  The  appellant  herself  was  not  in
    attendance.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 7. Ms Everett adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted  that  the  FtTJ
    had erred by relying solely on the medical evidence and by  failing  to
    make findings on issues in dispute. She argued that the respondent  was
    unclear why the appeal had been allowed and the FtTJ failed  to  engage
    with the refusal letter.

 8. Mr Collins, in lengthy submissions, argued there was no error  in  law.
    He submitted as follows:

      a.  He  referred  me  to  the  decision  of  Budhathoki  (reasons  for
         decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) that  had  been  raised  by  the
         respondent in her grounds of appeal.  He  submitted  the  FtTJ  had
         given reasons for his findings and he  referred  me  to  the  whole
         structure of the determination. The FtTj was fully  aware  of  both
         parties' positions and he had referred to  the  appellant's  claim,
         the respondent's response, the medical and country evidence as well
         as the appellant's written statement before he made  any  findings.
         At paragraph [23] of his  determination  the  FtTJ  made  clear  he
         intended to review all of the evidence before making a decision. Mr
         Collins  submitted  the  FtTJ  accepted  the  appellant's   account
         (paragraph [32(b)] of the determination) and took into account  the
         medical evidence as to why the appellant  did  not  give  evidence.
         Having considered the evidence he then found at  paragraph  [32(g)]
         that she had suffered as claimed and she benefited the  benefit  of
         the doubt and he stated there were very few discrepancies.

      b. The respondent had quoted Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 36 but  he
         submitted that this did not affect this appeal because at paragraph
         [16] of his determination the FtTJ considered the evidence and made
         findings and only then looked at the medical evidence. If the  FtTJ
         had allowed the appeal solely on the medical report then respondent
         would have a point but that is not what happened here. The FtTJ had
         given the report  weight  but  did  not  lose  sight  of  what  the
         appellant's case was.

      c. The respondent referred to the case of HH [2007] EWCA  Civ  306  in
         her grounds but this case was distinguishable as that case involved
         an attack on the credibility findings whereas  in  the  appeal  the
         FtTJ had considered the  medical  evidence  and  found  the  report
         supported the appellant's explanation at interview.  The  interview
         was extremely traumatic particularly because of the manner in which
         questioning was undertaken. Despite the nature of  questioning  the
         FtTJ found her to be a credible witness in  light  of  country  and
         medical evidence.

 9. Miss Everett responded briefly to those submissions and submitted  that
    if the FtTJ had been as detailed as  Mr  Collins  then  the  respondent
    would have know why they lost the case and whilst the challenges  today
    were not the best she maintained the FtTJ had not given cogent reasons.



10. Having considered the submissions I indicated to both  parties  that  I
    was satisfied there was no error  in  law  and  I  would  give  written
    reasons for my decision.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

11. This was an asylum application from an appellant who  claimed  she  had
    been regularly arrested and assaulted both physically and  sexually  by
    the Turkish Gendarme. This abuse was said to have  occurred  over  3  ï¿½
    year period and was linked to her husband's connections to the PKK.

12. The FtTJ allowed the appeal and the respondent appealed the decision on
    two grounds namely lack of reasons and taking  the  decision  based  on
    content of the medical report only.

13. The respondent referred in her grounds to the decisions  of  Mibanga  v
    SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 36, HH [2007] EWCA Civ 306 and Budhathoki (reasons
    for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC).

14. Having heard Ms Everett's submissions I raised with her the  fact  that
    the FtTJ had considered all of the evidence and had not merely  allowed
    the appeal based on a medical report. Her response to this was that the
    FtTJ had failed to engage with the respondent's  submissions  contained
    in the refusal letter.

15. Mr Collins addressed this issue in his response and quite properly took
    me through the FtTJ's determination. There was no suggestion  the  FtTJ
    had recorded facts incorrectly and I am satisfied that he  demonstrated
    engagement with the  issues  particularly  in  paragraph  [32]  of  his
    determination.

16. The FtTJ demonstrated he had considered the respondent's  concerns  but
    he rejected those concerns when he stated in paragraph [32(b)],

        "I should make it clear  that  I  believe  the  incidents  she  has
        described did occur and kept occurring".

17. The FtTJ then explained in paragraph [32]  (d),  {e)  and  (f)  why  he
    accepted her account and all those findings were open to him.  He  also
    made clear in paragraph [32] (b) and (g) that the report from the Helen
    Bamber Foundation supported her case and explained  why  she  may  have
    been unable to give as clear and concise account as the respondent  was
    seeking. He concluded in paragraph [32](g)-

        "... Given the background trauma I find she has  clearly  suffered,
        where there are discrepancies in her account then  she  merits  the
        benefit of the doubt. In fact, there are very few discrepancies and
        her account taken as a whole has a high degree of consistency".

18. I therefore am satisfied the FtTJ made findings that were open  to  him
    and gave reasons for his findings. A full reading of the  determination
    would make it clear to anyone why the appeal was allowed. The FtTJ made
    it clear he accepted her claims and did  this  in  light  of  her  own,
    medical and country evidence.

19. I also reject the submission that the decision was made  based  on  the
    medical report alone. At the beginning of his findings the FtTJ accepts
    her account (paragraph [32(b)] and found the  medical  report  assisted
    him in assessing her claim.

20. There is no merit to these grounds of appeal and I dismiss the appeal.

    DECISION

21. There was no material error. I uphold the original decision.

22. The First-tier Tribunal did make an  anonymity  direction  pursuant  to
    rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to alter that order.
