Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T J Pasha, Solicitor (Pasha Law Chambers)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer  to  the  appellant  as  the
      secretary of state and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 1st December 1992. He
      appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  following  the  refusal  of  his
      application for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
      Student Migrant. The secretary of state  refused  his  application  on
      12th March 2014, contending that he was not entitled  to  receive  any
      points under Appendix C for maintenance (funds) as he had not provided
      evidence  of  the  relationship  to  the  account  holder  whose  bank
      documents he produced.


   3. The claimant in his grounds of appeal asserted that he had provided an
      affidavit from his father confirming the relationship and sponsorship.
      He understood that the respondent had the records of his father in the
      system as these have been submitted with  his  application  for  entry
      clearance.


   4. He also contended that "flexibility policy" should have  been  applied
      in his case and that the  secretary  of  state  could  have  requested
      additional documents.


   5. In his witness statement produced before the First-tier Tribunal dated
      10th May 2014, he 'confirmed' that  an  original  affidavit  from  his
      father and a bank statement had been submitted.


   6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the claimant's  appeal  as  a
      paper case.


   7. The Judge referred to the application made by the  appellant  on  26th
      November 2013 in which a copy of  the  affidavit  in  support  by  his
      father had been submitted, including a copy of his Pakistani  passport
      stating his father's name. The secretary of state has  not  taken  any
      issue with regard to the bank statement itself or the availability  of
      the funds.


   8. The Judge found at paragraph 16 that the  claimant  submitted  a  bank
      statement in his father's name and  there  were  additional  documents
      confirming both his father's willingness to support him and  also  the
      claimant's passport showing his father's name.


   9. At paragraph 17, the Judge noted that the claimant  accepted  that  he
      had not provide a birth certificate at the date  of  the  application,
      although that has now been provided with the appeal documents.


  10. Taking into account the documentation available, the Judge found  that
      "it would appear" that the claimant did submit an affidavit  from  his
      father together with a bank statement in his father's name,  and  that
      his father is  referred  to  on  the  claimant's  passport.  There  is
      accordingly evidence that the bank  statement  was  submitted  by  the
      claimant's father. The Judge was  thus  satisfied  that  he  submitted
      sufficient evidence confirming that the funds represented in the  bank
      statement were available to him from his father [19].


  11. The Judge stated that for the avoidance of doubt, he  had  taken  into
      account SSHD v Rodrigues [2014] EWCA Civ 2.  It  was  clear  from  the
      documents submitted that the claimant was providing some  evidence  of
      relationships and that if the secretary of state had doubts, "he (sic)
      should have exercised his flexibility  policy"  in  order  to  require
      additional documents from the claimant. This is not a case where  such
      documents were not known to be in existence.


  12. Accordingly, the claimant had satisfied the Judge on  the  balance  of
      probabilities that he had at the date of application sufficient  funds
      available to meet the maintenance requirements under the rules.


  13. The Judge did not go on to consider the decision under Article 8.  Nor
      is there any counter appeal by the claimant in that respect.


  14. On 1st August 2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal. This was on  the  basis  that
      the Judge appeared to have ignored the  provisions  of  s.85A  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  s2002  when  determining  the
      appeal. Accordingly, it was arguable that he erred by considering  the
      birth certificate which had not been produced until the appeal stage.


  15. Mr Bramble on behalf of the secretary of state produced  the  relevant
      immigration rules, which both parties accepted applied as at the  date
      of the decision in this case.


  16. He submitted that the Judge had misdirected himself in  law.  That  is
      because Appendix C to the Immigration Rules provides at  paragraph  13
      that funds will be available to the applicant only where the specified
      documents show  or,  where  permitted  by  the  Rules,  the  applicant
      confirms that the funds are held or provided by his parents  who  have
      provided written consent that the funds may be used by him to study in
      the UK.


  17. Paragraph 13B provides  that  if  the  applicant  is  relying  on  the
      provisions of paragraph 13(ii) above, he must provide the original (or
      notarised copy) of his birth certificate  showing  the  names  of  his
      parent(s).


  18. The claimant had accepted before the First-tier Tribunal Judge that he
      had not provided at the time a birth  certificate  although  that  was
      provided with the appeal documents. The Judge relied on this  document
      to find that the claimant had demonstrated that the funds in the  bank
      statement were available to him.


  19. It was therefore submitted that the Judge ignored  the  provisions  of
      paragraphs 13 and 13B of Appendix C and  also  'ignored  and  paid  no
      regard to' the provisions of s.85A of the 2002  Act  when  relying  on
      post application evidence.


  20. Mr Pasha, who represented the  claimant  before  the  Upper  Tribunal,
      submitted that the secretary of state had  sufficient  information  on
      record to prove the status of relationship of the claimant's father at
      the  time  of  the  impugned  decision.  He  submitted  that  in   the
      circumstances, that "attracted" the applicability of the  "flexibility
      policy".


  21. He submitted that the information provided and held by  the  secretary
      of state, namely the documents identified by the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge, was sufficient for the purpose  of  the  policy  and  the  Home
      Office "could require further evidence as per this policy" to  produce
      the birth certificate if  additional  confirmation  were  needed.  The
      secretary of state failed to follow "the spirit of flexibility policy"
      and  refused  the  application  without  exercising   her   "judicious
      discretion" which forced the claimant to go to the appeal hearing.


  22. He thus sought to uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge
      with regard to the flexibility policy. The decision of the  Judge  was
      rational, judicious and "meets the ends of natural justice".


  23. Mr Pasha submitted in  the  alternative  that  the  matter  should  be
      considered under Article 8.


  24. Mr Bramble in reply submitted that paragraph 245AA did not assist  the
      claimant. Under the clear wording of that paragraph, the claimant  was
      not entitled to the relief assumed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge to
      be available.


     Assessment


  25. It is common ground that the claimant  failed  to  produce  his  birth
      certificate showing the names of his parents, either at  the  date  of
      application or the decision.


  26. Paragraph 13 of Appendix C  to  the  rules  provides  that  funds  are
      available to the applicant only where the specified documents  confirm
      that the funds are held, and if relying on the provisions in paragraph
      13(ii), he must provide an original or notarised  copy  of  his  birth
      certificate showing the names of his parent(s).


  27. It is common ground  that  he  did  not  provide  the  relevant  birth
      certificate which is a specified document.


  28. The Judge paid no regard to the provisions of s.85A of the  2002  Act,
      prohibiting in this case any reliance on post application evidence.


  29. The Judge, however, "took into account"  the  Rodrigues  decision.  He
      found  that  as  the  appellant  was  providing   some   evidence   of
      relationship, the secretary of state should, if she had  doubts,  have
      exercised her "flexibility policy"  to  require  additional  documents
      from the claimant. This is '....not a case where such  documents  were
      not known to be in existence'. In the event, the Judge found that  the
      claimant had submitted relevant documents sufficient for him to  prove
      the relationship.


  30. Paragraph 245AA to the rules which applied at  the  relevant  time  is
      headed "documents not submitted with applications."


  31. It states that where part 6A (an application under  the  points  based
      system) or any appendices referred to in part 6A state that  specified
      documents must be provided, the secretary of state will only  consider
      documents that have been submitted with the application and will  only
      consider documents submitted after  the  application  where  they  are
      submitted in accordance with sub paragraph (b).


  32. Paragraph 245AA(b)  provides  that  if  the  applicant  has  submitted
      specified documents in which some of the  documents  in  the  sequence
      have been omitted, or a document is in the wrong format, or a document
      is a copy and not the original document, or where it does not  contain
      all of the specified information, the secretary of state  may  contact
      the applicant to request the correct documents.


  33. It is expressly stated in paragraph 245AA(c) that documents  will  not
      be requested where a specified document has not  been  submitted  (for
      example an English language certificate is missing).


  34. Paragraph 245AA(d) provides that if the  applicant  has  submitted  "a
      specified document" in the wrong format, or which is a copy  or  which
      does not contain  all  the  specified  information,  but  the  missing
      information is verifiable from  other  documents  submitted  with  the
      application,  the  website  of  the  organisation  which  issued   the
      documents or the website  of  the  appropriate  regulatory  body,  the
      application may be granted exceptionally, provided that the  secretary
      of state is satisfied that the specified documents are genuine and the
      applicant meets all the other requirements.


  35. In order for  paragraph  245AA  to  apply  it  is  required  that  the
      applicant must have submitted  "specified  documents"  which  contains
      some problem relating to sequence, format or which is only a copy,  or
      which does not contain all the specified information.


  36. Moreover, the application may  in  certain  circumstances  be  granted
      exceptionally; however, it is again provided that the  applicant  must
      at least have submitted a specified  document,  albeit  in  the  wrong
      format or is only a copy, etc.


  37. In this case, however, no such specified document,  namely  the  birth
      certificate, had been submitted. In the circumstances,  there  was  no
      duty on the  secretary  of  state  to  contact  the  claimant  or  his
      representatives to request the correct documents.


  38. It is also expressly provided at 245AA(c) that documents will  not  be
      requested where a specified document has not been submitted.  In  this
      case, such  document  had  not  been  submitted  and  accordingly  the
      secretary of state was not in terms required to request such document.


  39. I accordingly find that for the reasons given, the First-tier Tribunal
      Judge made a material error of law.


  40. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not go on to consider  the  position
      under Article 8, I am satisfied that even if this amounts to an error,
      it was not material in the circumstances. The appellant's appeal under
      Article 8 would have been bound to fail.


  41. Having found that there was a material error of law, I set  aside  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  re-make  it,  dismissing  the
      claimant's appeal.


     Decision


     The determination of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the  making  of
material      errors of law.   Having set aside that  decision,  I  re-make
it, dismissing the appeal.


     No anonymity direction made.


     I set aside the fee award in the amount of �80 made in favour  of  the
claimant
