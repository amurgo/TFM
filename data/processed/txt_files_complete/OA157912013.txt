                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1.    This matter comes before us for consideration  as  to  whether  or
    not there is a  material error of law in the determination by the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge  Wiseman)  promulgated  on  30  May  2014.   Judge
    Wiseman dismissed the appeal against a refusal of entry clearance as  a
    returning resident and under Article 8 ECHR in a decision made  by  the
    respondent on 17 July 2013.

      2.   The appellant whose date of birth is 26 June 1984  is  a  citizen
    of India.

Background

   3.     The brief background facts are as follows.  The appellant lived in
      the UK with leave from September 2002 until March 2012. In a  decision
      dated 13 December 2011 the  respondent  refused  indefinite  leave  to
      remain as  a  work  permit  holder  under  paragraph  134(iv)  of  the
      Immigration Rules, finding that the appellant had failed to  establish
      that he was paid the appropriate rate as specified in the occupational
      codes.  No appeal right arose from that decision as the appellant  had
      extant leave until 20 March 2012.


   4.    The appellant did not make a  further  application  to  extend  his
      leave but in March 2012 returned to  India  because   his  father  was
      seriously ill.  His  leave to remain in the UK  expired  on  20  March
      2012. His UK employment was terminated on  26  March  2012  as  he  no
      longer had leave to enter or remain.

   5.   The appellant issued judicial review proceedings in relation to  the
      decision of 13 December 2011, relying on the judgement in Alvi v  SSHD
      [2012] UKSC 33, issued on 18 July 2012. After permission was  granted,
      on 17 April  2013  the  respondent  made  a  new  decision  to  refuse
      indefinite leave to remain. No appeal right arose from that decision.

   6.   The appellant then  applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a  returning
      resident and on Article 8 grounds but this  was  refused  on  17  July
      2013. That decision is the subject of this appeal.

   7.   In summary, the appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal  and
      before us was that the decision of 13 December 2011  was  unlawful  to
      the extent that  the later decision to refuse entry clearance breached
      his right to a private life under Article 8.

   8.   The First-tier Tribunal accepted at  [40]  that  the  appellant  had
      established a private life in the UK. It also found from [40] to  [41]
      that it was not solely the respondent's decision of 13  December  2011
      that had  lead  to  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  but  also  the
      appellant's decision to return to India in March 2012.  Judge  Wiseman
      described that decision as "fatal"  at  [41],  such  that  "I  do  not
      believe that it can properly be said now that it is  disproportionate"
      to refuse entry clearance.

Grounds of appeal

   9. The written grounds of appeal were set out as follows.


10. Ground one - the Tribunal erred in failing  to  determine  whether  the
    Secretary of State had unlawfully refused indefinite leave to remain to
    the appellant in the decision dated 13 December 2011.

11. Ground two  -  the  Tribunal  misdirected  itself  in  terms  that  the
    Secretary of State  applied "what the law was thought to be"  when  she
    refused indefinite leave to remain.

12.   Ground  three  -  the  Tribunal  erred  by  treating  the  appellant's
    position resulting from the Secretary of State's historical legal error
    as being equivalent to that resulting  from  a  lawful  change  in  the
    Rules.

13.   Ground four - the Tribunal erred in  law  in  its  evaluation  of  the
    legal significance of the appellant's departure from the UK.


 Error of Law Hearing

14.  It appeared to us that, at heart, the grounds of appeal were  really  a
    challenge to the  approach  taken  to  or  weight  apportioned  in  the
    proportionality assessment by the  First-tier  Tribunal  regarding  the
    respondent's decision of 13 December 2011 to refuse indefinite leave to
    remain.

15.  Ms  Isherwood  helpfully  conceded  that  the  appellant  had,  indeed,
    suffered an historic injustice regarding the decision  of  13  December
    2011. The decision was unlawful  where the respondent had  refused  the
    application on the basis of occupational codes that did not  form  part
    of the Immigration Rules, such reliance being found to be  unlawful  in
    Alvi v SSHD [2012] UKSC 33.

16.  Ms Isherwood submitted,  however,  that  notwithstanding  the  unlawful
    decision made on 13 December  2011,  the  appellant  had  retained  the
    option to remain in the UK and to pursue a fresh application  but  had,
    shortly before his leave expired, decided to return  to  India,  albeit
    for urgent and compassionate reasons. Given that fact,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  could not be said to have erred in finding  the  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance to be proportionate.

Discussion and Decision

17.   Our  starting  point  is  that  the  respondent's  decision  dated  13
    December 2011 was unlawful for the reasons conceded by  the  respondent
    above.  We do not however find any material  error  in  the  Tribunal's
    failure to make a finding on the lawfulness of  that  decision  or  the
    approach taken to that earlier  decision,  in  what  we  accept  is  an
    unsustainable comparison at [35] of the Alvi principle to a  change  in
    the Immigration Rules  or  elsewhere  in  the  determination  of  Judge
    Wiseman.

18.   The  reasoning  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at  [37]  is  that  the
    acknowledged "past failures" were  not  sufficient  to  show  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was  disproportionate.  That  was  a
    decision open to the First-tier  Tribunal  where  the  unlawfulness  of
    decision of 13 December 2011  was  taken  into  consideration.  We  are
    satisfied that the Tribunal set out the appellant's  circumstances  and
    the legal  and  factual  issues  arising  correctly  at  [35-37].   The
    Tribunal was entitled to take into account at [41] the fact that it was
    only subsequent to his departure  from  the  UK  and  loss  of  his  UK
    employment that the decision in  Alvi  rendered  the  earlier  decision
    unlawful.  It was open to the Tribunal at [39] to place weight  on  the
    appellant being able to continue  family  life  in  India,  family  and
    private life falling to be considered cumulatively.

19.  For the above reasons we find that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  no
    material error of law and the determination shall stand.
