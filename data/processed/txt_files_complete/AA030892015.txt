For the Appellant:     Ms K Tobin, counsel, instructed by Theva, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original
Appellant in this determination identified as CL. This direction applies
to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to comply with this direction
could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

   1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal on the grounds that  it
      was arguable that although the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  considered
      whether the appellant would be at risk of return to  Sri  Lanka,  more
      was needed in the assessment of the potential risk on return in  terms
      of an appraisal of the background material submitted and  relied  upon
      by the appellant.


   2. The First-tier Tribunal made the following findings:


    . The appellant was born on [ ] 1981 and is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.  He
      is Tamil and a Christian. He arrived in the UK on a student visa  23rd
      September 2009 travelling  on  his  own  passport.  His  student  visa
      expired on 1st March 2011. He did not leave the UK. He claimed  asylum
      on 1st September 2014.
    . He joined the LTTE in  2002  and  underwent  initial  training  for  3
      months.  He  worked  in  the  finance  section  until  December  2002.
      Thereafter he studied until 2009 during which time his activities  for
      the LTTE were minimal although on three  occasions  between  2003  and
      2004 he  accompanied  former  LTTE  members  to  Colombo  for  medical
      treatment - during the ceasefire. He also assisted the LTTE from  time
      to time collecting and delivering a supply of  medicine  between  June
      2006 and August 2007.
    . The appellant did not enrol on his accountancy  course  at  University
      because the LTTE told him to but because he decided  to  continue  his
      studies after completing his HND.
    . The appellant had no LTTE contact after August 2007.
    . In February 2009 he moved to Colombo to continue his studies.
    . On 13th July 2009 he was arrested, detained for four days, beaten with
      wire and kicked in the groin. A distant relative procured his release.
      He was released with no reporting restrictions and without payment  of
      a bribe.
    . There is no arrest warrant.
    . He has attended some demonstrations in London.
    . When he arrived in the UK in October 2009  he  was  of  absolutely  no
      interest to the Sri Lanka authorities.
    . The authorities did not visit his mother and threaten  her  in  August
      2010.
    . The authorities have not been to his home looking for  him  in  August
      2010.
    . His brother in law was not arrested and is not required to sign on.
    . He has not played any significant role in the diaspora post conflict.
    . The authorities would not perceive him to be a threat to the unity  of
      Sri Lanka.

   3. In the grounds seeking permission to appeal it is accepted  on  behalf
      of  the  appellant  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge   correctly
      considered the factual matrix in the context of GJ  (post  civil  war:
      returnees) Sri Lanka) CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC) but contends the  judge
      failed to have adequate or any regard to  the  substantial  background
      material submitted covering the  period  February  to  December  2014,
      January to June 2015 and a report by the Bar  Human  Rights  Committee
      March 2014 titled "An unfinished war: Torture and Sexual  Violence  in
      Sri Lanka, 2009 - 2014". The appellant submits that  he  was  detained
      and ill-treated for four days in July 2009 on  suspicion  of  being  a
      member of the LTTE which was after the conclusion of the "final  war".
      The human rights situation has, it is submitted, declined;  there  has
      been an increase in "paranoia" of the Sri Lankan authorities about the
      resurgence of the LTTE and because the appellant has been out  of  Sri
      Lanka for a number of years in a  "diaspora  hotspot"  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judge was required to assess current risk in that context.


   4. Before me Ms Tobin  submitted  that  it  was  "Robinson  obvious"  and
      implicit in the grounds seeking  permission  that  the  appellant  was
      disputing the findings that  his  mother  had  not  been  visited  and
      threatened in August 2010, that his home had not been visited  looking
      for him in 2010 and that his brother in law had not been arrested  and
      required to sign on for the  last  five  years.  The  grounds  seeking
      permission state (where relevant):

                  3. The judge found the remainder of the appellant's  claim
                  incredible
                  .....
                  5. It is submitted that the judge  erred  in  law  in  her
                  assessment of risk on return.
                  6. In assessing the risk on return,  the  judge  had  twin
                  legal duties. A failure  to  adhere  to  either  of  these
                  duties would render her decision erroneous in law.
                  7. The first duty was to apply the extant country guidance
                  case.  As  can  be  seen   from   paras   42-45   of   the
                  determination, the judge did so.
                  8. The second duty.....  that  asylum  appeals  should  be
                  determined by reference to the position at the time of the
                  appellate decision.
                  9. It is submitted that the judge  failed  in  the  second
                  duty. The decision in GJ was  based  on  country  evidence
                  that the Upper Tribunal heard in February  2013,  however,
                  placed before the judge was substantial evidence about the
                  country situation in the 2 � years that had passed  since,
                  including evidence about the situation in Sri Lanka at the
                  date of hearing.
                  10. It is submitted that the judge erred in law in failing
                  to have any regard whatsoever to the  up-to-date  evidence
                  about the situation in Sri Lanka......
                  11. In terms of reconciling the two duties, the judge  was
                  not required to depart from the risk categories identified
                  in GJ. Rather, it  was  incumbent  upon  her  to  consider
                  whether the appellant fell within one of the defined  risk
                  categories in GJ views  through  the  prism  of  the  most
                  recent objective evidence.
                  12. The most recent objective evidence  before  the  judge
               showed that:
                  (i)    the  human  rights  situation  in  Sri  Lanka   had
                  continued to deteriorate throughout the  period  following
                  the "final war" in 2009;
                  (ii)  in 2014  the  Sri  Lankan  government  was  becoming
                  increasingly  vocal   both   domestically   and   on   the
                  international stage (in the  face  of  mounting  criticism
                  about its conduct of the final war) about the risk of  the
                  resurgence of the LTTE;
                  (iii)     in 2014 the Sri Lankan government had its  first
                  armed encounter with the LTTE since the end of the war  in
                  May 2009;
                  (iv)  in 2015 there  had  been  an  increasing  number  of
                  arrests at the airport of Tamils returning from abroad  on
                  suspicion of activity in support of  the  revival  of  the
                  LTTE.
                  13.  That evidence, which post dated the evidence in GJ by
                  some 2 � years, was plainly relevant .....
                  14. Against that backdrop, it was incumbent upon the judge
                  to ask herself whether,  on  the  basis  of  the  positive
                  factual findings that she made, the objective situation at
                  the date of the hearing was such  that  someone  with  the
                  appellant's profile  now  fell  within  one  of  the  risk
                  categories in GJ, in circumstances where he may  not  have
                  done so at the time when GJ was decided.
                  15. The judge's determination fails  to  demonstrate  that
                  she  considered  that  updated  objective   evidence   and
                  therefore her assessment of  risk  on  return  is  legally
                  flawed....




   5. In further grounds  seeking  permission  relied  upon,  the  appellant
      asserted:


                  ..... given the passage of time since the country guidance
                  case, the objective evidence which showed a decline in the
                   human rights situation and  increasing  paranoia  on  the
                  part of the Sri Lankan authorities about a  resurgence  of
                  the LTTE, plus the fact that the appellant had been out of
                  Sri Lanka for a number of years in a '  Diaspora  hotspot'
                  like the UK, it was incumbent upon FTTJ Herlihy to  assess
                  the current risk, namely whether the appellant was  now  a
                  person " who is perceived to have a  significant  role  in
                  relation to  post-conflict  Tamil  separatism  within  the
                  diaspora  and/or  a  renewal  of  hostilities  within  Sri
                  Lanka"....


   6. The skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the appellant states that
      it was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal judge that the appellant


                  "had managed to hide [that he was a member  of  the  LTTE,
                  had undergone  training  with  the  LTTE,  and  helped  to
                  transport LTTE members to Colombo] those  facts  from  the
                  GOSL in 2009 and  had  been  released  as  someone  of  no
                  interest at that point. It is relevant to  note  that  the
                  GOSL authorities were not, at that point  in  time,  aware
                  that the A had undertaken those roles  or  tasks  for  the
                  LTTE."


        At no point in the grounds seeking permission or in the skeleton is
        it asserted that the findings regarding the appellant's brother  in
        law's claimed arrest, detention, questioning  and  signing  on,  or
        regarding the visits to his mother or his  home  looking  for  him,
        were  disputed.  The  grounds  accept  that  the  judge   correctly
        considered the factual matrix in terms of GJ. There is no assertion
        that the factual matrix relied upon by the  judge  in  making  that
        assessment was incorrect or somehow in error in the  light  of  the
        background material that was before her.


   7. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is sufficiently wide to enable it  to
      consider, in an  international  protection  context,  whether  or  not
      applicable statutes, rules, policies  and  Convention  standards  have
      been considered - whether or not they have been expressly referred to.
      Ms Tobin relied upon her assertion that the  dispute  in  relation  to
      those findings was 'obvious'. The  Robinson[1]  doctrine  obliges  the
      Tribunal to consider a point that was not raised before  the  Tribunal
      once it has occurred to  the  Tribunal,  even  if  the  point  is  not
      'obvious' in the sense of having a strong prospect of success. But  in
      this case it is simply not arguable that it is 'obvious' that findings
      of the judge are disputed. The grounds  refer  to  the  core  positive
      findings made by the First-tier Tribunal judge and base the  error  of
      law assertions on those findings in the context of post GJ  background
      material. There is no assertion that some  of  the  findings  were  in
      error when considered in the context of post GJ material - a different
      point to that relied upon in the grounds and one which  has  not  been
      raised; nor is it obvious.


   8. Ms Tobin referred to a December 2012 UNHCR report.  This  report  pre-
      dates the Country Guidance  case  and  was  considered  by  the  Upper
      Tribunal in reaching its decision. The skeleton argument refers  to  a
      COIS report published since the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  which
      includes  reference   to   the   Authorities   reportedly   monitoring
      communications and activities of individuals known to be  critical  of
      the government, refers to an Amnesty Report published in February 2016
      which refers to many human rights challenges remain  and  to  a  March
      2016 TamilNet report that intelligence operatives are conducting fresh
      registrations of people and that regardless  of  their  release  after
      prolonged periods of detention and rehabilitation they are again being
      subjected to questioning. These documents were not before  the  First-
      tier Tribunal when the judge reached her decision and  the  judge  can
      hardly be criticised for failing to take account of material that  was
      not before her. In any event, even if that material had been published
      prior to the hearing/decision, the appellant is not,  on  the  factual
      findings of the judge, a person at serious risk of  being  persecuted.
      Although he was detained it was not a  lengthy  period  of  detention,
      albeit it was  violent  and  he  was  badly  mistreated.  He  was  not
      subjected to "rehabilitation".


   9. In so far as the material relied upon that  post  dates  GJ  Ms  Tobin
      relied upon the UNHCR report (which in fact pre dates GJ) which refers
      to cadres employed in  administrative  functions  being  at  continued
      potential risk and a number of specific reports that refer to the LTTE
      continuing to use its links in USA, Europe and Asia to  procure  arms.
      Ms Tobin referred to the appellant returning from a  diaspora  hotspot
      and that the background material together with  this  results  in  the
      appellant being at serious risk of being  persecuted.  The  First-tier
      Tribunal judge did not in terms refer to any particular  documents  in
      the 101 page background bundle submitted of post GJ reports - the last
      46 pages of which in fact pre-date GJ or the additional  supplementary
      bundle of documents  titled  "Objective  Evidence  -  2015.  Of  those
      documents Ms Tobin drew my attention to three  specific  documents  in
      the latter bundle. None  of  the  individuals  referred  to  in  those
      documents had the same background profile as the appellant.


  10. I was only provided with the summary of the report from the Bar  Human
      Rights Committee. Although my attention was not specifically drawn  to
      other documents that post dated  GJ  I  have  nevertheless  considered
      those documents. Many repeat the same information and are  generalised
      statements that do indicate a continued level of activity by  the  Sri
      Lankan authorities in pursuing the arrest of those whom  it  considers
      to be involved in the possible resurgence of  the  LTTE.  One  notable
      example is of the leader of the women's wing of the  LTTE  Sea  Tigers
      from 1997 to 2000 who fled to France in 2005. She  was  arrested  when
      she returned to France in February 2015 but from one report appears to
      have been  released  on  bail  in  mid  March  2015  with  signing  on
      conditions. That report refers to her as the main financial controller
      of the LTTE's diaspora global finance networks. There  are  references
      to Tamils returning from the Middle  East  being  arrested  but  scant
      information  about  what  happened  to  them,  how  long   they   were
      questioned/detained for or what their history was.

  11. This appellant's sister (who has been in the UK since  2001)  and  her
      family have returned on regular visits to Sri Lanka  with  no  claimed
      problems; his family who remain living there have not, on the  judge's
      findings, had any problems; although he would be returning from London
      there is nothing  in  the  post  GJ  background  material  that  would
      indicate this appellant with his factual matrix would be at real  risk
      of being persecuted. Although the judge did not specifically refer  to
      the more recent material,  she  has  confirmed  ([27])  that  she  has
      considered the background material. Although it would have  been  more
      complete for the judge to specifically refer to documents to which her
      attention was drawn, consideration of those documents would  not  have
      resulted in a different outcome.

  12. There is no material error of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.


      Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

     I do not set aside the decision

     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
