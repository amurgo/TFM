                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal came before me on 24 July 2014 when I found an error of law
    and I gave an extempore judgment giving my reasons.  I was particularly
    concerned that the one good point that I had identified in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's determination seemed to be wholly unsupported  by
    the evidence and I set aside the decision.  I was nevertheless  anxious
    to be fair to all the parties including the Entry Clearance Officer and
    I gave the parties time to produce further evidence.

 2. The terms of my summary judgement, subject to minor corrections) is set
    out below:

    1    This is an appeal by a citizen of Nigeria against  a  decision  of
         the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against  the  refusal
         of entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a husband.   The  Entry
         Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the appellant is  in  fact
         engaged in a subsisting marriage and the First-tier  Tribunal  came
         to the same conclusion.

    2.   This case I find illustrates the  extraordinarily  difficult  task
         that  sometimes  faces  the  Upper  Tribunal  under  the  guise  of
         determining whether or not there was an error of law.  I  will  put
         the sponsor out of her misery  immediately  by  saying  that  I  am
         persuaded there is an error of law and the case  has  to  be  heard
         again.

    3.   I will now give my reasons.  Firstly I make it plain that not  all
         of the grounds are equally impressive.  Mr Saunders summarised  the
         appellant's case by addressing the three points raised, and I agree
         with him that the first point is not made out.  It  was  said  that
         there was some uncertainty about the standard of proof  applied  by
         the judge but that I find is completely wrong.

    4.   At paragraph 11, which is a crucial paragraph, the judge  did  say
         that the evidence was not conclusive evidence that the marriage was
         subsisting and that is a dangerous  phrase  but  it  is  absolutely
         plain when the paragraph is read as a whole that although  he  said
         the evidence was not conclusive the test he applied  was  what  was
         probable and he found that it had not been shown the  marriage  was
         probably subsisting.  There is no point to be made there.

    5.   The third ground of appeal said  too  much  weight  was  given  to
         certain factors and Mr Saunders said quite correctly that weight is
         a matter for the judge and it is really only if the  decision  goes
         into the territory of being perverse that the wrong application  of
         weight can be said to show an error of law.  It was the appellant's
         case that the decision was  perverse  although  it  is  the  second
         ground about points not being taken that were  not  put  which  has
         caused me the greatest concern.

    6.   The Entry Clearance Officer's position is in some ways is easy  to
         understand.  The Entry Clearance Officer had no evidence of  recent
         cohabitation and was faced with a man who had a previous history of
         going into the United Kingdom on a visa as  a  fiancï¿½  and  leaving
         behind him a woman pregnant, and then with a  child,  to  whom  the
         appellant was not married. The Entry Clearance Officer was entitled
         to find that this was a poor reflection on the appellant's sense of
         responsibility and to reach the conclusion that he did.  The  Entry
         Clearance Officer did not know about that contact  that  had  taken
         place afterwards when the sponsor had  visited  the  appellant  and
         spent time with him.

    7.   The reasons given for the First-tier Tribunal's conclusion are the
         previous history coupled with, as explained at paragraph  10,  "the
         inconsistencies and conflicting evidence set out above".   That  is
         potentially a perfectly good reason but when I look at  what  those
         inconsistencies and conflicting evidence are it becomes a much less
         impressive point.

    8.   It was held against the appellant that as well as saying he wanted
         to see his wife in the United Kingdom he  said  he  would  see  his
         daughter.  I really cannot see how that is any indication at all of
         the status of his present marriage.  It is a plain fact that  there
         is a daughter of an earlier relationship.  It  is  not  an  unusual
         state of affairs for people  who  have  children  from  an  earlier
         relationship to preserve that relationship  even  though  they  are
         then married to a subsequent partner.  It really  is  not  a  point
         that should be taken against the appellant and I do not  understand
         why it was.

    9.   At paragraph 8 in the determination it is noted that the appellant
         said in answer to questions at interview that he cohabited with his
         wife from the time their relationship began in September 2010 until
         he left the United Kingdom in 2011 but that is not  what  the  wife
         said.  She  claimed  that  they  lived  together  between  May  and
         September 2011.   There  is  no  getting  away  from  it;  this  is
         difference in the evidence and it is something which the judge  was
         entitled to take into account although when the remark is  seen  in
         context with the rest of  the  evidence  it  is  not  such  a  very
         impressive point.

    10.  He did say in answer to earlier questions  that  the  relationship
         started in 2010 and in answer to the critical  question  that  they
         lived together from when the  relationship  began.   It  was  never
         expressly put to him that he meant to say that  they  cohabited  as
         soon as the relationship started.  It would have been helpful if it
         had been put because his meaning might  have  become  clearer.   He
         said in his statement that  they  lived  together  for  about  five
         months, which is about what the sponsor says.  That really  is  the
         only point of substance taken against him, and I cannot see that it
         justifies the conclusion that was reached.

    11.  At paragraph 7 the judge said that there was an inconsistency.  It
         was in a previous  application  dated  6  February  2012  that  the
         appellant had said that he was still  residing  with  his  previous
         partner when he was encountered by the authorities.  Well, if  that
         is right that is a version of events very different  from  the  one
         presented here.   The  problem  is  I  can  find  no  justification
         whatsoever in the papers for that assertion.

    12.  In an effort to give me confidence I asked Mr Saunders, who  could
         not find it in his papers, and I asked him to look in my papers and
         he could not find it either.  He  was  of  course  assisted  by  Ms
         Sharkey, who had a duty to help me as well as to help the court and
         they could not find it.

    13.  I have to say there is  nothing  before  me  that  justifies  that
         conclusion, and when I take that out the evidence that supports the
         conclusion reached is extremely skimpy.  Further it  is  a  finding
         reached on the inclusion of the matters listed at paragraph 7 which
         I find entirely unjustified and I cannot say  with  any  confidence
         that if the judge had not made the finding he did at paragraph 7 he
         would have reached the conclusion that he did. I just do  not  know
         but I do know that  the  conclusion  he  reached  was  without  any
         particularly  unchallengeable  or  telling  point  and  included  a
         thoroughly bad  point  at  paragraph  7.   I  cannot  look  at  the
         conclusion and say that but for the bad point  at  paragraph  7  he
         would have still reached the conclusion that he did.

    14.  It follows therefore that I have to conclude that on the  material
         before me the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  not
         safe, and I set aside that decision, and then I will have to decide
         what to do with it.

    15.  Looked at from the appellant's point of view I see why  he  wishes
         to go ahead today.  Ms Sharkey is ready and it is unattractive from
         her point of view for me to adjourn the case for the respondent  to
         try and repair the defect in the case.

    16.  The fact is I am not here to please either party but  to  reach  a
         good decision that is fair  in  all  the  circumstances  and  I  am
         concerned that the judge may have  had  a  proper  reason  for  his
         findings in paragraph 7 and I am going to adjourn the case  now  so
         that further evidence can be produced on another occasion.  It will
         remove an area of doubt one way or the other.

    17.  The only direction that I give is that any party wishing  to  rely
         on any evidence not presently before the Tribunal should  serve  it
         on the other party no later than seven days before the hearing.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer has produced some further evidence  in  the
    form of on earlier "Reasons For Refusal Of  Entry  Clearance"  which  I
    have read.  I do not find that  it  is  of  any  assistance  whatsoever
    beyond confirming what we knew already, namely that there had  been  an
    earlier unsuccessful application.

 4. It is an irony that the one thing that  concerned  me  because  it  was
    completely unsupported by the evidence is  now  in  fact  supported  by
    evidence coming from the appellant himself who need  not  have  made  a
    statement at all but did and he explains that  in  fact  he  was  still
    living in the same house as his former partner  when  his  relationship
    with the present partner started but  it  was  an  unhappy  arrangement
    after the relationship had died and before they were able  to  organise
    their affairs to separate.

 5. I know from when I used to practise in the family courts that it is  by
    no  means  unusual  particularly,  if  I  may  say  it  without   being
    disrespectful, amongst the  less  well-off  members  of  society,  that
    people have to stay in the same house albeit unhappily and I do not see
    that this is the crushing point  against  the  appellant  that  it  was
    thought to be.  It is not  evidence  that  the  relationship  with  the
    present partner is a sham and that he just wants to get  to  his  first
    partner which was the concern.  It is just evidence that for a time the
    appellant and his former partner stayed in the same house.

 6. As Ms Sharkey said very fairly in her submissions, the case advanced by
    the appellant is not especially strong but it is all  the  points  that
    have to be made.  There is evidence of contact.  There is  evidence  of
    being to see each other.  All the things that you would expect to  find
    in the case of a couple who are committed to each other  but  separated
    by several thousands of miles is the evidence that is here.  None of it
    is compelling.  For example, I cannot look at the telephone  bills  and
    know with confidence that the  appellant  has  been  contacted  by  his
    sponsor but I can accept and do accept the explanation that  the  phone
    bills show the use of a cheap means of payment available through  Tesco
    in exactly the way that would be expected if the  sponsor  was  telling
    the truth and I think she was.  There was very little to put to her  in
    cross-examination.  Her further  evidence  merely  confirmed  that  she
    continued to be in a  close  relationship  and  although  it  is  post-
    decision evidence of marginal  value  the  fact  that  they  are  still
    together tends to be in support of the fact that they were together  at
    the material time.  It does not prove it but it points the right way.

 7. This is not a case where there is any good reason that I  can  see  for
    disbelieving the appellant.  There may be some points in the story that
    are not absolutely completely  tied  together  but  that  sometimes  is
    indicative of truthfulness rather than  rehearsal.   I  certainly  find
    that the essential points are made out, namely that the  appellant  and
    his partner are in frequent contact with each other as they  have  been
    since they separated by the appellant's return and  want  to  get  back
    together.

 8. I have been reminded  of  the  decision  of  this  Tribunal  in  Goudey
    (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC)  by  the
    President Mr Justice Blake with Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Juss.  This
    shows, if authority is needed, that once there is credible evidence  of
    commitment there is very little more if  anything  to  do  to  prove  a
    subsisting marriage and an intention to live together.  The evidence is
    there.  No proper reason has been given to go behind it and  find  that
    it is a sham.  It may be.  I do not have to be satisfied, so I am sure.
    On the balance of probabilities that the appellant's case is made  out.
    So, having set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  an
    earlier occasion I now allow the appeal.
