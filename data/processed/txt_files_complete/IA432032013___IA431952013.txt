    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr S Hosein a legal representative from E1
    Solicitors
    For the Respondent: Mr C Avery a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh.  They  are  husband-and-
         wife born on 8 December 1982 and 10 December 1990  respectively.  I
         will refer to him as the appellant and to her as his/the wife.  The
         appellant was given permission to appeal the determination of First-
         Tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands ("the FTTJ") who dismissed his  appeal
         against the respondent's decision of 3 October 2013 to curtail  his
         leave to remain in the UK as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  and  to
         remove  him  by  way  of  directions  under  Section  47   of   the
         Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The  wife  was  given
         permission to appeal the determination of the FTTJ  dismissing  her
         appeal against the  respondent's  decision  of  the  same  date  to
         curtail her leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the  dependent
         partner of a Tier 4 (General) Student and to remove her by  way  of
         similar directions.


      2. The appellants appealed against these decisions and  their  appeals
         were heard by the FTTJ 10 February 2014. He dismissed both  appeals
         under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.


      3. The appellants applied for and were granted permission to appeal to
         the Upper Tribunal. Their appeals came before Upper Tribunal  Judge
         Craig ("the UTJ")  who,  following  a  hearing  on  20  June  2005,
         adjourned in  order  to  enable  the  Presenting  Officer  to  make
         enquiries about the circumstances leading to  the  refusal  of  the
         appellants'  applications  to  establish  whether  there  had  been
         unfairness. The appeal came back before the  UTJ  on  29  September
         2014 when it became apparent that further enquiries  had  not  been
         made. The appeal was adjourned for the error of law hearing to take
         place. This came before me on 11 November 2014.


      4. Mr Avery informed me that no further enquiries had been made and no
         further information had emerged. The respondent's position was that
         there had been no unfairness and the main point in issue came  down
         to a dispute between the appellant and his  college  in  which  the
         respondent played no part. The respondent's position was that there
         was no error of law. He  provided  me  with  the  determination  in
         Marghia (procedural fairness) [2014] UKUT 00366 (IAC).


      5. Mr Hosein based the appeal on two points. Firstly,  the  respondent
         should have given the appellant 60 days in order  to  find  another
         college. Secondly, the fairness point: after  the  refusal  by  the
         respondent the appellant filed notice of appeal raising the 60  day
         point which the FTTJ should have but did not address.  The  closest
         the FTTJ got to this was in paragraph 4 of  the  determination.  In
         reply to my question, Mr Hosein accepted that the grounds of appeal
         to the Upper Tribunal contained an extract from  an  unrelated  and
         irrelevant determination which should be deleted.


      6. The chronology is as follows. On 26 March 2013 the appellant's  CAS
         was  assigned.  On  27  March  2013  the  appellants   made   their
         applications. These were accompanied by the CAS showing payment  of
         the full fee of �2500. The appellant's course was due to  start  on
         22 April 2013. He was not permitted to start this course before his
         application was approved. The appellant's application was  approved
         and he received his residence card on 17 June 2013. He was  granted
         leave for a period expiring on 25 August 2014. At this point he was
         entitled to start his course. On 18 June 2013 the college  informed
         the respondent that the appellant had failed to start studying with
         them. The appellant was not informed of this and he did not  become
         aware of it until he  received  the  curtailment  letter  from  the
         respondent on 3 October 2013.


      7. On 6 August 2013 the appellant  was  asked  for  and  paid  a  �250
         enrolment fee to the college. They also asked him for �500 which he
         did not pay because he considered that he had already paid all that
         had  been  agreed.  I  asked  Mr  Hosein  whether  there  was   any
         explanation for the apparent delay on the part of the appellant  as
         to why he did not attempt to start on his  course  as  soon  as  he
         received the residence card on 17 June 2013. It appeared  that  the
         next step he had taken in relation to the  college  was  not  until
         about 6 August 2013 and he had  never  commenced  his  studies.  On
         instructions, Mr Hosein said that the appellant had tried to  start
         on his course in August 2013  but  had  not  done  so  because  the
         College had demanded a payment which in  his  view  they  were  not
         entitled to. The appellant  relied  on  the  authorities  of  Patel
         (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT  00211
         (IAC) and Naved (Student - fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT
         14 (IAC).


      8. Mr Avery submitted that the appellant had misinterpreted rule  323A
         of the Immigration Rules ("(3) leave is to be varied such that when
         the variation takes effect the migrant will have leave to enter  or
         remain  and  the  migrant  has  less  than  60  days  extant  leave
         remaining"). Firstly, this did not cover the appellant's  situation
         and secondly, it  did  not  require  the  respondent  to  give  any
         additional period, merely gave her a discretion to do so.


      9. Mr Avery  argued  that  neither  the  grounds  of  appeal  nor  the
         submissions identified any error of law. There was  no  explanation
         for the fact that the appellant had  not  attempted  to  start  his
         course between June and August 2013. The problems were between  the
         appellant and the college and did not involve the  respondent.  The
         respondent was entitled to assume that the notice from the  college
         that the appellant had not started his course was correct  and  she
         had no responsibility to make further enquiries. The respondent had
         not been responsible for any unfairness to the appellant. There was
         nothing to impose any obligation on her which she had  not  met.  I
         was asked to find that there was no error of law and to uphold  the
         determination.


     10. I reserved my determination.


     11. I find that the FTTJ was generous to the  appellant  in  concluding
         that he tried to register at the college in  June  2013  (paragraph
         11). On my reading of the evidence he did  not  attempt  to  do  so
         until early August 2013. The sentence in  the  appellant's  witness
         statement that "after that I could possibly go to  the  college  on
         18/6/2013, which I went" does not in  my  view  provide  any  clear
         indication that he was claiming to have gone to the college at  any
         time between receiving  approval  from  the  respondent  and  early
         August 2013. There is no indication that he did so anywhere else in
         his evidence. However, I will assume that the FTTJ was  correct  in
         concluding that the appellant went to the college  to  register  in
         June 2013 in considering whether there is any error of law.


     12. Paragraph 323A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  does  not  assist  the
         appellant. It deals with variation of leave, not  curtailment.  The
         appellant's course was due to start on 22 April 2013. If he had not
         commenced his studies by 18 June 2013 it is not surprising that the
         college informed  the  respondent  that  he  had  failed  to  start
         studying with them. It is  not  clear  what  action,  if  any,  the
         appellant took in relation to the  college  between  attempting  to
         register in June and early August when the college  asked  him  for
         more money. He paid an enrolment fee of �250 but it  is  not  clear
         why he was asked for a further �500 and whether the college was  or
         was not entitled to this. This was a dispute between the  appellant
         and the college in which the respondent played no part.


     13. The FTTJ was entitled to conclude that there was no unfairness  and
         that the respondent was under no obligation to give him  a  further
         period, of 60 days or any other period, in which  to  find  another
         college. Whilst the FTTJ did not refer to 60 days I find  that  the
         reference to "should have been given further time" in paragraph  11
         is a sufficient indication that the FTTJ addressed the  point.  The
         appellant's evidence was  that  he  had  made  no  effort  to  find
         somewhere else to study. The FTTJ was  also  entitled  to  conclude
         that there was no unfairness because the respondent took from about
         27 March 2013 when the applications were made to 17  June  2013  to
         determine them.


     14. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see no
         good reason to do so.


     15. I find that there is no error of law and I uphold the  decision  of
         the FTTJ
