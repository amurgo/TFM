                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: XX, instructed by YY
For the appellant:     Mr J Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Olushola Atanda Owolabi, date of  birth  28.10.75,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Devittie,  who  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse his application
    for leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK, pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 2.4.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on 20.5.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 10.7.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Devittie should be set aside.

 7. The grounds of application for permission to appeal submit, inter alia,
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law by  not  following  the
    approach set out in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) that an  article  8
    assessment  outside  the  Rules  should  be  carried  out  only   where
    compelling circumstances exist, and that following  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC
    720  (Admin)  an  appeal  should  only  be  allowed  where  there   are
    exceptional circumstances, where refusal would lead to an unjustifiably
    harsh outcome.

 8. However, in reality the appeal comes about because of an error  in  the
    wording  of  the  decision  part  of  the  determination.  In  granting
    permission to appeal, Judge Reid stated, "The  judge's  conclusions  in
    relation to the human rights limb of the appeal outside the  Rules  are
    set out clearly at paragraphs 15 to 18. The conclusions  summarise  why
    removal would be proportionate. It is unclear therefore why  the  judge
    summarised the decision as allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.
    The grounds disclose a material error of law."

 9. I am satisfied that the judge gave very careful  consideration  to  the
    appellant's case. I am satisfied that the decision in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules was properly made and I note that  the  claimant  has
    made no application to  appeal  that  part  of  the  decision.  I  have
    carefully considered the article 8 aspects. I note that the  judge,  in
    the claimant's favour, considered that the facts of the case  justified
    a consideration of the article 8 claim outside the  Immigration  Rules,
    having earlier referenced Gulshan at �7 of the determination.  However,
    it is clear from �17 and �18 that the judge was not satisfied  that  it
    would be unreasonable to expect the claimant and his spouse to continue
    family  life  outside  the  UK.  They  married  and   developed   their
    relationship at a time when his immigration status was precarious. They
    are not entitled to settle together in the  UK  just  because  that  is
    their choice. The judge carefully considered the IVF aspect of the case
    but found there was no evidence that the claimant's spouse would not be
    able to access such treatment from outside the UK.

10. Ultimately, the judge concluded that whilst there will be a measure  of
    hardship and inconvenience, the factors in favour of the  claimant  and
    the degree of interference engaging article 8 private and family  life,
    as well as that of his spouse, did not  outweigh  the  public  interest
    considerations, namely the legitimate aim of the state to  protect  the
    economic well-being of the UK through the  application  of  immigration
    control. In other words, the judge found the decision of the  Secretary
    of State proportionate to the claimant's and  his  spouse's  article  8
    private and family life rights. I find that is a conclusion  which  the
    judge was entitled to  reach  and  for  which  cogent  and  sustainable
    reasons have been given in what in almost all senses can be regarded as
    a careful determination.

11. Unfortunately, the judge then made what I consider to be no more than a
    slip at the very end of the determination in stating that the appeal is
    to be allowed on human rights grounds. It was an error of just one word
    in the whole of the determination. It  is  clear  from  the  fee  award
    decision that the judge intended to dismiss the appeal, stating "I have
    dismissed the appeal and therefore there can be no fee  award."  It  is
    unfortunate that this tiny but crucial  error  was  not  drawn  to  the
    judge's attention when it was  promulgation,  as  it  could  have  been
    corrected without the need of the Secretary of State to appeal.  It  is
    also unfortunate that it  was  not  corrected  under  Rule  60  at  the
    permission stage.

12. Mr Shoye sought to argue that the wording of the first sentence of  �18
    of the determination was contradictory to the rest  of  the  paragraph,
    but accepted that it is clear that the judge intended  to  dismiss  the
    appeal on both immigration and human rights  grounds.  The  wording  of
    that sentence involved the acceptance that there would be a measure  of
    hardship and inconvenience, but as held  in  previous  case  authority,
    some  hardship  and  inconvenience   does   not   render   a   decision
    unjustifiably harsh, or unreasonable, or disproportionate. He also told
    me that they would have sought to  appeal  the  decision  had  it  been
    dismissed. However, I am satisfied that  the  decision  dismissing  the
    appeal on all grounds was open to the judge  and  sustained  by  cogent
    reasoning. In the circumstances, there  was  no  merit  in  Mr  Shoye's
    submissions.

Conclusions:

13. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside. I am satisfied
    that the judge intended to dismiss this appeal on all grounds.

                    I set aside the decision, preserving all the findings of
                    fact and conclusions  other  than  the  wording  of  the
                    decision itself.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    both immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed
