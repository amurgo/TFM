Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Poland born on 3 March 1989  appeals,  with
    permission, against  the  determination  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Gurung-Thapa who in a determination promulgated  on  8  August
    2013 dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision to refuse  her
    a registration certificate as an EEA national under the  provisions  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

2.   The Secretary of State had refused to  grant  the  certificate  on  the
    basis that the appellant had not shown that she was  exercising  Treaty
    rights in Britain.  The appellant had claimed that she was working  for
    K & K Delivery Limited but telephone calls made to  that  company  were
    unanswered and it was therefore considered that the appellant  had  not
    shown that she qualified for leave to remain as a qualified  person  in
    Britain.

3.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant.  She noted  that  although
    the appellant had originally applied for a residence  permit  both  for
    herself and for her partner her partner's application had not succeeded
    because he was not  able  to  provide  a  relevant  document.   It  was
    confirmed to the judge by the appellant's representative that the  only
    appeal before her was the  appellant's  appeal  and  not  that  of  her
    partner.

4.    In the appellant's application form EEA1,  she  had  stated  that  she
    worked for K & K Delivery for sixteen hours  a  week  at  a  salary  of
    �421.55 per month and that her employment had started on 1 August 2012.
     In the appellant's witness statement the appellant  had  again  stated
    that she had started working on 1 August 2012.  However,  in  her  oral
    evidence the appellant had said that she had not started working  until
    December 2012 and when it was put  to  her  that  she  had  produced  a
    payslip for 30 November 2012 she had then said  that  she  had  started
    employment in September that year.  The judge placed weight on the fact
    that the appellant should have known when she  started  her  employment
    and found that that led her to conclude that she could not be satisfied
    the appellant had worked, and indeed still  was  working,  for  K  &  K
    Delivery.

5.   The judge went on to state there  was  no  other  documentary  evidence
    corroborating the appellant's employment.  Moreover,  the appellant had
    said in cross-examination that she had asked  her  boss  to  provide  a
    letter but he was busy and also that she had a contract  of  employment
    which she had lost.  She had not asked her boss for a  duplicate  copy.
    She did not know why there had been no response when her  employer  had
    been telephoned.  She had added that before she started working for her
    employer they were friends and that her employer had lived with her and
    her boyfriend in Ilford for two weeks.  She said that  she  had  always
    worked at home.  Her employer sold alcohol to shops in crates  and  she
    would pick up telephone orders from the shops.  She stated that she had
    not asked her boss to come to give evidence.  She went on to  say  that
    they were now no longer friends but she still worked for him.

6.   The judge considered that given the terms of the  refusal  it  was  not
    credible that the appellant would not have asked her employer  to  give
    evidence and her conclusion was that the appellant was not employed  as
    claimed and therefore was not exercising treaty rights.

7.   Grounds of appeal asserted that the decision was unreasonable and  that
    there were no clear findings of fact.  The determination was  described
    as "at the very least objectionable".

8.   The grounds added that the judge had been wrong to state there  was  no
    other documentary evidence to corroborate the  appellant's  employment,
    referring to the appellant's P45 in the bundle of documents lodged.

9.   It was claimed that the judge was not entitled to reach the  conclusion
    that she had in that she had relied on only one discrepancy.

10.  In granting permission Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Brunnen  stated
    that apart from the fact that the judge had erred when she  had  stated
    there was no documentary evidence other than the appellant's payslip to
    support her claim to be in genuine employment when there was a  P45  in
    the bundle the other grounds submitted only amounted to a  disagreement
    with conclusions which the judge was entitled to make.

11.  At the hearing of the  appeal  before  me  the  appellant  appeared  in
    person.

12.  I pointed out at the beginning of the hearing that having gone  through
    the papers I considered that although the P45 had  not  been  submitted
    with the original application it had in fact been before the judge.  Mr
    Saunders stated that he accepted that the P45 had been before the judge
    but stated that the error in not mentioning the P45 was  not  material.
    He stated that all that the P45 showed was a leaving date from K & K of
    31 January 2013.  The appellant's daughter had been born on 22  January
    2013 and the appellant had indicated that she  had  been  on  maternity
    leave but had not specified for how long.  He stated that the  P45  did
    not resolve the lack of certainty in the appellant's oral evidence.

13.  I considered that,  given that the appellant was  not  represented  and
    that I had the grounds of appeal before me that it would be of  use  if
    Mr Saunders made his  submissions  first  to  give  the  appellant  the
    opportunity to reply as in that way she would understand the case which
    had had to be met.

14.  Mr Saunders referred to the three payslips which he stated were all  in
    identical terms notwithstanding the fact that it was asserted that  the
    appellant had been on maternity leave for part of the month of  January
    2013.  He stated that taking into account all the  documents  including
    the P45 all they served to show was the  disarray  in  the  appellant's
    evidence that she was working.   Moreover  the  payslips  were  not  in
    accordance with the evidence which had been given, given  the  date  of
    the appellant's daughter's birth.  The P45 did not resolve any  of  the
    initial concerns.   The  absence  of  a  letter  from  the  appellant's
    employer and the contract were material issues.   He  therefore  stated
    there had not been any material error of law in the conclusions of  the
    judge.

15.  The appellant replied that she had had no  difficulties  when  she  had
    had the baby on 22 January and had been able to work on with  the  same
    hours.  She asked if her employer was present could he  give  evidence.
    her employer,  Mr Ghulam Muhammad  Khakwani  then  gave  evidence.   He
    stated that the appellant had started working for him in May  2012  and
    had finished on 31 January 2013 returning to work on 1 April 2013.   He
    referred to a contract for the appellant showing that  she  was  to  be
    paid �429 each month for sixteen hours' work and he stated that no  tax
    or national  insurance  was  deducted.   This  was  an  issue  for  his
    accountant.  He stated that the appellant remained working for him.  He
    would do the  deliveries  and  she  would  answer  the  telephone.   He
    referred to his accounts which he had brought with him.   I  asked  him
    how many employees he had.  He stated that he had one employee.  I  put
    to him that the accounts showed that the wages  of  his  employee  were
    �3,987 for the year to 31 May 2013  and  his  salary  during  the  same
    period had been �5,293 and that it appeared therefore odd that he would
    need to employ an employee to answer the phone or indeed that he  could
    afford to do so when his own earnings were so small.  He said  that  he
    was a delivery man and it was difficult for him to  attend  the  phones
    and drive as well.

16.  In cross-examination by Mr Saunders  he  stated  that  he  had  limited
    leave to remain as he had had a child with an EEA national.  He  stated
    that he had lived in the same house as the appellant for one and a half
    months starting in September 2012 after he had had an argument with his
    wife.  He was then asked when he had started the business and  he  said
    that he had started it in May 2011.

17.  It was pointed out to him that the registered office for  the  business
    appeared to have changed and he said that this was because his wife had
    started returning post sent to his home address because she was  angry.
    Again he was asked when he had started the business and he said that he
    started in 2012.  It was put to him that he had just said the  business
    started in 2011 and he then said that he had not  started  living  with
    the appellant until September 2012 and  gave  the  reason  why  he  had
    changed the registered address of the company to that of the  appellant
    and said that that had remained the address of the registered office of
    the  company despite the fact that he had then returned  to  live  with
    his wife.

18.  Mr Saunders asked him if he had a mobile phone and he replied  that  he
    paid half of the appellant's mobile phone bill.

19.  He was then asked where he now lived and said that he lived at 35  Blad
    Court in Romford but had been living at the address at 34  Elgin  House
    when he had set up the business and emphasised that he had been trading
    since May 2011.

20.  It was put to him that in her witness statement the appellant had  said
    that the business had ceased training on 28 February 2012 and  he  said
    that he did not know why the appellant had said that.  He said that his
    business was struggling as it was hard to get work here.

21.  Mr Saunders summed up by  stating  that  the  evidence  was  completely
    inconsistent and it was simply not  credible  that  the  appellant  was
    employed here.

22.  In reply the appellant submitted that she was working and  she  had  no
    idea why she was not believed as she had all relevant  evidence  -  she
    had changed her solicitor because he had made mistakes.

23.  I have considered all the evidence before me as I  consider  that  that
    is a necessary exercise in order to decide whether  or  not  the  error
    (which Mr Saunders accepted) made by the judge in not referring to  the
    P45 was material.

24.  I have come to the conclusion that the error  is  not  material  and  I
    therefore do not set aside the decision of the judge.

25.  My reason for doing this is that although there is a certain amount  of
    documentary evidence placed before me and indeed was before  the  judge
    there are so many inconsistencies in that evidence that, taken with the
    evidence of the appellant and her  claimed  employer  I  find  that  no
    weight can be placed thereon: I consider that I can place no weight  on
    the documentary evidence.

26.  It is the appellant's evidence, set out in her witness  statement  that
    she was employed "as a receptionist" with K &  K  Delivery  Limited  in
    August 2012.  The appellant's own evidence before  the  judge  in  that
    regard was inconsistent.  There is no evidence that she was employed at
    that stage.  The first payslips for the appellant  covers  the  periods
    November and December 2012 and January  2013.   Her  P45  is  dated  31
    January 2013.  Further payslips refer to the period  April,  May,  June
    2013.  However, it is of note that none of the  payslips  nor  the  P45
    show any tax or national insurance  being  deducted  and  there  is  no
    indication that either the P45 was submitted to the tax authorities  or
    that  there  has  been  any  official  recording  of  the   appellant's
    employment.  Moreover the appellant's bank statements do not appear  to
    have any entries in the sums of �429.17 corresponding to the sums which
    are shown on the payslips which had been lodged.  I therefore place  no
    weight on the payslips and the P45 - and  not,  of  course   that   the
    reality is that only photocopies have been provided.

27.  Moreover,  I have considered other factors relating to the  appellant's
    employment.   She  states  that  she  works  from  home  answering  the
    telephone.  For this she appears to have been paid in the  year  to  31
    May 2013 �3,987, that sum, of course, including  a  period  it  appears
    when she said that she  was  on  maternity  leave  although  again  her
    evidence in that regard was confused in  that  she  said  that  as  she
    worked from home she did not need to take  maternity  leave.   However,
    the reality is that in that period her employer's  salary  was  �5,293.
    It is simply not credible that a man with a business with a turnover of
    �29.205 a year and a gross profit of �15,166 would pay a  receptionist,
    sitting in her own flat, 80%  of  his  own  pay  and  given  the  small
    turnover there seems no reason why Mr Khakwani required a  receptionist
    and could not have dealt with calls on his own mobile phone.
28.    I have also considered the employment agreement  which  is  dated  30
    July 2012.  That is  a  document  in  pro  forma  terms  and  given  Mr
    Khakwani's lack of fluency  when  speaking  English  I  simply  do  not
    consider that he could have drafted it let alone could  understand  the
    terms  thereof.   Moreover,   Mr  Khakwani's  evidence   was   somewhat
    surprising particularly with regard to the issue of the changes in  the
    registered office of his company and the fact that he left the  address
    of the registered office of the company at the appellant's flat when it
    appears he  returned  to  his  wife.   Again  there  are  discrepancies
    regarding the addresses where he lives as he now states that  he  lives
    in Blad Court rather than the original address given of 34 Elgin  House
    in Romford.  I should add that there was  the  further  discrepancy  in
    that the appellant stated that  K  &  K  Delivery  Limited  had  ceased
    trading at the end of January 2013 and had started up  again  in  April
    that year when that fact was denied by Mr Khakwani.

29.  The burden of proof lies on the  appellant.   It  is  for  a  judge  to
    assess the evidence submitted.  I do not  consider  that  the  evidence
    which I have seen and heard discharges the burden of proof to show that
    the appellant was at the time of the decision exercising Treaty  rights
    in Britain.

30.  Having considered all the  evidence  I  conclude  that  the  judge  was
    correct to be sceptical when she considered the evidence given  to  her
    and that reliance on the discrepancies in the documentary evidence  and
    in the appellant's evidence to her was sufficient for her to reach  her
    conclusions. The fact that she omitted the consideration of the P45 - a
    photocopy document which was not submitted to the tax authorities - was
    not a material error.  I therefore find, as I have  stated  above  that
    the decision of the judge dismissing this appeal shall stand.

31.    This appeal is dismissed.
