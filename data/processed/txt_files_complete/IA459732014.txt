                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr N Biggs, instructed by Universal Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Amran Ahmed, date of birth 20.10.84,  is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Khan promulgated 3.6.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision  of
    the Secretary of State dated 30.9.14  to  refuse  his  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules, on
    the basis of compassionate circumstances and article 8 ECHR private and
    family life.  The Judge heard the appeal on 14.5.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.9.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.10.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find no material error of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as would require
    the decision of Judge Khan to be set aside.

 6. It  is  clear  from  the  grant  of  permission  that  Judge  Nicholson
    considered there to be arguable merit in the principle ground of appeal
    that the decision  of  Secretary  of  State  relying  in  part  on  the
    suitability  requirement  of  S-LTR  2.2(a)  of  Appendix  FM  of   the
    Immigration Rules was in error for the reasons set out in  �24  of  the
    grounds of application for permission to appeal.  The  application  had
    been refused under Appendix FM because, according to �9 of the  refusal
    decision, the appellant did not meet the  suitability  requirements  by
    submitting a false document, a TOIEC English language  certificate,  in
    relation to the application. Mr Biggs submitted that as the certificate
    had been submitted not in relation to the application  the  subject  of
    the appeal but a previous application, S-LTR2.2(a) could not  apply  to
    this application. However, as Mr Staunton  was  able  to  explain,  the
    application was made on  23.9.13  and  the  covering  letter  cited  at
    section B the TOEIC certificate.  As  the  appellant  only  retook  the
    English language test in 2014, the only certificate in existence at the
    date of the application was that issued  resulting  from  the  test  of
    20.10.11, which had been invalidated because of anomalous test results.
    It follows that  he  had  submitted  a  certificate  with  the  present
    application, which the Secretary of State considered had been  obtained
    by deception. It was, therefore, entirely  open  to  the  Secretary  of
    State  to  rely  on  S-LTR2.2(a)  in  refusing  the   application.   In
    consequence of Mr Staunton's submissions, Mr Biggs accepted  that  that
    ground of appeal  fell  away.  Mr  Biggs  also  accepted  that  if  the
    appellant fails under the suitability requirements Appendix FM proceeds
    no further and he cannot meet the requirements of the Rules  for  leave
    to remain as a spouse.

 7. For the reasons set out below, I also find that the  remaining  grounds
    of appeal have no merit and disclose no material error of law.

 8. It is argued that the judge erred  by  failing  to  apply  the  correct
    burden and standard of proof in relation to the allegation  of  falsity
    in the submitted  test  certificate.  It  is  common  ground  that  the
    Secretary of State bore  the  burden  of  proving  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, and  with  cogent  evidence,  that  the  appellant  used
    deception in either obtaining the certificate or in submitting it  with
    his application. Mr Biggs submitted that the judge  failed  to  mention
    the correct burden and standard of proof. However,  at  �35  the  judge
    adopted  a  standard  of  proof  which,  whilst  erroneous,  was   more
    favourable to the appellant, stating  that  he  found  on  the  "higher
    balance of probabilities" that the Secretary of State  had  established
    that the appellant provided a false TOEIC certificate.  It  is  obvious
    that the judge was well aware that the  burden  of  proof  lay  on  the
    Secretary of State. In the circumstances,  and  having  regard  to  the
    decision taken as a whole, I reject the submission that  there  is  any
    material error in the burden and standard of proof adopted.

 9. I also reject the submission that the judge failed to provide  adequate
    reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence that  he  had  genuinely
    taken the English language test and finding in favour of the  Secretary
    of State on this issue. However,  any  fair  reading  of  the  decision
    discloses extensive reasons why the judge reached  the  conclusions  he
    did, rejecting the evidence of the appellant and his wife as  extremely
    vague and evasive, noting that he knew very little about the nature and
    the content of the test and that his standard  of  spoken  English  was
    very weak.

10.  Mr Biggs also complained that the evidence relied on by the  Secretary
    of State was generic and that the judge failed to take into account the
    expert evidence submitted on behalf of the appellant to the effect that
    there can be false positives in the analysis of the  testing.  This  is
    now a very well worn path familiar to the Upper  Tribunal  and  it  has
    been held on numerous occasions that the now-familiar  evidence  of  Ms
    Collings and Mr Millington is admissible. Mr Staunton also  pointed  to
    the recent Upper Tribunal's Judicial  Review  decision  of  R  (on  the
    application of Gazi) v SSHD (ETS - judicial review) IJR [2015] UKUT 327
    (IAC), in which, at �35, the President concluded that the evidence "was
    sufficient to warrant the assessment that  the  Applicant's  TOEIC  had
    been procured by deception and, thus, provided an  adequate  foundation
    for the decision made  under  section  10  of  the  1999  Act."  Whilst
    accepting that  the  evidence  may  not  be  infallible,  the  impugned
    decision of the Tribunal under  challenge  in  Gazi,  relying  on  that
    evidence, was made with the hallmarks of care, thoroughness, underlying
    expertise and sufficient reliability. In fact, the expert report relied
    by the appellant was more generic than the evidence relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  which  included  the
    witness statement of  Mr  Michael  Sartorius,  dated  11.5.15,  drafted
    specifically  with  reference  to  this  appellant's  English  language
    certificate. Taken together the evidence adduced by  the  Secretary  of
    State amounted to cogent evidence, more than justifying the  conclusion
    of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  that  the  appellant  had  exercised
    deception, as claimed by the Secretary of State.  It  is  perhaps  also
    significant that the appellant had  used  the  invalidated  certificate
    obtained in 2011 in both an application made in October  2011  and  the
    present application made some two years later in September 2013.

11. Considering the decision as  a  whole,  bearing  in  mind  the  judge's
    statement at �30 that all the evidence and submissions had  been  taken
    into consideration before making the decision in  the  appeal,  I  find
    nothing to demonstrate that the decision was perverse,  irrational,  or
    based on inaccurate, inadmissible  or  irrelevant  evidence.  Mr  Biggs
    could point to no factual errors. The conclusions  of  the  judge  were
    ones which the Tribunal was entitled to  reach  and  for  which  cogent
    reasoning  has  been  provided.  In  essence,  the  grounds  amount  to
    disagreement with those conclusions. However, I find that it  was  open
    to the judge to disbelieve the appellant's evidence and to  prefer  and
    find persuasive the evidence relied on by the Secretary  of  State.  In
    the circumstances, no error of law is disclosed.

12. Despite the considerable length  of  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal, none of the other  grounds  of  appeal  have  any
    merit and amount to a disagreement with the findings and conclusions of
    the judge. Some of  those  grounds  and  submissions  run  contrary  to
    decided case law. For example, in respect of the proportionality of the
    decision to remove the appellant to Bangladesh �28 of the grounds seeks
    to rely on the appellant's English language ability  and  the  couple's
    financial circumstances. Whilst the public interest  considerations  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act state that it is in  the  public  interest
    that a person seeking to enter or remain in the UK  can  speak  English
    and is financially independent,  for  obvious  reasons,  those  factors
    cannot  be  prayed  in  aid  to   the   appellant's   credit   in   any
    proportionality balancing exercise, as  held  in  AM  (S  117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).

13. I find that the article 8 ECHR private and family life  proportionality
    balancing exercise conducted by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  properly
    took all relevant factors  into  account,  as  set  out  in  particular
    between �36 and �42 of the  decision.  In  particular,  the  judge  was
    required to and did consider that the appellant came to  the  UK  as  a
    student and thus his status at all times  was  entirely  precarious  so
    that little weight should be given to any private life  he  established
    in the UK. Furthermore, he sought to remain in the UK  by  the  use  of
    deception. The judge considered the best  interests  of  the  child,  2
    years of age, and reached the conclusion that it was  not  unreasonable
    to expect the child alleged to be British by birth,  to  accompany  his
    parents  to  Bangladesh,  or  for  the  appellant  to  make  a   proper
    application for entry clearance from outside the UK.

Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of any material error of law such as to require the decision
    to be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has
been dismissed and the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
Secretary of State remains dismissed.
