                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction:


 1. The First-tier Tribunal has granted the Secretary of  State  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against a  decision  of  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal R Cooper who, following a hearing on 8 April  2016,
    allowed the appeal of Mr Cota  (hereafter  the  "claimant")  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State dated 2 March  2015  to  refuse  his
    application of 31 May 2012 for a residence card as confirmation of  his
    right to reside in the United Kingdom as the family member  of  an  EEA
    worker, a Ms Mihaela Arabol (the "sponsor").  The sponsor is a national
    of Romania, born on 11 September 1985. The decision was made under  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (hereafter  the
    "EEA Regulations").

 2. The judge found that the claimant did not pose a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society. She therefore allowed the appeal under the EEA Regulations.
    She did not  proceed  to  consider  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms
    (ECHR).

 3. The sole issue before me is whether the judge materially erred  in  law
    in reaching her finding that the  claimant  did  not  pose  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society.

Factual background

 4. I take the following background from the decision of the judge, at [5]-
    [11]. The claimant claims to  have  entered  the  UK  in  2006.  On  24
    December 2007, he was arrested (under the name of Koumas  Maruidas)  on
    suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He  was
    detained and served with form IS151A as an illegal entrant.  On  6  May
    2008, he  was  convicted  (in  the  identity  of  Koumas  Maruidas)  of
    possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply and sentenced  to  2
    years' imprisonment.

 5. On 22 August 2008, the Secretary of State is said  to  have  issued  an
    Exclusion Order against the claimant in the name of Koumas Maruidas and
    removed him to Albania. On 8 December 2009,  the  claimant,  using  the
    identity of Albert Cota, obtained a visit visa to  Ireland  purportedly
    to attend a conference. He travelled there on 9 December 2009. In early
    2010, he entered the United Kingdom.

 6. On 25 February 2012, the claimant married the sponsor. On or  around  1
    March 2012, he applied for a residence card as the  family  of  an  EEA
    National. That is the application which was the subject of the decision
    appealed against in the appeal before the judge.

The Secretary of State's decision:

 7. The  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  claimant's  application  under
    regulations 19(3)(b) and 21 of the EEA Regulations on the  ground  that
    the claimant had attempted to  obtain  leave  by  deception  whilst  an
    Exclusion Order was in force. The Secretary of State also  refused  the
    claimant's application under Article 8 of the ECHR.

The judge's decision

 8. The Secretary of State's  representative  was  unable  to  produce  the
    Exclusion Order before the judge.

 9. The judge found that no Exclusion Order could have  been  made  against
    the claimant personally under the EEA Regulations ([46]).  Her  reasons
    were that the claimant was not an EEA  national  at  the  time  of  his
    conviction and there was no indication that he was the family member of
    one. She said, at [49], that she did not find  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had demonstrated any basis to refuse the applicant's  application
    on the ground that he was subject to an Exclusion order or  Deportation
    Order.  The Secretary of State has not challenged these findings.

10. Under Regulation 17, the Secretary of State must issue a residence card
    to (amongst others) a person who is not an EEA national and who is  the
    family member of a qualified person. By regulation 17(8), regulation 17
    is subject to regulations 20(1) and 20(1A). The relevant provision  for
    the purposes of this appeal is regulation 20(1) pursuant to  which  the
    Secretary of State may refuse to issue a residence card if the  refusal
    is justified "on grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
    health or ...".  Regulation 21 applies to any EEA decision taken on the
    grounds  of  public  policy,  public  security  or  public  health.  It
    provides:


      "21 Decisions taken on public  policy,  public  security  and  public
    health grounds


      (1)  In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an  EEA  decision
             taken on the grounds of  public  policy,  public  security  or
             public health.


      (2)   A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.


      (3)   A relevant decision may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person
             with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15 except
             on serious grounds of public policy or public security.


      (4)   A relevant decision may  not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
            (a)   has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or
            (b)   is under the age of 18, unless the  relevant  decision  is
                  necessary in his best interests, as provided  for  in  the
                  Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child  adopted  by  the
                  General Assembly of the United Nations  on  20th  November
                  1989.


      (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of  public  policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply   with   the   principle   of
        proportionality;
            (b)  the decision must be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;
             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned   must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;
            (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or  which
                  relate to considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
                  justify the decision;
             (e)   a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
themselves justify the decision.


      (6)  Before taking a relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin.
    ..."

11. The evidence before the judge was that the  claimant  had  married  the
    sponsor in February 2012. Although the claimant's evidence was that the
    relationship had broken down, the judge noted that the decision  letter
    did not raise  any  concerns  that  the  marriage  was  a  marriage  of
    convenience ([67]). The judge noted  that,  although  the  couple  were
    separated, there was no evidence that they were divorced  or  that  the
    sponsor was no longer in the United Kingdom. The judge noted  that  the
    Secretary of State's  representative  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was
    exercising Treaty rights.

12. Accordingly, the judge turned to consider whether the claimant posed  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

13. I shall now summarise the judge's assessment of the case.

14. At [34] and [39]-[45], the judge considered the  Secretary  of  State's
    delay in  reaching  a  decision  on  the  claimant's  application.  She
    considered that "no cogent reasons have been put  forward"  to  explain
    why the Secretary of State took 3 years to make a  decision.  At  [34],
    she said that it appeared from the documents before her that a decision
    taken  in  December  2012  to  grant  the  claimant's  application  was
    subsequently cancelled in January 2013 and that the  file  appeared  to
    have been placed on hold pending enquiries from Beckett House and later
    in 2014 from the claimant. She  explained  her  reasons  at  [39]-[44],
    concluding, at [45] as follows:

            "45. I am satisfied from these documents that  although  shortly
             after the [claimant's] application was made in  2012  the  case
             for issuing him with a residence  card  on  the  basis  of  his
             relationship with Ms Arabol was made out, but that  from  early
             2013 until the decision in March 2015 there  was  awareness  of
             his conviction under an alias, and there was substantial  delay
             in a decision being reached."

15. The judge further stated at [47]-[49] as follows:

      "47.  On the basis of the GCID notes, I am satisfied that  Immigration
             Officers were aware back in December 2007 that Koumas  Maruidas
             was one and the same person as Albert Cota. I am also satisfied
             the Judge [in the claimant's criminal case,  His  Honour  Judge
             Denyer] was aware that notices had  been  served  by  the  Home
             Office (although it is not clear whether the  Judge  was  aware
             this was under a different name). I find  that  the  [claimant]
             was issued a notice to an illegal entrant in the name of Albert
             Cota.

      48.   I am satisfied from his evidence that the [claimant]  was  aware
             that he had been convicted, and that he had been  removed  from
             the UK in 2008 directly from prison to Gatwick airport.  Indeed
             in his witness statement he confirms  an  Exclusion  Order  was
             made against him.

      49.   It may be that Mr Cota  (or  Mr  Maruidas)  was  issued  with  a
             deportation order or was administratively removed in 2008,  but
             it may also be that he made a voluntary departure. On the basis
             of the evidence before me I do not find that the [Secretary  of
             State] has demonstrated any basis to refuse his application  on
             the grounds that he  was  subject  to  an  Exclusion  Order  or
             Deportation Order."

16. At [54]-[55], the judge considered the sentencing remarks of His Honour
    Judge Denyer of 6 May 2008 and noted, inter alia, that the claimant was
    sentenced on the basis that he was simply looking after  the  drugs  in
    question because of the position of  homelessness  in  which  he  found
    himself and that the sentence the claimant received was  on  the  lower
    end of the applicable range in the relevant Sentencing Guidelines.  She
    said that,  having  considered  the  guidelines,  she  found  that  the
    sentencing judge must have been satisfied that the claimant had  played
    a 'lesser role' and that the amount of the  Class  A  drug  seized  was
    relatively small. At the same time,  she  said  that  the  offence  was
    sufficiently serious that the  sentencing  judge  imposed  a  custodial
    sentence rather than a high level Community Order.

17. The judge then noted at [56] that  the  print  out  of  the  claimant's
    Police National Computer  information  indicated  that  Komas  Mavridis
    (date of birth 9 March 1980) was wanted in connection with  an  offence
    of burglary (for stealing two lawn mowers from an allotment).

18. The judge then said that, considering all of the evidence in the round,
    she did not find the claimant a credible witness. She gave her  reasons
    at [58]-[66], which read:

        "58.     When considering all of the evidence in the  round  I  did
             not find the [claimant] to be a credible  witness.  Although  I
             have borne in mind that the [claimant] was giving  evidence  in
             English, which is not his native language, I am satisfied  that
             he understood the questions he  was  being  asked  as  he  gave
             detailed  and  appropriate  answers  to  a  wide   variety   of
             questions,  even  at  times  when   different   subjects   were
             introduced. Although  at  one  stage  Mr  Lee  objected  to  Ms
             McKenzie asking  questions  of  the  [claimant]  regarding  his
             relationship with  Ms  Arabol,  on  the  grounds  that  he  was
             speaking in a  second  language  and  on  the  basis  that  the
             [Secretary of State] had had two and half  years  to  interview
             him about their relationship, I was satisfied that he was  able
             to understand, and was  able  to  articulate  himself  well  in
             English. He gave his answers to a  wide  variety  of  questions
             largely without hesitation.

        59.      The [claimant] in  cross-examination  admitted  to  having
             used the name Koumas Maruidas. He said  that  it  was  a  'joke
             name' and that he had only used it because  when  he  gave  his
             real name to the police at the time of his arrest they  laughed
             at it. He could provide no adequate explanation to Ms  McKenzie
             as to why he had not at  any  point  confirmed  either  to  his
             solicitor, the police or the Court that Koumas Maruidas was not
             his real name. When asked why he did not  tell  the  judge  his
             name was Albert Cota, the [claimant] did not initially  answer,
             although he confirmed he understood the  question.  His  excuse
             for not telling the Judge his real name was that he  was  never
             asked. When it was put to him that the  sentencing  was  not  a
             joke, and that a Judge would not have asked about his real name
             as they thought Koumas Mariudas was his  name,  the  [claimant]
             responded, 'I didn't know to be honest, it's the first time.  I
             didn't know these things going to be so serious.' When asked to
             clarify what he meant by  serious,  the  [claimant]  responded,
             'name thing or conviction', from which I infer that he did  not
             take deceiving the police or the Court seriously.

        60.      I am satisfied, and find, that the [claimant] deliberately
             used an alias at  the  time  of  his  arrest  with  a  view  to
             deceiving the police and the criminal justice system, and  that
             he considered this as some kind of joke.

        61.      The [claimant] confirmed in  re-examination  that  he  was
             able to read  English.  In  relation  to  his  application,  he
             confirmed he had completed it himself in English.  He  did  not
             remember answering question 8.1 or ticking the box  to  say  he
             had no criminal convictions, he thought it referred  to  family
             members.

        62.      When Ms McKenzie asked him to look at the  application  he
             had made in 2012, he  was  able  to  find  his  way  round  it,
             appeared to be reading  the  document  and  was  able  to  read
             question 8.1 (which  states  'Do  you  or  any  family  members
             included in this application have any criminal  convictions  in
             the UK or any other country (including traffic offences) or any
             civil judgments made against you').

        63.      In cross-examination when asked  why  he  ticked  the  box
             saying 'no' he said, 'I don't have'. When asked to clarify what
             he meant, he said he did not have any family members  who  had,
             and continued, 'I thought  it  said  do  you  have  any  family
             members. Doesn't make sense. I  can't  say  yes  or  no  -  you
             already know the name'.  He  said  he  thought  it  was  asking
             whether  any  brothers  or  sisters  had  a   conviction.   The
             application  form  concludes  with  a  declaration  that   'the
             information I have given in this form is complete and  is  true
             to the best of my knowledge' which the [claimant] signed. I  am
             satisfied when looking at the totality  of  the  evidence  that
             this explanation is without  merit.  Despite  the  [claimant's]
             assertion in  his  witness  statement  that  he  has  not  used
             deception (because he applied in his correct name  and  he  had
             never intended to deceive the Home Office - paragraphs  11  and
             12), I am satisfied and  find  that  the  [claimant]  knowingly
             failed to declare his conviction with an intention  to  deceive
             the [Secretary of State] into granting him a residence card.  I
             am satisfied he did not declare the conviction because he  knew
             it was in a false name.

        64.      The [claimant] was also asked how he had come to  the  UK.
             He claimed that he had not had to show his passport at any time
             between boarding the coach in Ireland,  boarding  or  embarking
             from the ferry and  arriving  in  London,  and  was  unable  to
             provide details of his journey (except  that  he  had  taken  a
             coach from Dublin to London).

        65.      The [claimant] was pressed about what he  had  done  since
             his arrival in the UK. He confirmed he had not done any courses
             (as he 'didn't know it was allowed'). He denied he had  worked,
             saying he had been financially supported by his friends and his
             wife since 2010. I found the latter somewhat  surprising  given
             that on his own evidence he and Ms Arabol had separated  in  or
             around 2014 and he was now purportedly in another  relationship
             with a British Citizen.

        66.      When considering all of the evidence in the round, I  find
             that the [claimant] deliberately used deception  to  arrive  in
             the UK in 2006. He used a false name at the time of his  arrest
             or  shortly  thereafter,  and  continued  to  use  that   alias
             throughout  the  course  of  the   criminal   proceedings   for
             possessing a Class A  drug  with  intent  to  supply.  He  was,
             therefore,  sentenced  in  that  name.  I  also  find  he  used
             deception on his application form made in  2012  by  confirming
             that he did not have a conviction when  he  knew  that  he  did
             (albeit in the name of Koumas Maruidas). I  am  also  satisfied
             from the visa appearing in his passport that he had obtained  a
             three-month visit visa to Ireland  on  8  December  2009  valid
             until 8 March 2010 (in the name of  Albert  Cota),  but  rather
             than returning to Albania after the conference he was  said  to
             have been attending, he entered the UK without passing  through
             or declaring himself to  immigration,  whether  unwittingly  or
             not. I am satisfied that had enquiries been made by immigration
             officers of Mr Cota's immigration record in 2010, they may well
             have discovered his alias and conviction  given  the  documents
             appearing at  pages  A:29-30.  I  am  also  satisfied  that  he
             remained in the UK without having leave to do so in  breach  of
             the  immigration  rules  and  without  making  any  attempt  to
             regularise his stay between 8 March 2010 and 1 March 2012."

19. Having made her observations (at [67]-[69]) that the Secretary of State
    had not suggested that the claimant's marriage to  the  sponsor  was  a
    marriage of convenience, that there was no evidence that  the  claimant
    and the sponsor were divorced or that the sponsor  was  not  exercising
    Treaty rights and that the  Secretary  of  State's  representative  had
    accepted that the sponsor  was  exercising  Treaty  rights,  the  judge
    turned to consider the submission advanced on the Secretary of  State's
    behalf that the claimant's attempt to obtain leave by  using  deception
    whilst being subject to an Exclusion Order was  itself  sufficient  for
    his application for a residence card to be  refused.  He  had  shown  a
    total disregard for the laws of the United Kingdom.

20. At this juncture, the  judge  reminded  herself  of  the  judgments  in
    Commission v the Netherlands Case C-50/06 and SSHD v Dumliauskas [2015]
    EWCA Civ 145 as follows:

        "70.     I remind myself that in Commission v the Netherlands  Case
             C-50/06 the Commission said that measures taken on the  grounds
             of  public  policy  or  public  security  were  to   be   based
             exclusively on the conduct of the  person  concerned.   Article
             3(2) specified that previous criminal convictions were  not  in
             themselves to constitute  grounds  for  taking  such  measures.
             They could be  taken  into  account  only  in  so  far  as  the
             circumstances which had given  rise  to  that  conviction  were
             evidence of personal conduct constituting a present  threat  to
             the requirement of public policy.

        71.      I remind myself also that in Secretary of  State  for  the
             Home Department v Arturas Dumliauskas, Lukasz  Wozniak  and  ME
             (Netherlands) [2015] EWCA Civ 145 the Court of Appeal (at �  40
             and 55) said if there is no real risk of reoffending  then  the
             power to deport nationals of other Member States on the grounds
             of public policy or public security does not arise."

21. The judge then applied the guidance in  these  judgments  at  [72]-[76]
    which read:

      "72.  Whilst I accept that the [claimant] has a  conviction  for  what
           was a very serious offence,  namely  possession  of  cocaine  (a
           Class A drug) with intent to supply, there is no evidence before
           me  indicating  a  propensity  to  re-offend.  I  have  no  pre-
           sentencing reports,  no  OASys  report,  and  I  have  not  been
           provided with the PNC report for Albert Cota (if any).  Nor  did
           the [Secretary of State] in her decision set out her reasons for
           concluding that the [claimant]  posed  a  genuine,  present  and
           sufficiently serious threat to  the  fundamentals  interests  of
           society. Indeed she does not seem to have turned her mind to the
           test that should be applied.

      73.   The sentence he received was on the lower end of the  scale  and
           the Judge found the  offence  had  been  committed  because  the
           [claimant] was homeless and was offered the  use  of  a  car  in
           exchange for the keeping of the cocaine. I find that there is no
           evidence that he has been convicted of  further  offences  since
           2008, although there does appear to be some suggestion  that  in
           the name of his alias he is was being sought in connection  with
           a burglary in 2013 but this was not put  to  the  [claimant]  or
           pursued by Ms McKenzie.

      74.   The only matter weighing in  the  balance  is  the  [claimant's]
           willingness to use deception, including deception  expressly  in
           connection with the immigration law of the UK. This is a concern
           as it may indicate a propensity to engage in other criminal acts
           of dishonesty.

      75.   I have also considered whether there  are  other  matters  which
           might demonstrate being in the UK might be  more  beneficial  in
           terms  of  preventing  the  likelihood  of   further   offending
           behaviour, but I find there are none.  Although  the  [claimant]
           says he is  in  a  relationship  with  a  British  national  and
           involved with her two children, that they are his 'motivation to
           remain a dutiful and law abiding citizen',  no  further  details
           are provided. He does not give their names or ages, there are no
           photographs or  any  other  evidence  to  support  this  claimed
           relationship. Indeed  the  only  photographs  in  the  extensive
           bundle are simply those  of  the  [claimant's]  marriage  to  Ms
           Arbola in 2012. For the reasons set out above I do not find  the
           [claimant] to have been a credible  individual,  and  I  do  not
           therefore give weight  to  the  unsupported  assertions  in  his
           witness statement about his current relationship.

      76.   However when considering the totality of the evidence before  me
           I am not satisfied that this  [claimant's]  willingness  to  use
           deception in 2007 and again in 2012 when taken together with his
           past offence in 2007 meet the threshold for  posing  a  genuine,
           present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the  fundamental
           interests  of  society  sufficient  to  justify  refusal  of   a
           residence car or his  removal  from  the  UK  on  the  basis  of
           Regulation 21."

The grounds and the respondent's submissions

22. The written grounds contend that:

      i.    The claimant's character and conduct demonstrated  that  he  was
        dishonest and had the propensity to re-offend for self-gain.

    ii.     Although the judge had acknowledged that the claimant had  been
        convicted of a "very serious offence",  she  appeared  to  mitigate
        this by finding that his offending was at  the  lower  end  of  the
        scale and committed because he was homeless at the time.

    iii.    The claimant  had  not  undertaken  any  behavioural  or  other
        rehabilitative course and there was nothing to suggest that he  had
        dealt  with  his  deceptive  behaviour.  "His  continuous  use   of
        deception for his own gain demonstrated that [he] would do whatever
        he felt necessary without thought of consequence".

    iv.      The  claimant  had  admitted  entering  the   United   Kingdom
        illegally, using deception in a false identity.

    v.      The fact that he had entered the United Kingdom  without  leave
        meant  that  he  had  committed  an  offence  under  s.24  of   the
        Immigration Act 1971.

    vi.     He had committed a serious drug offence and  was  sentenced  to
        two years imprisonment in his false identity and  he  continued  to
        deceive  the  police  and  the  courts  by  using  his  false  name
        throughout the criminal proceedings.

    vii.    He had returned to the United Kingdom in breach of an Exclusion
        Order. In his application for leave, he withheld information  about
        his conviction.

      viii. He had shown a blatant disregard for the  laws  of  the  United
        Kingdom.

    ix.     The judge had failed to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
        claimant had  willingly  used  deception  in  connection  with  the
        immigration laws of the United Kingdom.

    ix.     The judge had considered whether there were factors which might
        demonstrate that being in  the  UK  might  be  more  beneficial  in
        reducing the likelihood of the claimant re-offending in the  future
        and had concluded, at [75] that there were none. The judge had also
        found that the claimant was not credible.

    x.      There were wider societal considerations which form  the  basis
        of public policy and public security. It  was  in  the  fundamental
        interests of society not to tolerate drug offences.

    xi.     In the light of the above and the fact that  the  claimant  had
        intentionally used deception in 2007  and  (after  his  conviction)
        again in 2012, when taken together with this  past  "offences"  and
        the fact that he returned in breach  of  an  Exclusion  Order,  the
        grounds contend that the claimant  posed  a  genuine,  present  and
        sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
        interests of society.

23. At the hearing, Mr Tufan submitted that the  grounds  distil  into  the
    following grounds: The judge's decision lacked reasoning. She failed to
    apply her adverse findings, in particular,  but  not  limited  to,  her
    finding at [74] that the claimant's willingness to use deception was  a
    concern as it may indicate a propensity to  engage  in  other  criminal
    acts of dishonesty.

24. I asked Mr Tufan whether such adverse findings necessarily precluded  a
    finding, in all cases  in  which  such  findings  are  made,  that  the
    individual did not pose a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat. Mr Tufan said that it did not. However, he  submitted  that  in
    the instant case, the judge had made a series of negative findings such
    that the conclusion at [76] was not a logical conclusion. In the  light
    of the negative findings, it is difficult to understand the  conclusion
    at [76]. He accepted that perversity was a high threshold.

25. Mr Tufan relied upon R v Ahmed Benabbas [2005] EWCA Civ 2113  at  [46],
    although he acknowledged that this was not a  decision  under  the  EEA
    Regulations. At [46], the Court of  Appeal  said  that  the  judge  was
    correct to say that the use by the claimant in that case  of  a  forged
    passport undermined the good order of society  and  constituted  him  a
    threat; his continued presence would be a detriment to society.

26. Mr Tufan also relied upon SSHD v Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ 1245 where
    at [15], the Court of Appeal said, in relation to a case  concerning  a
    deportation decision under the EEA Regulations, that  there  have  been
    instances in which deterrence and public revulsion have placed  a  part
    in the decision. He referred me to R v Bouchereau (Case 30/77)  [21978]
    1 Q.B. 732 considered by the  Court  of  Appeal  at  [15]-[18]  of  the
    judgment in Straszewski.

27. I heard briefly from Ms Peterson in reply, following which  I  reserved
    my decision.

Assessment

28. In Straszewski, the Court of  Appeal  considered  the  Opinion  of  the
    Advocate-General in Bouchereau at [16]-[17] which read:


        "16.     In his Opinion Advocate-General J-P Warner agreed  with  a
             submission of the UK  government  that,  in  exceptional  cases
             where the personal conduct of an  alien  has  been  such  that,
             while not necessarily evincing a clear propensity on  his  part
             to re-offend, it has caused such  deep  public  revulsion  that
             public policy requires his removal. The court  dealt  with  the
             question as follows:


                 "28.  The existence of a previous criminal conviction can,
                       therefore, only be taken into account in  so  far  as
                       the circumstances which gave rise to that  conviction
                       are  evidence  of  personal  conduct  constituting  a
                       present threat to the requirements of public policy.


                 29.   Although, in general, a finding that such  a  threat
                       exists  implies  the  existence  in  the   individual
                       concerned of a propensity to act in the same  way  in
                       the future, it is possible that  past  conduct  alone
                       may constitute such a threat to the  requirements  of
                       public policy.


                 30.   It is for the authorities  and,  where  appropriate,
                       for the national courts, to consider that question in
                       each individual case in the light of  the  particular
                       legal position of persons subject  to  Community  law
                       and of the fundamental nature of the principle of the
                       free movement of persons."


        17.      In my view the clear emphasis of that passage  is  on  the
             fundamental nature of the principle of free  movement  and  the
             need to identify a present threat to the requirements of public
             policy, while recognising that there may be cases in which past
             conduct alone may suffice. However, paragraph 29 must  be  read
             and understood in the context of  the  court's  answer  to  the
             third  question,  namely,  whether  "public  policy"   includes
             reasons of state in circumstances where no breach of the  peace
             or public order is threatened. The court recognised that public
             policy may vary from country to country and  may  differ  under
             different  circumstances  and  at  different  times.   National
             authorities must be allowed a degree of discretion in how  they
             apply it within the limits imposed by  the  Treaty.  The  court
             then concluded with an endorsement of the underlying principles
             in these terms:


                 "35.  In so far as it may justify certain restrictions  on
                       the free movement of  persons  subject  to  Community
                       law, recourse by a national authority to the  concept
                       of public  policy  presupposes,  in  any  event,  the
                       existence, in addition to  the  perturbation  of  the
                       social  order  which  any  infringement  of  the  law
                       involves,  of  a  genuine  and  sufficiently  serious
                       threat to the requirements of public policy affecting
                       one of the fundamental interests of society."


           This seems to me to emphasise the need to  look  to  the  future
             rather than the past in all but the most exceptional cases  and
             to emphasise the importance of the right of  free  movement.  I
             agree with Mr. Drabble Q.C. that one can detect in the decision
             an understandable element of pragmatism in the  recognition  of
             the right to deport those who have committed the  most  heinous
             of  crimes  which  is  at  odds  with  the  principles  of  the
             Directive."

29. The Court of Appeal said at [20] that given "the great  importance   to
    be attached to the right of free movement which can be interfered  with
    only in cases where the offender represents a serious  threat  to  some
    aspect of public policy or public security", the  question  whether  an
    offender represents such a serious threat is to be determined solely by
    reference to the conduct of the offender - which the  Court  considered
    would "no doubt be viewed in the context of any previous  offending"  -
    and the likelihood of reoffending, save in exceptional  cases.  General
    considerations of deterrence and public revulsion normally have no part
    to play in the matter.

30. In the instant case, it is clear from  [70]-[71]  that  the  judge  was
    aware of the approach in the generality of  cases,  that  the  question
    whether an individual poses a serious threat is to be determined solely
    by reference to the conduct of the offender. It appears  that  she  was
    not referred to Straszewski, Bouchereau or Marchon.  Thus,  through  no
    fault of her own, she overlooked considering whether the  instant  case
    is one of those exceptional cases in which past conduct  is  in  itself
    sufficient.

31. The issue for me is whether this oversight is material.

32. Mr Tufan relied upon Benabbas. In my view, Benabbas does not assist the
    Secretary of State. It was not a decision under the EEA Regulations. It
    cannot therefore be relied upon to support the proposition that, in the
    case of a decision under the EEA Regulations, past conduct in the  form
    of the use of a  forged  passport  will  be  sufficient  in  itself  to
    constitute a sufficiently serious  threat  to  some  aspect  of  public
    policy or public security.

33. The Court of Appeal in Strazewski considered its previous judgment in R
    v SSHD ex parte Marchon [1993] 2 C.M.L.R 132. The Court  of  Appeal  in
    Marchon  considered  that  the  case  fell  within  the  scope  of  the
    observations made by the Advocate-General in Bouchereau and within  the
    final sentence of paragraph 29 of the Opinion in  Bouchereau.  However,
    Marchon concerned a Portuguese doctor living and working in the  United
    Kingdom who was convicted of conspiring to import 4 � kgs of heroin  in
    respect of which he was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. The  Court
    in Marchon described the offence as "very serious and  horrifying"  and
    as being "an  especially  horrifying  offence,  and  repugnant  to  the
    public" because it had been carried out by a doctor. It therefore  held
    that the claimant was liable to deportation and dismissed his appeal.

34. The Court of Appeal in Strazewski then went  on  to  consider  Nazli  v
    Stadt N�rnberg (Case C-340/97). At [19], Lord Justice  Moore-Bick  said
    that he could see some force in the submission made on  behalf  of  the
    claimant in Strazewski that the decision in Marchon can  no  longer  be
    regarded as representing Community law.

35. However, even leaving this observation aside, the reality is  that  the
    facts in the Marchon case are far removed from the facts of the instant
    case. Whilst both cases concerned individuals who had been convicted of
    offences relating to Class A drugs, the judge in the instant case found
    that the amount of drugs seized  was  "relatively  small"  whereas  the
    weight of the drugs seized in the Marchon case was 4 �  kgs.  Secondly,
    the sentence received by the claimant in the instant case was 2  years'
    imprisonment whereas the  claimant  in  the  Marchon  case  received  a
    sentence of 11 years' imprisonment. Thirdly, the Marchon case concerned
    a conspiracy  by  a  doctor  to  import  Class  A  drugs,  whereas  the
    sentencing judge who sentenced the claimant in the instant  case  found
    that the offence was committed by the claimant because he was  homeless
    at the time and he was offered the use of a car.

36. My attention was not drawn to any  authority  concerning  the  type  of
    conduct that is likely to be considered sufficiently serious to  amount
    to a serious threat on the basis of past conduct alone, irrespective of
    any future risk of re-offending. This is a question of  fact  in  every
    case. In the instant case, the judge considered the type of offence and
    its seriousness, the fact that it concerned a small amount of  Class  A
    drugs, the length of the sentence and the claimant's circumstances when
    he committed the offence. Importantly, she also took into  account  his
    wider conduct, i.e. the fact that he had  deliberately  used  deception
    when he arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006, that  he  used  a  false
    name at the time of his arrest or soon thereafter and continued to  use
    that alias through his criminal proceedings. She also took into account
    the fact that the claimant had used deception  when  he  completed  his
    application for leave in 2012  by  stating  that  he  did  not  have  a
    conviction. She took into account that he entered Ireland on 8 December
    2009 on a three-month visit visa and then entered  the  United  Kingdom
    without passing through or declaring himself to immigration. She  noted
    that he then remained in the United Kingdom without leave. There was no
    evidence before her indicating a propensity to re-offend. However,  she
    took into account her concern that the claimant's  willingness  to  use
    deception "may indicate a propensity to engage in other  criminal  acts
    of dishonesty".

37. I have considered all of the claimant's past conduct whether or not  it
    resulted in a criminal conviction. Even on that basis, I have concluded
    that, if the judge had considered whether the facts of the instant case
    fall within the category of exceptional cases  in  which  past  conduct
    alone is itself sufficient, she was bound to conclude that they do  not
    when seen in the wider context, that is to say, having  regard  to  the
    Tribunal's wider  experience  of  deportation  appeals  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.

38. I have therefore concluded that the judge's failure to consider whether
    the instant case is one  of  those  exceptional  cases  in  which  past
    conduct is in itself sufficient does not amount to an error of law.  If
    I am wrong in this respect, I  am  satisfied,  for  the  reasons  given
    above, that any such error of law is not material.

39. I reject Mr Tufan's submission that the judge gave inadequate  reasons.
    He submitted that, given the judge's negative findings, it is difficult
    to understand her conclusion at [76].  However, he also  accepted  that
    such adverse findings of fact do not necessarily preclude a finding  in
    all cases in which such findings are made that the individual concerned
    does not pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.   The
    judge's concern that the claimant's willingness to  use  deception  may
    indicate a propensity to engage in other criminal  acts  of  dishonesty
    was evidence that he posed some threat but she was entitled  to   find,
    on the facts, that he did not pose a sufficiently serious threat. There
    is therefore nothing in this submission.

40. It simply cannot be said that the judge's decision  was  perverse,  not
    only because there is a high threshold for perversity but also  because
    of the reasons that the judge gave for  her  conclusion  (reasons  that
    were adequate in my view).

41. There is no substance in the written grounds. The submission  that  the
    judge "appeared to mitigate" the seriousness of the claimant's  offence
    is no more than a disagreement with the weight she gave to his criminal
    conviction. I have dealt (at [28]-[38] above) with the submission  that
    "there were wider societal  considerations  which  form  the  basis  of
    public policy and public security".

42. The remainder of the written grounds amount to no more than an  attempt
    either to re-argue the case or to disagree with the judge's  reasoning.
    They fail to identify any material factor that she  should  have  taken
    into account but failed to do so or  that  she  erroneously  took  into
    account.

      Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
