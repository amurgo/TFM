Representation:
For the Secretary of State:     Mr L Tarlow (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Claimant: Mr A Choudhury (legal representative)


                            DECISION  AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Traynor) promulgated on 3 September 2014  in
    which it allowed the Claimant's appeal against a decision by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in Dhaka to refuse entry clearance as the spouse of a
    person present and settled in the UK.



Background

2.   The Claimant whose date of birth is 13  February  1991  and  she  is  a
    citizen of Bangladesh.

3.   The Secretary of State raised  concerns  as  to  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's finances.  It was  considered  that  the  sponsor  failed  to
    submit  bank  statements  for  and  corresponding  to  the  period   of
    employment and cash deposits shown in the bank statements did not match
    the income shown on the pay slips.  With  the  grounds  of  appeal  the
    Claimant produced correspondence from HMRC showing his earnings for the
    financial year ending April 2013 that amounted to �14,965.  It was  the
    claimant's case that he was employed as a head chef at the  Urmi  Balti
    House Takeaway where his salary was �18,980, that he was  in  full-time
    employment and paid in cash on  a  weekly  basis.   He  submitted  bank
    statements for the relevant six months period.

4.   The Tribunal determined  the  appeal  having  regard  to  the  date  of
    decision as the relevant  date  [29&33].   It  accepted  the  sponsor's
    evidence as credible. It calculated the sponsor's income on  the  basis
    that he was earning a gross income of �365 per week.  It  accepted  the
    evidence of the HMRC document showing a gross income up to 5 April 2013
    of �14,965.  The Tribunal calculated that from 5 April up to  the  date
    of application the sponsor would have earned an additional  ten  weeks'
    income from his employment which correlated  to  an  additional  �3,650
    from June 2012 to June 2013.  It calculated that  the  sponsor's  gross
    income for the year June 2012 to 2013 amounted to �18,615.  The  appeal
    was allowed on immigration grounds.

Grounds of Application

5.   The Secretary of State relied on the Rules of  specified  evidence  set
    out in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules.

    Ground 1 - The Tribunal  erred  by  failing  to  have  regard  to  the
    requirements for specified evidence.  The claimant could not  meet  the
    requirements for the six month period prior to the date of application,
    which are mandatory requirements.


    Ground 2 - The Tribunal took into account post-application evidence and
    relied on the date of decision rather than date of application to  find
    the income threshold was exceeded.


    Ground 3 - Appendix FM provides in terms of salaried employment,  that
    the following evidence must be produced:


         (a)  wage slips covering a period of six months prior to  the  date
             of application and personal bank statements  corresponding  to
             the same period as the wage slips as  paragraph  2(a)  showing
             that the salary has been paid into an account in the  name  of
             the person or their partner jointly.....


    The Tribunal erred by taking into account evidence of cash paid to  the
    claimant that was not paid into his bank account and should  only  have
    taken into account the actual amount paid into the account as  earnings
    which was substantially less.  The sponsor's actual gross income at the
    date of application is unclear and therefore the appeal should not have
    been allowed.

Permission

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    on 28 October 2014.

7.   Judge Simpson stated:


         "Only  PBS  applications  are  determined  as  at   the   date   of
         application:  overseas  applications  such  as  this   are   always
         determined as at the date of decision, i.e.  June  2013.   However,
         given that the sponsor was paid in cash at the  material  time  and
         did not deposit his wages into his bank account in  their  entirety
         each week, it is arguable that the appellant was not able  to  meet
         the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE in  relation  to  the
         submission of corroborating bank statements".

The Hearing

Submissions

8.   Mr Tarlow relied on the grounds in support of the application.  He  was
    provided with copies of the Immigration Directorate Instructions  dated
    November 2014 and those Instructions applicable prior to November 2014.



14.  Mr Tarlow submitted that the Claimant was required to  meet  the  Rules
    and not the  Immigration  Directorate  Instructions.   Paragraph  FM-SE
    detailed what evidence is required to establish income and that  it  is
    sustainable.  The Tribunal should only have taken into  account  actual
    income paid into the account as earnings and not the cash that was  not
    paid into the account.  He relied on all the grounds.

15.   Mr  Choudhury  produced  copies   of   the   Immigration   Directorate
    Instructions applicable pre and post November 2014. He  submitted  that
    it was the "old" instructions that applied and he referred to  pages  7
    and 16 of the same.  He submitted that at the time of  the  application
    the Claimant provided the required  specified  evidence  including  six
    months' pay slips, bank statements, a  contract  of  employment  and  a
    letter from his employers, as evidenced by the letter from  Equity  Law
    dated 5 February 2013.  The main issue was the  Claimant's  income  and
    how that was  calculated  by  the  Tribunal.   He  submitted  that  the
    Secretary of  State  must  have  relied  on  the  new  IDIs  which,  if
    applicable, the Claimant's appeal fails.  Mr Choudhury  submitted  that
    the current Rules came into effect at the end of 2014 and did not apply
    to this application. He submitted that the date of application or  date
    of decision was not material as  the  sponsor's  income  satisfied  the
    Rules whichever date.

16.  Specifically, the new IDIs at paragraph 3.1.4 states: "where the  gross
    (pre-tax) amount of any income cannot be properly  evidenced,  the  net
    (post-tax) amount will be counted, including  towards  a  gross  income
    requirement".

17.  Paragraph 3.1.5 states:


         "Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the  gross  amount  of  any
         cash income may  be  counted  where  the  person's  specified  bank
         statements show the net amount which relates to  the  gross  amount
         shown on their pay slips (or in  the  relevant  specified  evidence
         provided in addition to the specified bank statements  in  relation
         to non-employment income).  Otherwise, only the net amount shown on
         the specified bank statements may be counted".

18.   The  old  guidance  at  paragraph  5.5.2  headed  Specified   Evidence
    provides:

         "In respect of salaried employment, all of the  following  must  be
         submitted:


         .    P60 (if this has been issued) and wage slips for the six month
             period prior to the application, or as  appropriate,  for  the
             twelve month period prior to the application.


         .    Letter from the employer confirming  the  person's  employment
             and annual salary, the length of  their  employment  (and  the
             period over which they have been or were  paid  the  level  of
             salary relied upon  in  the  application),  and  the  type  of
             employment (permanent fixed term contract or agency).


         .    A signed contract of employment.


         .    Bank statements corresponding to the same period as  the  wage
             slips, showing that the salary has been paid into the person's
             account".


19.  Paragraph 5 headed  "Meeting  the  financial  requirements"   provides:
    "where the gross (pre-tax) amount of  any  income  cannot  be  properly
    evidenced, the net (post-tax) amount will be counted towards the  gross
    requirement".

20.  Mr Choudhury submitted that the letter from the employer enclosing  the
    P60 demonstrated an income of �14,965,  which  tallied  with  the  HMRC
    letter dated 1 July 2013.  This was evidence relevant as at the date of
    decision and which corroborated the appellant's claimed income.

21.  Mr Tarlow submitted that the postdecision evidence was not  foreseeable
    and therefore not admissible.  HMRC  records  are  based  on  what  the
    parties tell them.  It could not be shown in evidence that the Claimant
    was earning the required amount some of which  was  and  some  was  not
    shown in the bank statements.

22.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my  decision,  which  I  now  give
    with my reasons.


Discussion and Decision

23.   The  main  issue  before  me  relates  to  the  specified   evidential
    requirements that ensure that a person's income is  properly  evidenced
    and will be sustainable. The  first  point  to  be  made  is  that  the
    application was made for entry  clearance  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and therefore the relevant date in terms of  evidence
    was the date of decision.  Consequently, the Tribunal may consider only
    the circumstances appertaining as at the date  of  the  decision.   The
    date of decision was 18 June 2013 and the date  of  application  was  5
    February 2013.

24.  With regard  to  the  specified  evidence,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Claimant provided wage slips covering a period of six months  prior  to
    the date of application   (he  had  been  employed  for  at  least  six
    months),  a  letter  from  the  employer  who  issued  the  wage  slips
    confirming the details of  his  employment  (gross  salary,  length  of
    employment,  type  of  employment)   and   personal   bank   statements
    corresponding to the same period as the wage slips at  paragraph  2(a),
    showing that part of the salary has been paid into an  account  in  the
    name of the person or in the name  of  the  person  and  their  partner
    jointly.

25.  It is accepted that the sponsor did not deposit the full amount of  his
    wages into his bank account  each  week  and  that  was  why  his  bank
    statements did  not  correlate  with  his  wage  slips.   Mr  Choudhury
    submitted that the IDIs applicable at the date the application was made
    ("the old IDIs"). The Tribunal made no reference to  having  considered
    any Immigration Directorate Instructions and whilst those may well have
    been applicable they did not appear to have been relied on at the First-
    tier Tribunal hearing.  In any event I find that the Instructions  have
    no bearing on the evidential requirements in  the  Rules  to  show  the
    income. I am satisfied that the specified  evidence  requirements  were
    not met because the bank statements did not show payment in all of  the
    Sponsor's cash salary. The Rules seek  to  ensure  that  the  evidence,
    namely  the  bank  statements,  cover  the  specific  periods  in   the
    Immigration Rules for each of the sources of income relied upon.

27.  The Tribunal conflated the financial requirements in the Rules and  the
    date of decision.  At [29] it considered that the  issue  was  "whether
    the appellant's sponsor earned the minimum threshold of  earnings  from
    his employment at the time of the decision to refuse on 18 June  2013".
    The issue in fact was whether or not the Claimant met the  requirements
    of the Rules including the income threshold as at the date of  decision
    and that he met the requirements for specified evidence by reference to
    the period of six months prior to the date of application. It may  well
    be that the Claimant does indeed meet the financial requirements of the
    Rules in terms of his annual income. However,  the  Tribunal  erred  by
    failing to take  into  account  that  the  evidence  produced  did  not
    establish that all of the cash deposits were paid into the bank account
    nor were the amounts evidenced in  the bank statements.   The  Tribunal
    should only have taken into account the cash income shown  to  be  paid
    into the account which was insufficient to meet the threshold.

28.  I find a material error of law in  the  decision  and  that  the  first
    ground of appeal is made out.  The decision is set aside.

29.  I now go on to remake the decision with reference to the evidence  that
    was before the First-tier Tribunal. I substitute a  decision  that  the
    appeal is dismissed under Immigration Rules.  There was no  correlation
    of the amount of earnings in the bank statements produced to show  that
    the income threshold was met.

Decision

30.  There is a material error of law in the decision which is set aside.

31.  The appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.
