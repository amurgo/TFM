                            REMITTAL AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order by the First-tier Tribunal
    pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).   Neither  party  invited  me  to
    rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born on 27  September  1990.
    He arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2014 and claimed asylum the
    following day.  The appellant claimed to fear the  Iranian  authorities
    because he had worked as a smuggler's porter.  He claimed that  he  had
    stored a number of cartons of alcohol in his cellar for  the  smuggler.
    The police had come to his house and discovered  the  alcohol  together
    with some political documents which were found in the boxes  stored  in
    his cellar.  He was now wanted by the authorities and was  at  risk  of
    prosecution and severe punishment amounting to persecution  or  serious
    ill-treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR.

 3. On 12 September 2014, the Secretary of State  refused  the  appellant's
    claim for asylum, humanitarian protection and under Art 8 of the  ECHR.
    The Secretary of State rejected the appellant's account  as  not  being
    credible.  Consequently, on that same date, the Secretary of State made
    a decision to remove the appellant to Iran as an illegal entrant.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision to the First-tier Tribunal.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 12 February 2015, Judge  Maciel  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.  Like the Secretary of  State,  she  found  the
    appellant's account not to be credible and that the appellant  was  not
    wanted as a criminal or suspected political dissident.  Further, in the
    light of her adverse credibility finding, the judge did not accept that
    the appellant had exited Iran illegally.

 5. The appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    challenging the judge's adverse credibility finding.  On 31 March 2015,
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Lambert)   granted   the   appellant
    permission to appeal.

 6. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Appellant's Claim

 7. The appellant's claim was that he had worked as a smuggler's porter for
    about one and a half years prior to coming to the UK.  At  the  request
    of the smuggler, H he had stored  twenty  cartons  of  alcohol  in  the
    cellar of his home.  Subsequently, he was telephoned by  H  who  stated
    that someone would collect ten cartons.  In due course,  an  individual
    came and collected them.  The  appellant  remained  in  his  house  for
    approximately three to four hours before he went to the market  at  the
    request of his mother to buy some  produce.   Whilst  he  was  out,  he
    received a telephone call from a neighbour warning him  not  to  return
    home.  The police had come to his home.  The appellant went directly to
    his uncle's home where he stayed for about twenty  minutes  before  his
    uncle took him to a friend's house where the appellant hid in a  cellar
    for two to three hours  before  arrangements  were  made  to  take  the
    appellant out of the country.  The appellant travelled to Turkey  where
    he remained for ten days before travelling to the  UK.   The  appellant
    has contacted his uncle and was informed that his mother had been taken
    into detention as political  documents  were  found  in  the  boxes  of
    alcohol stored in his cellar.

 8. The appellant fears that he  will  be  prosecuted.   There  was  expert
    evidence before the judge that the punishment he would receive would be
    at least five  years'  imprisonment  and  74  lashes  with  a  fine  of
    approximately ï¿½60,000.

The Judge's Decision

 9. The judge found the appellant not to be credible.  Her reasons  are  at
    paras 16-23 of her determination as follows:

         "16.  I  find  that  there  (sic)  his  account  did  not   contain
             discrepancy as alleged in the reasons for  refusal  letter  in
             respect of him leaving the house as soon as he got a call from
             Mr H.  I find that in interview he stated that he remained  in
             his home for 3-4 hours after the call and left to  go  to  the
             market.

           17.    I was urged to find that the Appellant's  claim  that  his
             mother was detained was credible as he was fine prior to  that
             and thereafter displayed symptoms of anxiety  and  depression.
             However, I find that this time also coincides  with  the  time
             when his application for asylum was refused.  Accordingly, the
             change in his health cannot be solely attributable to any news
             he may have received from Iran.

           18.    The Appellant claimed to have had contact with  his  uncle
             en route when  his  uncle  telephoned  the  Appellant  on  the
             agent's telephone and he was informed  that  the  family  were
             well.  I find that the Appellant would have  kept  in  regular
             contact with his family.  I do not accept that  the  Appellant
             did not make any attempt to contact his family until after the
             refusal as alleged.  I find that this aspect of his claim  has
             been added to exaggerate his claim.  I  reject  his  assertion
             that political documents were found and that he  was  informed
             of this on 22 September.

           19.    Further,  if  the  authorities  had  discovered  political
             documents in the Appellant's house, they would  have  arrested
             his mother immediately and would not have waited, which  would
             mean, she would have been detained by the time  the  Appellant
             reached Turkey when his uncle is said  to  have  informed  him
             that all was well.

           20.    The Appellant states that he does not want to contact  his
             uncle as this might bring them trouble and is therefore  aware
             of the  sophistication  with  which  the  Iranian  authorities
             operate.  This is inconsistent with a  neighbour  tipping  him
             off that there were agents at his home when he  said  to  have
             gone to the  market.   That  call  would  have  been  tracked,
             leaving his neighbour to bear the repercussions.

           21.    I find that if the Iranian authorities had not  found  the
             Appellant at his home they would have immediately gone to  his
             uncle's home where the Appellant was for  some  time  (2  -  3
             hours).  They would have had intelligence of this.

           22.    I find that the Appellant's ability to evade  the  Iranian
             authorities to be based on  too  many  coincidences.   Despite
             waiting in his house for 3 - 4 hours the  Iranian  authorities
             only managed to get there after he left for the  market.   The
             Iranian authorities also did not think to look for him at  his
             uncle's address and there was no trouble for at least 10  days
             when he was travelling to Turkey as that is what it is claimed
             he was told.

           23.    I accept that the home area of where the  Appellant  comes
             from is a  centre  for  smugglers  and  it  may  be  that  the
             Appellant was involved in this business as a porter.  However,
             I reject his evidence that there was any adverse  interest  in
             him by the Iranian authorities when he left Iran or since.   I
             find that the Appellant claim that the Iranian authorities did
             not  visit  his  uncle  or  question  him  to  undermine   the
             background evidence  that  the  authorities  are  experienced,
             formidable and have a far reaching intelligence service."

10. At para 24, in the light of her adverse credibility finding, the  judge
    did not accept that the appellant had left Iran illegally.

11. At para 25, she considered the appellant's symptoms of  depression  and
    anxiety and noted that: "the timing of this coincides with the  refusal
    of his claim by the respondent."

12. Consequently, at para 26 the judge found as follows:

         "26. In the light  of  my  findings,  I  do  not  accept  that  the
             Appellant  is  a  wanted  criminal  or   suspected   political
             dissident.  I find that if required to  return  to  Iran,  the
             Appellant will have the support of his family  who  have  paid
             for him to travel to the UK."

Discussion

13. Ms Nowaparast,  who  represented  the  appellant,  submitted  that  the
    judge's adverse credibility finding was flawed on two bases.

14. First, the judge had misdirected herself as to  the  evidence  and  had
    based her reasoning upon two mistakes of fact.  At para 21,  the  judge
    had doubted the veracity of the appellant's account that he had gone to
    his uncle's home and not been found there by the Iranian authorities on
    the basis that he had been there for "some  time",  namely  2-3  hours.
    That, Ms Nowaparast submitted was a mistake.  The appellant's  evidence
    was that he spent about twenty minutes in his uncle's house  (see  Q123
    of the asylum interview).  The appellant's reference in his evidence to
    a period of "2-3 hours" was, Ms Nowaparast pointed out,  the  time  the
    appellant said that he spent hiding in the cellar of his uncle's friend
    before arrangements were made for him to leave.

15. Also, Ms Nowaparast submitted that in para 22 the judge had been  wrong
    to take into account that the appellant had been able to  safely  spend
    ten days travelling to Turkey undetected when that was no part  of  the
    evidence.  She  submitted  that  the  reference  to  ten  days  in  the
    appellant's evidence was to the time he spent in Turkey rather than the
    time he spent reaching Turkey (see Q121 of the asylum interview).

16. Mr Mills, who represented the respondent accepted that  the  judge  had
    made these two  factual  errors.   However,  he  submitted  that  these
    factual errors did not amount to a material error of law on  the  basis
    of the remaining reasons given by the judge  at  paras  16-23  for  her
    adverse credibility finding.

17. Turning then to Ms Nowaparast's challenge to that part of  the  judge's
    reasoning, particularly in paras 18-22, she submitted that the  judge's
    reasoning was not supported  by  objective  evidence  and  amounted  to
    inappropriate speculation.  In particular, in her oral submissions,  Ms
    Nowaparast challenged the judge's reasoning in  para  19  that,  having
    discovered political documents in the appellant's  house,  it  was  (in
    effect) implausible that the appellant's mother would not  be  arrested
    immediately.  Ms Nowaparast submitted that that inference was not  only
    not supported by the background evidence before the judge,  it  was  in
    fact contrary to it.  She relied upon a passage in the  Danish  Refugee
    Council's report on Iranian Kurds (September 2013) at para  1.34  where
    it stated that:

         "Asked how the regime treats the family of  someone  who  has  been
         caught with a flier, UNHCR Erbil answered that the family  will  be
         harassed until  the  wanted  person  shows  up.   The  regime  will
         sometimes detain a family member and  interrogate  him  for  a  few
         hours and then release him; or the regime  will  hold  one  of  the
         family members in detention."

18. Although that passage concerned the treatment of family members of  the
    Kurdish activist, and it is by no means necessarily  inconsistent  with
    the claimed treatment of the appellant's mother, the judge  was  in  my
    judgment  required  to  grapple  with  the  objective  evidence  before
    inferring  that  the  appellant's  mother  would  have  been   arrested
    immediately if the appellant's account was true.

19. The grounds also challenged the judge's  reasoning  in  para  20  that,
    given the sophistication of the Iranian authorities, again (in  effect)
    it is implausible that a neighbour would  risk  phoning  the  appellant
    when that call might be tracked.  The difficulty with this reasoning is
    that there was no evidence before the judge that the  authorities  were
    either tracking the  appellant's  phone  or  that  of  the  appellant's
    neighbour.  There was no evidence as to what, if any, surveillance  had
    been placed upon the appellant prior to the raid on his home.

20. That difficulty also  manifests  itself  in  para  22  of  the  judge's
    reasoning that it was again (in effect) implausible  that  the  Iranian
    authorities would wait for three to four  hours  after  the  smuggler's
    agent collected the alcohol to raid the house.   There  was  simply  no
    evidence as to the surveillance of the appellant or why it was that the
    Iranian authorities raided the  appellant's  house  at  the  time  they
    chose.

21. Even without the second ground upon which Ms Nowaparast  relied,  I  am
    satisfied that the errors of fact made  by  the  judge,  which  I  have
    identified above (and are accepted), were  material  to  her  decision.
    The judge's reasoning is relatively brief and I am unable to  say  that
    she would have reached the same  conclusion  had  she  not  taken  into
    account the reasoning in paras 21 and  22.   The  materiality  of  that
    error is more acutely identified when regard is had to the second of Ms
    Nowaparast's grounds which casts doubt on other aspects of the  judge's
    reasoning in paras 19, 20 and 22.

22. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the judge  materially  erred  in
    law in reaching an adverse credibility finding and  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal.

Decision and Disposal

23. Consequently, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal involved the  making  of  an  error  of  law.   That
    decision cannot stand and is set aside.

24. Both representatives accepted that  if  the  appellant's  grounds  were
    established the proper course was to remit the appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo of the appeal.

25. Applying para 7.2 of the Senior  President's  Practice  Statement,  and
    having regard to the nature of the error of law and the  need  to  make
    fresh findings of fact, I remit the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a de novo re-hearing before a judge other than Judge Maciel.
