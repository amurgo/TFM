                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of the People's Republic of China  born  on
    11 March 1990. She came to the United Kingdom on 9 June 2013 as a  Tier
    4 Student and this leave was further extended until  19  October  2015.
    Two days prior to the expiry of her  leave  on  17  October  2015,  the
    Appellant applied for leave to remain on the basis of her  relationship
    and family life.  This was due to the fact that the Appellant  had  met
    and married a British citizen, CHF, DOB 2  February  1980.   The  human
    rights application was refused by the Respondent on 1 December 2015  on
    the basis that the Appellant could not demonstrate that  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM were  met  and  the  Respondent  considered
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in
    China.

 2. On 6 February 2016, the Appellant gave  birth  to  a  daughter  of  the
    marriage, C, who is a British citizen by  birth  due  to  her  father's
    nationality.

 3. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald for hearing on
    14 March 2017.  In a decision and reasons promulgated on 22 March  2017
    he dismissed the appeal and made inter  alia  the  following  findings:
    that the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship and so the Appellant met the suitability requirements in S-
    LTR but she was unable at the date of  application  to  show  that  the
    eligibility requirements R-LTRP1.1(c)(ii) were  met  viz  the  relevant
    income requirement as her husband had not been working for long  enough
    to show the necessary wage slips and bank statements. At 18(b)  of  his
    decision the judge accepted in respect of the ten year route  that  the
    suitability requirements and eligibility requirements  were  met.   The
    judge accepted at 18(f) that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship with  a  child  who  is  a  British  citizen  but
    concluded it was not unreasonable to expect the child to leave the  UK.
    The rationale for this finding is at 18(i) and that is:

         "In this case the mother is Chinese.  The father was born  in  this
         country but his parents  are  from  Hong  Kong  and  he  has  close
         relatives in Hong Kong.  The child has his maternal grandparents in
         China. Both parents speak Cantonese  to  each  other  at  home  and
         presumably to the child who is now  1  year  of  age.   The  child,
         though a British citizen,  will  be  fully  accustomed  to  Chinese
         culture given the interest therein of his parents. No evidence  was
         put before me to suggest that the child could not benefit  from  or
         acquire Chinese nationality nor that the child  could  fail  to  be
         admitted to China.  No evidence was put before  me  to  the  effect
         that the mother is breastfeeding and although it is  not  desirable
         for a mother to be separated from her child, there are  no  reasons
         put before me as to why the child could not go with his  mother  to
         China, albeit temporarily, to await his mother's  entry  clearance.
         It might be said it would be an ideal opportunity for the child  to
         get to know his maternal grandparents and to attach to and bond  to
         them, something which is at present denied her.  I  note  that  the
         Appellant has in the past visited China to see her parents with her
         husband and there is nothing to prevent the husband  from  visiting
         his wife and his child or alternatively making arrangements for the
         child to stay in this country with him and/or his extended family

         (j). On balance given the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  I
         would not have found it unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave
         the UK at this stage."

4.   In relation to Article 8 and consideration of Article 8 outside the
Rules the judge   concluded at {25}:

          "I am not persuaded on the evidence presented that there are
compelling circumstances        not sufficiently recognised under the Rules
for  granting leave to remain ... "I should      add that even if I had
found the answers to the first four Razgar questions to be in the
affirmative I would have found such interference to be proportionate here
despite the       fact that there is a qualifying child given my findings
above."

5.   Permission to appeal was sought in time to the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
basis that the    judge had erred materially in law  in  his  assessment  of
the reasonableness of  expecting the Appellant's daughter to leave  the  UK.
It was submitted at [5] that the    test  is  whether  or  not  it  will  be
reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK, not    whether  it  will  be
reasonable to expect the child to temporarily leave the  UK  in   order  for
her mother to apply for entry clearance nor even whether or not it  will  be
reasonable for the child to remain in the UK while her  mother  applied  for
entry    clearance.

6.   Reliance was placed on the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  SF  and
Others   (guidance post 2014 Act) [2017] UKUT 120 (IAC). At  [7]  where  the
Tribunal       noted  the  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction  on  Family
Migration Appendix FM  Section 1.0B "Family life as a partner or parent  and
private life  ten  year  routes  August      2015"  at  11.2.3  provides  as
follows.

         "Would it be unreasonable to expect  a  British  citizen  child  to
leave the UK?

         Save in cases involving criminality the  decision  maker  must  not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer  of  a
         British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU regardless of the  age  of
         that child.  This reflects the European Court of  Justice  judgment
         in Zambrano.  Where a decision  to  refuse  the  application  would
         require a parent or primary carer to return to  a  country  outside
         the EU the case must always be assessed on the basis that it  would
         be unreasonable  to expect a British citizen child to leave the  EU
         with that parent or primary carer.  In such cases it  will  usually
         be appropriate to grant leave to the parent  or  primary  carer  to
         enable them to remain in the UK with the child provided that  there
         is satisfactory evidence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship.  It may however be appropriate  to  refuse  to  grant
         leave where the conduct of the parent or primary carer  gives  rise
         to considerations of such weight as to justify  separation  if  the
         child could otherwise  stay  with  another  parent  or  alternative
         primary carer in the UK or in the EU.  The circumstances  envisaged
         could cover amongst others:

         *    Criminality falling below the threshold set out  in  paragraph
             398 of the Immigration Rules.

         *    A very poor immigration history such as where the  person  has
             repeatedly and deliberately breached  the  Immigration  Rules.
             In considering whether refusal may be appropriate the decision
             maker  must  consider  the  impact  on  the   child   of   any
             separation."

7.   Permission to appeal was granted  on  3  November  2017  by  First-tier
Tribunal Judge    Alis on the following basis:

         "It is arguable that the judge did not give  sufficient  weight  to
         the Respondent 's August 2015 policy on when it  is  reasonable  to
         require a  British  child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  by
         implication of Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.  The principles of MA (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA  Civ
         705 also should be applied."



Hearing

8.   At the hearing before me, I heard submissions from Mr Smyth  on  behalf
of the   Appellant who, drawing attention to the Home  Office  policy  cited
at [6] above,     submitted it was not  reasonable  for  a  British  citizen
child to  leave  the  UK   permanently  in  the  absence  of  countervailing
factors.  In this case the Appellant  had      been  lawfully  resident  and
there were no countervailing factors.

9.   Mr Bramble submitted  that  the  judge  had  considered  the  competing
factors and that  at the date of the Respondent's  decision  the  child  had
not yet been born.  He further  sought to persuade me that the  Home  Office
policy related to sole parents or primary    carers only.

10.  Mr Smyth submitted that nowhere in the Rules is  it  required  that  an
Appellant seek    entry clearance in order to qualify  under  the  ten  year
route and that the references   within the decision to temporary  separation
are simply wrong and  have  no  basis  in    law.   He  submitted  the  sole
requirement is that contained  in  EX1(a)  viz  whether  or     not  it  was
reasonable for the child to leave the United Kingdom.

     Findings

11.  I find a material error of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge, in that it       is  apparent  from  the  decision  that  no
consideration was given to the relevant Home     Office policy  ([6]  above)
which  makes  clear  the  Respondent's  position  in  respect  of        the
reasonableness of expecting British children to leave  the  United  Kingdom.
It was    apparent  that  there  were  no  countervailing  factors  in  this
particular  case  that  would       justify  not  providing  leave  to   the
Appellant within the terms of that policy.  However   due to the  fact  that
the Appellant's daughter was born after the refusal  decision  but    before
the hearing, the Respondent did not, when  refusing  the  application,  take
into     account the fact there was a British child.

12.  Moreover, despite directing himself at [11] that  pursuant  to  section
85(4) of the NIAA      2002 the Appellant  may  adduce  and  the  Judge  may
consider evidence about any     matter relevant to  the  decision,  even  if
the requirements of the Rules were not met at    the date of  decision,  the
Judge went on 18(a) to rely on the evidence  of  income  at  the    date  of
decision  rather  than  that  before  him,  which  showed  that  the  income
requirements of the Rules were met by  the  date  of  hearing.  Had  he  not
fallen to error   on this point it would have been open to him  to  consider
allowing the appeal with   reference to R-LTRP 1.1.(c)  of  Appendix  FM  of
the Rules, given that the requirements  at (a) and (b) were met.

13.  I decided to remake the  decision  myself  and  gave  the  parties  the
opportunity to make    further submissions.  One issue arose  from  [18]  of
the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal and that was the assertion  by  the
judge that the child could benefit from or    acquire  Chinese  nationality.
I gave Mr Smyth the opportunity to provide evidence  in     rebuttal,  which
he did so and produced a  copy  of  the  Nationality  Law  of  the  People's
Republic of China which  provides  at  Article  3  that  the  PRC  does  not
recognise dual    nationality for any Chinese national.

14.  I then heard submissions from  Mr  Smyth  and  Mr  Bramble.   Mr  Smyth
submitted  that     there  was  no  requirement  under  the  Rules  for  the
Appellant to return to the PRC  for   the  purpose  of  applying  for  entry
clearance given that the judge accepted that she      met  the  requirements
of  the  Rules  except  for  Appendix  FM-SE.   He  submitted  that      the
Appellant's daughter is British and is not entitled to  Chinese  nationality
by virtue     of Article 3 of the National Law of the PRC and  that  removal
of her mother in order     to apply for  entry  clearance  will  clearly  be
contrary to her best interests see ZH   (Tanzania)  (2011) UKSC 4.

15.  In relation to the Appellant's husband, he was born and brought up  and
has lived his     entire life in the UK and his family are  from  Hong  Kong
rather  than  mainland  China.      He  submitted   it   will   clearly   be
disproportionate for the family to be separated given      it  was  accepted
that they are a genuine  and  subsisting  family  unit  and  there  were  no
countervailing factors and that in light of section 55  of  the  BCIA  2009,
the only      reasonable  and     proportionate  outcome  will  be  for  the
family to remain in the UK.     He submitted in respect of the  Home  Office
policy that  even  if  it  was  primarily     envisaged  as  addressing  the
situation for lone parents it clearly gives guidance as to      the  factors
therein that are relevant.

16.  In his submissions,  Mr  Bramble  acknowledged  that  the  Respondent's
refusal had   been before the birth  of  the  child  of  the  marriage.   He
submitted that the child was    not expected to  leave  the  United  Kingdom
but there was no reason why their  child       could  not  remain  with  her
father whilst the Appellant returned to the PRC in order   to  obtain  entry
clearance and there was no evidence that it was  not  possible  for  her  to
do this.  Alternatively, the family could return to the PRC  or  go  to  the
PRC as a      family unit, the father and daughter as  visitors,  while  the
Appellant made her     application.  He acknowledged,  however,  that  given
the age of the child who remains    under 2 that it was  debateable  whether
it will be proportionate for her to be  separated from her mother whilst  an
entry clearance application was being made.

17.  Mr Smyth in his reply submitted if it was not reasonable for the  child
to live in China  permanently then the requirements of the Rules  were  met.


     Decision

18.   I find that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  British  child,
who was born on 6      February 2016, to leave the United Kingdom.   She  is
under 2 years of age and I       consider  that  she  is  too  young  to  be
separated from her mother so would  have  to    accompany  her  to  make  an
application for entry clearance to re-enter the United    Kingdom.  Thus  in
light of the fact that  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met,  there
being no dispute as to the fact that the Appellant met the  eligibility  and
suitability   requirements of the Rules, this is a  classic  Chikwamba  case
as the only reason the     Appellant would be required to leave  the  United
Kingdom would be to apply for   entry clearance.

19.  It is also now clear that, contrary to the finding of  the  First  tier
Tribunal Judge, it will    not be open to either the Appellant's husband  or
her child to acquire Chinese    nationality as  both  are  British  citizens
and Chinese law precludes dual nationality:  [13] above refers.

20.  It is further clear from the Home Office  policy  cited  at  [6]  above
moreover that, given   that the Appellant has resided in the UK with  lawful
leave until 19  October  2015  and      since  that  time  she  has  resided
pursuant to the extant application and appeal process     and  there  is  no
suggestion  of  any  criminality  on   her   part,   that   there   are   no
countervailing factors that would justify refusing  leave  to  her.  I  also
bear in mind the  fact she is the mother of a British  child  and  that  the
effect of Section 55 of the  Borders,     Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
2009 means that although the child's  best  interests    are  not  paramount
they are a primary consideration and inform the Home Office    policy.

21.  There was  also  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
Appellant's   husband  at the  date  of  that  hearing  earned  �20,800  per
annum, which meets the income   requirement of the Immigration Rules and  it
was accepted that the relationship  between all  parties  were  genuine  and
subsisting. Thus the appeal falls  to  be  allowed   under  the  Immigration
Rules with reference to R-LTRP 1.1.(a)-(c) (the five year route)    or  (d),
EX1(a)(i) and (ii) of Appendix FM  of  the  Rules.  In  these  circumstances
there is      no requirement for me to go on to consider Article  8  outside
the Rules.

Notice of Decision

I find material errors of law in the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Herwald.  I remake the decision allowing the appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
