1. Because of the wording of  the  Qualification  Directive,  Community  law
   looks outside itself for the interpretation of article 1D, and the CJEU's
   pronouncement on  the  meaning  of  this  aspect  of  refugee  law  is  a
   pronouncement on the autonomous meaning of article 1D.

2. Following the CJEU's reversal of the operative part of  the  decision  of
   the Court of Appeal in El-Ali [2002] EWCA Civ 1103, the other elements of
   the latter decision may need to be reconsidered, possibly along the lines
   set  out  by  the  Advocate  General  in   Bolbol   v   Bev�ndorl�si   �s
   �llampolg�rs�gi Hivatal Case C-31/09.




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. The appellant is from Palestine. He has a long immigration  history  in
    this country, which we set out below.  Most  recently  he  was  refused
    leave to enter on 19 August 2011.  He appealed,  on  grounds  primarily
    relying on the Refugee Convention, to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge
    Scobbie,  basing  his  reasoning  almost  exclusively  on  a   previous
    determination of an appeal by the appellant, found that his account was
    not, in some important matters, worthy of  credit.   He  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant has  permission  to  appeal  to  this  Tribunal,
    granted by the First-tier Tribunal on grounds  that  largely  refer  to
    article 1D of the Refugee Convention and claim that  the finding as  to
    credibility, even if it were sound and complete, is  not  a  sufficient
    answer to it.

The Appellant's Immigration History

 2. The appellant was born in 1943.  His nationality  is  recorded  by  the
    Secretary of State as "Palestinian Authority".  Although "Palestine" is
    commonly used to describe a part of the Middle East and the authorities
    in place there, it is not a State recognised in  international  law  so
    far as we are aware; and it is not  capable  of  being  a  "country  of
    nationality" for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.  The appellant
    is stateless.  His country of former habitual residence is Lebanon.  He
    was born in Abllen, and grew up and lived in camps in  Lebanon  housing
    Palestinians.

 3. He first came to the United Kingdom in 2001.  He claimed asylum but was
    refused.  We do not know if he appealed:  in  any  event  he  left  the
    country reluctantly, returning to Lebanon  in  August  2004  under  the
    assisted voluntary return (AVR) scheme.

 4. In June 2007 he  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom,  travelling  on  a
    document issued by the Palestinian Authority  in  Beirut.   He  claimed
    asylum.  He was refused.  He appealed to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal.   Immigration  Judge  Forbes  dismissed  his  appeal   in   a
    determination prepared following a hearing  on  8  October  2007  ("the
    Forbes determination").  Reconsideration was  refused,  so  the  Forbes
    determination stood as the authoritative decision  on  the  appellant's
    claim.  By the end of 2007 his appeal rights were exhausted.

 5. Further submissions purporting to be a fresh claim  were  made  on  the
    appellant's behalf on 20 March 2008,  24  February  2009,  22  December
    2009, 29 April 2010 and 21  June  2010.   These  submissions  were  all
    rejected as not amounting to a fresh claim, or not one that would  have
    a realistic prospect of success before a Tribunal, within  the  meaning
    of paragraph 353 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules,  HC
    395.  Following the lodging of a Petition for Judicial  Review  of  the
    last decision it was, however, withdrawn and the appellant  was  issued
    with an immigration decision carrying  a  right  of  appeal,  which  he
    exercises by these proceedings.

 6. In the mean time, the appellant has twice applied for AVR  to  Lebanon.
    His applications were made on 23 September 2008  and  5  January  2010,
    that is to say during the period when he was making submissions to  the
    Secretary of State in support of his asylum  claim.   His  applications
    for AVR were rejected, because he had already had the  benefit  of  the
    scheme once and the rules of the AVR scheme do not allow  a  person  to
    have its benefits twice.  In his most recent submissions the  appellant
    said that he no longer wished to return voluntarily to Lebanon.

 7. These applications postdate  the  Forbes  determination  and,  although
    Judge Scobbie records them, he makes only the briefest comment on them.
     It is convenient for us to note their importance here.   It  is  that,
    while making his asylum claims, the appellant made it clear that he was
    not unwilling to return to Lebanon,  his  country  of  former  habitual
    residence.  On the contrary, he was  willing  to  return,  provided  he
    could obtain the benefits (that is to say, largely financial  benefits)
    of the AVR scheme.  His subsequent decision not to  pursue  the  matter
    adds nothing to his claim.  It must  now  be  clear  to  him  that  the
    Secretary of State is not prepared to make a  financial  grant  to  the
    appellant to leave the United Kingdom. We  note  that  the  appellant's
    declared change of mind in this regard is not said to be the result  of
    any change of circumstances in Lebanon.  His claim was and is based  on
    the events which he says happened before his last departure  from  that
    country in June 2007.

The Appellant's Claim and the Forbes Determination

 8. Immigration Judge Forbes set out the basis of the appellant's claim  in
    the terms in which it had been summarised by the Secretary of State  in
    refusing it.  There was and is no doubt that that summary was  accurate
    as far as it goes, and we adopt it too, subject to the comments we have
    already made on the phrase "Palestinian nationality":


       "6. You are a Palestinian national, having left Palestine originally
          in 1948.  You possess a Lebanese  travel  document  that  confirms
          your Palestinian nationality, and which allows  you  to  exit  and
          enter Lebanon.  You previously came to the United Kingdom in 2001,
          you claimed asylum which was refused and you returned  to  Lebanon
          voluntarily in August 2004.


       7.  You are claiming asylum in the UK on this occasion due to events
          which occurred when you returned to Lebanon.  You claim that  your
          son was kidnapped in April 2004 by an Islamic militant group Fatah
          al-Islam.  You returned to the  Naher  al-Bared  refugee  camp  in
          Lebanon, and began attempts to find  your  son  by  attempting  to
          infiltrate the organisation.


       8.  As a result of a close association with the militant  group  you
          were able to identify a secret tunnel network.   You  passed  this
          information to the Lebanese Army.  An attack was  carried  out  in
          May 2007 by the Lebanese Army on the tunnels in which 14 militants
          were killed. After the attack you sought refuge with the  Lebanese
          Army.  You believe the militants can correctly identify you as the
          informant and for this reason your life would be at risk on return
          to Lebanon."

 9. It is clear that at that stage the primary  claim  being  made  to  the
    Secretary of State and to the Tribunal was that the appellant's removal
    to Lebanon would breach the Refugee Convention because he was a refugee
    as defined by article 1A(2) of that Convention, having  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution for one of the  five  reasons  there  set  out  and
    unwilling to return to Lebanon because of that  fear.  The  immigration
    judge set out the terms of article 1A(2) and determined the  appeal  by
    reference to it.  After deciding that the  basic  story  on  which  the
    appellant relied was not true, he concluded in paragraph 39:

        "This appellant can safely  return  to  the  Lebanon.   He  has  no
        factual basis for the fear  he  has  expressed.  ...  He...  has  a
        network of family on whom he can rely."

10. In reaching that conclusion the  Immigration  Judge  had  also  had  to
    examine article 1D of the Convention.  As Laws LJ said in El-Ali [2002]
    EWCA Civ 1103, [2003] 1 WLR 95 at [22] "it is entirely plain, from  the
    travaux and the Convention's historical setting,  that  article  1D  is
    only concerned with Palestinian Arabs".  It reads as follows:

        "This Convention shall not apply to  persons  who  are  at  present
        receiving from organs  or  agencies  of  the  United  Nations  High
        Commissioner for Refugees  protection  or  assistance.   When  such
        protection or assistance has ceased for  any  reason,  without  the
        position of such persons being definitively settled  in  accordance
        with the relevant resolutions adopted by the  General  Assembly  of
        the United Nations, these persons shall ipso facto be  entitled  to
        the benefits of this Convention."

11. The "agency" in question, in relation  to  Palestinian  Arabs,  is  and
    always has  been,  the  United  Nations  Relief  and  Work  Agency  for
    Palestinian Refugees in the Near East ("UNRWA"), which runs  the  camps
    including those in which the present appellant has lived.

12. As Immigration Judge Forbes appreciated, the opening words  of  article
    1D might have been a complete answer to the appellant's case.   If  the
    Refugee Convention did not apply to the appellant,  his  removal  could
    not constitute a breach of it.  He dealt with that issue in  paragraphs
    16 and 18 of his determination as follows:

        "16.  The first issue for me is whether the appellant, as a citizen
             of Palestine who last lived in the Naher al-Bared refugee  camp
             in Lebanon under the protection of the UNHCR is entitled in his
             circumstances to argue that he is entitled to refugee status in
             this country.
        ...


        18.  There was no dispute that the Naher al-Bared refugee camp  was
             the scene of prolonged hostilities between Fatah  al-Islam  and
             the Lebanese Army from around mid-May 2007, the fighting having
             been instigated by the former organisation.  As a result of the
             fighting some 30000 Palestinians staying in  the  camp  had  to
             flee.  The appellant claims that  his  position  differed  from
             other Palestinians in the camp  on  the  basis  of  his  having
             informed on those  whom  the  Lebanese  Army  were  seeking  to
             detain.  He claims that he had no  protection  within  Lebanon.
             Such protection as he had prior to May 2007 appears  to  me  to
             have ceased.  Moreover he  claimed  he  could  distinguish  his
             position from those fleeing the  fighting.   It  seemed  to  me
             therefore  the  appellant  could  bring  himself   within   the
             provisions of the 1951  Convention  and  that  he  was  and  is
             entitled to make a claim for protection under the provisions of
             that instrument.

13. It was having cleared the deck in that way that he went on to reach the
    conclusions we have summarised.  In brief, article 1D did  not  prevent
    the appellant from being entitled to the benefits  of  the  Convention,
    but the facts in his case showed that  he  was  not  a  refugee.   Thus
    Immigration Judge Forbes dismissed the appeal.

14. As we have said,  Judge  Scobbie  based  his  own  conclusions  on  the
    credibility of the appellant's account of his son and his dealings with
    Fatah al-Islam very firmly on those in the  Forbes  determination.   It
    seems to us that he was entirely right to do so.  The appellants' claim
    to fear return to Lebanon is further undermined by his  willingness  to
    return to Lebanon if he could have access to the AVR scheme.  There  is
    no proper reason to suspect for an instant  that  the  appellant  is  a
    person with a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon.

Article 1D as an Inclusionary Provision

15. Immigration Judge Forbes decided that article 1D did  not  exclude  the
    appellant from the protection of the Refugee Convention.  He  did  not,
    however, consider whether that article might of itself offer protection
    to the appellant.  There have been a considerable number of cases where
    Palestinian Arabs who have travelled to countries  outside  the  Middle
    East have claimed that, on its terms, article 1D makes them  Convention
    refugees because of  the  wording  of  its  second  sentence.   At  its
    boldest, the claim has been that a person who has left  an  UNRWA  camp
    and travelled to (for example) the United  Kingdom  can  say  that  the
    protection previously given to him by UNRWA "has ceased for any reason"
    and that he is "ipso facto entitled to the  benefits"  of  the  Refugee
    Convention.  The unattractiveness of that argument based as  it  is  on
    the benefits of  the  Convention  accruing  to  an  individual  by  his
    voluntary choice rather than from need, has been widely recognised; but
    the precise  interpretation  of  article  1D  has  caused  considerable
    difficulty at the highest levels.

16. In El-Ali itself, the Court of Appeal endorsed the  conclusion  of  the
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal that the phrase "at present" in  the  first
    sentence of article 1D meant "at the time the  Convention  enters  into
    force", i.e. in 1951.  It followed  that  the  benefit  of  the  second
    sentence, whatever it might be, could not be claimed by a  person  born
    since 1951, as both the appellants before the court  were.   The  Court
    therefore did not need  to  decide  what  the  meaning  of  the  second
    sentence was.  Laws LJ (with whom the rest of  the  Court  agreed)  did
    not, however, leave any real room for doubt about what his  view  would
    have been.  His examination of the travaux pr�paratoires  had  led  him
    clearly to the conclusion at [15] that those Palestinian Arabs who were
    displaced and fled from their homes on the declaration of the State  of
    Israel on 15 May 1948 "were considered at all  relevant  stages  to  be
    refugees" and "were regarded, in and out  of  the  United  Nations,  as
    belonging to  a  special  category".   They  were  therefore,  although
    refugees,  dealt  with  outside  the  Convention  under   the   special
    protection not of the UNHCR but of UNRWA.  The second sentence was,  in
    Laws LJ's view, at [47] intended to have effect:

        "on the happening of a particular overall event: the  cessation  of
        UNRWA assistance.  [The drafters] did not contemplate that  article
        1D would apply piecemeal and haphazardly, its scope marked  off  by
        reference to the persons who at any given moment were or  were  not
        within the UNRWA territories receiving assistance...".

17. This, with the greatest respect, is an entirely coherent  view.   Those
    who were covered by article 1D were (already) refugees; they  were  (in
    1951) already receiving separate and special treatment apart  from  the
    UNHCR; if (and only if) UNRWA ceased to function, they would need to be
    considered under the general provisions of the Refugee Convention.   As
    we have said, however, Laws LJ's views on the  meaning  of  the  second
    sentence were obiter: only the interpretation of the first sentence was
    required for the determination of the appeal.

18. The scene now shifts to the Court of Justice  of  the  European  Union.
    That Court has, of course, no  direct  jurisdiction  over  the  Refugee
    Convention: the European  Union  is  not  a  party  to  the  Convention
    (although all Member States are) and the great majority of States party
    to the Convention are not subject to the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court.
    But the Refugee Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC  imposes  on  Member
    States  as  a  matter  of  Community  law,  obligations  equivalent  or
    identical to those already applying  under  the  Convention.  Thus  the
    Court acquires a jurisdiction  to  rule  on  the  meaning,  within  the
    Community  alone,  of  the  wording  of   the   Convention,   including
    specifically article 1D, which appears  in  the  Directive  at  article
    12.1(a).  There  is,  however,  an  important  difference  between  the
    treatment of other provisions of the Refugee Convention and  this  one.
    Whereas others are imported into Community  law  simply  by  using  the
    words of the Convention in the Directive,  article  12.1(a)  retains  a
    specific reference to the Convention:


        "Article 12


        Exclusion


        1.    A third country national or a stateless  person  is  excluded
        from being a refugee, if:


           (a) he or she falls within the scope  of  Article  1  D  of  the
           Geneva Convention, relating to  protection  or  assistance  from
           organs or agencies of the United Nations other than  the  United
           Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  When such protection or
           assistance has ceased for any reason, without  the  position  of
           such persons being definitely settled  in  accordance  with  the
           Nations, these persons shall  ipso  facto  be  entitled  to  the
           benefits of this Directive;"

19. The reference here to article 1D of the Convention  has  at  least  two
    consequences.  One is that the Directive recognises that the  exclusion
    is by  reference  not  to  its  own  terms  but  to  those  of  another
    instrument, on the meaning of which there might be discussion or ruling
    on a scale wider than that of Europe alone.  The other is that a ruling
    of the CJEU on this article of the Directive is a ruling  not  only  on
    the meaning of the Directive but also on the meaning of article  1D  of
    the Convention.  Thus,  whatever  may  be  the  autonomous  meaning  of
    article 1D (to use the language of Lord Steyn in SSHD v Adan [2001] Imm
    AR 253, 260-268), the Court's view is itself a view on that  autonomous
    meaning, and so appears to bind all national courts in Member states.

20. The  Court's  view  was  first  sought  in  Bolbol  v  Bev�ndorl�si  �s
    �llampolg�rs�gi Hivatal Case C-31/09), a reference by the  Metropolitan
    Court of Budapest.  The questions referred were as follows:-

        "For  the  purposes  of  Article  12(1)(a)  of  Council   Directive
2004/83/EC:


          1. Must someone be regarded as a person receiving  the  protection
             and assistance of a United Nations agency merely by  virtue  of
             the fact that he is entitled to assistance or protection or  is
             it also necessary for him actually to  avail  himself  of  that
             protection or assistance?


          2. Does cessation of the agency's protection  or  assistance  mean
             residence outside the agency's area of operations, cessation of
             the agency and cessation of the possibility  of  receiving  the
             agency's protection or assistance or,  possibly,  an  objective
             obstacle such that the person entitled  thereto  is  unable  to
             avail himself of that protection or assistance?


          3. Do the benefits of the directive mean recognition as a refugee,
             or either of  the  two  forms  of  protection  covered  by  the
             directive (recognition as a refugee and the grant of subsidiary
             protection), according to the choice made by the Member  State,
             or, possibly, [does it mean] neither automatically  but  merely
             [lead to] inclusion [of the person concerned within] the  scope
             ratione personae of the Directive?"

21. In answering the first question the Court (Grand Chamber)  specifically
    disapproved the decision in El-Ali:

          "47. Contrary to the line of  argument  developed  by  the  United
             Kingdom Government, it cannot be  maintained,  as  an  argument
             against  including  persons  displaced   following   the   1967
             hostilities within the  scope  of  Article  1D  of  the  Geneva
             Convention, that only those Palestinians who became refugees as
             a result of the 1948 conflict who were receiving protection  or
             assistance from UNRWA at the time when the original version  of
             the Geneva Convention was concluded  in  1951  are  covered  by
             Article 1D  of  that  convention,  and  therefore,  by  Article
             12(1)(a) of the Directive.


          48. The Geneva Convention,  in  its  original  1951  version,  was
             amended by the Protocol on the Status of Refugees of 31 January
             1967  specifically  to  allow  the   interpretation   of   that
             convention to adapt and to allow account to  be  taken  of  new
             categories of refugees, other than those who became refugees as
             a result of 'events occurring before 1 January 1951'."


          49. Therefore, in order to determine whether a person such  as  Ms
             Bolbol comes within a situation envisaged by the first sentence
             of Article 12(1)(a) of the Directive, it must  be  ascertained,
             as the referring court asks, whether it suffices  that  such  a
             person is eligible to receive the assistance provided by  UNRWA
             or whether it must be established that he has  availed  himself
             of that assistance.


          50.  Article  1D  of  the  Geneva  Convention,  to  which  Article
             12(1)(a) of the Directive  refers,  merely  excludes  from  the
             scope of that convention those  persons  who  are  'at  present
             receiving' protection or assistance from an organ or agency  of
             the United Nations other than UNHCR".

22. The Court went on to conclude that as Ms  Bolbol  had,  on  the  facts,
    never availed herself of UNRWA assistance,  she  was  not  excluded  by
    article 1D.  That being the  case,  the  Court  needed  to  express  no
    opinion on the other questions referred, and did not do so.

23. Bolbol clearly overrules El-Ali; and  if  the  temporal  interpretation
    adopted there cannot stand, it might well be wrong  to  attribute  very
    much weight to the rest of Laws LJ's views, which lose their  claim  to
    be part of a coherent whole.  He, it will  be  remembered,  had  opined
    that the second sentence of article 1D applied only to the cessation of
    UNRWA's activity, and had no other  application  to  the  cessation  of
    assistance to an individual. That is a view that may need  revision  in
    the light of the decision that the first sentence does  not  mean  what
    Laws LJ thought it did.

24. In these circumstances, it is  right  to  look  at  what  the  Advocate
    General (Sharpston) said in her opinion in Bolbol.  After arguing  that
    the temporal position taken in El-Ali was wrong and  therefore  writing
    against the background of the meaning of the first sentence of  article
    1D that was adopted by  the  Court  she  said  this  at  paragraph  90,
    summarising her conclusions:

          "90. The construction that I propose in dealing with each  of  the
          four points of interpretation involves reading the  two  sentences
          that together comprise Article 1D in a way that will generate  the
          following set of outcomes:


              a)  a  displaced  Palestinian  who  is  not  receiving   UNRWA
                 protection or assistance is not excluded  ratione  personae
                 from the scope of the Convention: he  is  therefore  to  be
                 treated like any other applicant for refugee status and  to
                 be assessed under Article 1A (avoidance of overlap  between
                 UNRWA and  the  UNHCR;  application  of  the  principle  of
                 universal protection);


              b) a displaced Palestinian  who  is  receiving  protection  or
                 assistance from UNRWA is excluded ratione personae from the
                 scope of the Convention whilst he is  in  receipt  of  that
                 protection or  assistance  (avoidance  of  overlap  between
                 UNRWA and the UNHCR);


              c) a displaced Palestinian who  was  receiving  protection  or
                 assistance from UNRWA but who, for whatever reason, can  no
                 longer obtain protection or assistance from UNRWA ceases to
                 be  excluded  ratione  personae  from  the  scope  of   the
                 Convention  (application  of  the  principle  of  universal
                 protection);  however,  whether  he  is  then  ipso   facto
                 entitled to the benefits of the Convention or  not  depends
                 on  why  he  can  no  longer  obtain  such  protection   or
                 assistance;


              d) if such a displaced Palestinian can no longer benefit  from
                 UNRWA protection or assistance  as  a  result  of  external
                 circumstances over which he  had  no  control,  he  has  an
                 automatic right  to  refugee  status  (application  of  the
                 principle of special treatment and consideration);


              e) if such a displaced Palestinian can no longer benefit  from
                 UNRWA protection or assistance  as  a  result  of  his  own
                 actions, he cannot claim automatic refugee status  assessed
                 on  its  merits  under  Article  1A  (application  of   the
                 principle of universal protection and  fair  treatment  for
                 all genuine refugees; proportionate interpretation  of  the
                 extent  of  special  treatment  and  consideration  to   be
                 afforded to displaced Palestinians).

25. That analysis does not have the authority of the Court but, it  clearly
    deserves respect, particularly given the fate of El-Ali.

26. Since judgment was given in Bolbol, there have been at least two  other
    references of cases raising questions relating to  article  1D  of  the
    Refugee Convention.  The judgements may or  may  not  provide  all  the
    necessary answers.  For the appellant before us Mr  Bryce  suggested  a
    reference in this case too, but we do not think that is necessary.

27. The position is that the Secretary of State has been almost  supine  in
    her approach to the appellant's claim.  It must have  been  clear  from
    the beginning that the case was  factually  and  legally  complex.   If
    there were any doubt at the beginning, there was  none  after  November
    2011, when in the presence of a Presenting Officer, Mr
    Bryce obtained an adjournment of the hearing precisely because  he  had
    been recently instructed in a case which the Scottish Legal  Aid  Board
    recognised was suitable for an appearance by  counsel.   Despite  that,
    the Secretary of State chose not  to  be  represented  at  all  at  the
    substantive hearing,  and  when  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted, there was, so far as we can see, no response from
    the Secretary of State.   There  was  no  response  to  the  Tribunal's
    invitation to make submissions on whether a hearing was  required.   At
    the  hearing,  the  Presenting  Officer  confined  his  submissions  to
    reliance on Laws LJ's obiter remarks in El-Ali on the  meaning  of  the
    second sentence of article 1D, and frankly accepted  that  he  was  not
    able to deal  in  detail  with  developments  in  the  law  since  that
    judgement was given.  We do not criticise  Mr  Mullen.   It  does  not,
    however, appear to us that the Secretary of State has shown  very  much
    anxiety to win this appeal at hearings.

28. We have set out the principal facts above in referring to  the  earlier
    determinations.  Mr Bryce's substantive  written  submissions  were  as
    follows:

        "12. The application of the A-G's involuntary displacement test  to
             the facts  of  the  present  appeal  are  straightforward.   On
             Devaseelan principles the Appellant, while  he  maintains  that
             his entire account has been truthful, is fixed with IJ  Forbes'
             finding that his presence in Naher al-Bared camp  was  not  for
             the reasons that he has stated.   Nevertheless  on  those  same
             principles the finding in IJ  Forbes'  determination  that  the
             Appellant was physically present when the camp was cleared must
             also stand.  He did not return to his  camp  of  Al-Bass.   The
             destruction and evacuation of the camp in what must  have  been
             terrifying   circumstances    must    constitute    involuntary
             displacement.  IJ  Forbes  at  para  18  of  his  determination
             effectively makes a finding to that effect.  It is  nothing  to
             the point that others who had actually  been  resident  in  the
             camp, which the Appellant had  not,  were  displaced  to  other
             refugee  camps.   This  Appellant  was  displaced  out  of  the
             relevant geographical area.


          13.   Other  circumstances  which  may  also  be  relevant  to  a
             contention of involuntary displacement are that the Appellant's
             means of livelihood had been destroyed in  Israeli  bombing  of
             southern Lebanon and his subsequent economic dependency on  his
             sons who are no longer able to support him."


29. It seems to  us  that  those  submissions  have  clear  merit  and  are
    sufficient to bring to  the  appellant  the  benefits  of  the  Refugee
    Convention.  The analysis of the Advocate  General,  bolstered  by  the
    decision in Bolbol, show that the Immigration Judge was wrong to  apply
    El-Ali, and to take the approach to the facts, that he did.

30. We shall therefore re-make the decision and  allow  the  appeal,  which
    accordingly succeeds on Refugee Convention grounds.  That is not to say
    precisely that the appellant is  a  refugee:  he  is  entitled  to  the
    benefits of the Refugee Convention,  including  those  prohibiting  his
    removal.

31. We recognise, however, that it is possible that the judgements  of  the
    CJEU on the references already made may show  that  our  approach,  and
    that of Advocate-General Sharpston, is mistaken.  For that reason while
    allowing the appellant's appeal we extend time for any  application  to
    this Tribunal for permission to appeal to the  Inner  House  so  as  to
    expire two weeks after  publication  of  the  CJEU's  decision  on  the
    reference in C-364/11 (Abd El Karim and Mustafa).  (For  the  avoidance
    of doubt, the previous sentence overrides  any  time  limit  stated  in
    documents accompanying this  determination  when  it  is  sent  to  the
    parties.)
