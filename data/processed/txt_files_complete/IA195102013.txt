Representation:

For the Appellant:              Mr S Walker, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr Bellara, Counsel (Direct Access)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against
    refusal of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  on  the
    ground that the decision was not in accordance with the law, and that a
    lawful decision on her Tier 1  application  remained  outstanding.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity  order,  and  I  do  not
    consider that such an order is warranted for these proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of India, whose date of birth is 5  December
    1988.  She first entered the United Kingdom on 24  December  2010  with
    valid entry clearance as a student.  Leave ran until 27 November  2012,
    on which date the claimant made her Tier 1 application.  She did so, on
    the basis that she had access to �200,000 in  funds  from  third  party
    funders in India.  There were four funders two  of  them  had  a  joint
    account with the Bank  of  Maharashtra.   The  other  two  funders  had
    individual accounts with the same  bank.   The  holders  of  the  joint
    account were Mr Kunalkumar Babubhai Vaghasiya ("KBV") and  Mr  Babubhai
    Veljibhai Vaghasiya ("BVV").

 3. On 17 May 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing the
    claimant's application.  As evidence of access to at least �200,000  to
    invest in business in the UK she provided third  party  documents  from
    three sources.  But the evidence she provided was not acceptable.   She
    claimed to have access to sums of �128,000 from KBV and BVV.   But  the
    bank letter provided was a scanned  copy  and  not  an  original  copy.
    Also, the letter did not state that the bank was regulated.  The  third
    party declaration was not signed by her, and although  she  provided  a
    separate declaration this was not acceptable.  Also, while KBV and  BVV
    had provided a legal representative letter, this did  not  contain  the
    identification number, place of issue or the date of issue and  expiry.
    Although a copy of an identity card had been  provided,  this  was  not
    acceptable sufficient evidence as per  paragraph  41-SD(b)(ii)  of  the
    Rules.

 4. Similar, but not identical, objections were raised with regard  to  the
    evidence of funding from Mr K Chaudhari ("KDC") and from Mr D Chaudhari
    ("DJC").  The bank letter provided  was  a  scanned  copy  and  not  an
    original copy.  Also the letter did not  contain  the  address  of  the
    third party, nor did it state the bank was regulated.  The third  party
    declaration was not signed by the claimant.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Seelhoff sitting in the First-
    tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross on 23 April 2014.  Mr Bellara appeared on
    behalf of the claimant, and Miss Leyshon, Presenting Officer,  appeared
    on behalf of the Secretary of State.  At paragraph 9 of his  subsequent
    determination,   Judge   Seelhoff   records   that   the    appellant's
    representative submitted a bundle which included  an  updated  lawyer's
    letter from India, an updated letter from the bank, and a copy  of  the
    covering letter under which the original documents  were  sent  to  the
    respondent by recorded delivery on 24 December 2012.  There was also  a
    recorded delivery receipt for the same.

 6. It is recorded at paragraph 10 of the determination that in the  course
    of the hearing it became apparent that the original documents  attached
    to the letter of 24 December 2012 were all on the Home Office file,  so
    it was clear that the letter and enclosures had been  received  by  the
    Home Office.  There was a discussion whether these  original  documents
    were admissible.  Miss Leyshon submitted that only documents sent  with
    the application were admissible.

 7. At paragraph 12 the judge observes that  Annex  P  to  the  Immigration
    Rules contained a list of banks and  financial  institutions  in  India
    which  are  specifically  recognised,  and  that  the   list   includes
    Maharashtra Bank.

 8. At paragraph 13 the judge records that, during further  oral  argument,
    he asked Miss Leyshon if she is willing to concede  that  the  original
    documents held on the Home Office file were genuine.  She said she  did
    not believe that they had been examined by those  instructing  her  and
    that she was not in  a  position  to  accept  that  they  were  genuine
    documents.  Given that  she  was  not  in  a  position  to  accept  the
    documents as genuine, he indicated that he was in  agreement  with  the
    suggestion of Mr Bellara that he ought to find that  the  decision  was
    not in accordance with the law.

 9. The judge went on  in  his  subsequent  determination  to  explain  the
    rationale for this finding.  At paragraph 15  he  cited  sub-paragraphs
    (a)  and  (b)  of  paragraph  245AA  as  they  stood  at  the  date  of
    application.  At paragraph 16 he held there  had  not  been  compliance
    with sub-paragraph (b)(iii) as the UK Border Agency had  not  contacted
    the  applicant  or  his  representative  in  writing,  to  request  the
    originals.  Had the procedure been followed,  the  Secretary  of  State
    would have been directed to the letter of 24 December which had already
    been submitted and which had clearly already found its way to the  Home
    Office file.  The decision was flawed procedurally as a result  of  the
    failure to  follow  the  provisions  in  the  Immigration  Rules  which
    specified steps to be taken in the decision  making  process.   Because
    the Home Office had not formally examined the  original  documents,  it
    would not be appropriate to proceed to allow  the  appeal  outright  as
    their authenticity  needed  to  be  tested.   On  his  reading  of  the
    documents, the Secretary of State also needed to  consider  whether  it
    was appropriate to waive the  requirement  that  the  bank  letter  had
    stated that Maharashtra Bank was regulated in  India,  given  that  the
    bank was expressly  acknowledged  and  recognised  in  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 25 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Fisher granted permission to appeal
    for the following reasons:

         In his determination, the judge stated, at paragraph 11, that where
         copies of documents had been sent with  an  application,  the  case
         worker was under an obligation to contact the appellant to  request
         the originals.  However, that ignores  paragraph  245AA(c)  of  the
         Rules, which states that such requests will not be made  where  the
         application would be refused for other reasons.  At  paragraph  12,
         the judge observed that legal letters from India did not  meet  the
         evidential requirements, but decided  that  documents  attached  to
         them should be read as a whole.  It is arguable that, in so  doing,
         the judge replaced the requirements of paragraph 41-SD with his own
         interpretation.  It is  arguable  that  the  judge  ought  to  have
         dismissed the  appeal,  rather  than  allowing  it  to  the  extent
         indicated.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me, I received submissions from Mr Bellara and Mr
    Walker on the question of  whether  the  decision  was  vitiated  by  a
    material error of law.  I ruled in the Secretary of State's  favour  on
    this question, and indicated my reasons for doing so in short form.  My
    extended reasons are set out below.  On the question  of  remaking,  Mr
    Bellara submitted that the decision should be remade  in  his  client's
    favour.  He relied, among other things, on a modification to  paragraph
    245AA of the Rules which he said had been introduced in February  2014.
    He submitted that, as from that date, paragraph  245AA  provided  inter
    alia as follows:

         (d)  if the applicant had submitted a specified document:

             (i)  in the wrong format; or

             (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or

             (iii)     which  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
                  information, but the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:

                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application,

                  (2)  the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
                      document, or

                  (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory  body;  the
                      application may be granted  exceptionally,  providing
                      the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration  Officer  or
                      the Secretary of State is  satisfied  that  specified
                      documents are genuine and the applicant meets all the
                      other requirements.

12. Although  the  above  provision  was  not  in  force  at  the  date  of
    application or date of decision, Mr  Bellara  submitted  this  did  not
    matter as sub-paragraph (d) merely codified a  pre-existing  discretion
    which the case worker could have exercised when reviewing the documents
    provided by the appellant.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. As I informed the parties  at  the  hearing,  the  primary  ground  for
    finding an error of law is that the judge failed to take  into  account
    paragraph 245AA(c) which at all material times provided as follows:

         The UK Border Agency will not request documents where  a  specified
         document has not been submitted; or where the UK Border Agency does
         not anticipate that addressing the omission or error referred to in
         sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the application will
         be refused for other reasons.

14. So the judge failed to direct himself that the  obligation  under  sub-
    paragraph (b) to request originals was overridden where the  UK  Border
    Agency did not anticipate that the provision of originals would lead to
    a grant of leave, because the application would be  refused  for  other
    reasons.

15. The appellant's application stood to be refused for other  reasons,  as
    there had not been full compliance with the requirements  of  paragraph
    41-SD with regard to the content of the bank letters  and  third  party
    declarations.  So, on the face of it, there was no breach of  paragraph
    245AA(b) by the Secretary of State not requesting the originals of  the
    specified documents relied on in support of the application.  Thus, the
    judge erred in law in finding  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  in
    breach.

16. Mr Bellara submitted that the judge's error was not  material,  as  the
    outcome  could  be  justified  for  other  reasons   not   specifically
    articulated by him.  But since the sole ground of the  judge's  finding
    that the decision was not in accordance with the law was the  Secretary
    of State's alleged failure to comply with  the  obligation  under  sub-
    paragraph (b) of paragraph 245AA, such arguments are only  relevant  to
    the question of how the decision should be remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

17. Mr Bellara submitted that the Secretary of State ought  to  have  taken
    into account the original documents provided under cover of a letter of
    24 December 2012, and that as  a  result  of  her  not  doing  so,  the
    claimant was deprived of the possibility of discretion being  exercised
    in her favour with regard to non-compliance with the other requirements
    identified in the refusal letter.  In short, if the Secretary of  State
    had been persuaded of the authenticity of the original  documents,  she
    might  have  been  prepared  to  waive  compliance   with   the   other
    requirements.

18. In order for an applicant to obtain the relief of a  finding  that  the
    decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law,  it  must  first  be
    established that  the  applicant  has  been  a  victim  of  common  law
    unfairness;  and/or  that  there  has  been  a  breach  of   evidential
    flexibility principles, as codified in paragraph 245AA or otherwise.

19. Since it was a reasonable exercise of  discretion,  and  in  accordance
    with paragraph 245AA, for the Secretary of State  not  to  request  the
    originals of the specified documents, and not to take into account  the
    documents provided under cover of the letter of 24 December  2012,  the
    claimant has arguably not established a prima facie case.

20. But I have also asked myself the question whether the  deficiencies  in
    the copy specified documents provided by the claimant were minor  ones,
    such that there was a legitimate  expectation  that  the  Secretary  of
    State would overlook them or at  least  give  her  the  opportunity  to
    provide the missing information.

21. Mr Bellara  referred  me  to  the  published  IDIs  on  PBS  evidential
    flexibility, valid as from 28 March 2014.  These provides as follows on
    the topic of obtaining additional information:

         Before you request additional evidence you must have enough  reason
         to believe the information exists.  This is limited to cases where:

           . documents  (for  example  bank  statements)  omitting  from  a
             series;

           . photocopies of the required documentation have been  received;
             or

           . a document is in  the  wrong  format:  "wrong  format"  covers
             documents which contain all  of  the  substantive  information
             required by the Immigration Rules but are not laid out in  the
             way described in the Rules.  For example,  where  a  specified
             document should be submitted on letter headed  paper  ...  you
             must refuse the application if it would fall for refusal  even
             if the missing information was provided, or if a  minor  error
             was corrected.  You must not request any  missing  information
             if it cannot change the decision on the case.

22. Mr Bellara initially submitted that the missing information relating to
    the contact details of the third party funders fell into  the  category
    of a specified document being provided in the wrong format.  But in the
    light of the clarification in the IDIs as to what is constituted  by  a
    document being in the wrong format, he did not maintain the stance.

23. Instead, he relied on  sub-paragraph  (d)  paragraph  245AA  which  was
    introduced into the Rules on 1 October 2013 (not February 2014).  I  am
    prepared  to  accept  that  this  provision  codifies  a   pre-existing
    discretion, and  that  this  provision  assists  the  claimant  on  the
    evidential issue of the bank being  regulated.   The  bank  letter  was
    found not to contain all of the specified information, but the  missing
    information about the bank being regulated is verifiable from  Annex  P
    (and presumably from the bank's website).

24. But the missing information in respect of the contact  details  of  all
    four party funders is not verifiable  from  other  documents  submitted
    with the application or  from  a  relevant  website.   Moreover,  as  I
    canvassed with Mr Bellara at the hearing, the Indian lawyer has on  the
    face of it failed to establish satisfactorily the identity of  KBV  and
    BVV.  The document relied on by the Indian lawyer as establishing their
    identity (see E2 of the Home Office bundle) is not on the face of it an
    identity  document.   It  is  a  document  issued  by  the  Indian  tax
    department, not an identity card, as was  provided  by  the  other  two
    funders.  While the document issued by the  tax  department  refers  to
    both KBV and BVV, it only contains a photograph of one individual.  The
    photocopied document at E2 also only contains the signature of KBV.

25. At the hearing before me, it was also established that the original  of
    the document at E2 had not in fact been provided  under  cover  of  the
    letter of 24 December 2012.   What  was  provided  was  merely  another
    photocopy.

26. In conclusion, the deficiencies in the  specified  documents  were  not
    minor ones such as arguably to trigger an obligation on the part of the
    Secretary of State to seek further information or  documents  from  the
    claimant before making a decision on her application.  So she does  not
    discharge the burden of proving that the decision appealed against  was
    not in accordance with the Rules or was  otherwise  not  in  accordance
    with the law.

27. No alternative claim under Article 8 was pursued before me.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal by the claimant against the  refusal  of  leave  to
remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant is dismissed under the Rules.
