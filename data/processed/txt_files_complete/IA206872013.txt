Representation:

For the appellant:     Mrs H Gure of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of the  Ghana  born  on  4  August  1986.   He
   appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of   the
   respondent dated 17 May 2013 to refuse to  issue  him  with  a  permanent
   residence card as an extended family member of an EEA  national  pursuant
   to regulation 15 (1) (b) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006 (the  '2006  Regulations')  because  he  has  failed  to
   demonstrate that he has resided for a continuous period of five years  in
   accordance with the 2006 Regulations. In a decision of  7  October  2011,
   First tier Judge P. J. G.  White  granted  the  appellant  permission  to
   appeal to the Upper Tribunal stating that it is arguable that the  First-
   tier Tribunal Judge erred because he gave inadequate reasons for  finding
   that the sponsor had not been in  continuous  employment  in  the  United
   Kingdom since 6 April 2009 given  that  at  paragraph  5  and  6  of  the
   determination, the Judge accepted that the sponsor had  been  earning  an
   income in all the relevant tax years.


2. Thus the appeal came before me for hearing on 18 June 2014.


Findings of the first-tier Tribunal

3. The main issues in the proceedings before the  First-tier  Tribunal  were
   whether the appellant's sister was  a  qualified  person  exercising  her
   treaty rights continuously for five years in the United Kingdom due to  a
   perceived gap in her  employment.  The  Judge  found  that  the  evidence
   submitted in support of the appeal was very short on detail  and  nowhere
   in the sponsor's witness statement has the very  substantial  falling  of
   income been explained. The sponsor in the course of  oral  evidence  said
   that she has always worked since she arrived in the United Kingdom  apart
   from one period between April 2010 and August 2010. This is reflected  in
   the start dates given for the sources of income for the tax years  ending
   in 5 April 2010 and 2011. The sponsor said that she was looking for  work
   during this period. There is no  evidence  to  support  this  claim.  She
   confirmed also that the letter from HM Revenue and Customs  contained  an
   accurate summary of all work done. However, she said also the  pay  slips
   at pages 88 to 93 of the appellant's bundle would not  reflected  in  the
   summary, for reasons which she was unable to explain. The Judge concluded
   that in light of  all  the  evidence,  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
   appellant's EEA national sponsor had been in continuous employment from 6
   April 2009 to date and accordingly found  that  the  appellant  does  not
   satisfy the requirements of paragraph 15 (1) (b) of the 2006 Regulations.


   The grounds of appeal


4. The appellant's grounds of appeal  argue  as  follows.   The  refusal  is
   against the weight of evidence as the  Secretary  of  State  ignored  the
   sponsor's overall active employment from 2006-2012. The decision  is  not
   in accordance with the law  as  it  ignores  the  appellant's  continuous
   presence and employment throughout the relevant five years. The  decision
   is an unlawful interference with the appellant and sponsor's family life.
   The decision is unlawful interference with the appellant's  private  life
   and the Tribunal is invited to allow this appeal.

The respondent's Rule 24 response

5. The respondent's response to the grounds of appeal state  the  following.
   The respondent opposes the appellant's appeal and will  submit  that  the
   Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  directed  himself  appropriately.  The
   determination at paragraph 7 indicates that the evidence was "very  short
   on detail". The Judge's findings that no explanation has  been  given  in
   the sponsor's witness statement for the very substantial falling  off  in
   income in his findings finding in that regard were entirely open  to  the
   Judge to make. The Judge said that there was no evidence to  support  the
   claim that the appellant was looking for work and why the HM Revenue  and
   Customs summary did not reflect the sponsor's payslips.

Error of law hearing

6. At the hearing I heard submissions from both parties as to whether  there
   was an error of law in the determination. There was no dispute  that  the
   appellant and his sponsor have been in this country  for  at  least  five
   years as they have been here since 2007.


7. Miss Gure made the following submissions. The Judge  fell  into  material
   error when he stated in his determination  that  the  appellant  has  not
   provided evidence that she has been working continuously  "from  6  April
   2009 to date". The appellant does not have to prove that she has been  in
   employment to date but only for the five years. As the Secretary of State
   was not represented at the hearing before the first-Tier Tribunal,  there
   was no cross examination of the  sponsor  and  therefore  no  credibility
   issues were raised so  therefore  the  Judge  should  have  accepted  the
   sponsor's evidence. The sponsor was not in employment for four months and
   she explained in her statement she was looking for work. That  in  itself
   does not disqualify her from being treated as a worker in accordance with
   the 2006 Regulations.


8.  Miss  Isherwood  in  her  submissions  stated  the  following  which   I
   summarise. There is no  material  error  of  law  in  the  determination.
   Paragraph 8 of the determination acknowledges the period of time that has
   to be covered. The Judge was aware of the respondent's position  even  if
   there was no cross examination at the hearing of the First-tier Tribunal.
   The Judge did not have to accept  the  sponsor's  evidence.  There  is  a
   shortfall in income for which no explanation has been given.


9. Miss Gure in reply said that the Judge referred to  pages  88-93  of  the
   appellant's bundle of documents which was not in the summary of  the  tax
   and revenue letter. It was not up to  the  sponsor  to  explain  why  the
   Inland Revenue did not put this evidence into their  summary.  The  Judge
   did not consider the further evidence provided at the hearing which was a
   letter from the Inland Revenue stating the appellant's earnings. The  gap
   of four months has been explained by the sponsor which is  that  she  was
   looking for work.

Error of law decision

10. I find that there is an error of  law  in  the  determination  of  Judge
   White in relation to the application of the 2006 Regulations.  The  Judge
   did not give clear reasons for why he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal.
   He appears to make contradictory findings as  to  whether  the  appellant
   sponsor was in full-time employment for  five  years.  He  also  said  at
   paragraph 8 that  the  appellant  sponsor  has  not  been  in  continuous
   employment "from 6 April 2009 to date". The respondent's  case  was  that
   the sponsor ceased  to  be  a  qualified  person  from  July  2009  until
   September 2010 a gap of some 14 months and there was no  suggestion  that
   she is not currently employed.


11. As I have found an error of law, it was agreed between the parties  that
   the appeal be reheard by way of submission.


   Rehearing of appeal by way of submissions


12. It was agreed between the parties that the issues in the rehearing  were
   whether the appellant's EEA national family member remained  a  qualified
   person in accordance with the 2006 Regulations in the gap  of  employment
   in this country. There was no  dispute  that  the  appellant  sponsor  is
   currently working in this country and exercising  her  treaty  rights.  I
   also take into account that I have to consider evidence as of the date of
   the hearing.


13. Miss Gure and Miss Isherwood however disagreed as to how long  this  gap
   consisted of. Miss Gure said that the gap was only for four months  while
   Miss Isherwood said that the gap in employment was from July  2009  until
   September 2010 a gap of some 14 months.


14. Miss Gure made the following submissions.  The  appellant  has  provided
   sufficient evidence from the HM Revenue and Customs which states that she
   has been in employment every year since she has been in this country. The
   refusal letter gives the gap from 2009-2011. The first  page  of  the  HM
   Revenue and Customs summary letter for the appellant's income states that
   the appellant has worked from April 2008 until April 2010.


15. The appellant's explanation for why she could not work from August 2010-
   September 2010 was that  she  was  employed  at  the  Commercial  Limited
   although it does not show the end date of the  employment.  The  evidence
   from HM Revenue and Customs shows that the sponsor was in employment. The
   sponsor's witness statement explained at paragraph  2  that  the  sponsor
   worked for an agency from October 2010 until March  2011.  The  documents
   which were submitted to  the  respondent  did  not  include  evidence  HM
   Revenue and Customs which the Judge has ignored.


16. Miss Isherwood said that I should dismiss  the  appeal  HM  Revenue  and
   Customs documents show that there is a gap from April 2009  until  August
   2010 which is for about 13 months.  The  appellant's  income  dropped  to
   �430.10 and applying the case of Begum this cannot be  considered  to  be
   genuine economic activity because  it  is  at  such  a  small  scale  and
   marginal. Therefore the appellant was not a worker when she  was  earning
   this minimum amount. The sponsor's  witness  statement  is  of  extremely
   limited value as she does not explain why she ceased working. There is no
   evidence to support the sponsor's evidence that she was looking for  work
   and therefore does not satisfy regulation 6 (2) of the 2006  regulations.
   All the sponsor says is that she is looking for employment  but  the  gap
   was for more than six months and therefore she ceased to be  a  qualified
   person because there was a break in the five years  continuous  residence
   as a qualified worker.


17. Miss Gure in reply stated the following. The sponsor  was  working  from
   2012 and 2013 and therefore the refusal letter with states  that  sponsor
   has to leave the country as he has no basis to remain is incorrect.  Miss
   Isherwood is only referring to the income from one job which  started  on
   13 September and which does not show an end date.  The  sponsor  gave  an
   explanation that she worked for an agency which is not reflected  in  the
   HM Revenue and Customs summary of her employment. The  appellant  sponsor
   has a history of working and has explained her true  position.  The  last
   job which she was earning �30,000 was discontinued and that  is  why  she
   was looking for additional work and was earning a low income.


Findings


  18. The relevant provisions of the 2006 Regulations are the following:
      "Permanent right of residence
      15. - (1)   The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in

                       was  the  result  of  an  accident  at  work  or   an
                       occupational disease;
              (f)      a person who -
                  (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with

              Kingdom for a period exceeding two consecutive years.
        (3)      But this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b).



19. Regulation 6 sets out who is a 'qualified person' for  the  purposes  of
   the 2006 Regulations. It  states:


             6. (1) In these Regulations, "qualified person" means a  person
             who is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as


             (a) a jobseeker;
             (b) a worker;
             (c) a self-employed person;
             (d) a self-sufficient person; or
             (e) a student.


             (2) A person who is no longer working shall  not  cease  to  be
             treated as a worker for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if:


             (a)  he is temporarily unable to  work  as  the  result  of  an
             illness or accident;


             (b) he is  in  duly  recorded  involuntary  unemployment  after
             having been employed in the United Kingdom,  provided  that  he
             has registered as a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant  employment
             office and


             (i)   he was employed for one  year  or  more  before  becoming
             unemployed;


             (ii)  he has been unemployed for no more than six months; or


             (iii) he can provide evidence that he is seeking employment  in
             the United Kingdom and has a genuine chance of being engaged;


             (c)   he  is  involuntarily  unemployed  and  has  embarked  on
             vocational training; or


             (d)   he  has  voluntarily  ceased  working  and  embarked   on
             vocational training that is related to his previous employment.


             (3) A person who is no  longer  in  self-employment  shall  not
             cease to be treated as a self employed person for  the  purpose
             of paragraph (1)(c) if he is temporarily unable to  pursue  his
             activity as a self-employed person as the result of an  illness
             or accident.


             (4) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a),  "jobseeker"  means  a
             person  who  enters  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to   seek
             employment  and  can  provide  evidence  that  he  is   seeking
             employment and has a genuine chance of being engaged.





20. There is no dispute as to the following facts. The  appellant's  sponsor
   is a national of Netherlands and came to this country  in  2007  and  was
   exercising her treaty rights as a  worker.  The  respondent  granted  the
   appellant leave to remain as the family member  of  his  sister,  an  EEA
   national in accordance with the  2006  regulations.  There  is  no  issue
   between the parties that the appellant has been physically present in the
   United Kingdom for five years.


21. Regulation 15 states that the appellant can only  be  granted  permanent
   residence if he can demonstrate that his EEA national  sponsor  has  been
   exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
   five years whilst being employed in the United Kingdom.


22. The  respondent's  case  is  that  there  is  a  gap  in  the  sponsor's
   employment from 6 April 2009-5 April  2011  and  therefore  she  has  not
   demonstrated that his sponsor was exercising treaty rights as a qualified
   person  during  this  period.  The  respondent  was  also  concerned  the
   appellant's sponsor's P45  dated  6  September  2010  indicates  she  was
   earning �430.10 for the 2011 tax year and these  small  earnings  do  not
   reflect continuous employment for 12 months from 6 April 2010 to 5  April
   2011.


23. I will first  decide  whether  the  sponsor  has  continuously  been  in
   employment in the United Kingdom. The sponsor in  her  witness  statement
   states that her old employment with Sodexo stopped on 13  May  2009.  She
   claims that she continued to work part time at Temple Security  until  15
   April 2010. She claims that she continued to look  for  work  and  had  a
   temporary job in August 2010 until 6 September 2010. She claims that  she
   also did agency work from October 2012 until March 2011 with Nature  Care
   Ltd. She states that the only gaps in her employment was for about  three
   months after she stopped working with Temple Security between April  2010
   and August 2010.


24. I have considered the letter  from  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  dated  14
   November 2013 setting out the sponsor's employment history.  The  sponsor
   worked at Temple Security Ltd from 6 April 2008 2/5 of  April  2010.  She
   worked for Industrial Cleaning UK Ltd from 25  February  2008  to  8  May
   2008. She worked for as Odexo Ltd from 13 May 2009 to 13  May  2009.  She
   worked for GSS Support Services Ltd from 23 August 2010  to  6  September
   2010. She worked for Servest from 1 of the September 2011 and no end date
   is given but she was still working for  that  company  in  the  tax  year
   ending 5 April 2013.  She  worked  for  Comprehensive  Cleaning  Services
   Leisure Ltd from 5 March 2012 to 5 October 2012. There is therefore a gap
   between because 5 April 2010 and 23 August 2010 which is four months gap.
   There is also a gap from 6 September 2010 to 1 September 2011 which is  a
   gap of about one year for which there is  no  credible  explanation.  The
   sponsor said that she continued to work part time but the letter from  HM
   revenue and Customs states that they  have  no  taxable  income  for  the
   sponsor as a self-employed individual.


25. I find that the appellant has not  demonstrated  that  his  sponsor  has
   continuously been in employment for five years and as such was  a  worker
   in accordance with the 2006 Regulations for the full five years that  she
   has been in this country.


26. For the tax year ending 5 April 2011 the sponsor worked from  23  August
   2010 until 6 September 2010 and earned �430  for  the  tax  year.  The  a
   sponsor's P 45 dated 6 September 2010 shows her earnings were �430.10 for
   a 12 month period.


27. I take into account the case of Begum (EEA worker-  jobseeker)  Pakistan
   [2011] UKUT 275 (IAC) referred to me by the respondent. It states in  the
   headnote the following. (1) "When deciding whether an EEA national  is  a
   worker for the purposes of the EEA regulations regard must be had to  the
   fact that the term has a meaning in EU law, that it must  be  interpreted
   broadly and that it is not conditioned by the type of employment  or  the
   amount of income derived. But a person who does not pursue  effective  in
   genuine activities, or pursue activities on such a small scale as  to  be
   regarded as purely marginal and ancillary or which have no economic value
   to an employer, is not a worker. In this context, regard must be given to
   the nature of the employment relationship and the rights  and  duties  of
   the person concerned to decide  if  work  activities  are  effective  and
   genuine. (2) When considering whether an EEA national is a jobseeker  for
   the purposes of EU law, regard must be had to whether the person  entered
   the United Kingdom to seek employment and, if so, whether that person can
   provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged.  If  a
   person does not or cannot provide relevant evidence, then  an  appeal  is
   bound to fail on this ground.


28. The case further stated paragraph 23 "EU  law  provides  for  jobseekers
   into two distinct situations. Provisions have been made  in  relation  to
   union citizens moved to another member state to look  for  work  but  who
   have never worked in the host Member State. The other provisions  related
   to union citizens who are seeking work after previously  working  in  the
   Host Member state.  It  states  that  the  provision  relating  to  union
   citizens in the second category, are much more robust than those  in  the
   former since the second situation, union citizens will often retain their
   right of residence already secured. The strength of these provisions  can
   be seen by examining article 7 (3) (b) and (c) of the Citizens  Directive
   (2004/38/EC) as discussed by the Court of Appeal in Tilianu  v  Secretary
   of State for work and pensions [2010] EWCA Civ 1397.


29. The appellant in this case falls  within  the  second  category  as  his
   sponsor is a union citizen who has previously worked in the  Host  Member
   State and therefore  the  appellant  has  to  demonstrate  that  the  EEA
   national on whom his application  is  dependent,  has  been  economically
   active in the United Kingdom for the full five year period.


30. I find that the appellant economic activity was on such  a  small  scale
   as to be regarded as purely marginal  and  ancillary  and  which  had  no
   economic value to an employer. She has also  not  demonstrated  effective
   and genuine activities during this period. I find that the appellant  was
   not a worker according to the 2006 Regulations when she earned  �430  for
   the full tax year ended 5 April 2011 as she only worked  from  23  August
   2010 until 6 September 2010 and earned �430.


31. The appellant claims that the sponsor was looking for work  during  this
   period. She has however not demonstrated by cogent evidence that she  was
   looking for work during the periods she was not  working  or  working  at
   very low wage.

32. I find that considering all the evidence in the round, I find  that  the
