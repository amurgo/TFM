                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Thew promulgated on 27 September 2017 dismissing her appeal  for  entry
    clearance as the partner of a British citizen on human rights  grounds,
    under Article 8 ECHR.  Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge McGinty.  The grant of permission may be  summarised  in
    the following terms:

         "It is arguable that the  learned  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
         erred  in  failing  to  apply   the   statutory   public   interest
         considerations as  required  under  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as argued in the first  ground  of
         appeal.  The issue in that regard is materiality.

         The second and fourth grounds appear to have  less  merit,  as  the
         Judge has  given  seemingly  adequate  and  sufficient  reasons  in
         respect of paragraph 320(11) and her findings  in  respect  of  the
         answers on application forms.

         It is arguable that the  Judge  has  not  adequately  set  out  the
         positive features in carrying  out  the  proportionality  balancing
         exercise, as argued in the third ground.

         However, I do not limit permission, but grant permission  to  argue
         all grounds."

 2. I was not provided with a  Rule  24  reply  from  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer but the Respondent indicated that she resisted the appeal.

Error of law

 3. At the close of submissions I indicated that I did not find that  there
    was an error in law such that the decision should  be  set  aside,  but
    that my reasons for that finding  would  follow.   My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

 4. In respect of Ground 1 which Mr Nadeem pursued concerning Section  117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  the  public
    interest considerations he submitted that these were factors that would
    fall to  be  assessed  in  the  applicant's  favour  and  the  evidence
    indicated that the Appellant could speak English  and  was  financially
    independent and would therefore not be a burden on the taxpayer and  be
    able to integrate.  He submitted that in  light  of  AM  (Malawi)  that
    these factors had to be considered to the required extent.  However, Mr
    Nadeem was unable to address me on the materiality of this point and in
    particular, given the decision of  Forman  (ss  117A-C  considerations)
    [2015] UKUT  00412  (IAC)  which  confirms  that  the  public  interest
    considerations which may indicate that the applicant is able to not  be
    a burden on a taxpayer and  integrate,  do  not  provide  any  positive
    weight in the  Article  8  balancing  exercise  but  simply  failed  to
    contribute  any  negative  weight  in  the  opposing   scale   in   the
    Respondent's favour.  Consequently, on this ground alone, I  would  not
    find a material  error,  notwithstanding  that  Section  117B  was  not
    considered by the First-tier Judge as complained.

 5. Turning to Ground 2, this ground did give  me  considerable  pause  and
    caused me to reflect upon the consideration of  paragraph  320(11)  and
    the nature and purpose of the Rule and the judge's assessment  of  that
    Rule.  Ultimately, however, notwithstanding the valiant and  persuasive
    submissions of Mr Nadeem, I do not  find  there  is  a  material  error
    revealed by this ground.  Mr Nadeem argued that the factors which  gave
    rise to  paragraph  320(11)  were  such  that  the  judge  should  have
    considered the length of time since the Rules were frustrated  (as  the
    Rule alleges) and that that would be a material  consideration  in  the
    conduct  of  the  proportionality  exercise,  particularly  where   the
    Respondent had not disputed the genuine and subsisting  nature  of  the
    relationship between the Appellant and the sponsoring  fianc�,  and  in
    light  of  the  Sponsor's  ability  to  maintain  and  accommodate  the
    Appellant also.  As persuasive  as  this  submission  seemed  at  first
    instance, whilst paragraph 320(11) factors, such as the length of  time
    since the Immigration Rules was frustrated, would be a material  factor
    in an Article 8 exercise, my reason for rejecting this ground is due to
    the parties' agreed position and interpretation  of  paragraph  320(11)
    which they addressed me on at the conclusion of the hearing and which I
    turn to further in this decision at �10 below.

 6. Turning to Ground 3, Mr Nadeem in essence complained that the judge had
    failed to consider material evidence before her  in  the  form  of  the
    previous refusal letter which  failed  to  raise  any  complaint  under
    paragraph 320(11) whereas the current refusal letter did.  As  the  two
    application forms were in essence identically completed, it was said to
    be untoward of the Entry Clearance Officer to criticise  the  Appellant
    on the second occasion, and not on the first, which led her to  believe
    that her answers on the first Visa Application Form she submitted  were
    given correctly.  It is true indeed  that  this  particular  submission
    does not find explicit consideration in the judge's  decision,  however
    this argument on its own would not be sufficient to indicate a material
    error of law.  However it is an  argument  which  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer could consider in  a  future  application  in  the  Appellant's
    favour, if the Appellant were to make one.

 7. Turning to Ground 4 and the judge's failure to consider the evidence in
    the application form, Mr Nadeem in essence argued that the questions at
    31, 27 and 34 of the application form had not been  considered  by  the
    judge in terms of the burden of  proof  alongside  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant was merely granted temporary admission and  would  have  been
    confused as to how to complete these parts of the form and in any event
    she had confirmed that she was refused entry into the  United  Kingdom.
    I have some sympathy for  the  Appellant  in  respect  of  this  ground
    because of the manner in which the previous legal  representatives  had
    completed the application form on her behalf.  The  Appellant's  bundle
    showed the previous application form of 3 November 2015 at pages 42  to
    48 and the Entry Clearance Officer's bundle had within it, the  current
    application form submitted on 20 July 2016 which had given rise to  the
    instant  refusal.   I   am   told   that   the   second   and   current
    representatives, namely City Law Immigration, relied upon  the  answers
    given by the previous legal representatives in completing the  previous
    visa application form, and were  fortified  in  that  reliance  because
    nothing was complained of in terms of general grounds  for  refusal  in
    the previous application and so the current  representatives  addressed
    their minds to other matters and merely recited the  previous  answers.
    In terms of the previous application form I note that it was  completed
    by a person named "Belinda Mason" and purports  to  be  signed  by  the
    Appellant.  Mr Nadeem was unable to confirm who Belinda Mason was,  but
    it certainly was not the name of the authorised  representative  within
    the previous representatives, Immigration Law Practice, the  authorised
    advisor being a Mr Ayo Olufunwa.

 8. I note that in the current letter  from  Immigration  Law  Practice  at
    pages 39 to 41,  the  previous  representatives  have  noted  that  the
    Appellant was in the United Kingdom as a student and returned to India,
    however I note an error in the application  form  which  has  not  been
    noted by the Entry Clearance Officer in the first  application  or  the
    current one or by the First-tier Tribunal Judge either.  That error  is
    that at question 30 of the previous form and question 32 of the current
    form, the question  is asked 'have you been  refused  a  visa  for  any
    country including the UK in the last 10 years?' to which the answer was
    'no' on both occasions.  Leaving aside the previous form,  the  current
    form could not have been completed with the answer 'no'  without  there
    either  being  a  misunderstanding  of  the  form  or  incompetence  in
    completing it by whoever did complete it.  This is because  in  respect
    of the current application it  would  have  been  apparent  to  whoever
    completed the form that the Appellant had been refused entry  clearance
    within a year of making the second application.  This should have  been
    apparent to the legal representative who completed the form and putting
    it neutrally, this evidence does indicate to me  that  it  is  arguable
    that something has gone 'awry' in terms of the completion of  at  least
    the most recent application form.  However, this matter was not  raised
    or argued before the First-tier Judge and therefore it is not a  matter
    by which her decision can be criticised.  However, it is  of  course  a
    matter which the Entry Clearance Officer should  consider  if  a  fresh
    application for entry clearance is made by the Appellant.

 9. Returning to Ground 4, in terms of the criticism made by Mr  Nadeem  of
    the questions he alleges the judge has not considered, I  do  not  find
    there is any merit in this submission because the judge has  considered
    the Appellant's immigration history at paragraphs  20  and  24  of  the
    decision.  I also note that the judge has considered the application on
    the basis that family life did exist given  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer did not explicitly seek to  criticise  the  Appellant  on  this
    basis, which was the correct approach for the First-tier Judge to take.
    However, the complaint that that there should have been clear  findings
    regarding family life do not follow given that the judge  did  consider
    the appeal on the basis that family life exists.

10. Having considered the grounds as they are framed, I do make some  final
    observations before concluding this decision.   My  observation  is  in
    relation to the complaint by  Mr  Nadeem  that  paragraph  320(11)  may
    operate as a bar to entry clearance for the Appellant - indefinitely  -
    if the Entry Clearance  Officer  maintains  his  or  her  view  of  the
    discretionary  application  of  paragraph  320(11).   This  issue  does
    overlap with Ground 2 but is addressed  here  in  isolation  given  its
    complexity.   Having  heard  an  agreed  position  of  both  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's representative and the  Appellant's  representative
    on this issue at the close of the hearing I record their  agreed  view,
    and my independent affirmation of that view, that there is  nothing  in
    that argument in hindsight.  This is because paragraph  320(11)  itself
    operates based upon two sets of factors.  The first set of factors is a
    list of factors that will  instigate  or  activate  paragraph  320(11).
    Whilst the second set of factors is a list of aggravating factors which
    would need to be met, over and above, and entirely  separate  from  the
    first list of instigating factors.

11. In the instant appeal there are two  instigating  factors:  first,  the
    manner in which the form was completed by the Appellant  and  secondly,
    the failure to disclose the number  and  whereabouts  of  all  previous
    spouses.  Looking at those instigating factors in light  of  the  FTT's
    decision, Mr Nadeem is wrong in arguing that  paragraph  320(11)  could
    apply time and again, this is because if the  Appellant  reapplies  and
    completes the form correctly and discloses the  previous  refusals  and
    other matters as complained of by the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  the
    instant appeal, there will be no instigating factor  from  the  initial
    list of factors under paragraph 320(11) which  will  trigger  paragraph
    320(11) being considered against the Appellant.  This is  because,  the
    second list of aggravating factors will cannot be reached unless  there
    is an instigating factor from the initial list under paragraph 320(11).



12. Turning to the failure to disclose the number and  whereabouts  of  all
    previous spouses, this, as far as I can see, was not a ground raised by
    Mr Nadeem in his Grounds of Appeal, however it did arise in the  course
    of legal submissions and therefore I feel I should say something  about
    the point.  It is a belated but fair submission that Mr Nadeem makes in
    criticising the application form in giving no question on the form that
    would prompt or elicit information regarding the  Appellant's  previous
    spouses, other than a question which queries  a  person's  relationship
    status and asks for evidence in support  of  what  the  current  status
    might be i.e. divorced or unmarried etc.  On that basis, and given that
    there is no requirement under the specified evidence rules  to  provide
    the number and whereabouts of all previous spouses, it is a  concerning
    criticism that is made of the Appellant for not disclosing these  facts
    in her application.  Rather, if the Entry Clearance Officer desired  to
    know about these issues, it would have been more  appropriate  for  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to either request evidence from  the  Appellant
    in this regard before refusing the application, or invite her to attend
    an interview where she could discuss these relationships  (particularly
    if the Entry Clearance Officer harboured doubts as to the nature of the
    present relationship, although these doubts if  they  existed  did  not
    solidify into a refusal on that speciifc basis as  the  FTT  seemed  to
    feel also).

13. Therefore, given my observations on the above instigating factors which
    arose under paragraph 320(11) in the instant refusal, these are matters
    which the Appellant can resolve and correct in any  future  application
    for entry clearance if she so wishes to make one, and I do not see  why
    paragraph 320(11) would apply on a future application if the  Appellant
    is more careful on a future application as discussed above.

14. As such whilst there are minor errors in the decision, those errors are
    not of such materiality or perversity that the decision should  be  set
    aside in accordance with the requisite standard identified in R, (Iran)
    & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982.
