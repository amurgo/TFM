                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Bedford, Counsel instructed by Sultan Lloyd
                    solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Najib, Counsel instructed by Government Legal
Department

(1) It has long been a requirement, found in the case law  of  the  European
Court of Human Rights ("ECtHR"), for the government of a signatory state  to
dispel any doubts regarding a person's claim to be at real risk  of  Article
3 harm, if that person adduces evidence capable of proving  that  there  are
substantial grounds for  believing  that  expulsion  from  the  state  would
violate Article 3 of the ECHR.

(2) This requirement does not mean the  burden  of  dispelling  such  doubts
shifts to the government in every case where such evidence is adduced,  save
only where the claim is so lacking in substance as to be clearly  unfounded.


(3)  Article  4.5  of  the  Qualification   Directive   (Council   Directive
2004/83/EC) provides that,  where  certain  specified  conditions  are  met,
aspects of the statements of an applicant for international protection  that
are  not  supported  by  documentary  or  other  evidence  shall  not   need
confirmation.

(4) The effect of Article 4.5  is  that  a  person  who  has  otherwise  put
forward a cogent case should not fail, merely because he  or  she  does  not
have supporting documentation. Nowhere in the Directive is it  said  that  a
person who has  documentation  which,  on  its  face,  may  be  said  to  be
supportive of the claim (eg an  arrest  warrant  or  witness  summons),  but
whose claim is found to be problematic in other respects,  has  nevertheless
made out their case, so that the burden  of  disproving  it  shifts  to  the
government.

(5) When national courts and tribunals are considering cases  in  which  the
ECtHR has decided  to  embark  on  its  own  fact-finding  exercise,  it  is
important to ensure that the ECtHR's factual conclusions are not treated  as
general principles of human rights law and practice.


                                  Anonymity

         Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity order was made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  As  this  is  a
protection claim, it is appropriate to make that order.  Unless and until  a
tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No
report of these proceedings shall directly or  indirectly  identify  him  or
any member of his family. This direction applies, amongst  others,  to  both
parties. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the decision of us all.  The section dealing with the burden
       and standard of proof was  primarily  written  by  Lane  J  and  the
       remainder of the decision was written by  UTJ  Smith.   The  section
       setting out the submissions concerning the facts  of  the  case  was
       drafted shortly after the hearing.


    BACKGROUND


    2. The Appellant appeals against  a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Moan  promulgated  on  21  November  2016  ("the   Decision")
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
       decision dated 19 May  2016  refusing  his  protection  claim.   The
       Appellant was granted discretionary leave to remain on the basis  of
       his age  until  22  January  2017  (under  paragraph  352ZC  of  the
       Immigration  Rules).   His  appeal  therefore  concerns   only   his
       protection claim.


    3. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born on 22 July 1999.  He
       entered the UK clandestinely in  2015.   He  claimed  asylum  on  26
       August 2015.  At the time of his claim,  the  Respondent's  decision
       and the hearing and decision of the First-tier Tribunal he was  aged
       under eighteen.  By the time of the hearing before us, the Appellant
       had reached his majority but that is only relevant in the event that
       we find a material error of law in the Decision and have to  re-make
       the decision for ourselves (for reasons we will come to).


    4. The Appellant claims that his father was a  member  of  the  Taliban
       (having been forcibly recruited by  them),  that  his  parents  were
       killed by the Taliban and that the Taliban  had  tried  forcibly  to
       recruit the Appellant. He claims that he  is  at  risk  of  forcible
       recruitment by the Taliban on return to his home  area  (Nangarhar).
       The Respondent did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant's  father  was
       associated with  the  Taliban  and  rejected  the  claim  of  forced
       recruitment as being inconsistent with the background evidence about
       the activities of the Taliban.  The  Respondent  also  rejected  the
       Appellant's claim that his parents were killed by the Taliban due to
       inconsistencies in the Appellant's account.


    5. In relation to risk on return, the Judge found that, as a young  man
       with no family in Kabul, it would not be reasonable for him to  stay
       there alone but that, as he has family in Nangarhar Province,  those
       family members could assist him to return to that area.   The  Judge
       discounted the failure of the Respondent to carry out family tracing
       as not relevant  to  the  protection  claim.   She  also  considered
       whether there was a risk  of  a  breach  of  Article  15(c)  of  the
       Qualification Directive by reason of the general level  of  violence
       in Afghanistan and in  particular  the  Appellant's  home  area  but
       rejected that claim also based on the extant country guidance  which
       the Judge found not to be displaced  by  the  later  background  and
       expert evidence relied upon by the Appellant.


    6. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  J  M
       Holmes on 9 December 2016 and by Upper Tribunal Judge Southern on 31
       January 2017.   However,  following  a  successful  judicial  review
       challenge to Judge Southern's decision, on  22  November  2017,  the
       Vice President of the Tribunal granted permission to appeal.


   7. The matter comes before us to decide whether the Decision contains a
      material error of law and, if we so find, either to re-make the
      Decision ourselves or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to
      do so.


    DECISION AND REASONS


    Ground One: The Burden and Standard of Proof in Article 3 Claims


    8. An appellant in a human rights appeal who asserts that  his  or  her
       removal from the United Kingdom would violate Article 3 of the  ECHR
       must establish that claim. In other words, the appellant  bears  the
       burden of proof.  The standard of proof requires  the  appellant  to
       show a "reasonable likelihood" or "real risk" of Article 3 harm.

    9. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal  so  held  in  Kacaj  (Article  3  -
       Standard of Proof - Non-State Actors) Albania*  [2001]  UKIAT  00018
       ("Kacaj").  At paragraph 12 of its determination, the IAT said  that
       "the standard may be a  relatively  low  one,  but  it  is  for  the
       applicant to establish his claim to that standard".

   10. Section 107(3) and (3A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") provides  that  practice  directions  made
       under section 23 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007
       may require the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal to  treat
       a specified decision  of,  amongst  other  bodies,  the  Immigration
       Appeal Tribunal, as authoritative in respect of a particular matter.



   11. Practice Direction 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of  the
       First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal provides that a  reported
       determination of, inter alia, the IAT which is  "starred"  shall  be
       treated as authoritative in respect  of  the  matter  to  which  the
       "starring" relates, unless inconsistent with other authority that is
       binding on the Tribunal.

   12. It is undisputed that  Kacaj  is  "starred"  for  what  it  says  in
       paragraph 12 of the determination.  There is no  domestic  case  law
       that is inconsistent with Kacaj.  On the contrary, the higher courts
       consistently follow the same approach.  Thus,  for  example,  in  AM
       (Zimbabwe) and Another v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       [2018] EWCA Civ 64, Sales LJ held:-

         "16.     It is common ground that where a foreign national seeks to
             rely upon Article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a  state  to
             remove him into another country, the overall legal  burden  is
             on him to show that Article 3 would be infringed in  his  case
             by showing that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing
             that he would face a real risk of being subject to torture  or
             to inhuman or degrading treatment in that other country ..."

   13. In the light of this, Mr Bedford  accepts,  as  he  must,  that  the
       Appellant has a burden to discharge. He submits, however, that  what
       he describes as  the  "standard  direction  on  appeal  against  the
       refusal of an international protection claim" needs modification  in
       order to take account of what he says is the "clear and  consistent"
       line that has emerged from the European Court of Human Rights in the
       past decade. In this regard, Mr Bedford places  particular  reliance
       upon the judgment of the Grand Chamber in JK  and  Others  v  Sweden
       (Application no. 59166/12) ("JK"), given on 23 August 2016.

   14. According to Mr Bedford, JK holds that the burden on applicants  for
       international protection is discharged  when  they  adduce  evidence
       which is "capable of proving" a real risk on return.  At this point,
       the burden  shifts  to  the  government  to  dispel  any  doubts  or
       uncertainty.

   15. Mr Bedford further submits that:-

         "Any new or modified direction in the Tribunal on  the  burden  and
         standard of proof must take account of the effect  of  the  Supreme
         Court decision in R (Kiarie); R (Byndloss) v SSHD ...  [2017]  UKSC
         42 at [54], [35] that for the purposes of section 82 [of  the  2002
         Act] any proposed appeal must  be  taken  to  be  arguable  in  the
         absence of a certificate that it is clearly unfounded."

   16. The "hard" form  of  Mr  Bedford's  submission  (to  adopt  his  own
       description) is, accordingly, that whenever the  respondent  decides
       not to certify  a  human  rights  claim  (at  least,  one  involving
       international  protection),  that  claim  must,  logically,  involve
       "evidence capable of proving" the appellant's case, with the  result
       that the ensuing appeal is one in which the  respondent  necessarily
       bears the burden of dispelling "any doubts about it".

   17. To use again Mr Bedford's terminology, the "softer" version  of  his
       submission acknowledges that, even where a claim is not certified as
       clearly unfounded, the appellant may, in certain circumstances, bear
       the burden of proof throughout.  However, as we understand  him,  Mr
       Bedford submits that an appellant whose case is not confined to  his
       or her own statements but  is  supported  by  documentary  or  other
       evidence,  has  discharged  the  burden,  so  that  it  is  for  the
       respondent to dispel any doubts or uncertainty.  Mr Bedford  relies,
       in this regard,  on  Article  4.5  of  the  Qualification  Directive
       (Council Directive 2004/83/EC).

    Article 4.5 of the Qualification Directive

   18. Article 4 of the Directive provides as follows:-

         "Article 4


         Assessment of facts and circumstances


          1. Member States may consider it the duty  of  the  applicant  to
             submit as soon as possible all elements needed to substantiate
             the application for international protection.  In  cooperation
             with the applicant it is the  duty  of  the  Member  State  to
             assess the relevant elements of the application.


          2. The elements  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  consist  of  the
             applicant's  statements   and   all   documentation   at   the
             applicant's   disposal   regarding   the   applicant's    age,
             background, including that of  relevant  relatives,  identity,
             nationality(ies),  country(ies)  and  place(s)   of   previous
             residence,  previous  asylum  applications,   travel   routes,
             identity and travel documents and the reasons for applying for
             international protection.


          3. The assessment of an application for international  protection
             is to be carried out  on  an  individual  basis  and  includes
             taking into account:


               a) all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin
                  at the time of  taking  a  decision  on  the  application;
                  including laws and regulations of the  country  of  origin
                  and the manner in which they are applied;


             (b) the relevant statements and documentation presented by the
                  applicant including information on whether  the  applicant
                  has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;


             (c) the individual position and personal circumstances of  the
                  applicant, including factors such  as  background,  gender
                  and age, so as to assess whether,  on  the  basis  of  the
                  applicant's personal circumstances, the acts to which  the
                  applicant has been or could be  exposed  would  amount  to
                  persecution or serious harm;


             (d) whether  the  applicant's  activities  since  leaving  the
                  country of origin were engaged in for  the  sole  or  main
                  purpose of creating the necessary conditions for  applying
                  for international protection,  so  as  to  assess  whether
                  these activities will expose the applicant to  persecution
                  or serious harm if returned to that country;


             (e) whether the applicant  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
                  avail himself of the protection of another  country  where
                  he could assert citizenship.


         4.  The  fact  that  an  applicant  has  already  been  subject  to
             persecution or serious harm  or  to  direct  threats  of  such
             persecution or such harm,  is  a  serious  indication  of  the
             applicant's well-founded fear of persecution or real  risk  of
             suffering serious harm,  unless  there  are  good  reasons  to
             consider that such persecution or serious  harm  will  not  be
             repeated.

         5. Where Member States apply the principle according to which it is
             the duty of the applicant to substantiate the application  for
             international protection and where aspects of the  applicant's
             statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence,
             those aspects shall not need confirmation, when the  following
             conditions are met:


             (a) the applicant has made a genuine  effort  to  substantiate
                  his application;


               b) all relevant elements, at the applicant's  disposal,  have
                  been submitted, and a satisfactory  explanation  regarding
                  any lack of other relevant elements has been given;

             (c)  the applicant's statements are found to be  coherent  and
                  plausible and do not run counter to available specific and
                  general information relevant to the applicant's case;


             (d)  the applicant has applied for international protection at
                  the earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  applicant  can
                  demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and


             (e)   the  general  credibility  of  the  applicant  has  been
                  established." (our emphasis)

   19. Article 4.5  is  given  direct  effect  in  the  United  Kingdom  by
       paragraph 399L of the Immigration Rules:-

         "339L    It is the duty of the person to  substantiate  the  asylum
                claim or establish that  they  are  a  person  eligible  for
                humanitarian protection or substantiate their  human  rights
                claim.  Where aspects of the  person's  statements  are  not
                supported by documentary or other  evidence,  those  aspects
                will  not  need  confirmation  when  all  of  the  following
                conditions are met:

                (i)    the person has made a genuine effort to  substantiate
                    their asylum claim or establish that they are  a  person
                    eligible for humanitarian protection or substantiate his
                    human rights claim;

                (ii)   all material factors at the  person's  disposal  have
                    been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding
                    any lack of other relevant material has been given:

                (iii)  the person's statements are found to be coherent  and
                    plausible and do not run counter to  available  specific
                    and general information relevant to the person's case;

                (iv)   the person has made an  asylum  claim  or  sought  to
                    establish  that  [they  are]  a  person   eligible   for
                    humanitarian protection or made a human rights claim  at
                    the  earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  person  can
                    demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and

                (v)    the  general  credibility  of  the  person  has  been
                    established."

     The UNHCR Note on the Burden and Standard of Proof

   20. As we shall see, Article 4 was considered by the ECtHR  in  JK.   So
       too was the UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of  Proof  in  Refugee
       Claims, where we find the following:-

         "6.      According to  general  legal  principles  of  the  law  of
             evidence, the burden of proof lies on the person who makes the
             assertion.  Thus, in refugee claims, it is the  applicant  who
             has  the  burden  of  establishing  the  veracity  of  his/her
             allegations and the accuracy of the facts on which the refugee
             claim is based.  The burden of  proof  is  discharged  by  the
             applicant rendering a truthful account of  facts  relevant  to
             the claim so that, based on the facts, a proper  decision  may
             be reached.  In view  of  the  particularities  of  a  refugee
             situation, the adjudicator shares the duty  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate all the relevant facts.  This is achieved, to a large
             extent, by the adjudicator being familiar with  the  objective
             situation in the country of origin concerned, being  aware  of
             relevant matters of common knowledge, guiding the applicant in
             providing the relevant information  and  adequately  verifying
             facts alleged which can be substantiated.

         ...

         10.       As  regards   supportive   evidence,   where   there   is
             corroborative  evidence  supporting  the  statements  of   the
             applicant, this would reinforce the veracity of the statements
             made.  On the other  hand,  given  the  special  situation  of
             asylum-seekers, they should not be  required  to  produce  all
             necessary evidence.  In particular, it  should  be  recognised
             that, often, asylum-seekers  would  have  fled  without  their
             personal documents.  Failure to produce  documentary  evidence
             to substantiate oral statements should, therefore, not prevent
             the  claim  from  being  accepted  if  such   statements   are
             consistent with known facts and the general credibility of the
             applicant is good.

         11.      In assessing the overall credibility  of  the  applicant's
             claim, the adjudicator should take into account  such  factors
             as the  reasonableness  of  the  facts  alleged,  the  overall
             consistency  and   coherence   of   the   applicant's   story,
             corroborative evidence adduced by the applicant in support  of
             his/her  statements,  consistency  with  common  knowledge  or
             generally known facts and the known situation in  the  country
             of origin.  Credibility is established where the applicant has
             presented  a  claim  which  is  coherent  and  plausible,  not
             contradicting generally known  facts,  and  therefore  is,  on
             balance, capable of being believed.

         12.      The term 'benefit of the doubt' is used in the context  of
             standard of proof relating to the factual assertions  made  by
             the applicant.  Given that in  refugee  claims,  there  is  no
             necessity for the applicant to  prove  all  facts  to  such  a
             standard that the adjudicator  is  fully  convinced  that  all
             factual assertions  are  true,  there  would  normally  be  an
             element of doubt in the mind of the adjudicator as regards the
             facts  asserted  by  the  applicant.   Where  the  adjudicator
             considers that the applicant's story is on the whole  coherent
             and plausible, any element of doubt should not  prejudice  the
             applicant's claim; that is, the applicant should be given  the
             'benefit of the doubt'."

    Strasbourg case law

   21. The first applicant in JK was a citizen of Iraq who claimed to be in
       need of international protection, but whose claim  was  rejected  by
       Sweden on the basis that he had not shown that he was at  real  risk
       of serious harm in Iraq, were he to be returned  there.   The  ECtHR
       referred to Saadi v Italy (Application no. 31201/06) as stating that
       the relevant standard of proof in Article 3 cases of  this  kind  is
       whether "substantial grounds have been shown for believing that  the
       person in question, if deported, would face a  real  risk  of  being
       subjected to treatment contrary to  Article  3  in  the  destination
       country".

   22. Paragraphs 91 to 98 of the judgment in JK need  to  be  set  out  in
       full:-

         "91.     Regarding the burden of proof in expulsion  cases,  it  is
             the Court's well-established case-law that it is in  principle
             for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of  proving  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she  would
             be exposed to a real risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to  Article  3;  and  that  where  such  evidence  is
             adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any  doubts  about
             it (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 120;  Saadi  v.  Italy,
             cited above, � 129; NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above,  �
             111; and R.C. v. Sweden, cited above, � 50).

         92.      According to the Court's  case-law,  it  is  incumbent  on
             persons who allege that their  expulsion  would  amount  to  a
             breach  of  Article  3  to  adduce,  to  the  greatest  extent
             practically possible, material and  information  allowing  the
             authorities of the Contracting State concerned, as well as the
             Court, to assess the risk a removal may entail  (see  Said  v.
             the Netherlands, no. 2345/02, � 49, ECHR 2005-VI).  The Court,
             however,  acknowledges  the   fact   that   with   regard   to
             applications for recognition of  refugee  status,  it  may  be
             difficult, if not impossible,  for  the  person  concerned  to
             supply evidence  within  a  short  time,  especially  if  such
             evidence must be obtained from the country from  which  he  or
             she claims to have  fled.   The  lack  of  direct  documentary
             evidence thus cannot be decisive per se (see Bahaddar  v.  the
             Netherlands, 19 February 1998,  �  45,  Reports  1998-I,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above, � 49).

         93.      Owing to the special  situation  in  which  asylum-seekers
             often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them
             the benefit of the doubt when  assessing  the  credibility  of
             their  statements  and  the  documents  submitted  in  support
             thereof. Yet when information is presented which gives  strong
             reasons  to  question  the  veracity  of  an   asylum-seeker's
             submissions,  the  individual  must  provide  a   satisfactory
             explanation for the alleged inaccuracies in those  submissions
             (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 113; Collins and Akaziebie
             v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007;  and  S.H.H.  v.
             the United Kingdom, no. 60367/10,  �  71,  29  January  2013).
             Even if the applicant's account of  some  details  may  appear
             somewhat implausible, the Court has considered that this  does
             not necessarily detract from the overall  general  credibility
             of the applicant's claim (see Said, cited above,  �  53,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, �� 154-155,  26
             July 2005).


         94.      As a general rule, an  asylum-seeker  cannot  be  seen  as
             having discharged the burden of proof until he or she provides
             a substantiated account of an individual,  and  thus  a  real,
             risk of ill-treatment upon  deportation  that  is  capable  of
             distinguishing his or her situation from the general perils in
             the country of destination.


         95.      Moreover, although a number of individual factors may not,
             when considered separately, constitute a real risk,  the  same
             factors may give rise to a real risk when  taken  cumulatively
             and when considered in a situation  of  general  violence  and
             heightened security (see NA.  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  cited
             above, � 130).  The following elements may represent such risk
             factors: previous criminal record and/or arrest  warrant,  the
             age, gender and origin of a returnee, a previous record  as  a
             suspected or actual  member  of  a  persecuted  group,  and  a
             previous asylum claim submitted abroad (see NA. v. the  United
             Kingdom, cited above, �� 143-144 and 146).


         96.      The Court notes that it is the shared duty of  an  asylum-
             seeker  and  the  immigration  authorities  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate  all  relevant  facts  of  the  case  in  the  asylum
             proceedings.  Asylum-seekers are normally the only parties who
             are able to  provide  information  about  their  own  personal
             circumstances.   Therefore,   as   far   as   the   individual
             circumstances are concerned, the burden  of  proof  should  in
             principle lie on the applicants, who must submit, as  soon  as
             possible,  all   evidence   relating   to   their   individual
             circumstances that is needed to substantiate their application
             for  international  protection.   This  requirement  is   also
             expressed both in the UNHCR documents (see paragraph 6 of  the
             UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in  Refugee  Claims
             and paragraph 196 of the  UNHCR  Handbook  and  Guidelines  on
             Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee  Status,  both
             referred to in paragraphs 53-54 above) and in Article 4 � 1 of
             the EU Qualification Directive, as well as in  the  subsequent
             case-law of the CJEU (see paragraphs 47 and 49-50 above).


         97.      However, the rules concerning the burden of  proof  should
             not render ineffective the applicants' rights protected  under
             Article 3 of the Convention.  It is  also  important  to  take
             into account all the difficulties which an  asylum-seeker  may
             encounter abroad when collecting evidence (see Bahaddar, cited
             above � 45, and, mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above,  �  49).
             Both the standards developed by the UNCHR (paragraph 12 of the
             Note  and  paragraph  196  of  the  Handbook,  both  cited  in
             paragraphs 53-54 above) and Article 4 � 5 of the Qualification
             Directive  recognise,  explicitly  or  implicitly,  that   the
             benefit of the  doubt  should  be  granted  in  favour  of  an
             individual seeking international protection.


         98.      The Court notes that, as far  as  the  evaluation  of  the
             general situation  in  a  specific  country  is  concerned,  a
             different approach  should  be  taken.   In  respect  of  such
             matters, the domestic  authorities  examining  a  request  for
             international protection have full access to information.  For
             this  reason,  the  general  situation  in  another   country,
             including the ability of its  public  authorities  to  provide
             protection,  has  to  be  established  proprio  motu  by   the
             competent  domestic  immigration  authorities  (see,   mutatis
             mutandis, H.L.R. v. France, cited above, �  37;  Hilal,  cited
             above, � 60; and Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, �  116).
             A similar approach is advocated in paragraph 6 of  the  above-
             mentioned Note issued by the UNHCR,  according  to  which  the
             authorities adjudicating on an asylum claim have to take  "the
             objective situation in the country of origin  concerned"  into
             account proprio  motu.   Similarly,  Article  4  �  3  of  the
             Qualification Directive requires that "all relevant  facts  as
             they relate to the country of origin" are taken into account."

   23. At paragraph 102, the ECtHR considered the significance of past ill-
       treatment:-

         "102.    The court considers that the fact  of  past  ill-treatment
                provides a strong indication  of  a  future,  real  risk  of
                treatment contrary to  Article  3,  in  cases  in  which  an
                applicant has made a generally coherent and credible account
                of events that is consistent with information from  reliable
                and objective sources about the  general  situation  in  the
                country at issue.  In such circumstances, it will be for the
                government to dispel any doubts about that risk."

   24. At paragraph 106, having noted that the existence of a risk of  ill-
       treatment, so far as the  ECtHR  was  concerned,  must  be  assessed
       primarily with reference to the facts known or which ought  to  have
       been known to the Contracting State at the time  of  expulsion,  the
       court nevertheless noted that, since the applicants had not yet been
       deported, "the question whether they  would  face  a  real  risk  of
       persecution upon their return to Iraq must be examined in the  light
       of the present day situation".

   25. The ECtHR then embarked on that task.  It could see  "no  reason  to
       cast doubt on the [Swedish] Migration  Agency's  findings  that  the
       family have been exposed to the most serious forms of abuses ...  by
       Al-Qaeda from  2004  to  2008"  (paragraph  114).   The  applicants'
       account of what happened  between  2004  and  2010  was,  the  ECtHR
       considered, "generally coherent and credible" and  "consistent  with
       the relevant Country of Origin Information".  This meant that it was
       "therefore for the government to dispel any doubts about that  risk"
       (paragraphs 114, 115).

   26. Looking at the most  recent  objective  international  human  rights
       sources, the ECtHR considered that there were deficits in  both  the
       capacity and integrity  of  the  Iraqi  security  and  legal  system
       (paragraph 120) and that, overall, there was a real  risk  that  the
       Iraqi state would not be able to protect the applicants.

   27. That was the majority view of the ECtHR, reached  by  ten  votes  to
       seven.  Judge Ranzoni, in  a  dissenting  opinion,  considered  that
       paragraph 102 of the majority judgment lacked  sufficient  reasoning
       and diverged from Article 4.4 of the Qualification  Directive  in  a
       number of respects.

   28. RC v Sweden (Application no. 41827/07) is a judgment  of  the  third
       section of the ECtHR.  It  concerned  an  individual,  RC,  who  was
       present in Sweden  and  claimed  to  be  in  need  of  international
       protection from the authorities in Iran.  Before the First  Instance
       Migration Court in Sweden, the credibility of RC was examined.   Two
       of the three judges of that Court found RC's account was incredible;
       but one dissented from that conclusion.

   29. At paragraph 50 of  its  judgment,  the  ECtHR  noted  that  it  was
       "frequently necessary to give" asylum seekers the  "benefit  of  the
       doubt" when it comes to  assessing  credibility  of  statements  and
       documents; but that when there were "strong reasons to question  the
       veracity of an asylum  seeker's  submissions,  the  individual  must
       provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies".

   30. Beginning at paragraph 52, the ECtHR began  its  own  assessment  of
       RC's credibility.  It noted that one of the Migration  Court  judges
       had considered the applicant to have given  a  credible  account  of
       events.  The ECtHR found that a medical certificate put  before  the
       Migration Board gave a "rather strong indication to the  authorities
       that the applicant's scars and injuries may have been caused by ill-
       treatment or torture" and that, in the circumstances, it was for the
       Board "to dispel any doubts that might  have  persisted  as  to  the
       cause of such scarring".  The ECtHR held that the Board should  have
       "directed that an expert opinion be  obtained  as  to  the  probable
       cause of the applicant's scars".

   31. The court came to the conclusion that  the  applicant  had  given  a
       credible account and was at real risk if returned to Iran.

   32. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Fura said he was not  convinced  that
       the applicant had made out a prima facie case, even having regard to
       the  medical  certificate.   Judge  Fura  did  not  agree  that  the
       certificate meant the authorities should  have  directed  an  expert
       opinion to be obtained.  On the contrary, Judge Fura said he  "would
       be reluctant to give  any  specific  instructions  to  the  domestic
       authorities as to what procedural measure  to  take  and  even  less
       willing to advise on what conclusions to draw from certain  evidence
       introduced in a case where I have not had the benefit of seeing  the
       parties and in which the relevant events  took  place  a  long  time
       ago".

   33. In FG v Sweden (Application no. 43611/11), a judgment of  the  Grand
       Chamber given on 23 March 2016, the ECtHR had this  to  say  on  the
       burden of proof:-

         "120.    Regarding the burden of proof, the Court found in Saadi v.
             Italy (cited above, �� 129-32; see also, among others, Ouabour
             v. Belgium, no. 26417/10, � 65, 2 June 2015  and  Othman  (Abu
             Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, � 261,  ECHR  2012
             (extracts)), that it was in principle  for  the  applicant  to
             adduce evidence capable of proving that there were substantial
             grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of  were
             to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being
             subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3; and  that  where
             such evidence was adduced, it was for the Government to dispel
             any doubts raised by it (ibid., � 129). In order to  determine
             whether there is a  risk  of  ill-treatment,  the  Court  must
             examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the  applicant
             to the  destination  country,  bearing  in  mind  the  general
             situation there and his personal circumstances (ibid., � 130).
              Where the sources available describe a general situation,  an
             applicant's specific allegations in a particular case  require
             corroboration by other evidence  (ibid.,  �  131).   In  cases
             where an applicant alleges that he or she is  a  member  of  a
             group systematically exposed to a practice  of  ill-treatment,
             the Court considers that the protection of Article  3  of  the
             Convention enters into play when  the  applicant  establishes,
             where necessary on the basis of the  above-mentioned  sources,
             that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence  of
             the practice in question and in his or her membership  of  the
             group concerned (ibid., � 132)."

   34.  Applying  this  approach  to  the  facts  of  FG,  who  had  sought
       international  protection  in  Sweden  alleging  a   fear   of   the
       authorities in Iran (both as regards  alleged  political  activities
       and because of a sur place conversion to  Christianity),  the  ECtHR
       held that the Swedish authorities had not erred in  their  approach.
       FG's application was, accordingly, dismissed.

   35. In MA v Switzerland (Application no.  52589/13),  a  second  section
       judgment handed down on 18 November 2014, the ECtHR placed  emphasis
       on the fact  that  neither  the  Migration  Board  nor  the  Federal
       Administrative Court of Switzerland had challenged the  authenticity
       of a court summons, originating  in  Iran,  put  forward  by  MA  in
       connection with his protection claim.  Having carried  out  its  own
       analysis,  the  ECtHR  concluded  that  the  applicant  had  adduced
       evidence capable of proving that there were substantial grounds  for
       believing that, if expelled, he would be at real risk of  Article  3
       ill-treatment and that he "must be given the benefit  of  the  doubt
       with regard to the remaining uncertainties.  The government  on  the
       other hand have not dispelled any doubts that  the  applicant  would
       face such treatment" (paragraph 69).

   36. Judge Kj�lbro gave a dissenting opinion.  He said that an assessment
       of the credibility of a claimant's  account  "is  an  essential  and
       important element in the processing of asylum cases.   This  is,  in
       many cases, a difficult exercise in which many factors  have  to  be
       taken into account" (paragraph 2).

   37. At paragraph 4, Judge Kj�lbro said:-

           "Owing to the risk of abuse of the asylum system and  fabricated
           stories from asylum seekers, who have  often  been  assisted  by
           professional  human  traffickers  deriving   profit   from   the
           desperate situation of vulnerable individuals, it is  legitimate
           for asylum authorities to submit the  account  given  by  asylum
           seekers to  a  thorough  examination  in  order  to  assess  the
           credibility of their statements.  In doing so it  is  important,
           amongst other things, to ascertain whether the account given  by
           the asylum seeker, in particular concerning the core elements of
           the motives for seeking asylum, is consistent and coherent."

   38. Judge Kj�lbro noted that the Migration Board had had the benefit  of
       seeing the applicant in person "which is  an  important  element  in
       assessing the reliability of an asylum seeker's motives"  (paragraph
       5).  The authorities in Switzerland considered  that  the  applicant
       had not  given  a  plausible  explanation  for  inconsistencies  and
       discrepancies.  Judge Kj�lbro considered that  the  majority  judges
       were "acting as  a  "fourth  instance"  in  its  assessment  of  the
       reliability of the applicant's statements" (paragraph 6).

   39. He also found that the  importance  attached  to  documents  by  the
       majority was problematic" in that:-

           "It is well-known in asylum cases that it is often easy  to  get
           hold of forged and fraudulently obtained official documents  ...
           If the account given by an asylum seeker is credible,  documents
           in support of the statement are often of  less  importance.   On
           the other hand, if the account given  by  an  asylum  seeker  is
           clearly unreliable, documents will frequently  be  incapable  of
           dispelling the doubts concerning its credibility." (paragraph 7)

   40. Judge Kj�lbro concluded by saying that, in his view,  having  regard
       to the "subsidiary role of the court", the majority had not given  a
       "sufficient basis for overturning the  assessment  of  the  domestic
       authorities as regards the credibility  of  the  applicant's  asylum
       story".

   41. In Paposhvili v Belgium (Application  no.  41738/10),  given  on  13
       December 2016, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR examined the threshold
       in an Article 3 case, involving a claim by a person that  to  remove
       him from Belgium would lead to a real risk  of  serious  harm  as  a
       result of a deterioration  in  his  medical  condition,  where  that
       condition could not be said to be attributable to the authorities of
       the country to which he was proposed to be returned.

   42. We are not here concerned with that aspect of the judgment.  Rather,
       Mr Bedford draws attention to paragraphs 186 and 187, which  contain
       what, by now, can be seen to be standard  statements  of  the  ECtHR
       regarding the burden of proof:-

         "186.    In  the  context  of  these  procedures,  it  is  for  the
             applicants to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented,  they  would  be
             exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G.
             v. Sweden, cited above, � 120).  In this connection it  should
             be observed that a certain degree of speculation  is  inherent
             in the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it  is  not  a
             matter of requiring the persons  concerned  to  provide  clear
             proof of their claim that they would be exposed to  proscribed
             treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi  v.  Belgium,  no.
             140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).

         187.     Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the  authorities
             of the returning State, in the context of domestic procedures,
             to dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited  above,  �
             129, and F.G. v.  Sweden,  cited  above,  �  120).   The  risk
             alleged must be subjected to close scrutiny (see Saadi,  cited
             above, � 128; Sufi  and  Elmi  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  nos.
             8319/07 and 11449/07, � 214, 28 June  2011;  Hirsi  Jamaa  and
             Others, cited above, � 116; and Tarakhel, cited above, �  104)
             in the course of which the authorities in the returning  State
             must consider the foreseeable consequences of removal for  the
             individual concerned in the receiving State, in the  light  of
             the general situation  there  and  the  individual's  personal
             circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, �  108;
             El-Masri, cited above, � 213; and  Tarakhel,  cited  above,  �
             105).  The assessment  of  the  risk  as  defined  above  (see
             paragraphs 183-84)  must  therefore  take  into  consideration
             general  sources  such  as  reports  of   the   World   Health
             Organisation or of  reputable  non-governmental  organisations
             and  the  medical  certificates  concerning  the   person   in
             question."

   43. We have already observed that, in paragraph 16 of the  judgments  in
       AM (Zimbabwe), Sales LJ stated that the overall legal burden  is  on
       an applicant for international protection relying upon Article 3  to
       show that there are substantial grounds for  believing  that  person
       would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment  contrary  to
       that Article, in the event of  removal.   Sales  LJ  then  said  the
       following:-

           "In Paposhvili, at paras. [186] - [187] ... the Grand Chamber of
           the ECtHR has given guidance how he may achieve that, by raising
           a prima facie case of infringement of Article 3 which then  cast
           an evidential burden onto the defending state which  is  seeking
           to expel him."

    Discussion

   44. It is trite law that the obligation of courts and tribunals  in  the
       United Kingdom is to "take into account any ... judgment,  decision,
       declaration or advisory opinion  of  the  European  Court  of  Human
       Rights ..." (section 2(1)(a)) of the Human Rights Act 1998).  United
       Kingdom courts and tribunals should, however, generally  follow  any
       clear and consistent approach of the ECtHR (particularly, of course,
       its Grand Chamber).  However, that will not be the position  if  and
       in so far as the domestic court or tribunal in question is bound  by
       the principle of stare decisis to follow the decision  of  a  higher
       court  or  tribunal,  even  though  this  may  be  contrary  to  the
       Strasbourg approach: Kay v London Borough of Lambert [2006] UKHL 10.

   45. It is quite clear from RC v Sweden (paragraph 50) and  FG  v  Sweden
       (paragraph 120) that JK v Sweden introduces no new approach  to  the
       issue of the burden of proof in Article 3 cases.  The requirement of
       a government to dispel doubts, where an applicant  adduces  evidence
       "capable  of  proving"  that  there  are  substantial  grounds   for
       believing expulsion would violate Article 3, has been a  feature  of
       the ECtHR jurisprudence for some considerable time.

   46. Whilst that means, of course, that Strasbourg has indeed  maintained
       a consistent approach over a significant period of time, Mr  Bedford
       must face the question of why, if his interpretation of the  ECtHR's
       approach is correct, the startling consequences for  United  Kingdom
       immigration law and, no doubt, much of the law of  other  EU  States
       have not been identified before now.

   47. The fact of the matter is, we find, that there is  no  justification
       for Mr Bedford's contention that evidence  "capable  of  proving"  a
       claim  constitutes  the  same  or  even  a  similar  threshold   for
       determining whether a claim is so lacking  in  substance  as  to  be
       clearly unfounded within the terms of section 94 of the 2002 Act.

   48.  In JK, the ECtHR  cited  (without  evident  disapproval)  both  the
       passages from the UNHCR guidance on the benefit of the doubt,  which
       we  have  set  out  above,  and  also  certain  provisions  of   the
       Qualification Directive  including,  importantly,  Article  4.   The
       UNHCR Note does not say the burden always shifts to  the  government
       in question except where the claim is, on any  view,  hopeless.   We
       shall have more to say on Article 4 of the  Qualification  Directive
       in a moment; but, for the present, we observe that Article  4.5,  on
       its face,  shares  nothing  in  common  with  Mr  Bedford's  primary
       submission.

   49. Accordingly, if Mr  Bedford's  primary  or  "hard"  submission  were
       right, we would expect to see the majority of the  ECtHR  explaining
       why they had seen fit to depart from both the UNHCR Note and Article
       4 of the Qualification Directive.  However, one looks  in  vain  for
       any such explanation.

   50.  It  is  manifest  from  the  ECtHR's  analysis  of   the   personal
       circumstances of the applicants in JK,  which  begins  at  paragraph
       112, that the applicants had,  according  to  the  majority  of  the
       court, produced strong  or  compelling  evidence  of  real  risk  on
       return.  In particular, emphasis was placed by the majority upon the
       findings of the Migration Agency that JK's family had  been  exposed
       to "the most serious forms of  abuses"  by  Al-Qaeda  and  that  the
       latter's  threats  had  continued  after  2008.   Furthermore,  JK's
       account was "consistent with relevant Country of Origin  information
       available from reliable and objective sources" (paragraph 114).

   51. It was on this basis that the majority of the  court  concluded,  at
       paragraph 115, that it was for the Swedish Government to dispel  any
       doubts about the risk  to  the  applicants.   Even  so,  however,  a
       violation of Article 3 was found by only ten votes to seven.

   52. RC v  Sweden  was  not  a  Grand  Chamber  case.   In  reaching  its
       conclusion on credibility, the majority of the ECtHR  was  impressed
       by a medical report, which said that RC had been tortured.

   53. When national courts and tribunals are considering  cases  in  which
       the ECtHR decides to embark on its own fact-finding exercise, it  is
       important to ensure that the ECtHR's  factual  conclusions  are  not
       treated as general principles of human rights law and practice.

   54. Indeed, judicial conclusions of fact will often have little light to
       shed on those  general  principles,  for  the  simple  reason  that,
       whatever standard of proof is in play,  it  is  quite  possible  for
       different judges to reach different but  valid  conclusions  on  the
       same  evidence.  We  see  this  graphically  demonstrated   in   the
       dissenting judgments recorded above.

   55.  In RC, Judge Fura gave a strong dissenting opinion,  in  which  she
       disagreed with the  significance  placed  by  the  majority  on  the
       medical report.   In  MA  v  Switzerland,  Judge  Kj�lbro  explained
       cogently why he took issue with the  significance  afforded  by  the
       majority to the court summons from Iran.

   56. We are, of course, well aware of the status  of  minority  opinions.
       They  nevertheless  reinforce  the  point  that  different   judges,
       properly applying a particular standard of proof,  can  legitimately
       reach different conclusions on the evidence.

   57. It is, therefore, not possible to  find  support  for  Mr  Bedford's
       primary submission from the ways  in  which,  in  these  cases,  the
       members of the ECtHR have gone about their fact-finding  tasks.   In
       particular, there is nothing in the cases to suggest that the  court
       regards the threshold of "evidence capable of proving ..." as a  low
       one, let alone so low as to catch only cases that are bound to fail,
       on any rational view.

   58. We turn to the "softer" version of Mr Bedford's  submissions.   This
       involves an analysis of Article 4.5 of the Qualification  Directive.



   59. The first point to mention is one  which  we  have  already  touched
       upon; namely, that Article 4.5 is, on its face, wholly  inconsistent
       with Mr Bedford's "strong" version.  Mr  Bedford,  however,  submits
       that the effect of Article 4.5 is as follows.

   60. The provision applies only in cases where an  applicant's  statement
       is not "supported by documentary or other  evidence".   Article  4.5
       explains the circumstances in which the  absence  of  such  evidence
       can, in effect, be set to one side and the applicant's  claim  still
       accepted as satisfying the burden and  standard  of  proof.   Where,
       however, an applicant does have such documentary or other  evidence,
       in addition to his or her own statement, Mr Bedford submits that the
       corollary of Article 4.5 is the applicant  is  thereby  entitled  to
       succeed.

   61. We do not accept this interpretation.  Article  4.5  means  what  it
       says.  A person who, in respect of each  of  sub-paragraphs  (a)  to
       (e), has put forward a cogent claim should not fail, merely  because
       he or she does not have supporting documentation.   Nowhere  in  the
       Qualification Directive is there to be found any  statement  to  the
       effect that a person who has documentation which, on its  face,  may
       be said to be supportive  of  the  claim  (for  example,  an  arrest
       warrant or  witness  summons),  but  whose  claim  is  found  to  be
       problematic in other respects, has nevertheless made out their case,
       so that the burden of disproving it shifts to the government.

   62. Although it was not cited before us, we observe that in KS  (Benefit
       of the Doubt) [2014] UKUT 00552 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held  that
       "the  ambit  of  Article  4.5  is   limited   to   cases   of   non-
       corroboration/confirmation"  (paragraph  85).  We  agree  with  that
       finding.

   63.  Nothing we have said is intended  to  diminish  the  importance  of
       Article  4.5  in  the  circumstances  in  which  it  applies.  Those
       circumstances must, however, be kept in mind.  Article  4.5  has  no
       application outside them.

   64. In  Tanveer  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT*  00439,  the  Immigration  Appeal
       Tribunal in a "starred" decision, held that it  is  unnecessary  for
       the respondent to allege that a document relied on by an  individual
       is a forgery, in order to resist the submission  that  the  document
       must be given weight by the Tribunal.  Accordingly, as  set  out  in
       summary in paragraph 38 of the IAT's determination: "It  is  for  an
       individual claimant to show that a document on  which  he  seeks  to
       rely can be relied on".

   65. There is nothing in the Strasbourg case  law  or  the  Qualification
       Directive to call that statement into doubt.   What  the  Strasbourg
       case law does demonstrate is that, where a judicial  fact-finder  is
       satisfied that a document adduced by an  applicant  in  evidence  is
       reliable, then this may mean that the government in question will be
       required to show why the applicant is,  nevertheless,  not  at  real
       risk.   Depending  on  the  circumstances,  that  may  require   the
       government  to  make  its  own  enquiries  regarding  the  document.
       However, as can  be  seen  from  the  dissenting  judgments  in  the
       Strasbourg cases, there is, emphatically, no "bright line" rule that
       governs judicial fact-finding in this area.

   66. For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the Judge  applied  the
       correct burden and standard of proof as set out at [4] to [6] of the
       Decision.  The summary there given is consistent with what we say at
       [8] above.


  67. Before we turn to ground two, we need to deal with another issue which
      Mr Bedford raised for the first time in the Appellant's  statement  of
      case which concerns the Judge's approach to the  Appellant's  position
      as a child and whether his age was properly taken  into  account  when
      the Judge reached her credibility findings.  We refuse  permission  to
      the Appellant to raise this ground (insofar as permission was formally
      sought which it was not).  This issue was not raised in either set  of
      grounds of appeal and permission to appeal was not  therefore  granted
      on that ground.  In any event, as Mr Najib for the Respondent  pointed
      out, the Judge has dealt with the Appellant's age at the time  of  his
      claim and the events which led to it and has reached  her  credibility
      findings with that factor in mind (see in particular [17] and [18]  of
      the Decision).






    Ground Two: Application of Background Evidence


  68. Turning then to the Appellant's ground two, that focusses on the  risk
      to the Appellant himself of forcible recruitment by the Taliban.   The
      Appellant says that he falls within an established  risk  category  as
      identified by the UNHCR in its reports dated 2013 and 2016.   He  says
      that the Judge has erred in her conclusion at [13]  and  [18]  of  the
      Decision by  finding  that  the  up-to-date  and  relevant  background
      information was at odds with the Appellant's claim to be  at  risk  of
      forcible recruitment by the Taliban in Nangarhar Province.


  69. The paragraphs of the Decision which are criticised by  the  Appellant
      in this regard are [13] and [18] as follows:


           "[13] The Appellant had said in his asylum interview  that  lots
           of young men from the  village  were  forced  to  take  part  in
           fighting by the Taliban.  The background material suggests  that
           forced recruitment  was  a  rare  occurrence  and  only  usually
           occurred from refugee camps.  The Appellant's father was  not  a
           medic and had no particular value to the  Taliban,  as  was  the
           case for the Appellant.   It  was  difficult  to  reconcile  the
           evidence from the Appellant that  there  had  been  many  forced
           recruits  from  his  village  with   the   background   material
           suggesting otherwise.
           ...
           [18]  I have  considered  the  Appellant's  material  claims  in
           accordance with paragraph 339L  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
           noting that he was 16 years of age at the  time  of  his  asylum
           interview.   He  was  not  consistent  as  regards   some   very
           significant features of  his  claim.   The  discrepancies  about
           whether his father arranged the agent or his father's friend, he
           only mentioned in his screening interview that  his  mother  had
           been killed and his assertions of forced recruitment run counter
           to the background material available.  I  have  also  noted  the
           inconsistencies  outlined  in  his  age  assessment   and   have
           discounted the explanation that this  was  due  to  interpreting
           difficulties,   noting   the   nature   and   extent   of    the
           inconsistencies.  I am unable to find the Appellant credible and
           cannot accept his material claims.  As such,  I  find  that  the
           Appellant does not  have  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
           should he return to Afghanistan.   I  do  not  accept  that  his
           parents were killed by the Taliban, that his father was a forced
           recruit or that the Taliban attempted to recruit the  Appellant.
           He  is  not  at  risk  from  Taliban  retribution  or  from  the
           authorities  or  community  implying  his  allegiance   to   the
           Taliban."


  70. In support of this ground, the Appellant relies in particular  on  the
      UNHCR reports on Afghanistan in 2013 and  2016  which  expressly  deal
      with this topic.  It is important therefore to start  by  setting  out
      precisely what the UNHCR said in those  reports.   Both  reports  were
      apparently before the Judge.


  71. The 2013 report deals with this issue at [3] of  the  "Potential  Risk
      Profiles" under heading of "Men and  Boys  of  Fighting  Age"  in  the
      following terms:


           "In  areas  where  AGEs  [Anti-Government   Elements]   exercise
           effective control,  they  are  reported  to  use  a  variety  of
           mechanisms to recruit fighters, including recruitment mechanisms
           based on coercive strategies.  In  a  traditional  form  of  war
           mobilization knows as lashkar, every household  is  expected  to
           contribute a man of fighting age.  In areas where AGEs  exercise
           effective control, as well as in IDP settlements in Afghanistan,
           they are reported to use threats  and  intimidation  to  enforce
           this mechanism to recruit fighters for the  insurgency.   People
           who resist recruitment are reportedly at risk of  being  accused
           of being a government spy and being killed or  punished.   There
           are reports of families linked to the insurgency giving boys  to
           AGEs as suicide bombers, in the hope of gaining status with  the
           AGE in question.
           ALP [Afghan Local Police] commanders have also been reported  to
           forcibly recruit local community members, including  both  adult
           men and children, into ALP forces.
           In light of the foregoing, UNHCR considers  that,  depending  on
           the specific circumstances of the case, men and boys of fighting
           age living in areas under the effective control of AGEs,  or  in
           areas where pro-government forces and  AGEs  are  engaged  in  a
           struggle for control, may be in need  of  international  refugee
           protection on the ground of their  membership  of  a  particular
           social group.  Depending on the specific  circumstances  of  the
           case, men and boys of fighting age living  in  areas  where  ALP
           commanders are in a sufficiently powerful position  to  forcibly
           recruit community members into the ALP may equally be in need of
           international  refugee  protection  on  the  ground   of   their
           membership of a particular  social  group.   Men  and  boys  who
           resist forced recruitment may also be in need  of  international
           refugee protection on the ground of  their  (imputed)  political
           opinion.  Depending on the specific circumstances of  the  case,
           family members of men and boys with this profile may be in  need
           of international protection on the basis  of  their  association
           with individuals at risk."


  72. In the 2016 report, in the equivalent section, under the heading  "Men
      of Fighting Age, and Children in the Context of  Underage  and  Forced
      Recruitment" UNHCR says that "[i]ncidents  of  forced  recruitment  of
      children are said to be subject to widespread underreporting" and that
      recruitment of children by all parties to the conflict is "reported to
      be observed throughout the country".  With  that  introduction,  UNHCR
      goes on to say this:


           "(a) Forced Recruitment by AGEs
           In areas where AGEs exercise effective  control  over  territory
           and the population, they  are  reported  to  use  a  variety  of
           mechanisms to recruit fighters, including recruitment mechanisms
           based on coercive strategies.  Persons who  resist  recruitment,
           and their family members, are reportedly at risk of being killed
           or punished.
           AGEs are reported to continue to recruit children, both boys and
           girls, to carry out suicide attacks and  as  human  shields,  as
           well as to participate in  active  combat,  to  plant  IEDs,  to
           smuggle weapons and uniforms, and to act  as  spies,  guards  or
           scouts for reconnaissance."


  73.  Having  updated  its  earlier  guidance  in  relation   to   underage
      recruitment by the Afghan Government forces (which has led  to  a  law
      being put in place to  prevent  it),  the  report  finishes  with  the
      following summary:


           "In light of the foregoing, UNHCR considers that,  depending  on
           the specific circumstances of the case, men of fighting age  and
           children living in areas under the effective control of AGEs, or
           in areas where pro-government forces, AGEs and/or  armed  groups
           affiliated to ISIS are engaged in a struggle for control, may be
           in need of international refugee protection  on  the  ground  of
           their membership of a particular social group or other  relevant
           grounds.  Depending on the specific circumstances of  the  case,
           men of fighting age and  children  living  in  areas  where  ALP
           commanders are in a sufficiently powerful position  to  forcibly
           recruit community members into the ALP may equally be in need of
           international  refugee  protection  on  the  ground   of   their
           membership of  a  particular  social  group  or  other  relevant
           grounds.  Men of fighting age and  children  who  resist  forced
           recruitment  may  also  be  in  need  of  international  refugee
           protection on the ground of their (imputed)  political  opinion.
           Depending on the specific  circumstances  of  the  case,  family
           members of men and boys with this profile  may  be  in  need  of
           international protection on the basis of their association  with
           individuals at risk."


  74. Interestingly, unlike the  2013  report,  the  2016  report  does  not
      specifically highlight under-age and forced recruitment by AGEs  as  a
      problem under the heading  in  relation  to  children  (although  does
      mention it in the  summary).   However,  in  consequence,  the  source
      documents underlying the UNHCR guidance in 2016 do not  include  those
      at [356] of the source documents  underlying  the  2013  report  which
      identify specific incidents involving the recruitment of  children  by
      AGEs.  The only source material identified in the 2016 report  summary
      under the heading of "Children"  is  a  cross-reference  back  to  the
      section we identify above which is not itself sourced by reference  to
      reports of individual incidents.  We surmise though that this  may  be
      because, in the view of UNHCR, such incidents are underreported.


  75. On this topic, our attention was also drawn to what  is  said  by  the
      European Asylum Support Office in its Country  of  Origin  Information
      Report  entitled  "Afghanistan  Recruitment  by  armed  groups"  dated
      September 2016 ("the  EASO  report")  at  [1.5.5]  under  the  heading
      "Nangarhar":


           "Borhan Osman explains that in some areas where the  Taliban  is
           facing opposition and pressure from local  anti-Taliban  forces,
           it needs to assert itself in the role of protector and  may  put
           some pressure on communities to contribute - financially  or  by
           providing fighters.  This is the case in Nangarhar where  it  is
           confronted with Islamic State groups.  In this case, the Taliban
           liaised with tribal elders from the Khogyani tribe and organised
           a couple of large gatherings in  which  it  explained  that  the
           tribe, the area, and their properties  were  under  attack  from
           foreigners (Pakistani militants rebranding themselves as Islamic
           State).  In these gatherings the  Taliban  relies  on  religious
           discourse, appeal to honour of the people, cultural codes etc to
           create a consensus among the tribal elders to get their support.
            It asks for money, food, other supplies and recruits.  However,
           asking for recruits is a last resort.  The  Taliban  prefers  to
           fight itself and will only ask local leaders  to  provide  their
           local fighters in cases of severe shortage.  The Khogyani elders
           agreed to support the Taliban against IS by  providing  supplies
           and not giving shelter to Islamic State fighters.   In  case  of
           unexpected attacks at night, they might have asked for a  couple
           of men (4-5) per village in order to be able to repel the attack
           but this mobilisation would  have  been  temporary  because  the
           Taliban would move in its mobile special forces in the following
           days to fight back.  Osman explains that he did not  know  about
           such a particular case but this is how it would happen according
           to his information."


  76.  Unsurprisingly,  this  evidence  is  relied  upon  largely   by   the
      Respondent.  As Mr Bedford pointed out, the source of this evidence is
      only one telephone interview with one gentleman in April 2016.   We do
      note though that Mr Osman is  an  Afghan  expert  in  the  Afghanistan
      Analysts Network who is said to have been studying  the  Taliban  very
      closely.  We  note  also  that  the  report  contains  more   detailed
      particulars of how the Taliban operates in the specific home  area  of
      the Appellant than does either the 2013 or 2016 report  of  the  UNHCR
      which is vague and applies more generally.


  77. Mr Najib also drew our attention to the section  of  the  EASO  report
      which sets out the views of Dr Giustozzi, an expert who is familiar to
      this Tribunal and who has given expert evidence about  Afghanistan  to
      the Tribunal.  His views are set out at 1.5 where this is said:


           "Antonio  Guistozzi  says  that  in  Afghan  social   structures
           decisions are made by  heads  of  families,  tribal  elders  and
           community leaders... The decision to mobilise fighters  is  made
           by them and Afghans do not refer  to  'forced  recruitment',  as
           they do not think in terms of individual rights.  The  decisions
           made by leaders are legitimate and accepted by the social  units
           (family and tribe).  Therefore 'forced recruitment' is a concept
           that does not stem from the Afghan social context."


  78. That view is underpinned by what is said by Ms Gossman of Human Rights
      Watch reported also in that section.


  79. As Mr Najib observed, there is  some  disagreement  between  EASO  and
      UNHCR about what is understood to be forced recruitment.  That can  be
      seen from the criticism made by EASO at [1.5] of  its  report  of  the
      UNHCR update in 2014 reporting on  recruitment  by  insurgents.   EASO
      criticises those reports on the basis that they "do not  mention  what
      is  exactly  understood  by  'forced  recruitment'  and  there  is  no
      information on what actors were involved or on the prevalence of it".


  80. Mr Najib also drew  our  attention  to  the  Home  Office  Operational
      Guidance Note for Afghanistan reissued in February 2015  ("the  OGN").
      At [3.10.15] to [3.10.17] of the OGN, the report refers  to  a  Danish
      report  issued  in  May  2012  following  a  fact-finding  mission  to
      Afghanistan which is there cited as follows:


           "[3.10.15] The same Danish report states "UNHCR  referred  to  a
           leaked ISAF report on the state of the Taliban  in  relation  to
           the change of  strategy  of  the  Taliban.   According  to  this
           report, the Taliban  do  not  have  difficulties  in  recruiting
           people for their force.  They have many volunteers and there  is
           a willingness to join the movement.   The  Taliban  may  recruit
           collectively in the  villages  by  offering  education  to  poor
           people's sons and  by  brain  washing  people."  "Based  on  its
           research, Co-operation for Peace and Unity" (CPAU)  stated  that
           poverty, unemployment, and a desire for higher social status  in
           the community, rather than ideological  reasons,  are  the  main
           factors driving the recruitment to the Taliban.
           [3.10.16] The EASO report (referred to  in  3.10.4)  provides  a
           comprehensive  insight  into  the  Taliban,  a  history  of  the
           conflict in Afghanistan and recruitment  strategies.   It  notes
           that "Local and autonomous  commanders,  tribal  structures  and
           religious  clerics  are  the   main   channels   through   which
           recruitment is facilitated within  Afghanistan.   As  a  general
           principle, it could be stated that the local cell  -  commander,
           tribe, family or madrassa - is the basic  recruitment  hub.   In
           general, the direct use of coercion or retaliation for  refusing
           enlistment by the Taliban is not typical for the current  Afghan
           insurgency.  There are cases of forced  recruitment,  but  these
           are considered as exceptional.   To  gain  support  and  recruit
           fighters, they relied on  economic  needs,  fear  and  coercion,
           pride and honour, tribe and tradition, religious persuasion etc.
             Clerics  played  an  indispensable  role  in  the  recruitment
           processes."  In  its  summary  the  EASO  report  states  "Other
           sources stated explicitly that force or coercion were  not  used
           for recruitment in their provinces:  Ghazni,  Herat  and  Logar.
           Sources discussing the general situation in Afghanistan commonly
           state that coercion is rare in the  recruitment  process.   They
           sometimes refer to locations where it did happen: refugee  camps
           and areas under strong influence of  the  Taliban.   One  source
           mentioned that the Taliban recruited porters and  medical  staff
           by force in  areas  under  their  control.   Some  sources  gave
           arguments  against  forced  recruitment:   it   would   alienate
           communities or there is  no  need  for  it,  since  the  Taliban
           dispose of sufficient volunteers.
           [3.10.17] In July 2012 UNHCR welcomed the EASO report and  noted
           "The report focusses on forced recruitment by  the  Taliban  and
           concludes  that  the  Taliban  only  uses   forced   recruitment
           exceptionally.   The   report   defines   "forced   recruitment"
           narrowly, limiting its scope of application to situations  where
           individuals are forced to join the  Taliban  under  the  use  or
           threat of immediate violence.  The report does  not  include  in
           this definition Taliban recruitment mechanisms based on  broader
           coercive strategies, including fear, intimidation and the use of
           tribal mechanisms to pressurize  individuals  into  joining  the
           Taliban.  The report's conclusion that forced recruitment is the
           exception rather than the rule should therefore not be taken  to
           apply  to  these  other  forms  of  coercive  recruitment.    In
           circumstances where recruitment is based at  least  in  part  on
           fear, intimidation, tribal pressures or other coercive elements,
           it is exceedingly difficult  to  make  a  clear-cut  distinction
           between  individuals  joining  the   Taliban   voluntarily   and
           individuals being forcibly  recruited.    Where  Afghan  asylum-
           seekers claim to have fled forcible recruitment by the  Taliban,
           decision-makers in EU Member States will need  to  identify  the
           precise nature of the coercion of which the applicant  complains
           and decide the case on the basis of the  applicant's  individual
           circumstances.  Amnesty International expressed concern that the
           term "forced  recruitment"  is  defined  narrowly  in  the  EASO
           report: "In its conclusion the EASO  does  not  acknowledge  the
           situations of persons  joining  or  supporting  the  Taleban  as
           result of indirect  methods  of  intimidation  such  as  through
           instilling fear among the local population by threatening  night
           letters, killing individuals, including children,  perceived  as
           spies or supporters of the government, the extortion  of  fines,
           as well as pressuring individuals to join  the  Taliban  through
           tribal, family and  religious  mechanisms,  and  other  indirect
           means  of  coercion.   Also,   in   the   current   context   of
           reintegration and reconciliation efforts with the Taliban, it is
           expected that more people, including members of ethnic  minority
           groups, may submit to Taliban demands, fearing reprisals."


       Mr Najib also drew our  attention  to  the  UNHCR  July  2012  paper
       entitled "Forced recruitment by the Taliban in Afghanistan:  UNHCR's
       perspective" from where the UNHCR comments  there  incorporated  are
       taken.


  81. In its conclusion, the OGN states as follows:


           "[3.10.18] Conclusion. The risk from anti government groups will
           be highest in the areas where  they  operate  or  have  control.
           Caseworkers will need to take into account the most up  to  date
           country information, the nature of the threat and the particular
           profile of the claimant.  For applicants who can  demonstrate  a
           well-founded fear of persecution for  reason  of  their  imputed
           political opinion and who are unable to  acquire  protection  or
           relocate internally, a grant of asylum will be appropriate.
           [3.10.19] Forced recruitment  by  Taliban  military  commanders,
           leaders or fighters (i.e.situations where individuals  or  their
           families are directly approached and forced  to  join  up  under
           threat of retaliation or violence if  they  refuse)  has  to  be
           considered as exceptional.  The risk will be  highest  in  areas
           where armed anti-government groups are operating or have control
           and in refugee camps but the evidence of recruitment driven more
           by  broader  coercive  strategies,  such  as  economics,   fear,
           intimidation, pride and honour, religious persuasion and the use
           of tribal mechanisms to pressurise individuals into joining  the
           Taliban, rather than by force."


  82. Mr Najib also reminded us that the case of HK  and  others  (minors  -
      indiscriminate violence - forced recruitment by Taliban - contact with
      family members) Afghanistan CG [2010] UKUT 378 (IAC) ("HK and others")
      remains extant country guidance to which we need to have regard.  That
      country guidance remained binding on Judge Moan  unless  displaced  by
      later material.  Mr Najib drew our attention to what is said at [2] of
      the headnote as follows:


           "While forcible recruitment by the Taliban cannot be  discounted
           as a risk, particularly in areas of high  militant  activity  or
           militant control, evidence is required to show that it is a real
           risk  for  the  particular  child  concerned  and  not  a   mere
           possibility."


  83. That conclusion is underpinned by [29] to [39] of the  decision  which
      refers at  [39]  to  there  being  "anecdotal  evidence"  of  forcible
      recruitment by the Taliban in parts of Afghanistan but  no  more.   We
      accept of course that the decision is now of some  antiquity  relating
      to the position in 2010.  It has not though been  overtaken  by  later
      country guidance.


  84. Although of course documents post-dating the  Decision  cannot  inform
      the issue whether there is an error of law disclosed by the  Decision,
      nonetheless, such documents can illustrate whether any error is or  is
      not material.  To that extent, we take  into  account  also  the  most
      recent  country  guidance  encompassed  in  AS   (Safety   of   Kabul)
      Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 118 (IAC) ("AS") and  the  Landinfo  report
      entitled "Afghanistan: Recruitment to Taliban" dated June  2017  ("the
      Landinfo report") as relied upon by the Respondent.


  85. We accept that the guidance in AS  was  largely  concerned  only  with
      safety of return to Kabul.  However, it has some relevance as follows.




  86. First, the Tribunal expressly upheld the earlier country  guidance  in
      AK  (Article  15(c)  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  163   (IAC).    In
      consequence,  the  Appellant  cannot   argue   that   the   level   of
      indiscriminate violence  in  Afghanistan  reaches  the  Article  15(c)
      threshold unless there is later material which shows that the position
      has changed, and that country guidance should not be followed.


  87. Second, the Tribunal in AS upheld the earlier country guidance  in  AA
      (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012]  UKUT  00016  (IAC)  which
      itself upholds HK and others to which we refer at [82] above.  We have
      already cited the relevant paragraph of the headnote  which  continues
      to apply unless the Appellant can show by more  recent  material  that
      the position has changed to such an extent that the  country  guidance
      should no longer be followed.


   88. Third, the Tribunal, in AS, also heard evidence from  Dr  Giustozzi.
       At [84] of the country guidance decision, the position as to  forced
       recruitment is summarised as follows:


           "In the Afghan context, there appears to be no  agreement  about
           the meaning of  forced  recruitment  to  armed  groups,  instead
           commentators refer to mobilisation  of  fighters  and  agreement
           within social structures for recruitment, albeit with the use of
           coercion, duress or force in some  cases.   There  is  also  the
           possibility that the term forced recruitment necessarily applies
           to children because they're not old enough to make  an  informed
           choice as opposed to a more  literal  use  of  force  for  their
           recruitment."

  89. Reference is there made to the divergence of expert opinion about what
      constitutes "forced recruitment" but, consistently with  the  material
      to which we have already referred that, in general, the evidence  does
      not support a finding of recruitment by actual force.  Although AS  is
      predominantly concerned with safety on return to Kabul, we  reject  Mr
      Bedford's suggestion that the section dealing with the evidence  about
      forced recruitment is narrowly confined to dealing with risks  in  the
      capital when that section is read as a whole.  Although  we  recognise
      that what is said about the evidence of  Ms  Winterbotham  might  lend
      some support to the Appellant's case, we note from [62] of the country
      guidance decision that the Tribunal found that  her  evidence  carried
      "far less weight" because of her approach.


  90. Landinfo is Norway's Country of  Origin  Information  Centre.   Having
      drawn attention to what was said by UNHCR in its July  2012  paper  to
      which we refer at [80]  above  and  drawing  attention  again  to  the
      distinction between the approach of the various organisations  to  the
      definition of "forced recruitment" the report goes on to criticise the
      UNHCR 2016 report on which the Appellant here places reliance  in  the
      following terms [page 17]:


           "The claims are geographically delimited to  "areas  where  AGEs
           exercise effective control over the territory  and  population".
           It is therefore difficult to know which areas UNHCR is referring
           to and whether the claim is valid only for such areas.  Landinfo
           would also point out that UNHCR, by using the  terms  "reported"
           and "reportedly" seems to distance themselves from the  validity
           of the substance in the documentation.
           The allegations of coercion are substantiated by  references  to
           documentation from both UNHCR itself,  news  media,  the  Afghan
           authorities and other international organisations such as  Human
           Rights Watch (HRW) and  International  Crisis  Group.   In  some
           cases, in Landinfo's opinion, there is little or no  correlation
           between the UNHCR's assessments and the  documentation  (country
           information) presented.  This applies to both the  claim  "[...]
           recruitment mechanisms based on  coercive  strategies"  and  the
           claim "[...] at risk of being killed or punished" (UNHCR 2016)."


  91. The report goes on to consider other sources including the  2016  EASO
      report before again citing Dr Giustozzi's conversation  with  Landinfo
      itself in 2010 where he is said to have opined that  the  Taliban  did
      not need to use coercion.  Reference is made to an article written  by
      him in 2011 where he states that:


           "Forced recruitment has not been  a  salient  characteristic  of
           this conflict.  The insurgents have made  recourse  to  it  only
           very marginally, mainly forcing male villagers  in  areas  under
           their control and not sympathetic to the  insurgents'  cause  to
           serve as porters." [taken from page [18] of the Landinfo report]


  92. The report goes on to note that information provided by  Dr  Giustozzi
      in 2015 did not differ from  those  views  and  that  the  views  were
      confirmed by others who they had consulted.


  93. We record that Mr Bedford did draw  our  attention  to  some  material
      which he said showed that the general level of  violence  had  changed
      for the worse since AK.  Dealing first with  the  report  of  Dr  Lisa
      Schuster (report dated December 2015 at  [AB/46-86]),  the  Judge  has
      dealt with what that shows at [33] to  [40]  of  the  Decision  before
      reaching the conclusion at [41] that the Article 15 (c)  threshold  is
      not met.  Mr Bedford also referred to a small number of press  reports
      relating to violence in Nangarhar province  which  all  post-date  the
      Decision.  The reports at [AB/88-90] record two attacks  in  Jalalabad
      at public places in May 2018 which killed  nine  and  eight  civilians
      respectively and injured over thirty and forty-five further civilians.
      The third report relates to the bombing of the car of a local official
      in the same month.


  94. Mr Bedford also drew our attention to a report by  the  Institute  for
      War and Peace Reporting (UK) at [AB/101-102] which also post-dates the
      Decision.   We  did  not  find  that  of  much   assistance   to   our
      consideration of the issues before us because although it  deals  with
      the case of two teenagers from Nangarhar who were recruited  to  fight
      for the  Taliban  there  is  no  suggestion  that  this  was  forcible
      recruitment in the sense that the Appellant claims exists.


  95. We return then to what is the central issue which is whether the Judge
      took into account the material before her when dealing with the  issue
      of forced recruitment and whether, if  she  did  not,  such  error  is
      material.  The Appellant's position is that what is said  at  [13]  of
      the Decision does not show that the Judge took the background material
      into account at all, particularly the UNHCR reports of 2013 and  2016.
      The Respondent's position is that the Judge did take into account that
      material but did not need to cite it or deal with it expressly because
      the conclusions of UNHCR  are  not  firm  enough  to  warrant  express
      mention and/or because those opinions  are  not  consistent  with  the
      generality of the background evidence which supports the Judge's  view
      that forced recruitment is not generally an issue which gives rise  to
      a risk on return.


  96. Having set out fully the material  which  was  before  the  Judge,  in
      particular the views expressed in the EASO report and the OGN, we have
      concluded that the Judge did not  fall  into  error  in  this  regard.
      Whilst, ideally, it may have been useful to refer to the fact that not
      all the background evidence points the same way and that  there  is  a
      divergence of view as to what is encompassed within the definition  of
      "forced recruitment", the Judge did not need to do so.  The  claim  by
      the Appellant is that his father had been recruited to the Taliban  by
      actual force, that he feared that the same would  happen  to  him  and
      that he would be killed or forced to act against his will as a suicide
      bomber.  Such a fear, even if genuinely subjectively held, is not made
      out on an objective basis when the background evidence is  considered,
      read as a whole.


  97. For the above reasons, we are not satisfied that the Decision contains
      a material error of law.  We therefore uphold the Decision.


    DECISION


    We are satisfied that the Decision does not contain a material error of
    law.  We  uphold  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Moan
    promulgated  on  21  November  2016  with  the  consequence  that   the
    Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.
