For the Appellant:     Mr M Gill, QC, of Counsel, instructed by Lee Valley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chana (the judge), promulgated  on  26  March  2018,  by
    which she dismissed his appeal against the Respondent's decision of  16
    November 2016, which in turn had refused his human rights  claim  (made
    by way of an application for indefinite leave to remain  on  8  January
    2015).

 2. That application had been for indefinite leave to remain on  the  basis
    of ten years' continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom.

 3. The refusal was predicated upon an allegation that  the  Appellant  had
    been dishonest in respect of an  English  language  test  taken  on  29
    August 2012.  As a result of the alleged dishonesty paragraphs  322(1A)
    and 322(2) of the general grounds  of  refusal  under  the  Rules  were
    relied on.  This had the effect of precluding the Appellant from  being
    able to satisfy all of the  requirements  of  276B,  specifically  sub-
    paragraph (ii)(c).

 4. What was rather unusual about the Appellant's case is that the  English
    language issue (hereafter the ETS issue) had not  been  raised  by  the
    Respondent when refusing a previous application made by  the  Appellant
    in 2015.




The judge's decision

 5. At [15] the judge concluded that the only live issue in the appeal  was
    whether or not the Appellant had been dishonest in respect of  the  ETS
    issue.  She rightly emphasised the fact-specific nature of  cases  such
    as the present.  The judge concluded that  the  Respondent  had  proved
    that the Appellant had indeed been dishonest  in  respect  of  the  ETS
    issue and that as a result paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Rules  applied.
    Therefore the Appellant was unable to satisfy  all  the  provisions  of
    276B and that his Article 8 claim would fail.

 6. The basis for this conclusion was essentially that the  judge  did  not
    find  aspects  of  the  Appellant's  evidence  to  be   credible.    In
    particular, she did not accept the evidence that the Appellant had been
    unable to submit evidence about the speaking  component  of  a  City  &
    Guilds English language test that  he  had  undertaken,  and  that  the
    Appellant had failed to show that he had in fact attended a prestigious
    English  language  school  in  Pakistan.   A  further  reason  was  her
    rejection of the Appellant's claim to have taken  an  English  language
    test when it had been unnecessary and that it was implausible that  the
    Appellant would have remained in this country for a significant  period
    of time and studied for as long as he did.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The grounds of appeal are lengthy and make a number of attacks  on  the
    judge's approach to the ETS issue.  Of significance in this case is the
    list of issues which were said to have been raised before the judge  by
    the Appellant's Counsel (not Mr Gill).  I will deal with the  substance
    of the most significant of the grounds, below.

 8. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but was then granted  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor  on  1
    November 2018.







The hearing before me

 9. Given the date of the claim/application, I did ask the  representatives
    to clarify whether or not the Appellant's appeal fell to be  considered
    under the old statutory appeal regime in force  before  the  amendments
    brought about by the  2014  Immigration  Act  or  whether  the  current
    provisions applied.  It is fair to say that the situation  appeared  to
    be somewhat unclear. However, it was agreed for  the  purposes  of  the
    appeal the particular framework did not matter.

10. Mr Gill relied on the grounds of appeal.  I indicated those  challenges
    which appeared  to  have  more  merit  than  some  of  the  others,  in
    particular the points raised about paragraph 322(1A) and  an  interview
    conducted with the Appellant by the Respondent in 2015,  together  with
    the Appellant's reliance on an IELTS certificate indicating that he had
    a very good level of English at the time of the ETS test.

11. Mr Duffy, with his customary candour, checked the Respondent's database
    and confirmed  that  there  had  indeed  been  an  interview  with  the
    Appellant conducted on 7 September 2015.  This interview had related to
    the  ETS  issue.   The  note  on  the  database  confirmed   that   the
    interviewing  officer  had  found  the  Appellant's  evidence   to   be
    "credible".  No record of that interview has ever  been  produced.   Mr
    Duffy also accepted that the judge was wrong  to  have  concluded  that
    paragraph 322(1A) applied in the Appellant's  case.   That  is  because
    this particular provision relates only to "the application"  which  led
    to the refusal currently under appeal: it did not  relate  to  previous
    applications.

12. In light of the above, Mr Duffy quite rightly accepted that the judge's
    decision as a whole was unsafe.




Decision on error of law

13. I conclude that there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.  These are threefold.

14. First, I am satisfied  that  the  judge  was  made  aware  of  the  ETS
    interview and that the Respondent had not challenged the  fact  of  its
    occurrence and that no negative issues  had  arisen  as  a  consequence
    thereof.  I am satisfied that  the  Appellant  had  asserted  that  the
    Respondent had indeed found him to have been telling  the  truth  as  a
    result of that interview.  The judge has simply failed to  engage  with
    this evidence at all.  There is no specific finding that the  interview
    took place, or what its effect was in  respect  of  the  allegation  of
    dishonesty.  This aspect of the  evidence  was  particularly  important
    given that the Respondent had not raised the ETS issue in the past.

15. Second, the judge was wrong to have concluded  that  paragraph  322(1A)
    applied to the Appellant's case.  It is, in my view, well-settled  that
    the  phrase  in  that  provision,  "the  application"  relates  to  the
    application leading to  the  refusal  currently  under  appeal  to  the
    Tribunal.  It does  not  relate  to  previous  applications.   Although
    paragraph 322(2), which  does  relate  to  previous  applications,  was
    raised in the reasons for  refusal  letter,  the  judge  quite  clearly
    relies on the inapplicable general ground for refusal in her  decision.
    Given that paragraph  322(2)  is  a  discretionary  ground  of  refusal
    (unlike 322(1A), which is mandatory) the judge's  error  had  potential
    consequences as to make it material.

16. Third,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  did  produce  an  IELTS
    certificate indicating that he had a score of 8  at  the  hearing  (see
    [24]).  The  judge  fails  to  have  factored  this  into  her  overall
    assessment.  This evidence was significant because it showed  a  strong
    command of the English language at the material time that the Appellant
    had taken the ETS language test.

17. In light of these material errors of law I  set  the  judge's  decision
    aside.




Remaking the decision

18. Both representatives were agreed that I could  and  should  remake  the
    decision on the basis of the evidence now before me.  This I now do.

19. It has been accepted throughout that  the  Appellant  has  accrued  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the United  Kingdom  and  I  find
    this to be the case.

20. I turn to the ETS issue.  For present purposes I will accept  that  the
    generic evidence provided by the Respondent discharges  the  relatively
    low evidential threshold.  This is consistent  with  case  law  on  the
    subject including Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615.

21. I move on to consider whether the Appellant has  provided  an  innocent
    explanation to the allegations made against him.   First  and  foremost
    there is what I consider  to  be  the  extremely  significant  evidence
    relating to the interview conducted in September  2015.   I  find  that
    this interview in fact took place, that it in fact related specifically
    to concerns over the relevant English language test in 2012,  and  that
    the  interviewing  officer  found  the  Appellant's  evidence   to   be
    "credible", as confirmed by Mr Duffy at the hearing and in the printout
    of the database which he has helpfully provided to me post-hearing (now
    on file).

22. In effect, this evidence shows that an officer of the Respondent acting
    within his/her powers specifically addressed their mind  to  the  issue
    now in dispute and concluded that the Appellant had not been dishonest.
      There  is  no  evidence  whatsoever  postdating  this  interview   to
    significantly undermine the conclusion reached after the  interview  in
    2015.

23.  In  addition,  there  are  several  other  factors  pointing  in   the
    Appellant's favour.  I am satisfied that he did indeed achieve a  score
    of 8 in the IELTS test and that this indicates a  very  good  level  of
    English at the time at which the Respondent alleges he  was  having  to
    use a proxy test taker in respect of the ETS issue.  In saying this,  I
    do appreciate that people may have a variety of reasons  for  cheating,
    but I am of course assessing  the  Appellant's  case  on  the  evidence
    before me and not on generalisations.

24. I also look back to the history of the appellate  proceedings  in  this
    country.  I note that in an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal heard  in
    December 2011 (IA/32481/2011), the judge, whilst acknowledging that the
    Appellant had not produced a certificate for a City  &  Guilds  English
    test, clearly found the Appellant to have a good level of English ([12]
    of that decision).  The decision was overturned on appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal.  At that stage the Respondent conceded that the Appellant had
    then been able to provide all relevant  information  and  that  he  did
    satisfy all the requirements of the Rules in respect of Tier  4.   This
    of course included the English language ability.  The relevance of this
    is that it provides contemporaneous  evidence  as  to  the  Appellant's
    English language ability with reference to the ETS test.

25. Even leaving aside entirely the issue of the Appellant's  schooling  in
    Pakistan, he has provided what in my view is a very strong rebuttal  to
    the allegations against him.

26. The Respondent has not been able to  produce  any  cogent  evidence  to
    materially undermine the Appellant's explanation.

27. Ultimately, I find that the Respondent  has  failed  to  discharge  the
    burden  of  proof  in  respect  of  paragraph  322(2)  of  the   Rules.
    Therefore, none of the  general  grounds  of  refusal  applies  to  the
    Appellant's case.

28. No other public interest concerns have been raised by the Respondent.

29.  Therefore,  I  conclude  that  the  Appellant  has  met  all  of   the
    requirements of paragraph 276B of the Rules.

30. What is the consequence of this?  Although there is a lack of certainty
    as to which appellate regime applies to this appeal, it really  matters
    not.  For the sake of argument and in light  of  TZ  (Pakistan)  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1109 and OA and Others (human  rights;  'new  matter';  s.120)
    Nigeria [2019] UKUT  00065  (IAC),  I  conclude  that  the  Appellant's
    satisfaction  of  paragraph  276B  has  the  effect  of  rendering  the
    Respondent's decision a disproportionate interference with his  private
    life, that refusal thereby being unlawful under section 6 of the  Human
    Rights Act 1998.

31. Although it is not for me to direct the type of leave to be granted  by
    the Respondent as a result of my decision, the Appellant would  have  a
    very strong case in arguing that  indefinite  leave  to  remain  should
    follow.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the Appellant's appeal on the  basis  that
the Respondent's refusal  of  his  human  rights  claim  is  unlawful  under
section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. In light of the very late disclosure  of  the  outcome  of
the 2015  interview,  the  very  least  the  Appellant  can  expect  is  the
repayment of his fee.
