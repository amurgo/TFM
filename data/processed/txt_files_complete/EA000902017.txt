                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Vereena Jones), sitting at Birmingham on 9  August,  to
    an EEA appeal by a  citizen  of  Albania,  born  1984.  Permission  was
    granted by a first-tier judge on two grounds:

      1)       the  judge  should  have  offered  the  appellant,  who   was
         unrepresented before her too, an adjournment so  he  could  provide
         evidence of  his  ex-wife's  financial  standing  as  a  'qualified
         person' at the relevant date; and

      2)      she did not allow for the ex-wife's being both a student and a
         self-employed person at the time in question.

 2. History   The appellant arrived in May 2011, when he met and  moved  in
    with his future wife, a  Bulgarian  citizen:  in  May  2012  they  were
    married, and in May 2013 he got a residence card on that basis. However
    in November 2015 they separated and she issued a petition for  divorce,
    on which a decree  nisi  was  granted  in  December,  with  the  decree
    absolute following on 2 February 2016.

 3. In May 2016 the appellant applied for a permanent  residence  card,  on
    the strength of his  retained  rights.  On  5  January  2017  that  was
    refused, and his ordinary card  revoked:  the  reason  given,  in  very
    general terms, was that he had not shown his ex-wife was  a  'qualified
    person'.

 4. Law       At the time it was thought that the relevant date in  a  case
    of this kind was that of the decree absolute; but in Baigazieva  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1088 it was held to be  the  issuing  of  the  petition.  That
    decision came out on 20 April, and it, or the rule in it, was known  to
    the judge, and to the appellant's former solicitors,  who  drafted  the
    present grounds of appeal, and were acting for him  at  least  till  15
    March, when they made inquiries from the Home Office; but they said the
    appellant had known nothing about it.

 5. That may be so; but,  without  going  into  what  the  appellant  might
    reasonably have been expected to produce at the hearing,  it  is  worth
    looking at what evidence he did produce, and whether the change in what
    was understood to be the relevant date had made any difference.

 6. First, the judge accepted that  the  appellant's  ex-wife  had  been  a
    student for the whole of the 2015 - 16 academic year. However,  as  the
    judge noted, that entitled her to be considered as a 'qualified person'
    only  so  long  as  (see  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 reg. 4 (1) (d)), she was also a person who

       (ii)   has comprehensive  sickness  insurance  cover  in  the  United
           Kingdom; and

       (iii)  has assured the Secretary of State, by means of a declaration,
           or by such equivalent means as the person may choose,  that  the
           person has sufficient resources not to become a  burden  on  the
           social assistance  system  of  the  United  Kingdom  during  the
           person's intended period of residence.

 7. These were not criteria  the  appellant's  ex-wife  could  satisfy;  so
    clearly she could not be a 'qualified person' as a student, and  needed
    to rely on her status as a self-employed person.  The  evidence  before
    the judge about her self-employed status at the relevant time came from
    her own statement, and from another, produced by the Home Office, by an
    official of HM Revenue and Customs called Roger Drew, as well  as  from
    her bank statements from 12 December 2015 to 11 March 2016.

 8. So far as self-employed income during that period  was  concerned,  the
    judge accurately noted that there were payments of �245.26 in  December
    from the University of Westminster (apparently for 'student ambassador'
    work), and �350 in January from another Bulgarian lady by the  name  of
    Savina Ivanova, for whom she had done some video  work.  The  ex-wife's
    statement shows two further payments of �570 in all for photography she
    had done for Robert Martin between 15 January and 10 February; but that
    could not possibly have affected the position at the relevant date.

 9. As Mr Bramble pointed out, these are all the sums mentioned by the  ex-
    wife (see her paragraph 8) as  received  by  her  from  self-employment
    "When Luan and I were undergoing divorce ...". At least the first three
    came before the date of the decree absolute, and there  is  nothing  in
    the ex-wife's statement to suggest that she had  more  than  occasional
    self-employed work during her year as a student. The figures before the
    judge could not possibly have shown she was self-supporting as a  self-
    employed person.

10. The appellant's ex-wife had been exceptionally  co-operative  with  him
    for someone in that situation, and, as he had to acknowledge, she might
    be expected to know best about what income she was getting.  Regardless
    of what might have been expected from the appellant by way  of  dealing
    with the effect of Baigazieva, the best evidence he had been  able,  or
    was likely to be able to produce about his ex-wife's  income  fell  far
    short of showing she was a 'qualified person' at the relevant date.
