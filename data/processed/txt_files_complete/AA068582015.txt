Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Chandran
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Thailand  born  in  1980.   She  appealed
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 4  March  2015  to
    remove by way of directions.  She was refused asylum.

 2. The basis of her claim in brief is that she was trafficked  to  the  UK
    for sexual exploitation.  She fears her traffickers were she to  return
    to Thailand.  There would not be state protection and she would not  be
    able to internally relocate.

 3. The  Secretary  of  State  in  the  refusal  letter  having  noted  the
    Appellant's coherent and consistent account coupled with the conclusion
    of the Competent Authority accepted that she had been trafficked to the
    UK.

 4. On sufficiency of protection having reviewed  background  material  the
    Respondent considered that the Appellant  had  failed  to  establish  a
    sustained and systematic failure of state protection on the part of the
    authorities.  Avenues of redress are available to her.  As for internal
    relocation Thailand is a large country with a  large  population.   She
    has a degree, has worked as  a  secretary  and  speaks  both  Thai  and
    English.  She has  transferable  skills  which  she  could  utilise  on
    return.  There is no reason why she could not relocate and gain  lawful
    work.

 5. The Respondent then considered medical evidence  which  indicated  that
    the Appellant had been  diagnosed  with  First  Episode  Psychosis  but
    having considered background material, concluded that  there  would  be
    adequate medical facilities in Thailand for her.

 6. The Appellant has a British husband  Mr  K.W.   It  was  accepted  that
    theirs is a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.   However,  it  was
    considered that there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK.

 7. She appealed.

    First tier hearing

 8. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 3 December  2015  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Grant dismissed  the  appeal  on  asylum  and  human  rights
    grounds.

 9. In her decision she noted that there was medical  evidence  before  her
    that indicated that the Appellant was not fit to  give  evidence.   She
    noted evidence from the Appellant's husband Mr K.W.  Also, the contents
    of a psychological report by Dr Eileen Walsh.

10. Her findings are stated to be from [30] but following a  recitation  of
    the facts [30-36] the findings are dealt with at [37-41].

11. She found that the Appellant's case could be distinguished on her facts
    from AZ (trafficked women) Thailand CG [2010] UKUT 118, and  she  would
    not be at  risk  of  re-trafficking  on  return  to  her  parents.   In
    rejecting the protection claim the judge found that the  Appellant  did
    not live with her parents while working as  an  escort  and  they  knew
    nothing about the work she carried out [37]; there was no evidence that
    the trafficker who she approached whilst working in Bangkok  knows  her
    parents' address because she was not living at  her  parents  when  she
    sought contact for work in the UK as a  prostitute  [37];  her  parents
    live two hours from Bangkok.  She was not recruited by  the  trafficker
    in her parents' town or village.  She was recruited in Bangkok  through
    contacts she had made [38].  She concluded: 'I am satisfied  that  upon
    return to her home town she will not be at risk from the trafficker she
    originally met in Bangkok' [38].

12. The judge went on briefly to conclude  that  there  would  be  adequate
    treatment in Thailand available for her mental health  problems.   Also
    for  her  husband's  medical  issues.   Further  that  there  were   no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life between the Appellant  and  her
    husband continuing in Thailand.   Alternatively  she  could  return  to
    Thailand and seek entry clearance.

13. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted on 4  March
    2016 following reapplication.

14. The matter came before me at an error of law hearing on 22 June 2016.

    Error of law hearing

15. At that hearing, Mr Walker for the Respondent agreed that the  decision
    showed procedural unfairness, namely, that the  judge,  without  notice
    had gone behind a concession by the Respondent that there  was  a  real
    risk to the Appellant from the traffickers in her home area were she to
    be returned to Thailand.  Such was a material error of law.  By consent
    the decision was set aside to be remade.  The only issues to be decided
    (the historical account having been accepted and that she faced risk on
    return to her home area) were whether there  would  be  sufficiency  of
    protection and whether she could internally relocate.

    Resumed hearing

16. At the resumed hearing before  me  I  had  before  me  a  large  bundle
    containing, inter alia, statements by the Appellant and her husband, Dr
    Walsh's report and various background  reports.   I  also  had  further
    bundles  containing  additional  background  material  lodged  for  the
    resumed hearing,  and  detailed  written  submissions  prepared  by  Ms
    Chandran.

17. There was no oral evidence. As before the First tie Tribunal there  was
    no dispute that as a victim of trafficking and in light of  her  mental
    health  the  Appellant  was  a  'vulnerable  adult'  (per   the   Joint
    Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010).

18. Mr Tufan made brief submissions. He confirmed that the only issues were
    sufficiency of protection and internal relocation. He noted in  respect
    of the former that Thailand now has a Tier 2 Watch List  ranking  which
    is an improvement having been downgraded to Tier 3 in 2011.   The  USSD
    Report for 2016 indicated  that  whilst  there  are  still  significant
    problems the  situation  is  improving.   The  authorities  are  making
    significant efforts.  There are specific anti-trafficking units.

19. As for internal relocation there was no need why she had to go back  to
    her home area, Bangkok.  Whilst it was clear  she  has  medical  issues
    they are not exceptional and she  has  family  there  who  could  help.
    There was no up-to-date medical  report  in  respect  of  her  husband.
    There were no insurmountable obstacles to her and  her  partner  living
    together in Thailand.

20. Ms Chandran sought to rely on her detailed  written  submissions.   She
    emphasised the Appellant's vulnerabilities as set out in  the  reports.
    She could not live an ordinary life elsewhere in Thailand.   The  clear
    indication from the background material is  that  the  authorities  are
    corrupt and complicit and would not offer protection.

         Consideration

21. I begin my consideration by noting that the following aspects have been
    accepted in the Appellant's case.  First, her claim  falls  within  the
    accepted PSG 'Victims of trafficking for sexual  exploitation'  per  AZ
    [RFRL paragraph 13 & 14 refer].  Second, her account that Thailand is a
    country  where  women  are  trafficked  for  the  purposes  of   sexual
    exploitation is found to be 'corroborated' by the  background  evidence
    [RFRL, paragraph 18].  Third, it is accepted that she  has  provided  a
    'sufficiently detailed account of [her] trafficking  experiences  which
    is both internally and  externally  consistent'  [RFRL,  paragraph  22]
    referring to the Respondent's  summarised  account  of  the  background
    facts to the claim as set out at RFRL paragraphs 19-21.

22. The RFRL confirms  also:  'It  is  noted  that  a  Competent  Authority
    accepted that you are a victim of trafficking from Thailand to  the  UK
    for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  In light of your coherent and
    consistent account, coupled with the conclusion the Competent Authority
    made, it is  accepted  that  you  were  trafficked  to  the  UK'  [RFRL
    paragraph 22].

23. The Respondent records that the Appellant fears  her  traffickers,  who
    are non state actors, will hurt her and her family  in  Thailand  [RFRL
    23].

24. The acceptance of the Appellant's trafficking engages an acceptance  by
    the Respondent that (1) before she was  trafficked  she  had  debts  to
    moneylenders of �10,000 and was compelled to engage in sex work to  pay
    them off and (2) that she was trafficked from Thailand to the UK  by  a
    gang of traffickers.

25. Her unchallenged evidence is that she remains in debt  bondage  to  the
    traffickers to the sum  of  �19,000.   Further,  that  traffickers  had
    attempted to contact her twice in the UK by phone after she had escaped
    from them.  Also that her parents'  home  details  were  known  to  her
    traffickers as she had been required to give the traffickers a copy  of
    the land registry for that property.  Moreover that the traffickers had
    her photographs, her  educational  certificates  and  they  knew  which
    company in Bangkok she used to work for.

26. The Appellant's evidence also expressed her fears that  her  trafficker
    in Thailand was a powerful person with a strong influence in  Thailand,
    that he and his gang are supported by immigration  and  they  had  been
    able to use a corrupt immigration official.  Her evidence,  summarised,
    amounted to the prospect that owing to state corruption her traffickers
    would be able to check  records  to  locate  her  if  she  returned  to
    Thailand.  She described them as being mafia and being used to  harming
    women and that if she returned  to  Thailand  the  trafficking  network
    would be against her.

27. As indicated it was on the strength of her personal evidence taken with
    the background evidence on Thailand that the Respondent accepted in the
    RL  that  the  Appellant  had  'provided  a  detailed  account  of  her
    trafficking  experience  which  is  both  internally   and   externally
    consistent.'  The RFRL  confirmed:  'In  light  of  your  coherent  and
    consistent  account,  coupled  with  the  [conclusive   NRM   decision]
    conclusion the Competent Authority made, it is accepted that  you  were
    trafficked to the UK'.

28. As further indicated it was conceded by the Respondent that there would
    be a real risk of persecution for a Convention reason  if  returned  to
    her home area in Thailand.

29. Before going on to look at the issues of sufficiency of protection  and
    internal relocation it  is  appropriate  to  consider  the  Appellant's
    mental health (which is unchallenged).

30. She was assessed by a Clinical Psychologist Dr Eileen Walsh who wrote a
    report dated 20 November 2015.  The Appellant  reported  a  history  of
    childhood abuse, physical and emotional abuse and  sexual  exploitation
    and threats in relation to debt bondage.  Dr  Walsh  records  that  the
    Appellant was  admitted  to  hospital  in  2014  with  acute  psychotic
    symptoms  and  was  diagnosed  with  First   Episode   Psychosis;   F25
    Schizoaffective Disorder [paragraph 34].  She was sectioned  under  the
    Mental Health Act and remained in hospital for two  months.   Dr  Walsh
    records that the Appellant's mental  health  is  'now  stable  and  her
    functioning is improved' but  that  'she  continues  to  be  prescribed
    antipsychotic medication' [38], and confirms that she remains under the
    care of Brent Early Intervention in Psychosis Service, that she sees  a
    psychiatrist and that she also has a care co-ordinator  who  meets  her
    for regular reviews at home.  Dr Walsh observes: 'This  is  high  level
    secondary care only given to people who have a  high  level  of  mental
    healthcare needs' [35].

31. In her expert opinion the Appellant was not fit to work [63] or to give
    evidence at her asylum appeal [65].

32. Further,  Dr  Walsh  considered  the  risk  of  re-trafficking:  '[She]
    presents  with  several  factors  that  make  her  vulnerable  to   re-
    trafficking.  She has worked in prostitution in the past and has  found
    it the only way to make enough money to support herself and her  family
    in Thailand ... Her family's circumstances are  not  reported  to  have
    changed and she describes a family  dynamic  where  she  supports  them
    financially and in return they are nice to her.  She is likely to again
    seek out work that would provide better payment than office work.   She
    would then be vulnerable to exploitation.  She is also  vulnerable  due
    to her fears about  her  trafficker,  and  presents  as  likely  to  be
    extremely frightened should he approach her ... She is also  vulnerable
    due to her mental health' [62].

33. Dr Walsh continues [60]: 'In my view her mental health is likely to  be
    affected and to deteriorate,  if  she  should  lose  the  care  of  the
    specialist team who currently oversee her care ... She is  at  risk  of
    developing a severe and enduring mental health problem'.

34. There is other medical evidence.  Dr Twins, Speciality Doctor  at  Pine
    Wood, Park Royal Mental Health wrote on 1 May 2014 '[The Appellant] was
    admitted to our services on 13/02/14 due to an acute  deterioration  in
    her mental health'.  He stated her to be 'still in  a  very  vulnerable
    state despite support from her husband'.

35. I now turn to consider sufficiency of protection.

36. The starting point is AZ which concluded

         '1.  Whilst former victims of trafficking  in  Thailand  constitute
             members of a particular social group, not all will be at  risk
             of serious harm on return; the risk will depend upon a  number
             of factors and must be assessed on a case by case basis.

         2.    Relevant  factors  will  include  the  age,  marital  status,
             domestic background, education level, qualifications and  work
             experience of the Appellant. The  availability  of  employment
             and  a  familial  or  other  support  network  will  also   be
             significant factors.

         3.   Although anti trafficking legislation  has  been  implemented,
             the involvement of corrupt officials with  traffickers  and/or
             criminals has weakened the steps taken by  the  government  to
             combat trafficking.' [head note]

37. Dealing specifically  with  sufficiency  of  protection  the  issue  is
    whether the authorities in Thailand are  able  to  protect  victims  or
    potential victims of trafficking from agents of persecution.  Such will
    depend on whether legislative and administrative mechanisms  have  been
    put in place to prevent and combat trafficking as well  as  to  protect
    and assist the victims and on whether these mechanisms are  effectively
    implemented in practice.  In Bagdanavicius & Anor v  SSHD  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 1605 the Court of Appeal held that sufficiency of state  protection
    meant a willingness and ability on the part of the receiving  state  to
    provide through its legal system a reasonable level of protection  from
    ill-treatment of which the applicant  had  a  well-founded  fear.   The
    effectiveness of the system provided was to be judged by its ability to
    deter and/or to prevent the form of persecution of which  there  was  a
    risk, not just punishment of it after the event.

38. In AZ it was found (at [159]): 'We are aware that the  Thai  government
    has enacted legislation to attempt to tackle the problem of trafficking
    which, as the country material indicates, is widespread and  a  serious
    problem  all  over  Thailand.   We   accept   that   inefficiency   and
    incompetence is not the same as unwillingness ... The country  evidence
    before us, however, indicates the problem is more than inefficiency  or
    incompetence.  It is reported that corruption  is  rife  and  that  the
    involvement  of  officials,  whether  at  the  border,  at  immigration
    counters  at  airports  or  in  other  government   departments,   with
    traffickers and criminals has weakened the impact of the steps taken by
    the government to combat human trafficking'.

39. At [160] '... we note that  the  evidence  indicates  that  high  level
    officials did not participate in  taking  bribes  from  traffickers  or
    criminals and that it was the low or  mid  level  police  officers  who
    facilitated the most severe forms of trafficking ... However, officials
    found to be complicit in any part of the illegal  economy  were  rarely
    prosecuted and we  find  that  this  strengthens  our  finding  that  a
    sufficiency of protection would not be available to the appellant.'

40. And at [154] '... On the accepted facts the appellant has already  been
    trafficked from Thailand which demonstrates a failure by the  State  to
    protect her from being  trafficked.   For  the  reasons  given  by  the
    appellant, and taking into account the evidence of the country experts,
    we find that either her traffickers would be reasonably likely to learn
    of her return and would be motivated to seek her out or that she  would
    be at risk of being re-trafficked because of her lack of support,  lack
    of economic opportunity, the stigma attached to her as a prostitute and
    her vulnerable state of mind'.

41. In considering the more recent country material I note  the  following.
    The Human Rights Watch Report (June 2013)  that  traffickers  had  been
    able to access the Government run shelter and had taken a woman and her
    children, the woman was raped and a day later a Thai man  attended  the
    shelter and threatened  the  lives  of  the  woman  and  the  shelter's
    director.

42. The USSD Country Report 2015 confirms that  trafficking  is  a  serious
    problem, confirms  there  is  official  impunity;  that  corruption  is
    widespread among members of the police.

43. The USSD Trafficking in Persons Report 2015 confirms that Thailand  was
    downgraded since 2011 (when  the  Appellant  was  trafficked)  and  was
    ranked Tier 3 (the lowest ranking) including  for  failing  to  protect
    victims, prosecute traffickers and prevent trafficking;  confirmed  the
    involvement of Thai  officials  and  their  complicity  in  trafficking
    crimes and corruption; that some corrupt  officials  protect  brothels;
    the number of Thai victims given assistance had fallen from 305 in 2013
    to 67 in 2015.

44. The US State Department Trafficking in Persons Report 2016  notes  that
    Thailand has been given a Tier 2 Watch  List  ranking  for  failing  to
    provide  minimum  standards   for   protecting   victims,   prosecuting
    traffickers and preventing trafficking [the second to lowest  ranking];
    confirms the extensive nature of corruption and the involvement of Thai
    officials and their complicity in trafficking  crimes  and  corruption;
    that some corrupt officials protect brothels; that  trafficking-related
    corruption continued to impede progress in combating trafficking;  that
    126 Thai victims were sheltered; that they could not leave the shelters
    freely; there was no confirmation of the  government's  claim  that  it
    provides counselling, assistance and medical care to trafficked victims
    in its shelters.

45. As indicated Thailand dropped to being ranked a Tier 3 country  and  is
    now back to its status as Tier 2 Watch List Country, as it was when  AZ
    was decided (at [121]).  This ranking continues to evidence the failure
    by the Thai State to reach minimum standards required by  international
    law for the prosecution of traffickers, the protection of  victims  and
    the prevention of trafficking.  As  the  2016  Trafficking  in  Persons
    Report puts it: 'Given the extensive nature of corruption  ...  efforts
    to combat trafficking-related corruption, including official corruption
    remained insufficient.' Although some  efforts  were  made  to  protect
    trafficking victims 'overall victim screening  and  protection  efforts
    remained inadequate.'

46. I conclude from my reading of the up-to-date country  material  that  I
    have no reason to divert from the country  guidance.  I  conclude  that
    there  is  an  inability  and  in  many  cases  unwillingness  of   the
    authorities  to  protect  women  from  gender  based  harm,   including
    trafficking and re-trafficking.  There are  many  reports  of  official
    complicity in human trafficking and high levels  of  corruption.   Also
    that there are no durable forms of Government  shelters  which  provide
    adequate care and protection for trafficked victims.

47.  In  light  of  the  background  reports  and  having  considered   the
    Appellant's particular circumstances not least her vulnerability due to
    her mental health  I  find  that  there  is  no  provision  of  durable
    protection or support for a returning  victim  of  trafficking  in  the
    Appellant's  position  to  equate  with  minimum  standards  of   State
    protection.

48. Turning to consider internal relocation the  appropriate  approach  was
    laid out in Januzi [2006] UKHL 5 and confirmed  in  AH  (Sudan)  [2007]
    UKHL 49.  It is whether  a  claimant  can  reasonably  be  expected  to
    relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect her  to  do  so.
    The assessment must be directed to  the  situation  of  the  particular
    Appellant whose age, gender, experience, health, skills and family ties
    must be carefully  assessed.   For  some,  relocation  may  well  be  a
    possibility.

49. In my judgment the medical evidence is of major importance in  deciding
    this matter.  It has been referred to in some detail above.  In summary
    she has serious mental health illnesses.  She requires a high level  of
    care.  She takes anti-psychotic medication and is also  assisted  by  a
    care co-ordinator.  Although she has education and in the past  worked,
    she is not now fit to work.  As Dr Walsh stated 'In my view her  mental
    health is highly likely to be affected and to deteriorate if she should
    lose the care of the specialist team who currently oversee her care ...
    She is at risk of  developing  a  severe  and  enduring  mental  health
    problem'.  In addition the role of her husband is relevant.   Dr  Walsh
    found that while the  Appellant  denied  having  any  current  suicidal
    thoughts or intent, this was because 'her risk is  currently  minimised
    by the presence and support of  her  husband,  and  the  stability  and
    safety of their daily life together'.

50. Dr Walsh found that her psychotic episode appeared to be  triggered  by
    stress, finding that 'should she be  placed  at  high  risk  of  stress
    again, such as being faced with removal to Thailand or [being  removed]
    from her family life with her husband in the UK, her mental  health  is
    likely to deteriorate'.  In these circumstances  Dr  Walsh  found  'the
    risk to herself would almost certainly increase'.

51. It is  clear  from  the  unchallenged  medical  evidence  that  if  the
    Appellant is removed from her therapy she would essentially fall apart.
     She would not be able  to  work.   The  evidence  before  me  is  that
    treatment and counselling in Thailand is extremely limited and  I  find
    that the Appellant due to her fragile state of mind is not somebody who
    would be able to  approach  the  authorities  or  relevant  bodies  for
    assistance.  As Dr Walsh notes at [62] 'She stayed in the  exploitative
    situation in the UK for a long time after being offered help to  leave,
    so  has  already  shown  difficulties  in  accessing  help   in   these
    circumstances'. Although she has family there it  can  hardly  be  said
    that they would be in a position to provide her with effective support.

52. In light of all these factors I find that it would be  unreasonable  to
    expect the Appellant to relocate and  I  also  find  that  due  to  her
    personal circumstances she would be vulnerable wherever she went.

53. For the reasons given the asylum appeal succeeds.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal showed material error  of  law.   It
is set aside and remade as follows:

     The appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
