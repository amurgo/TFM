                                                                    Claimant


Representation:

For the claimant: No attendance and no representation
For the respondent:    Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The claimant, Sohail Ahmed, date of  birth  1.8.90,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Phull  promulgated  26.3.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    20.11.14, to refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK as  a
    Tier 4 Student under the Points Based System (PBS) of  the  Immigration
    Rules and to remove him from the UK  pursuant  to  section  47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 3.4.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there was such error of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    decision of Judge Phull should be set aside and  remade  by  dismissing
    the appeal.

 6. On 25.7.14 the claimant applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    Student, but he did not have a Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies
    (CAS). In consequence, his application was doomed to failure  from  the
    outset. He obviously could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX. He did not qualify for points under Appendix A for the  CAS  and
    he did not qualify for points under Appendix C for  maintenance  funds,
    because he did not support a valid CAS. Contrary to  the  understanding
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, and in accordance with paragraph  113
    of  Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  this  is   a   mandatory
    requirement. In any event, the judge did not seem  to  appreciate  that
    without a valid CAS, stating the course and location, it is  impossible
    for the Secretary of State to know what the relevant maintenance  funds
    requirements are under Appendix C.

 7. Judge Phull erred in stating in �7 that "the immigration rules  do  not
    state that points cannot be awarded for maintenance  if  the  appellant
    does not provide a valid CAS. I find on balance that this part  of  the
    respondent's decision is therefore unlawful and not in accordance  with
    the law."

 8. The judge also erred in stating at �2 that  as  it  was  an  in-country
    appeal he could "have regard to  any  other  matter  which  I  consider
    relevant to the decision, arising after the date of decision."  Section
    85A(4) prohibits the Tribunal from considering evidence which  was  not
    submitted with and in support of a PBS application.  It  is  not  clear
    whether  in  fact  any  post-application  evidence  was  submitted   or
    considered, as the appeal was decided on the papers.

 9. However, the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  perverse  and
    entirely contrary to the law for  the  very  obvious  reasons  set  out
    above. It is plain from the papers before the judge  that  no  CAS  had
    been issued and thus neither Appendix A nor Appendix C  could  be  met.
    The application had no possibility of success  and  the  appeal  should
    have been dismissed.

Conclusions:

10. For the reasons set out above I find that the making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on  a  point
    of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
