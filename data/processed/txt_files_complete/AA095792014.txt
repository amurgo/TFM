Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Hena, Counsel instructed by Virgo Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Turkey date of birth 1st April 1992.  He
    appeals with permission[1] the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Kelly)[2] to dismiss his appeal against a decision to remove him
    from the United Kingdom pursuant to s10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999. That decision followed from the Respondent's rejection of the
    Appellant's asylum claim.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that he had a well-founded  fear
    of persecution in Turkey for reasons  of  his  political  opinion.  The
    Appellant is Kurdish and had in recent years become involved  with  the
    BDP (translated in  the  determination  as  'The  Peace  and  Democracy
    Party'). The First-tier Tribunal accepted that as a result of his  open
    support for that organisation the Appellant had on three occasions been
    arrested and detained.  The first time was in  September  2013  when  a
    meeting in a cafï¿½ was raided. The  Appellant  was  held  for  two  days
    during which time he was questioned about his support for the  BDP  and
    why he had gone  to  the  meeting.  He  was  released  without  charge.
    Undeterred by this he continued to attend  meetings  including  one  in
    December 2013 when he was arrested again. On this occasion he was  held
    for almost two days during which time he was not given anything to  eat
    or drink. Again he was released without charge  but  warned  to  desist
    from his political activity. The third detention took  place  in  March
    2014 following a Newroz demonstration in Nurdagi.  The police had tried
    to break it up and the  Appellant  had  remonstrated  with  them;  this
    earned him three days in a rat-infested cell that smelled of urine.  He
    was slapped and told that if he attended any more political  events  he
    would be sent to prison.

 3. Having found those facts the Tribunal conducted a  risk  assessment  in
    accordance with the still extant country  guidance  in  IA  and  Others
    (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT 00034  as  affirmed
    in IK (Returnees-Records-IFA) Turkey CG [2004] UKIAT  00312.  It  found
    that the BDP is not banned; that on each occasion  that  the  Appellant
    was arrested he was released without charge; there was no  evidence  to
    suggest that the authorities viewed him as a separatist (i.e. a  member
    of the PKK); he was not placed on any reporting  charges;  he  was  not
    facing any outstanding charges (as far as he  was  aware);  he  had  no
    family connection to HADAP, DEHAP or KADEK; he had not been asked to be
    an informer; he was not a draft evader; he had remained in Turkey for a
    month after his last arrest and had not suffered any  adverse  interest
    from the authorities; crucially the Tribunal found that  the  Appellant
    had not suffered  "any  torture  or  lasting  physical  injury".    The
    country guidance indicated that these factors  would  show  no  current
    risk for  the  Appellant.   Applying  the  country  guidance  the  only
    background factors to indicate risk were his Kurdish ethnicity and lack
    of a valid passport. Focusing on the risk at the point  of  return  the
    Tribunal accepted  that  the  Appellant  would  be  questioned  at  the
    airport, but in light of his circumstances, there would be no  risk  of
    serious harm:

         "Although deeply unpleasant, the ill-treatment he  suffered  during
         his detention was at the lowest end of the scale. However,  I  find
         that he is unlikely to be detained for more than a few hours before
         being released to go on his way" [at 29]

    The determination then finds that the Appellant can return to his  home
    area without risk, or in the alternative that he could relocate  within
    the country. The appeal was thereby dismissed.




    Error of Law

 4. On the 25th May 2015 the appeal came before  myself  and  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Saini to determine whether the  determination  contained
    an error of law such that it should be set aside.

 5. The grounds of appeal appeared to have been drafted  by  the  Appellant
    himself. They boil down to two points:

      i) No consideration had been given to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant
         remains a supporter of the BDP/believer in Kurdish rights who would
         want to give effect to those political views if returned to Turkey;

     ii)  His  return  on  an  emergency  travel  document  will  alert  the
         authorities to the fact that he is a failed asylum seeker making it
         reasonably likely that he will be questioned  about  his  political
         views and thus placing him in a situation where he  will  be  faced
         with a choice - reveal them and risk serious harm, or be "discreet"
         about them and thus suppress his own conscience.

 6. At the error of law stage the Appellant was represented by Mr  Spurling
    of Counsel.  He expanded on the grounds to argue  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to consider the specific submission that the  Appellant
    would  be  at  risk  because  he  continued  to  hold  political  views
    antithetical to the Turkish state.  He  relied  on  HJ  (Iran)  and  HT
    (Cameroon) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31 and RT (Zimbabwe) [2012] UKSC 38.   He
    referred to his skeleton before the First-tier Tribunal  in  which  [at
    15] the following point is made:

         "His present views and actions in the past demonstrate that  he  is
         reasonably likely to wish to give effect to his political views  by
         associating with like-minded people in the BDP. Although  he  might
         conceivably be able to avoid persecution by ceasing this  activity,
         that would violate the principle in RT (Zimbabwe) ..."

 7. The Respondent was represented by Senior Presenting Officer  Mr  Duffy,
    who realistically conceded that this submission had not been  expressly
    addressed, even though it was recorded as part of the Appellant's  case
    at paragraph 17 of the determination.   Mr Duffy  nevertheless  made  a
    robust defence of the determination, submitting that the  situation  in
    Turkey has improved, with police and security  forces  in  cities  like
    Istanbul receiving human rights training. In light of that it was  open
    to the Appellant to relocate away from his home area in  Gaziantep  and
    continue to express his political views without  risk  of  persecution.
    He submitted that overall this was an entirely  adequate  determination
    and that the Judge had given careful consideration to each of the  risk
    factors set out in the albeit old country guidance.

 8. We considered all of the submissions made.  The  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal was detailed and cogent, and the reasoning  clearly
    expressed. We were nevertheless satisfied that the decision must be set
    aside for the following reasons, which we set out in a written decision
    dated the 25th May 2015:

         "First of all we would express some  unease  about  the  Tribunal's
         conclusions about the  degree  of  harm  already  suffered  by  the
         Appellant.   The Appellant is a supporter of a legal party  and  as
         such is entitled in a democratic state to take part  in  activities
         such as attending meetings and demonstrations. He is Kurdish and is
         entitled to express his cultural identity  by  celebrating  Newroz,
         the New Year.   In exercising these  rights  he  was  subjected  to
         three periods of  what  were  by  his  account  entirely  arbitrary
         detentions, contrary to Article 9 of the Universal  Declaration  of
         Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and  Political
         Rights.  During one of these detentions he was deprived of food and
         water for almost two days. During another he was slapped, and  kept
         in  a  rat-infested  cell  smelling  of  urine.  The  determination
         describes  these  events  as  "deeply  unpleasant"  but  apparently
         discounts the  possibility  that  the  treatment  could  amount  to
         persecution on the basis that it was at  the  "lowest  end  of  the
         scale".  Having had  regard  to  Article  9  of  the  Qualification
         Directive[3] we are not satisfied that the  Tribunal  has  properly
         turned  its  mind  to  whether  such  treatment  could,  for   this
         Appellant, be a violation of Article 3.  We find it to be at  least
         arguable that deprivation of water - or sleep, as one might  expect
         in a rat-infested cell - is  capable  of  constituting  inhuman  or
         degrading treatment.   That is particularly so where the  recipient
         of such treatment does not know when it is going to end.   Although
         this matter did not form  a  ground  of  appeal  we  regard  it  as
         Robinson[4]  obvious and leave is granted to argue the point in the
         re-making.

         The central matter in this appeal is the 'HT/RT point'. It was  the
         Appellant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  he  was  so
         committed to the cause of the BDP/Kurdish  political  and  cultural
         rights that if in Turkey he would continue to attend  meetings  and
         demonstrations. As evidence of this he pointed to the fact that  he
         continued to do so even after being arrested on two  occasions  and
         the ill-treatment endured grew progressively worse.   That this was
         argued before the  Tribunal  is  apparent  from  the  skeleton  and
         paragraph 17  of  the  determination.   In  light  of  the  country
         background  material  before  the  Tribunal  (Mr  Spurling   placed
         particular reliance on the Respondent's Operational Guidance  Note)
         and the findings of fact already made, it was  incumbent  upon  the
         Tribunal to  consider  whether  the  Appellant  would  continue  to
         exercise his  basic  civil  and  political  rights  in  the  manner
         asserted and whether he was reasonably  likely  to  suffer  serious
         harm as a result; if it was found that he would refrain from  doing
         so,  consideration  had  to  be  given  to  whether  he  would   be
         constrained by his fear of persecution. That was not done. Although
         in the final analysis the  Respondent  may  be  right  to  rely  on
         internal  flight,  we  are  not  satisfied  that  this  point   was
         addressed, or that there was any analysis,  for  instance,  to  the
         effect that the Appellant could express his political views without
         fear of harm in Istanbul. To that extent the decision is set  aside
         to  be  re-made.  The  findings  of  fact  are   unchallenged   and
         preserved".

    The Re-Made Decision

 9. The matter came back before me to be re-made on the 25th January  2016.
    Mr Kotas who appeared for the Respondent had only received  the  papers
    at 9.30 that morning, because his colleague with conduct  of  the  case
    had fallen ill. I gave Mr Kotas some  additional  time  to  familiarise
    himself with the papers and at the outset of the hearing  he  indicated
    that he was content to go ahead.

10. The parties agreed the issues as follows:

      i) Was the ill-treatment suffered by the Appellant  in  the  past  (as
         summarised at paragraph 2 above) sufficiently serious to amount  to
         persecution?

     ii) Is there a real  risk  that  the  Appellant  would  be  subject  to
         persecution on return to his home area of  Gaziantep  today?   This
         would include consideration of the 'HT/RT' point.

    iii) If so is there a reasonable internal flight  alternative  for  this
         Appellant?

11. Both parties made submissions on the evidence.

12. The Appellant's case is that he is a Kurd from Sakcagozu,  Antep.  When
    he was in Turkey he was an active supporter of the BDP and as a  result
    was arrested and detained on three occasions. He fears that if returned
    to Turkey today there is a reasonable likelihood that if he returned to
    Antep the local security services would arrest  him  again  (not  least
    because  of  his  absence).  He  fears  ill  treatment  and   arbitrary
    detention. He avers that he is opposed, on grounds  of  conscience,  to
    serving in the Turkish military as he  is  bound  by  law  to  do,  his
    enlistment date being 2016.   He submits  that  he  will  not  be  safe
    anywhere in Turkey as he is reasonably likely at  some  point  to  come
    into contact with the authorities, and at that point cannot be expected
    to conceal his political views.

13. On the facts as found by the First-tier Tribunal the Respondent submits
    that at its highest the Appellant's case is that he was a supporter  of
    the BDP who attended several meetings. He has no links to the PKK,  nor
    do the Turkish authorities have any evidence to suggest that  he  does.
    The current assessment of conditions in Turkish prisons  (as  reflected
    in paragraph 3.15.10 of the OGN) is that they are not likely  to  reach
    the threshold required to violate Article 3 ECHR.  There is no risk  of
    the Appellant going back to a rat-infested cell.  If the Appellant  did
    not want to return to Gaziantep he could safely live in Istanbul.

    Country Background Information

14. The last country guidance case on Turkey was IK in 2004.  The  headnote
    reads:

         "1.       The  evidence  of  Mr  Aydin  (paragraph  32)  accurately
             describes the defined and limited ambit  of  the  computerised
             GBT system. It comprises  only  outstanding  arrest  warrants,
             previous arrests,  restrictions  on  travel  abroad,  possible
             draft evasion, refusal to perform  military  service  and  tax
             arrears. "Arrests" as comprised in the GBTS require some court
             intervention, and must be distinguished from  "detentions"  by
             the security forces followed by release  without  charge.  The
             GBTS  is  fairly  widely  accessible  and  is  in   particular
             available to the border police at booths in Istanbul  airport,
             and elsewhere in Turkey to the security forces.

         2. In addition, there is border control information collated by the
             national  police  (Department  for  Foreigners,  Borders   and
             Asylum)  recording  past  legal  arrivals  and  departures  of
             Turkish citizens, and information about people prohibited from
             entering Turkey  as  a  result  of  their  activities  abroad,
             collated by MIT.

         3. The  Judicial  Record  Directorate  keeps  judicial  records  on
             sentences served by convicted persons, separate from GBTS. The
             system is known as "Adli Sicil."  It  is  unlikely  that  this
             system would be  directly  accessible  at  border  control  in
             addition to the information in the GBTS.

         4.  The  Nufus  registration  system  comprises  details  of   age,
             residence, marriage, death, parents' and  children's  details,
             and religious status. It may also include arrest warrants  and
             if any of the people listed have been stripped of nationality.
             There is no evidence that it is directly available  at  border
             control.

         5. If a person is held for questioning either in the airport police
             station after arrival or subsequently elsewhere in Turkey  and
             the situation justifies it, then some additional inquiry could
             be made of the authorities in his local area about him,  where
             more extensive records may  be  kept  either  manually  or  on
             computer. Also, if the circumstances so  justify,  an  enquiry
             could be made of the anti terror police or MIT to  see  if  an
             individual is of material interest to them.

         6. If there is a material entry  in  the  GBTS  or  in  the  border
             control information, or if a returnee is travelling on a  one-
             way emergency travel document,  then  there  is  a  reasonable
             likelihood that he will be identifiable  as  a  failed  asylum
             seeker and could be sent to the  airport  police  station  for
             further investigation.

         7. It will be for an  Adjudicator  in  each  case  to  assess  what
             questions are likely to be asked during such investigation and
             how a returnee would respond without being  required  to  lie.
             The  ambit  of  the  likely  questioning  depends   upon   the
             circumstances of each case.

         8. The escalation of the violence following the ending of  the  PKK
             ceasefire reinforces our view  that  the  risk  to  a  Kurdish
             returnee of ill treatment by the authorities may be greater if
             his home area is in an area of  conflict  in  Turkey  than  it
             would be elsewhere, for the reasons described in paragraphs 90
             and 116.

         9. The Turkish Government  is  taking  action  in  legislative  and
             structural terms to address the  human  rights  problems  that
             present a serious obstacle to its membership of the EU. It has
             made its zero tolerance policy towards torture clear.  However
             the use of torture is long and  deep-seated  in  the  security
             forces and it will take  time  and  continued  and  determined
             effort to bring it under control in practice. It is  premature
             to conclude that the long established  view  of  the  Tribunal
             concerning the potential risk of torture in detention as per A
             (Turkey) requires material revision on the  present  evidence.
             However the situation will require review as further  evidence
             becomes available. For the time being as  in  the  past,  each
             case must be assessed on its own merits from the  individual's
             own history and the relevant  risk  factors  as  described  in
             paragraph 46 of A (Turkey).

         10.      Many  of  the  individual  risk  factors  described  in  A
             (Turkey) comprise in themselves a broad spectrum  of  variable
             potential  risk  that  requires  careful  evaluation  on   the
             specific  facts  of  each  appeal  as  a  whole.  The  factors
             described in A (Turkey) were  not  intended  as  a  simplistic
             checklist and should not be used as such.

         11.      A young, fit, unmarried person, leaving his home area  and
             seeking unofficial employment in a big city, may not feel  the
             need to register with the  local  Mukhtar,  at  least  at  the
             outset. Many  do  not.  However,  given  the  range  of  basic
             activities for which a certificate of residence is needed, and
             which depend upon such registration, we conclude that it would
             in most normal circumstances  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  a
             person  to  live  without  appropriate  registration  for  any
             material time, as a requirement for avoiding persecution. This
             does  not  necessarily  preclude  the  viability  of  internal
             relocation for  the  reasons  described  in  paragraph  133.13
             below.

         12.      The proper course in assessing the risk for a returnee  is
             normally to decide first whether he has a well founded fear of
             persecution in his home  area  based  upon  a  case  sensitive
             assessment of the facts in the context of an analysis  of  the
             risk factors described in A (Turkey). If he does not  then  he
             is unlikely to be at any real risk anywhere in Turkey.

         13.      The risk to a specific individual  in  most  circumstances
             will be at its highest in his  home  area  for  a  variety  of
             reasons, and particularly if it is located  in  the  areas  of
             conflict in the south  and  east  of  Turkey.  Conversely  the
             differential nature of the  risk  outside  that  area  may  be
             sufficient to mean that the individual would not  be  at  real
             risk of persecution by the state or its agencies elsewhere  in
             Turkey, even if they were made aware  of  the  thrust  of  the
             information maintained in his home area by  telephone  or  fax
             enquiry from the airport police station or elsewhere, or by  a
             transfer of at least some of the information  to  a  new  home
             area on registration with the local  Mukhtar  there.  Internal
             relocation may well therefore be viable,  notwithstanding  the
             need for registration in the new area. The  issue  is  whether
             any individual's material history would be  reasonably  likely
             to lead to persecution outside his home area."

15. In view of the passage of time, and dramatic geo-political  changes  in
    the region, as well as in Turkey itself,  the  parties  agreed  that  I
    would need to look beyond this guidance to determine current risk,  and
    to have regard to more up to date evidence.

16. In this regard the Respondent relied on her Operational  Guidance  Note
    (OGN) issued in May 2013. This reports inter  alia  that  thousands  of
    members of the Turkish security forces have received training in  human
    rights [2.2.3] but that impunity remains a problem  where  abuse  still
    occurs [2.2.6]. Efforts to combat the use of torture began in 1999 when
    Turkey became a candidate to join the EU, a process which has also seen
    some relaxation of laws designed to  suppress  expressions  of  Kurdish
    identity and nationalism. The military  conflict  between  the  Turkish
    Army and the PKK has continued however, with 711 people killed in  2012
    [2.2.12]. In respect of internal flight the OGN  states  that  this  is
    usually only going to be an option where the feared persecutor is a non-
    state agent:

         "Very careful consideration  must  be  given  to  whether  internal
         relocation would be a viable way to  avoid  a  real  risk  of  ill-
         treatment/persecution at the hands of, tolerated by,  or  with  the
         connivance of, state agents" [2.3.2]?

17. The OGN considers the risk to supporters of Kurdish  and/or  left  wing
    groups at section 3.9. This recognises that Kurds seeking  to  exercise
    their constitutional right  to  freedom  of  assembly  are  subject  to
    harassment and detention, and sometimes prosecution. Between  2010  and
    2013 police arrested an estimated 20,000 people on charges of belonging
    to the Kurdish Communities Union (KCK), described as  "a  part  of  the
    political organisation of the PKK terror  group".  Although  there  has
    been a decrease in the number of reported cases of ill-treatment the UN
    Committee Against  Torture  has  expressed  grave  concerns  about  the
    continuing use of torture against political detainees, and the  climate
    of  impunity  for  those  accused  of  ill-treating   prisoners.    The
    Respondent concludes from  the  evidence  that  supporters  of  Kurdish
    political groups may face police harassment; this will not generally be
    such  serious  harm  so  as  to  amount  to  a  violation  of   Article
    3/persecution but all claims must be decided on a case by case basis.

18. The Appellant has submitted a report  by  Sheri  Laizer,  a  recognised
    expert on Turkey.   She writes that Sakcagozu, where the  Appellant  is
    from, is a mixed Kurdish-Turkish area where the  Kurdish  minority  has
    long suffered ill treatment as second-class citizens:

         "... political opinion  is  imputed  by  members  of  the  security
         services on the basis of the reputation  of  Kurdish  families  and
         their  known  or  documented  political  and  'criminal'   history.
         Detention threats and release have long been a  common  pattern  of
         intimidation as set forth by [AO] ... The  aim is not  specifically
         that of court prosecution but rather to induce fear such  that  the
         detainee agrees to abandon resistance  under  threat  of  worse  to
         come" [at 3(v)]

19. Ms Laizer cites recent research into human rights abuses in  detention,
    including the findings of the Turkish Human Rights Institution that the
    new anti-torture  agency  was  deemed  to  lack  authority,  structure,
    resources, functional independence and legal protection to  fulfil  its
    duties.

20. As to the risk of harm for those suspected of involvement with the PKK,
    Ms Laizer notes that Kurds in Turkey continue to join the  organisation
    which is still perceived to be an active threat to the Turkish state:

         "... the suspicion that motivates such detentions on  the  part  of
         the gendarmes soldiers and police in Turkey  is  that  the  suspect
         supporting the BDP-HDP actually supports the PKK  by  extension  or
         indeed may even be in active service of the PKK. Such  a  suspicion
         will remain alive until proven otherwise" [at 3(vi)]

    The report goes on to state that where young Kurds  go  'missing'  from
    their home villages, the local security services assume that they  have
    either joined the PKK or that they have gone to Europe to claim asylum.

21. Ms Laizer analyses the June 2015 election results as follows.  The  HDP
    took over 10% of the vote for the first time,  whilst the vote  of  the
    ultra Turkish nationalist MHP increased by over 2 million votes, giving
    them 16.5% of the overall vote.  Commentators in Turkey fear  a  return
    to the violent confrontations of the 1990s.  If the  state  insists  on
    the closure of the HDP such is sure to result in an  intense  spike  in
    PKK violence with serious repercussions  on  the  Kurdish  and  Turkish
    civilian populations and ordinary members of the HDP.  The report cites
    several instances of serious violence between the  state  and  the  PKK
    during 2015, increased political tension  and  military  confrontations
    including in Istanbul itself.

22. In respect of the possibility of relocation  to  Istanbul  Ms  Laizer's
    highlighted the following factors for consideration:

           o There are roadblock-checkpoints throughout  rural  Turkey  and
             random ID checks made by police in the cities

           o Police officers have access to a new  security  services  data
             system called TEM-NET which has a wider remit  that  the  GBTS
             considered in the past by the Tribunal[5]

           o TEM-NET contains information gathered by  the  state  security
             and intelligence services and does not depend on there  having
             been a formal arrest

           o Turkish law requires citizens to register  wherever  they  are
             living

23. Addressing the Appellant's assertion that he does not wish  to  perform
    military service, Ms Laizer explains that once he receives his call  up
    papers he will be required by law to report. If he fails to do  so  his
    name will be entered on the GBTS. She cites information supplied  by  a
    Turkish lawyer, Mr Levent Kanal. Mr Kanal states that  individuals  who
    express a conscientious  objection  to  serving  in  the  military  are
    sentenced according to military law, and serve  in  a  military  prison
    where they are treated as military personnel.   Turkish  law  does  not
    provide for conscientious objection as  a  defence  to  draft  evasion.
    Kurds who are perceived to have a political objection  to  the  Turkish
    state face a sentence "far more fraught with difficulty": "he will face
    a greater danger to life in a military prison. I can state such  to  be
    apparent from many past examples.  There  are  widespread  allegations,
    whether those reported in the news or others that  have  been  emerging
    from the testimonies of the victims,  of  a  great  many  people  where
    having claimed a Kurdish identify in  the  political  sense  have  been
    killed and their deaths made to appear as suicide".

    Findings

24. I remind myself of the accepted facts. The Appellant  has  demonstrated
    that he is a supporter of the BDP who attended five or six meetings and
    as a result was detained on three occasions, for two days in  September
    2013, in December 2013 when he was verbally abused and denied water and
    food for almost two days and in March 2014 when he was held  for  three
    days in a rat infested cell smelling of urine. On this latter  occasion
    he was slapped by those interrogating him.

25. The applicable standard of proof is "real risk". The burden lies on the
    Appellant  to  show  that  there  is  a  "real  risk",  or  "reasonable
    likelihood" that  if  returned  to  Turkey  today  he  would  face  ill
    treatment serious enough to be classed as persecution.

26. The Appellant is undocumented,  having  left  Turkey  and  entered  the
    United Kingdom illegally. He would therefore be returned to Turkey on a
    document either issued by the Respondent, or by the Turkish authorities
    in the UK. Either way he would he identifiable on return as someone who
    has been in the  UK  without  a  passport  or  visa.  I  regard  it  as
    reasonably likely that in those circumstances checks would be conducted
    on arrival by receiving officials.   I note that since IK  the  records
    available to security personnel have  expanded  from  the  GBTS  system
    scrutinised in that decision.   Ms Laizer cites evidence of the use  of
    TEM-NET, a record system with a far wider remit. Security  intelligence
    not dependent on any formal arrest or  conviction  would  therefore  be
    available to  an  official  conducting  an  enquiry.  It  is  therefore
    reasonably likely  that  an  official  at  the  airport  would  quickly
    establish a) that the Appellant is a failed asylum seeker b)  that  the
    Appellant is Kurdish c) that he is from Antep and d) that he has in the
    past been detained for involvement with the BDP.  In  IK  the  Tribunal
    determined that there is  a  reasonable  likelihood  of  failed  asylum
    seekers being transferred to the airport  police  station  for  further
    enquiry. There is no evidence before me to suggest that this system has
    changed.

27. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant was a supporter  of
    the BDP who was  sufficiently  committed  to  the  cause  to  carry  on
    attending meetings even after having been detained. I am satisfied that
    the Appellant genuinely holds political beliefs  as  stated,  namely  a
    belief in self-determination for the Kurdish people and  by  extension,
    the destruction of the Turkish state as it currently  exists.    Having
    regard to the findings in IK and the more recent material  to  which  I
    have been referred I am satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the
    Appellant, when transferred to the  airport  police  station,  will  be
    asked questions about his previous detentions, and  whether  these  had
    any connection to his illegal exit from Turkey and his journey  to  the
    UK. It is difficult to imagine how the Appellant could respond to  such
    questions without a real risk of a) revealing his political beliefs  or
    b) concealing them in order  to  protect  himself  from  ill  treatment
    amounting to persecution.

28. If I am wrong and the Appellant manages to proceed through the  arrival
    procedure without any difficulty I have considered whether there  would
    be a real risk of harm in Sakcogozu.   The Appellant submits  that  the
    most significant point of note about the three detentions he endured in
    the past is  that  the  conditions  and  treatment  were  progressively
    worsening,  on  the  last  occasion  involving  inhuman  and  degrading
    conditions and actual physical violence. Whilst arbitrary detention  is
    in itself a breach of the  Appellant's  human  rights  not  every  such
    detention will constitute persecution. Whether it does must be assessed
    on a case  by  case  basis,  having  regard  to  such  factors  as  the
    frequency,  the  level  of  ill  treatment  endured  if  any,  and  the
    resilience or otherwise of the detainee.  I consider too the purpose of
    such detentions to be  relevant.  I  note  that  the  account,  already
    accepted, is consonant with Ms Laizer's evidence that such  short  term
    detentions, often without charges being brought, are part of the  modus
    operandi of the Turkish police, a policy pursued specifically in  order
    to harass and frighten Kurds away from  overt  political  activity  and
    assertion of Kurdish minority rights. Having had regard to all of these
    factors I am satisfied that the last detention, following Newroz  2014,
    did in fact amount to serious harm. The features of that detention were
    clearly intended to instill fear in the Appellant:  the  violence,  the
    rats, the  urine  soaked  cell,  and  importantly  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant did not know when he would be released. These factors combine
    to create a severity of  ill  treatment  such  that  the  threshold  of
    persecution is reached.

29. That past persecution - relatively recent persecution - is my  starting
    point for consideration of risk  on  return  to  the  Antep  area.  The
    Appellant is known to the security services there. He continues to hold
    the political beliefs which landed him in detention on three  occasions
    in the past. The political climate in Turkey has not materially changed
    since 2013-2014 save to note that the  ceasefire  between  the  Turkish
    army and the PKK is well and truly over, with frequent clashes  between
    the two. I accept Ms Laizer's analysis that Turkish security  personnel
    will often suspect supporters/members of legal organisations deemed  to
    be fronts for the PKK of actual involvement in that group.    There  is
    no evidence to suggest  that  there  has  been  a  material  change  in
    circumstances such  that  persecution  would  not  occur  again.  I  am
    accordingly satisfied that there would be a real risk of persecution in
    the home area.

30. I now turn to consider  whether  there  is  a  viable  internal  flight
    alternative for the Appellant. I am satisfied that the Appellant  would
    continue to hold the political views that he does, and  that  he  would
    wish to express them. As the First-tier Tribunal  found,  a  series  of
    confrontations and detentions did not persuade him to desist  in  2013-
    14. There is therefore no evidential foundation to  support  a  finding
    that the Appellant would simply choose to 'keep his head  down'  should
    he relocate to Istanbul.  If he did choose to keep a low profile  I  am
    satisfied that this would be for reason of a fear of  persecution.  The
    OGN points about that where the agents of persecution are state  actors
    "very careful consideration" should be given  to  whether  there  is  a
    viable  internal  flight  alternative.  There  is  no  reason  for  the
    Appellant to believe that the police in Istanbul, whether stopping  him
    at a checkpoint  or  pulling  him  out  of  a  protest,  will  act  any
    differently from the police in Antep. Having  given  this  matter  such
    consideration I cannot be satisfied that Istanbul, nor  indeed  Ankara,
    would be a safe alternative for an individual with a record of dissent,
    clear political views about Kurdish rights and and unwillingness to "be
    discreet" about those views.  The appeal must therefore be allowed.

    Decisions

31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
    was set aside to the extent identified above.

32. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:

    "The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.

    The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection because he  is
    a refugee.

    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds."

33. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on  the  facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
