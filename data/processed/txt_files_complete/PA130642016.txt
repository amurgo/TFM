Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Bradley, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant advanced her asylum claim at interviews and by statements
    from 11 May to 23 August 2016 (as recorded  at  �1  of  the  respondent
    refusal letter of 18 November  2016).   She  founded  on  her  and  her
    husband's activities in Ethiopia  on  behalf  of  Ginbot  7,  an  anti-
    government group.

 2. The respondent found the appellant's account not credible.

 3. At �32 of her letter, the respondent noted the absence of  evidence  of
    political activity in the UK: "It is considered inconsistent  that  you
    would be prepared to put your life  at  risk  ...  whilst  residing  in
    Ethiopia where you claim you were detained and tortured, but not become
    involved in any activity whilst residing in a safe country ....".

 4. FtT Judge Mill heard the appellant's appeal on 25 and dismissed  it  by
    decision promulgated on 28 July 2017.  He also rejected the appellant's
    account of activities in Ethiopia.  She made no  perceptible  challenge
    on that score in the UT.

 5. The appellant at the FtT hearing relied also on activities in the UK.

 6. The judge at �37 - 38 founded adversely on  absence  of  evidence  from
    Ginbot 7, although the appellant claimed to be  the  secretary  in  the
    Glasgow association and to be in touch with higher party members in the
    UK.

 7. At �38 the judge noted that the appellant said she had been  unable  to
    advance her interest in Ginbot 7 in  the  UK  until  after  her  asylum
    interview, but that from 2 days thereafter she made links and  attended
    events and demonstrations in Glasgow and London.  He said,  "Given  her
    claims to have fled ... specifically due to her husband's and  her  own
    involvement with Ginbot 7 ... it is most likely she would  have  sought
    solace and support from the UK branch ... shortly after entering the UK
    ... I do not accept her suggestions  that  she  was  unable  to  do  so
    earlier."

 8. At �40 the judge noted production of photographs of the appellant at  a
    demonstration (or demonstrations?)  in  the  UK  but  said  these  were
    private  photographs,  not  publicly  posted  or  available,  and   not
    supportive of her claim.

 9. At �41 the judge noted production of a still screenshot from a  YouTube
    video, "said to  be  of  a  demonstration  in  London",  in  which  the
    appellant  was  "most  certainly  not  prominent",  perhaps  1  of  100
    participants, and "extremely unlikely  to  be  identifiable  from  this
    online material".

10. At �48  the  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant  had  "no  publicly
    accessible profile connected to Ginbot 7".

11. The appellant applied to the FtT for permission to appeal  to  the  UT,
    relying on evidence of political repression in Ethiopia and on a  Human
    Rights Watch report, "How Ethiopia spies on its  diaspora  in  Europe":
    spy agencies trying to silence criticism; use of advanced  surveillance
    tools, including ability to monitor  computers  and  remotely  turn  on
    webcams and microphones; a  level  of  sophistication  on  a  par  with
    western governments.  The FtT is said to have overlooked this material,
    by which another conclusion might well have been reached.  (The rest of
    these proposed grounds appear to relate to some other  case,  and  were
    not repeated in the further application made.)

12. The FtT refused  permission.   The  application  was  renewed,  on  the
    grounds summarised above.  Permission was granted by UTJ  Bruce  on  11
    October 2017.

13. Mr Bradley submitted along the lines of the grounds, and relied heavily
    on �18 of YB (Eritrea) v SSHD [2008] 360, where Sedley LJ said:
      ... the tribunal,  while  accepting  that  the  appellant's  political
      activity in this country was genuine, were not prepared to  accept  in
      the absence of positive evidence that  the  Eritrean  authorities  had
      "the means and the  inclination"  to  monitor  such  activities  as  a
      demonstration outside their embassy, or that they  would  be  able  to
      identify the appellant from photographs of the  demonstration.  In  my
      judgment, and without disrespect to what  is  a  specialist  tribunal,
      this is a finding which risks losing contact with reality.  Where,  as
      here, the tribunal  has  objective  evidence  which  "paints  a  bleak
      picture  of  the  suppression  of  political  opponents"  by  a  named
      government, it requires little or no evidence or speculation to arrive
      at a strong  possibility  -  and  perhaps  more  -  that  its  foreign
      legations not only film or photograph their nationals who  demonstrate
      in public against the  regime  but  have  informers  among  expatriate
      oppositionist organisations who can name the people who are filmed  or
      photographed. Similarly it does not require  affirmative  evidence  to
      establish a probability that the intelligence services of such  states
      monitor the internet for information about oppositionist  groups.  The
      real question in most cases will be what follows  for  the  individual
      claimant. If, for example, any information  reaching  the  embassy  is
      likely to be that the claimant identified in a photograph is a hanger-
      on with no real commitment to the oppositionist cause,  that  will  go
      directly to the issue flagged up by art 4(3)(d) of the Directive.

14. Mr Matthews submitted that YB did not disclose any error by Judge Mill.
     The findings were of private photographs and a single screenshot of  a
    video posted on the internet.  The appellant did not establish that she
    had any public profile which might attract adverse attention  from  the
    Ethiopian authorities.  The Human Rights Watch evidence was of targeted
    surveillance of opposition figures, through computers and the internet.
     The appellant had denied in evidence that either she or even Ginbot  7
    had any access to the internet (�36 of the decision).  YB did  not  lay
    down a rule that being a face in a crowd at a demonstration  against  a
    repressive regime established a risk; the passage cited recognised that
    all depends on the evidence in the particular case.

15. Mr Bradley in his reply said  that  the  Human  Rights  Watch  evidence
    showed that the regime was not only  looking  for  those  known  to  it
    abroad but searching further  for  their  associates,  to  silence  the
    opposition; the use of internet surveillance included  enhanced  facial
    recognition; and that applying YB, "little or no evidence" might  yield
    a real risk, a possibility the judge failed to consider.   He  accepted
    that he had not referred Judge Mill to YB.

16. I reserved my decision.

17. YB is a strong and clear statement of how to analyse risk arising  from
    sur place  activities,  but  it  is  not  a  universal  template  which
    tribunals are invariably bound to specify in such cases.  It is  not  a
    legal error that the FtT did not cite it, when the appellant placed  no
    reliance on it.

18. However, applying YB  as  literally  as  possible  to  this  case,  the
    following would emerge:

   i. There was objective evidence of "suppression of  political  opponents"
      by the Ethiopian regime.

  ii. There was a strong possibility  that  the  foreign  legations  of  the
      regime not only  film  or  photograph  nationals  who  demonstrate  in
      public, but have informers who can name those filmed or photographed.

 iii. The intelligence services of  the  regime  monitor  the  internet  for
      information about oppositionist groups.

  iv. The "real question" would be "what follows" for the appellant.

   v. Other than one obscure appearance  on  YouTube  [on  which  4  billion
      videos are viewed daily] the appellant has no oppositionist history or
      profile, or presence on the internet.

  vi. In  the  unlikely  event  that  any  information  were  to  reach  the
      authorities, it would be that the appellant is "a hanger  on  with  no
      real commitment to the oppositionist cause".

19. This analysis is the same as the FtT reached at �40 - 42.

20. The appellant did not ask for anonymity either in the FtT of in the UT;
    perhaps oddly, as she bases her  case  on  the  pervasive  surveillance
    carried on by the Ethiopian authorities, and the decisions of  the  UT,
    at least, are public.

21. Although not requested, and perhaps in an abundance of caution, I  have
    decided at this stage to make an anonymity direction.

22. Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her or any member of her  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

23. The appellant has not shown that the making of the decision of the  FtT
    involved the making of any error on a point of law,  so  that  decision
    shall stand.
