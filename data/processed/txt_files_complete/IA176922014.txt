For the Appellant:     Miss Johnstone, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss Khan, instructed by Jackson & Canter,
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, Seun Rilwan Anifowose, was born on 11 March 1990 and is
    a male citizen of Nigeria.  I shall hereafter refer to the appellant as
    the respondent and the respondent as the  appellant  as  they  appeared
    respectively before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant appealed against a decision of  the  respondent  dated  2
    April 2014 refusing him  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.   First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Ransley)  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 4 August  2014,  allowed  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds (Article 8 ECHR).  The Secretary of  State  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom in October 2012 with leave  to
    enter as a Tier 4 (Student) until 30 January 2014.  On 29 January 2014,
    he made a further application  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on
    Article 8 (family life) grounds.  The appellant's partner (Ms  Fox)  is
    19 years old and is a British citizen.  The couple have a  young  child
    which was 8 weeks old at the date of the hearing before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The judge found that the appellant  is  actively  seeking  a
    permanent job and was likely to obtain work with an annual gross salary
    of around ï¿½18,000 per annum.

 4. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge  failed  to  apply  Gulshan
    (Article 8-new rules-correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC).   The
    respondent asserts that there were no exceptional circumstances in this
    case nor would there be an unjustifiably harsh outcome if the appellant
    were required to leave the United Kingdom.  The grounds assert that the
    appellant and his partner could continue their family life together  in
    Nigeria.  Alternatively, the appellant could apply for entry  clearance
    out of country as the partner of Ms Fox.

 5. Miss Khan, for the appellant, submitted that the  judge  clearly  found
    that there were "compelling circumstances" arising from the  fact  that
    the appellant's son had been born shortly before the hearing.  Further,
    the judge had found that [16] Ms Fox could not reasonably  be  expected
    to live with the child and the appellant in Nigeria and that there  was
    a "strong bond between the appellant, Ms Fox and their baby son"  [17].
    She submitted that Article 8 ECHR was properly engaged in this  appeal,
    there being no Gulshan "threshold" for the appellant to cross,  as  the
    respondent asserts (see MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985).

 6. I find that I agree with Miss Khan.  It is clear that it is not correct
    in law to impose any "hurdle" which an appellant must cross before  his
    or her circumstances under Article 8 ECHR  may  be  considered  by  the
    Tribunal.  As the Court  of  Appeal  has  made  it  clear,  the  proper
    application of the Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR should lead  to
    the same result.  The judge was entitled  to  find  that  there  was  a
    strong relationship between Ms Fox and  the  appellant  and  that  they
    intended to continue  their  relationship  together  with  their  young
    child.  She was also entitled to find that, in all  the  circumstances,
    it would be unreasonable to expect Ms Fox and the child to relocate  to
    Nigeria.  Those were not  findings  which  the  circumstances  rendered
    inevitable; indeed, another Tribunal  may  have  come  to  an  entirely
    different view.  However, that is not the  point.   The  judge  reached
    findings on the evidence which were open to  her  and  supported  those
    findings with clear and adequate reasoning.  The Upper Tribunal should,
    in those circumstances, hesitate before interfering with the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  I had been given no good reason by the  Secretary
    of State for doing so in this case.
