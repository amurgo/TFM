Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born on 16 March  1988.   He
    appeals against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  D  Ross
    dismissing his appeal against  the  refusal  of  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of  a  right  of  residence  under  Regulation  9  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

2.   The Appellant appealed on two grounds. Firstly, the judge  applied  the
    wrong burden of proof and required the  Appellant  to  prove  his  case
    whereas European law made clear that the burden lay on the party making
    the accusation. Secondly, the judge wrongly refused the application  on
    the basis that there was no evidence the Appellant satisfied  both  the
    financial  and  English  language  requirements  as  set  out  in   the
    Immigration Rules.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Alis  on
    the following grounds: "The burden of proof set out in paragraph  8  of
    the judge's decision is correct because the appellant must  demonstrate
    on the balance of probabilities that he met the  2016  Regulations  but
    where the respondent is alleging the purpose of the  residence  in  the
    EEA State was as a means for  circumventing  immigration  laws.  It  is
    arguable he must prove that on the balance of probabilities. The second
    ground of appeal also has merit because the judge appears to import the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules into a European  decision.   Both
    grounds are arguable."

4.   The Appellant did not attend the  hearing.  There  was  no  explanation
    from him why he did not attend and there  was  no  application  for  an
    adjournment. There  was  however  an  email  from  solicitors  who  had
    represented  the  Appellant  before   the   First-tier   Tribunal,   AA
    Immigration  Lawyers,  stating  that  they  were  unable  to   continue
    representing the Appellant in this case due to a conflict of  interest.
    The Appellant had been  advised  of  this  and  of  the  need  to  seek
    alternative representation.

5.   I am satisfied that the Appellant has been served with  the  notice  of
    hearing and that he is aware of the hearing date and  of  the  need  to
    instruct alternative solicitors. There was no satisfactory  explanation
    for his non-attendance today and, in the interests  of  the  overriding
    objective and pursuant to Rule 28 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014,
    I consider that it is in the interest of justice to  proceed  with  the
    hearing in the Appellant's absence.

6.   Ms Brocklesby-Weller relied on the Rule 24 response which stated:

         "The FTJ correctly finds at [8] that the burden of proof rests with
         the appellant to satisfy Regulation 9.  Regulation 9(2)(c) requires
         the Appellant to show that the  residence  in  the  EEA  State  was
         genuine with reference to the factors set out in  Regulation  9(3).
         The FTJ summarises this at [10].  The respondent's decision  letter
         at pages 1 and 2 reject the  appellant's  claim  to  have  met  the
         centre of life test set out in Regulation 9 having  considered  the
         documents provided by the appellant (bearing in mind the failure to
         respond to a request for further evidence).
         It is submitted that whilst  the  FTJ  does  consider  whether  the
         appellant meets the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules
         that in itself is not a material error. The FTJ identifies at  [12]
         that the earnings of the Appellant and partner would not  have  met
         the ï¿½18,600 threshold. It is submitted that although this is not  a
         relevant  test  in  this  appeal  it  is  a  relevant  factor  when
         considering the credibility  of  the  Appellant's  case.  This  was
         considered in the round at [13-14] where it was open to the FTJ  to
         find that the appellant and partner's claim  to  have  moved  their
         centre of their life to Ireland was  not  genuine  as  required  by
         Regulation 9."

7.   Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the relevant Regulations  were  the
    2016 Regulations and  the  burden  was  on  the  Appellant  to  satisfy
    Regulation 9. The issue in the appeal was whether relocation to Ireland
    was genuine. The Appellant did not  have  to  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules but the fact that he was unable to do so was a relevant factor in
    considering whether residence in Ireland was genuine. The  judge  dealt
    with all the evidence relevant to whether  relocation  to  Ireland  was
    genuine and he considered whether the Appellant's British citizen  wife
    genuinely wanted to pursue Treaty rights there.  The judge  found  that
    the financial accounts submitted may not be genuine, but in any  event,
    the Appellant's wife had  changed  profession  and  the  sums  were  so
    inconsequential that they did not support  her  case  to  be  genuinely
    exercising Treaty rights.

8.   Whilst there may be an error at paragraph 13,  when  the  judge  stated
    that the starting point was whether the  Appellant  could  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules, this  error  was  not  material  because  it  was  a
    relevant factor in assessing whether residence in Ireland was genuine.

9.   In the grounds of appeal, the Appellant relied on the case of O  and  B
    v The Netherlands CJEU C-456/12 at paragraph 58 which stated "It should
    be added that the scope of the Union law cannot be  extended  to  cover
    abuses...  Proof of such an abuse requires,  first,  a  combination  of
    objective circumstances in which,  despite  formal  observance  of  the
    conditions laid down by the European Union rules, the purpose of  those
    rules has  not  been  achieved,  and  secondly,  a  subjective  element
    consisting in the intention to obtain an advantage  from  the  European
    Union rules by artificially  creating  the  conditions  laid  down  for
    obtaining it.

10.  Ms Brocklesby-Weller relied on paragraphs 52 onwards of that  judgment.
    She submitted that it was genuine residence  in  another  Member  State
    which generated the right of residence to be recognised  on  return  to
    the host Member State. EU law  did  not  extend  to  cover  abuse.  The
    Respondent was  not  alleging  abuse  in  this  case  but  refused  the
    application on the basis that the Appellant had failed to show  genuine
    residence.  On the Appellant's own account, he and his British  citizen
    wife had specifically chosen to go to Ireland in  order  to  circumvent
    domestic legislation and the Immigration Rules for entry.


Regulation 9

11.  Regulation 9 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 states:
    "(1) If the conditions in paragraph (2) are satisfied these Regulations
         apply to a person who is the family member F of a  British  citizen
         BC as though the BC were an EEA national.


    (2)  The conditions are that -
         (a)  BC -
             (i)  is residing in an EEA State as  a  worker,  self-employed
                  person, self-sufficient person or a student or so  resided
                  immediately before returning to the UK, or
             (ii)     has acquired the right of permanent residence  in  an
                  EEA State;
         (b)  F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and
         (c)  F and BC's residence in the EEA State was genuine.


    (3)  Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State is  or  was
         genuine include
         (a)  whether the centre of BC's life transferred to the EEA State;
         (b)  the length of F and BC's joint residence in the EEA State;
         (c)  the nature and quality of F and BC's accommodation in the  EEA
             State and whether it is or was BC's principal residence;
         (d)  the degree of F and BC's integration in the EEA State;
         (e)  whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with  BC  was  in
             the EEA State.


    (4)      This regulation does not apply -
         (a)  where the purpose of the residence in the EEA State was  as  a
             means for circumventing any immigration laws applying to  non-
             EEA nationals to which F would otherwise be subject such as an
             applicable requirement under the 1971 Act have leave to  enter
             or remain in the UK; or
         (b)  to a person who was only eligible to be treated  as  a  family
             member as a result of Regulation 7(3) extended family  members
             treated as family members.

The judge's findings

12.  The judge made the following findings.

         "13.     The starting point in this case that the  Appellant  would
             not be able to satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
             Rules because he does not have sufficient income and  has  not
             produced evidence that his wife earns ï¿½18,600. In addition  he
             has not passed the English language test.  The  Appellant  and
             his wife have both indicated to me that once they were married
             they  looked  into  the  best  way  of  achieving   settlement
             together.  They decided that what they call the European route
             was the best option.  They claim that they were  intending  to
             settle  in  Ireland  and  that  this  was  genuine   but   the
             Appellant's wife has indicated that it  would  not  have  been
             possible for them to settle in  Ireland  because  she  has  no
             family in Ireland who would  provide  them  with  support  and
             enable them to start a family.  I do not consider that  it  is
             plausible that they only considered this for  the  first  time
             when they arrived in Ireland. I also  considered  that  it  is
             significant that the Appellant  gave  no  evidence  that  they
             wished to live in Ireland.  In  other  words  that  there  was
             something about Ireland which attracted them such as the offer
             of a job or the fact that they liked  the  city  of  Limerick.
             The only reason for going to Ireland was to follow  what  they
             described as the European  route.   Therefore  I  must  reject
             their evidence that they propose  to  settle  in  Ireland.   I
             consider that it is far more likely  that  they  decided  that
             because the Appellant could not meet the requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules they would circumvent the Rules by living in
             Ireland for about a year.  The Appellant states that  if  they
             were not intending to settle in Ireland they would  have  left
             Ireland much earlier but I consider  that  it  is  significant
             looking at the chronology that they waited until they had been
             granted a certificate of registration in Ireland  on  1st  May
             2016.  One day later on 2nd May  2016  they  returned  to  the
             United Kingdom. Furthermore the Appellant's wife used to  work
             in a pharmacy before she came to Ireland.  After she  returned
             to the UK she continued to work in a similar field because she
             worked  as  a  laboratory  assistant  in  a   hospital.    Her
             occupation in Ireland is not of a similar type at all  because
             she did tailoring from home.


         14.   Although  the  documentary  evidence  tends  to  support  the
             contention  that  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  were  living
             together in Ireland and they both did some work there I do not
             consider that looking at the bigger picture it is at all  like
             that the Appellant's wife intended to settle in  Ireland  away
             from her family and in a completely different  career  to  the
             one she had been pursuing in the  UK.   I  therefore  consider
             that the purpose of the residence in Ireland was as a means of
             circumventing any immigration laws which they were  unable  to
             meet.  I consider this  is  the  true  meaning  of  what  they
             described as the European route.  I do not consider  therefore
             that the Appellant has proved that he meets  the  requirements
             for a registration card and the appeal is dismissed."

Discussion and Conclusion

13.  The Appellant and his British citizen wife  were  married  on  9  April
    2015 in Abu Dhabi.  In her statement the Appellant's wife stated:

    "6.  After my marriage, I obtained advice with regards  to  my  husband
         joining me so we can start our private life. I  was  advised  about
         both the British  route  and  the  European  route.  Obviously,  my
         husband and I wanted to live together as soon as  possible  so  the
         European route through Ireland was the one we chose to take.
    7.   I travelled to Ireland around May 2015. I went in order to find  a
         job and find a home so that my husband could join me.  I registered
         a Tailoring company on  a  self-employed  basis.  The  company  was
         registered on 9 June 2015.
    8.   My husband was granted a family visa to join me in Ireland where I
         was exercising treaty rights. The Visa was  issued  from  26  April
         2015 valid until 25 July 2015. He was then granted a residence card
         for a period of five years."

14.  In cross-examination, the Appellant's wife stated that they had  chosen
    the European route 'as this was quicker to  reunite  and  start  living
    together'. When asked why she did not stay in Ireland she  stated  that
    she needed the support of her  family  in  the  UK  in  order  to  have
    children. She needed help with childcare  if  she  wanted  to  continue
    working.  She was working part-time in a pharmacy in the UK.  When  she
    came back to the UK she was working  as  a  laboratory  assistant.   In
    Ireland she worked as a tailor.

15.  The Immigration  Rules  are  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  whether
    residence in Ireland was genuine.  The  fact  that  the  Appellant  was
    unable to satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules,  coupled  with  his  wife's
    admission that they had sought advice about how they would be  able  to
    live together as soon as possible and had chosen  the  European  route,
    was a factor which  the  judge  was  entitled  to  take  into  account.
    Although the judge stated it was the starting point, it  was  only  one
    factor that he took into account in assessing whether the Appellant had
    shown that he could satisfy Regulation 9. The judge was  not  assessing
    whether the Appellant could satisfy the Immigration Rules  but  whether
    the Appellant's residence in Ireland with his wife was genuine.

16.  The judge erred in fact in stating that the  Appellant  was  granted  a
    certificate of registration on 1 May 2016. The Appellant was granted  a
    residence card on 1 March 2016. This mistake of fact was  not  material
    given that the Appellant and his  wife  left  Ireland  2  months  after
    obtaining a residence card and the judge's other findings  in  relation
    to Regulation 9 which are dealt with below.

17.  The judge properly applied the  relevant  Regulation  and  the  correct
    burden of proof.  It was for the Appellant to show that  residence  was
    genuine. The judge considered  all  relevant  factors  in  relation  to
    whether the centre of the British citizen's life had transferred to the
    EEA State. He took into account the fact that she had been working in a
    pharmacy in the UK and on return to  the  UK  worked  as  a  laboratory
    assistant, but in Ireland she had registered as a self-employed tailor.
    She also stated that the reason she had gone to Ireland was to follow a
    particular route to settlement which she  identified  as  the  European
    route. The judge considered the length of residence of  eleven  months.
    Their accommodation was  rented  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  any
    integration.  This was the Appellant's first lawful residence in an EEA
    State.

18.  The reasons the judge gives at paragraph 13 were all  relevant  to  the
    application of Regulation 9(2) and 9(3). It was for  the  Appellant  to
    show that his residence was  genuine.  The  judge  was  satisfied  that
    residence was not genuine and the appeal was  properly  dismissed.  The
    conclusion that the intention was to circumvent the  Immigration  Rules
    was one which was open to the judge on the evidence and was relevant to
    the application of Regulation 9(4). On the Appellant's own evidence, he
    and his wife had specifically chosen the European route to  settlement.
    Given the other factors which the judge quite properly considered,  his
    finding that they did not intend to settle in Ireland was open to  him.
    On the facts asserted, the Appellant could not satisfy Regulation 9.

19.  Accordingly, I find that there was no material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision promulgated on 26 May  2018  and  I  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    appeal.
