Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr  P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richardson, instructed by James, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge K S H Miller)  allowing  an  appeal  by  the
    applicant against a decision made  on  22  October  2013  refusing  his
    application for an extension of discretionary leave to  remain  in  the
    UK.  In this determination I will refer to the  parties  as  they  were
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal:  the  Secretary  of  State  as   the
    respondent and the applicant as the appellant.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born  on  4  December  1977.   He
    first entered the UK on 20 September 2000 with  entry  clearance  as  a
    visitor valid until 19 October 2000.  On 17 October 2000 he applied for
    an extension and this was granted until 25 November 2001.  According to
    the chronology his first child was born on 10 October  2002.   At  that
    stage  he  was  in  a  relationship  with  Kadecia  Bennett  but   that
    relationship was short-lived.  In 2003 the appellant  met  and  married
    Aleasha Roach, a British national.  In 2003 he  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a spouse but the application  was  refused  although  he  was
    granted discretionary leave to remain until  2009.   According  to  the
    appellant's chronology he applied for an extension of leave in 2009 and
    on 8 March  2012  he  made  a  further  application  for  an  extension
    confirming  that  his  relationship  with  Mrs  Roach  was  no   longer
    subsisting and that he was applying for leave  as  the  partner  of  Ms
    Bennett.  By 2012 he had had a second child with Ms Bennett born on  20
    August 2007 and on 10 October 2012 a third child was born.

 3. The application was refused in the respondent's decision of 22  October
    2013.  The application was considered firstly under the  partner  route
    but the respondent was  not  satisfied  that  it  was  shown  that  the
    appellant had been living with Ms Bennett in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage for at least two years  prior  to  the  date  of  application.
    Further, his claimed partner was not a  British  citizen  nor  was  she
    presently settled in the  UK.   The  respondent  went  on  to  consider
    whether para EX1 applied but, whilst it was acknowledged that he had  a
    genuine  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  his  children,   the
    application fell to be refused under the  eligibility  requirements  of
    the rules.

 4. The respondent then considered the decision under the parent route  and
    under the private life provisions of para 276ADE but  found  that  they
    were not  met.    She  then  went  on  to  assess  whether  there  were
    exceptional circumstances which might warrant consideration outside the
    requirements of the rules.  The respondent  noted  in  support  of  the
    application the fact that the children were British  citizens  and  had
    been living in the UK for all their lives but  the  appellant  had  not
    provided any evidence indicating that he would be  unable  to  maintain
    and support them from Jamaica.  It was accepted that this might involve
    a  degree  of  disruption  of  his  private  life  but  that  would  be
    proportionate  to  the  legitimate   aim   of   maintaining   effective
    immigration control and be in accordance with the s.55 duties under the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009.   Having  refused  the
    application for leave to remain, the  respondent  went  on  to  make  a
    decision to remove the appellant.

 5. He appealed against this decision and his appeal was heard by the First-
    tier Tribunal on 6 February 2014.  The judge heard  evidence  from  the
    appellant as well as from his partner Ms Bennett.  He  noted  that  his
    partner did not have British nationality.  She had three years leave to
    remain valid until about May 2014.  She had come to the UK in July 2000
    as her husband was here.  She had had indefinite leave  to  remain  but
    because she had used someone else's identity document  that  leave  was
    removed [19].  Ms Bennett, in her evidence, confirmed that she had come
    to the UK in 2000 and said that she had been in a relationship with the
    appellant for 22 years, and had known him in Jamaica.  She agreed  that
    their relationship had been "on and off" and said that in recent  times
    they had got back together at the end of 2009 when he had moved in  and
    he had lived with her ever since.

 6. In his conclusions, the judge said that although it  was  not  entirely
    clear, it would appear that when the appellant made his application  on
    20 March 2009 it was on the basis of his relationship with  Mrs  Roach.
    It further appeared that no decision  was  made  in  relation  to  that
    application and by the time his solicitors wrote to the  respondent  in
    early 2012, he had separated from her  and  had  been  living  with  Ms
    Bennett for a considerable period of time.  The judge said that he  had
    no reason to  doubt  that  the  appellant  had  previously  been  in  a
    relationship with Ms Bennett and had already had one child  by  her  in
    2002 but that relationship was  interrupted  by  his  marriage  to  Mrs
    Roach.  The judge then set out his findings as follows:

          "25.  Although both the Appellant and Ms  Bennett  describe  their
              relationship as having been "on and off", it would seem  that
              it has been sufficiently "on"  for  them  to  have  a  second
              child, J, in 2007 and a third child, N, in 2012.   There  are
              some documents, in joint names, from 2008 and 2010, and I  am
              prepared to accept that they  have  probably  lived  together
              since 2010, two years prior to the application.

          26.  Although I am sceptical and do not accept that the  Appellant
              has no ties in Jamaica, under Section 55 of the 2009  Act,  I
              have to consider the welfare of the children.  The eldest, D,
              is now 11 years old, whilst J is aged 6.  Children tend to be
              highly adaptable and I suspect that they would be able to re-
              adjust to living in Jamaica.  However, the fact is  that  the
              children are British citizens, and I have to take  this  into
              account.

          27.  Although I find that the case is finely  balanced,  it  would
              seem that the Respondent took an inordinate period  of  time,
              to decide the Appellant's application  for  an  extension  of
              leave, made in 2009, and  that,  had  a  decision  been  made
              within a reasonable period of time, the case of the Appellant
              would have been considerably weaker.  However, D  and  J  are
              now five years older, and having regards to their interest, I
              do not consider  it  appropriate  for  the  Appellant  to  be
              removed and for them to be  either  separated  from  him,  or
              forced to  leave  this  country  where  obviously  they  have
              developed all sorts of relationships.

          28.  Finally, I note that the position of Ms Bennett continues  to
              be uncertain.  However, the lack of urgency  with  which  the
              Appellant has been pursued does not give  me  any  confidence
              that the Respondent would resolve her position  in  the  near
              future.  This again, can serve only to harm  the  welfare  of
              the children, leaving them uncertain as to where their future
              home is to be."


          29.  It is accordingly with some considerable reluctance,  that  I
              have to allow this appeal.
The Grounds and Submissions

 7. In lengthy grounds the respondent argued that the judge  had  erred  in
    law by  failing  to  consider  the  merits  of  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules  and  in  the  alternative  whether  there  were  any
    compelling  circumstances  warranting  granting  the  appellant   leave
    outside the rules.   It is further argued that the judge failed to give
    adequate consideration  to  the  respondent's  legitimate  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control, to assess properly the issue
    of insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside  the  UK,
    particularly having noted that the children were at an  age  when  they
    were adaptable,  to  apply  the  income  threshold  in  the  article  8
    assessment,  failed  to  take  into  account  Azimi-Moayed  and  others
    (Decision affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT  197,  or  to
    consider the issue of delay in accordance with the guidance set out  by
    Lord Bingham in EB (Kosovo) v  SSHD [2008] UKHL 41.

 8. Mr Nath adopted these grounds  in  his  submissions  arguing  that  the
    assessment of article 8 had not been properly carried out in the  light
    of the authorities of MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192,  Nagre  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640.  When  the  grounds  were
    looked at cumulatively the judge had  failed  to  carry  out  a  proper
    assessment of proportionality.  He submitted that his conclusions  were
    set out very briefly and he should have given more consideration to the
    specific circumstances of the children and the nature and the extent of
    the relationship between the appellant and his partner.  There had been
    no adequate assessment of the public interest  and  in  particular  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control.

 9. Mr Richardson relied on the  Court  of  Appeal  judgement  in  Edgehill
    [2014] EWCA (Civ) 402, submitting that the application  had  been  made
    before the new rules had taken effect and on this basis the judge could
    not be criticized for failing to follow  Nagre  and  Gulshan.   He  was
    entitled to approach article 8 under the general  jurisprudence  rather
    than taking  the  more  limited  approach  mandated  by  MF  (Nigeria).
    Further, he argued that it was clear from the judge's conclusions  that
    he  had  been  well  aware  of  the  public  interest  in  relation  to
    immigration control.  The judge had said at [29] that it was with  some
    considerable reluctance that he allowed the appeal.   He  had  regarded
    the case as finely balanced [27] and had been sceptical about the claim
    that the appellant had no ties  in  Jamaica  [26].   This  was  a  case
    involving three children aged 11 �, 6 �, and 1.   The  judge  had  been
    right to regard their best interests as a primary consideration.

10. He submitted that there was no substance  in  the  ground  relating  to
    insurmountable obstacles as the substance of the case was based on  the
    appellant's relationship with his children.  No issue had  been  raised
    at the hearing about the financial requirements of the rules but in any
    event they would not be determinative.  The children were  British  and
    the judge was entitled to give weight  to  that  factor.   It  was  not
    suggested that this was a case where the delay  was  determinative  but
    again it was a matter the judge was  properly  entitled  to  take  into
    account.  In summary,  Mr  Richardson  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    reached a decision properly open to him and had not erred in law.

Assessment of whether there is an Error of Law

11. The issue before me at this stage of the appeal is  whether  the  judge
    erred in law such that his decision should be set aside.  It  is  clear
    that the judge accepted that the appellant  was  the  father  of  three
    children from his relationship with Ms Bennett.  The  oldest  child  is
    now 11 and there are two younger children aged 6 and  1.   He  accepted
    that the relationship had been "on and off"  but  also  that  they  had
    probably lived together since 2010, two years prior to the application.
     Ms Bennett had had indefinite leave to remain but in the light of  the
    fact that she used someone else's identity document  that  was  removed
    and she now has limited leave to remain based on her relationship  with
    her children.  The judge accepted that the three children were  British
    citizens and that an application for an extension  of  leave  had  been
    made in 2009.  That fact appears to be in dispute between  the  parties
    but the judge accepted the appellant's evidence on that issue.

12. Having found that there was genuine and subsisting family life  between
    the appellant, Ms Bennett and the three children, it was for the  judge
    to assess whether the appellant's removal would be proportionate  to  a
    legitimate aim.  Mr Nath submitted that the judge erred by  failing  to
    follow the guidance set out in MF (Nigeria)  and  in  subsequent  cases
    such as Nagre and Gulshan, whereas Mr Richardson  argued  that  in  the
    light of the Court of Appeal judgment in Edgehill the judge  cannot  be
    faulted for in effect carrying out  an  assessment  of  proportionality
    under the principles set out in Huang [2007] UKHL 11  and  EB  (Kosovo)
    without considering the matter within  the  framework  of  the  amended
    Immigration Rules.  The judgment in Edgehill  sits  uneasily  with  the
    Court of Appeal judgment in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558  where  the
    Court proceeded on the assumption that applications before the  amended
    rules came into force would, at least under article  8,  be  considered
    under the new rules.  However, in the particular circumstances of  this
    appeal, I do not think that this issue affects the outcome.

13. The judge did not refer in terms to MF  (Nigeria)  and  the  subsequent
    cases and his the conclusions are set out quite succinctly, but on  the
    other hand it is difficult to see how  the  welfare  of  three  British
    children aged between  11  and  1  could  be  anything  other  than  an
    exceptional or compassionate circumstance which would give rise to  the
    need to consider article 8, whether under the approach set  out  in  MF
    (Nigeria) or generally.

14. It is argued that  the  judge  failed  to  give  consideration  to  the
    respondent's legitimate interests in maintaining effective  immigration
    control, but the phraseology used  by  the  judge,  highlighted  by  Mr
    Richardson in his submissions, satisfies me that he was  clearly  aware
    of the balance he had to strike.  In any event, the judge recorded when
    setting out the background facts, that the respondent had had regard to
    the  duty  under  s.55  of  the  2009   Act   and,   when   considering
    proportionality, he referred  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining
    effective immigration control.  I do not accept that the judge did  not
    have those factors in mind  when  setting  out  his  conclusions.   The
    ground relating  to  insurmountable  obstacles  has  limited,  if  any,
    bearing on the issue as under para EX1 when considering  children,  the
    issue is whether there is a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  and
    whether it is reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.  Those
    factors were clearly in the judge's mind.

15. Issues relating to the income threshold were not raised at the hearing,
    but in any event, they would lead into a consideration of para EX1  and
    more generally how the balance should be struck in circumstances  where
    the requirements of the rules were not met.  The grounds also refer  to
    the guidance in Azimi-Moayed and in particular to [13] and the  factors
    set out there, but again there is no reason to believe that  the  judge
    was not fully aware of those provisions.   Finally,  on  the  issue  of
    delay, there is no reason to believe that the judge  regarded  that  as
    determinative; he was entitled to comment on  the  delay  in  making  a
    decision, having found that an application had been made in 2009.   His
    comment that at that stage the case would have been considerably weaker
    is consistent with the point being made by Lord Bingham in EB  (Kosovo)
    that a delay may strengthen a claim based on private and family life.

16. In summary I am satisfied that on the particular facts of  this  appeal
    the judge reached a decision properly open to him, and  that  when  the
    decision is read as a whole, it is clear why  he  took  the  view  that
    removal would be disproportionate to  a  legitimate  aim,  particularly
    taking in to account the fact that the welfare of the three children of
    the family was a primary consideration.

Decision

17. For these reasons, I am not  satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law and this appeal by the respondent is therefore dismissed.
