For the claimant: Mr R Martin, instructed by Bhogal & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Frankish  promulgated  18.5.15,   allowing   the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    curtail his  Residence  Permit  on  grounds  of  false  representation,
    pursuant to paragraph 320(7A) and 321A of the Immigration  Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 5.5.15.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Baker  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.7.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission on 1.9.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. For the reasons set out in  my  error  of  law  decision,  attached  as
    Appendix A, I found such error of law in the making of the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal such that the decision of Judge Frankish should
    be set aside and remade.

 5. The relevant background can be summarised briefly as follows.

 6. The claimant first came to the UK with leave  as  a  student  in  2011,
    residing with her aunt and uncle. To extend her visa she took  a  TOEIC
    English language test in March 2012. The circumstances  of  taking  the
    test as described by the claimant are, to say the least,  unusual.  She
    took the reading and writing test in London but claims she was told she
    would have to take the listening and speaking test in Nottingham, which
    she did 2 days later. She claims to have completed the  listening  test
    and was halfway through the speaking test when she had  stomach  pains.
    The examiner told her she could take the speaking  test  when  she  was
    feeling better. When she rang the next day, she  was  told  she  didn't
    need to return  because  the  half  of  the  test  she  had  taken  was
    sufficient and that she had passed the test. Judge Frankish noted  that
    the claimant's case was inconsistent and that in oral evidence she  did
    not come up to proof of her witness  statement  and  gave  a  different
    reason for feeling ill and that because of  a  cold/flu  was  told  her
    speaking test recording may not have been adequate.

 7. In January 2014 the claimant was issued with leave  to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a British citizen. On returning to the UK she was stopped and
    refused  leave  to  enter  on  the  basis  that  the  English  language
    certificate was fraudulently obtained. Further checks revealed she  had
    used the same certificate when applying in 2012 for  further  leave  to
    remain in the UK as a student. The Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied
    that the claimant employed deception to gain entry to the UK  and  thus
    refused entry under paragraph 320(7A) of the Immigration Rules.

 8. I found that the respondent's evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was in fact  sufficient  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  on  the
    Secretary of State, relying on the Judicial Review case of Gazi  [2015]
    UKUT 00327 (IAC), in which the President found that  that  the  generic
    evidence was sufficient to warrant the assessment that the  Applicant's
    TOEIC had been procured by deception and, thus,  provided  an  adequate
    foundation for the decision  to  refuse  entry.  Whilst  there  may  be
    multiple reasons for invalidation falling short of fraud, and there has
    been expert evidence in other cases to that  effect,  on  the  evidence
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal  there  was  certainly  sufficient  to
    discharge the burden of proof.  The  Judicial  Review  application  was
    dismissed, on the basis that the issue is best  suited  for  the  fact-
    finding forum of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  rather  than  by  Judicial
    Review.

 9. In my error of law decision, I found that the Secretary  of  State  had
    produced cogent evidence and that the claimant failed to undermine that
    evidence  or  provide  alternative  evidence   or   credible   innocent
    explanation which could or should have caused the judge to conclude the
    burden of proof on the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  discharged.  It
    followed that the appeal had to be dismissed on immigration grounds.

10. However, as this is an in-country appeal and any assessment of  private
    and family life concerns has to be made as at the date  of  hearing,  I
    recognised that further evidence may be necessary before resolving that
    aspect of the appeal, leaving open the question as to whether there are
    compelling circumstances insufficiently  recognised  within  the  Rules
    which would justify consideration outside the Rules on the  basis  that
    the decision  would  otherwise  be  unjustifiably  harsh  or  otherwise
    disproportionate. The parties were not in a position  to  address  that
    issue  or  call  evidence  at  the  error  of  law  hearing,  hence  my
    adjournment of the balance of the  remaking  of  the  decision  in  the
    appeal,  with  directions.  Unfortunately,  the  directions  were   not
    complied with,  in  that  no  revised  bundle  had  been  prepared  and
    considerable extra time was lost in seeking out the  relevant  material
    from the various previous bundles and separate documents submitted.

11. Since my error of law decision, the Upper Tribunal has  promulgated  SM
    and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC),  in
    which the Tribunal found that the 'generic' evidence relied on  by  the
    Secretary of State may be just sufficient to discharge  the  evidential
    burden on the Secretary of State, so as to place an  evidential  burden
    on the appellants of innocent explanation. However, on  the  particular
    facts of that case, once  the  two  appellants'  evidence  of  innocent
    explanation and ability in English was taken into account, the Tribunal
    found that the Secretary of State failed discharge the legal burden  of
    proof.


12. There was extensive discussion at the resumed hearing before me  as  to
    the correct course of action. Mr Martin submitted that I  could  reopen
    the decision and address  the  issue  as  to  whether  the  appellant's
    evidence was sufficient to discharge the  evidential  burden  and  then
    reassess whether the Secretary of State had discharged the legal burden
    of proving deception.


13. However, Ms Aboni opposed that course and submitted that in  any  event
    she had come prepared only to address the issue I left  open,  that  of
    private and family life, and would require an adjournment to be able to
    address the immigration grounds and the issue of  deception.  She  also
    pointed out that the human rights aspect of the appeal is  affected  by
    the conclusion and  decision  on  immigration  grounds,  in  particular
    whether the appellant used deception.


14. Mr Martin recognised that if the matter were to be  further  adjourned,
    further expense would be incurred by the  appellant,  as  to  which  he
    wished to take instructions. I thus gave both sides  time  to  consider
    the position and stood the case down. On resumption of the hearing,  Ms
    Aboni  maintained  her  position  and  Mr  Martin  did  not   seek   an
    adjournment, making no further submissions.


15. In the circumstances, I  concluded  that  the  correct  course  was  to
    proceed with the human rights aspect of the re-making  of  the  appeal,
    leaving the appeal dismissed on immigration grounds.


Private and Family Life Considerations


16. I heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant,  relying  on  her  witness
    statement of 12.11.14, and Mr Tak, relying on his witness statement  of
    6.11.14. They both relied on further, undated witness  statements,  all
    of which I have carefully taken into account.


17. Mrs Kaur has been living in the UK for  some  5  years,  and  has  been
    married to a British citizen  for  3  years.  In  her  additional  oral
    evidence, she explained that before coming to the UK she had  lived  in
    India with her parents and grandmother  in  a  property  owned  by  her
    grandmother. Her father has since passed away and there is  an  ongoing
    family dispute as to the grandmother's property following her death. If
    returned to India she would have to live in the family home, but  there
    are court proceedings to evict her family from the property.  She  said
    she would look for work, but as she did not have experience working  in
    India she anticipated that it would be hard to find work. She  believed
    she would find some work, but was not sure of  what  kind.  She  enjoys
    life in the UK  with  her  husband,  her  in-laws,  and  relatives  and
    friends. She said that these immigration proceedings had  really  upset
    her husband and he has  been  depressed  and  not  sleeping  or  eating
    properly. She had taken further English tests, including a  skills  for
    life test in September 2014 but has not  yet  been  able  to  take  the
    IELTS.


18. In cross-examination, Mrs  Kaur  explained  that  her  mother  and  two
    brothers still live in the family home. They do not work but survive on
    her mother's widow's pension. In India she obtained a degree in history
    and a B'Ed. In the UK she has obtained a diploma in business  strategic
    management. She has worked, both when a  student  and  after  marriage,
    sewing and operating machinery in a  factory.  She  said  she  had  not
    considered  returning  to  India  to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse. Asked why she could not  do  so,  she  said  she
    didn't want to, she had been living with her husband  for  three  years
    and if she returned her family's reputation  would  suffer.  She  would
    rather live and work in the UK. She said her life was in the UK and she
    didn't want to put any additional burden on her mother.


19. Mr Tak gave evidence as to the effect the immigration  proceedings  had
    on him. He had been a manager at a supermarket but the decision of  the
    Secretary of State tore him apart and he couldn't focus or eat properly
    and had to be demoted at work to a customer assistant. There were times
    he thought about taking his life. His wife has helped  him  get  better
    and he has now come off anti-depressants. However, the  appeal  of  the
    Home Office has destroyed his recovery, so that he  has  gone  back  to
    'square one.' However, he continues to work as a customer assistant and
    has been told that he could go back to being a manager.


20. Asked in cross-examination whether he and his wife have considered  her
    going back to India to make application from there,  he  said  she  had
    nothing to go back to. "She's made her life here... She's  not  welcome
    back there." He said that all of his family were in  the  UK  and  none
    remained in India.


21. I have taken into account the medical  evidence  as  to  the  husband's
    health and the statements in support of the claimant from the husband's
    parents, who were at court, but not called  to  give  evidence.  It  is
    clear that the claimant is well-liked and integrated into her husband's
    family.


22. Although Mrs Aboni suggested that it was  relevant  to  any  article  8
    assessment that the claimant had used deception to  obtain  an  English
    language test certificate, which in turn was used to  obtain  leave  to
    remain as a spouse,  I  consider  that  the  private  and  family  life
    assessment should primarily be made on  the  basis  of  the  prevailing
    personal and family circumstances.


23. Article 8 provides that:


           "Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           "There shall be no interference by a public authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


24. At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


25. Claims to remain in the UK on the basis of family and/or  private  life
    have first to be assessed under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the
    Immigration Rules. However, as submitted by Ms Aboni and accepted by Mr
    Martin, the claimant cannot meet those requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules,  even  without  the  complicating  feature  of  the  suitability
    requirements, arising from the deception in  obtaining  and  using  the
    TOEIC certificate.


26. In relation to private life, under paragraph 276ADE  the  claimant  has
    not been in the UK for 20 years  and  she  cannot  show  insurmountable
    obstacles to her integration in India, where she has lived most of  her
    life, speaks the language, was educated to a high  level,  and  retains
    obvious family, social and cultural ties.


27. In relation to family life under Appendix FM,  the  claimant  does  not
    meet the English language requirements, even now, and it has  not  been
    shown that they meet the minimum income financial  threshold.  Even  on
    consideration of EX1(b), the claimant has not shown, in my  view,  that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  with  her
    partner outside the UK. Whilst the husband has no family in  India,  as
    they are all in the UK, and he has employment in the UK,  the  claimant
    has family and they both have the prospect  of  finding  employment  in
    India. The Rules do not guarantee accommodation, income  or  lifestyle,
    or a choice of place to settle. In effect, they will be no different to
    the circumstances of many others in India.


28. Before article 8 ECHR can be considered outside the Rules the  claimant
    must demonstrate that there are compelling circumstances insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules so as  to  justify  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside Rules under article 8 ECHR, on  the  basis  that  the  decision
    would otherwise be unjustifiably harsh.


29. In SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal re-
    stated the  context  and  considered  the  role  of  public  policy  as
    expressed in the Rules in the proportionality assessment. The  decision
    maker is entitled to decide that Article  8  considerations  have  been
    fully addressed in the Rules when dealing with 'stage  two'.   If  they
    have, it is enough to say so.  This will necessarily  involve  deciding
    whether there is a 'gap' between the Rules  and  Article  8,  and  then
    whether there are circumstances in the case under  consideration  which
    take it outside the class of cases which  the  Rules  properly  provide
    for.  Whether these circumstances  are  described  as  'compelling'  or
    'exceptional' is not a matter of substance.   They  must  be  relevant,
    weighty, and not fully provided for within the Rules.  In practice they
    are likely to be both compelling and exceptional, but  this  is  not  a
    legal requirement.  The  first  stage,  therefore,  is  to  assess  how
    completely the Rules  reflect  Article  8  considerations  and  decided
    whether there is a gap between the Rules and article 8 rights.


30. On the facts of this case I find no gap between the Rules  and  article
    8. There are no particularly compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances
    that I can identify on the facts of this case, even taking  account  of
    all the claimant's circumstances urged upon me,  that  would  render  a
    decision to remove the appellant unjustifiably harsh.


31. Even if I conducted an  assessment  outside  the  Rules,  applying  the
    Razgar stepped approach, I am satisfied that in the balancing  exercise
    between the rights of the appellant on the one hand, and on  the  other
    the legitimate and necessary aim of the state to protect  the  economic
    well-being of the UK  through  immigration  control,  the  decision  is
    proportionate.


32. I would in that assessment have to take into account  section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act that immigration control is in the  public  interest,  and
    that little weight should be given to any private life developed in the
    UK  when  the  claimant's  immigration  status  was,  at   the   least,
    precarious. She can obtain no credit for being financially  independent
    or speaking English.


33. I bear in mind that the claimant married a  British  citizen,  but  she
    came to the UK as a student and had no legitimate expectation of  being
    able to remain here further,  except  in  accordance  with  the  Rules.
    Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the Rules and  her  case
    is not strengthened by the degree to which she fails to meet the Rules.
    They are not entitled to settle and carry on family life in the UK just
    because they have chosen to do so. Their marriage was entered into when
    it was known and should have been realised that the claimant would have
    to return to India on completion of her studies. Her leave as a student
    did not give rise to  any  legitimate  expectation  of  being  able  to
    settle. It follows, therefore, that the marriage was always precarious.
    There are Rules for those wishing to remain in the UK as a partner,  or
    on the basis of  private,  but  she  has  been  unable  to  meet  those
    requirements.  Her  failure  to  do  so  is  highly  relevant  to   any
    proportionality  assessment.  I  take  into  account  that  there   are
    difficulties over her family home  in  India  and  that  her  husband's
    family are all in the UK and that he is employed here. I also  bear  in
    mind his ill-health. However, medical treatment will  be  available  to
    him in India, should he choose to accompany the claimant to India.


34. Taking a view of the evidence as a whole, in the round, I find that her
    family life and whatever private life she may  have  developed  in  the
    time she has been in the UK, and taking into account as  far  as  I  am
    able all other circumstances, I can find nothing sufficient to outweigh
    the public interest in removing the appellant from the UK. Even without
    the findings in relation to deception and  the  use  of  an  improperly
    obtained English language certificate, I find  that  the  result  would
    have been the same.


Conclusions:

35. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I previously set aside the decision.

                    I previously re-made  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
                    dismissing the appeal on immigration grounds.

                    I further dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

36. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Frankish  promulgated  18.5.15,   allowing   the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    curtail his  Residence  Permit  on  grounds  of  false  representation,
    pursuant to paragraph 320(7A) and 321A of the Immigration  Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 5.5.15.

37. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Baker  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.7.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission on 1.9.15.

38. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

39. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Frankish should be set aside.

40. The relevant background  can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  In
    January 2014 the claimant was issued with leave to remain as the spouse
    of a British citizen. In his  application  he  had  submitted  a  TOEIC
    English language certificate provided by ETS. On returning to the UK he
    was stopped and refused leave to enter on the basis  that  the  English
    language certificate was fraudulently obtained. Further checks revealed
    he had used the same certificate when  applying  in  2012  for  further
    leave to remain in the UK as a  student.  The  Secretary  of  State  is
    satisfied that the claimant employed deception to gain entry to the  UK
    and thus refused entry  under  paragraph  320(7A)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Case law, including RP (Proof of Forgery) Nigeria [2006] UK  AIT
    00086, has established that an allegation of forgery should  be  proved
    on the basis  of  clear  and  cogent  evidence;  a  mere  assertion  is
    insufficient.  The  burden  of  proof  remains  on   the   balance   of
    probabilities and lies  with  the  party  making  the  allegation;  the
    Secretary of State.

41. In deciding the claimant's appeal, Judge Frankish  concluded  that  the
    Secretary of State had failed to demonstrate that the submission of the
    2012 test certificate amounted to the use of a false, document  or  the
    submission of false information or representations.

42. Judge Frankish noted at �15 that the claimant did not come up to  proof
    in her evidence, giving inconsistent explanations as to why she  claims
    not to have sat the whole test. In allowing the appeal, he  appears  to
    have relied on the fluency  of  the  claimant's  English  in  her  oral
    evidence and her one-year post-graduate course in English, to  conclude
    that she did not have the need to fake her  speaking  test.  The  judge
    considered the  evidence  relied  on  by  the  Secretary  of  State  as
    generalised and not specific to the claimant, concluding at �18 "It  is
    apparent, however, that the respondent has failed to  demonstrate  that
    the (claimant's) use of her test result of 19 June 2012 in  support  of
    her student and spouse visa amounted to a false  document,  information
    or representation as  alleged."  In  the  circumstances,  allowing  the
    appeal on immigration grounds, the judge did not go on to consider  her
    private and family life claims.

43. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Grubb found  it  arguable  that
    the judge failed to give adequate reasons  for  his  finding  that  the
    Secretary of State had failed to establish on  the  evidence  that  the
    test result had been obtained as a result of a proxy test-taker, and/or
    to properly consider the so-called 'generic' evidence and ETS  decision
    to invalidate this claimant's test certificate. "It  is  arguable  that
    the (claimant's)  account  -  itself  inconsistent  -  did  nothing  to
    displace the factual  link  which  was  arguably  established  by  that
    evidence."

44. The First-tier Tribunal was presented with  the  now  familiar  witness
    statements of Rebecca Collins  and  Peter  Millington,  explaining  the
    process of detection. The evidence relating this to  the  claimant  was
    the usual short excel data sheet naming  the  claimant,  with  date  of
    birth, the test centre and the test date, as well as the  scores.  This
    corresponds  entirely  with  the  test  certificate  submitted  by  the
    claimant. The so-called 'generic' evidence explains that  in  order  to
    invalidate a test  result  the  case  has  to  go  through  a  computer
    programme analysing speech and then requiring the confirmation  of  two
    independent voice analysts. If all three are in agreement that a  proxy
    is used, the test certificate is invalidated. This  amounts  to  cogent
    evidence sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on  the  Secretary
    of State. In the recent Judicial Review case of Gazi [2015] UKUT  00327
    (IAC), referred to me by Mr Rahid, the President found  that  that  the
    generic evidence was sufficient to  warrant  the  assessment  that  the
    Applicant's TOEIC had been procured by deception and, thus, provided an
    adequate foundation for the decision to refuse entry. Whilst there  may
    be multiple reasons for invalidation falling short of fraud, and  there
    has been expert evidence in other cases to that effect, on the evidence
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal  there  was  certainly  sufficient  to
    discharge the burden of proof.  The  Judicial  Review  application  was
    dismissed, on the basis that the issue is best  suited  for  the  fact-
    finding forum of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  rather  than  by  Judicial
    Review.

45. With respect to Judge Frankish, the issue is not whether  the  claimant
    could in 2012 or at the date of the appeal hearing speak English  to  a
    reasonable  standard,   but   rather   whether   deception   or   false
    representation was employed, as  strongly  suggested  by  the  evidence
    produced by the Secretary of State. There may be all kinds  of  reasons
    why a person would resort to such a device to obtain a  certificate  by
    proxy. The finding that a person who speaks English would, in the  view
    of the judge, have no reason to secure a test certificate by  deception
    fails for want of cogent reason  to  address  or  displace  the  cogent
    evidence produced by the Secretary of  State,  particularly  given  the
    somewhat inconsistent account of the claimant as to what happened, what
    may be regarded as an inadequate explanation.

46. In the circumstances, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  in
    material error of law and cannot stand. I set aside  the  decision  and
    remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by  dismissing  the  appeal  on
    immigration grounds. For the reasons set out above,  the  Secretary  of
    State has produced cogent evidence and the claimant failed to undermine
    that evidence or provide alternative evidence or  credible  explanation
    which could or should have caused the judge to conclude the  burden  of
    proof was not discharged.

47. For obvious reasons, Judge  Frankish  did  not  address  the  issue  of
    private and family life, either under the Rules or  outside  the  Rules
    under article 8 ECHR because of compelling circumstances insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules so as justify allowing the claimant's leave  to
    continue on the basis that it would be unjustifiably harsh or otherwise
    disproportionate to require him to leave  the  UK.  Those  are  matters
    which remain outstanding and which the Tribunal was unable to deal with
    at the error of law hearing. In the circumstances I adjourn the  appeal
    for that consideration, in accordance with the attached directions.

Conclusions:

48. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by  dismissing  the
                    appeal on immigration grounds.

                    I adjourn the appeal for evidence and  consideration  of
                    private and family life human rights grounds.

Consequential Directions

49. The appeal is adjourned to be relisted in  the  Upper  Tribunal  before
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup, sitting at Birmingham on a  day  to
    be fixed as soon as possible, for  the  reasonable  convenience  of  Mr
    Rashid;

50. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours;

51. No interpreter is required;

52. The appeal will be confined to the issue  of  human  rights  only.  The
    Tribunal will consider private and family life  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and whether there are sufficiently compelling reasons to consider
    human rights outside the Rules pursuant to article 8 ECHR;

53. Not later than 15 working days before the adjourned  hearing  date  the
    claimant shall serve on the Secretary of State  and  lodge  two  copies
    with the Tribunal a single consolidated, paginated, indexed  bundle  of
    all subjective and objective materials relied on,  including  any  case
    authorities  and  skeleton  argument.  The  Tribunal  will  not  accept
    evidence submitted on the day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
