Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Capel instructed by Migrant Legal Project
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
      Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings
      shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant.   This  direction
      applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and a  failure  to
      comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to   Contempt   of   Court
      proceedings.

Introduction

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on [ ] 1987.   She
      arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2011 as a student.  On 14
      November 2012, she married her husband, also a Pakistan national in an
      Islamic marriage in the UK.  He had entered the UK on 4 April 2008  as
      a visitor but, subsequent to the expiry of his visa, he overstayed.

   3. On 22 January 2013, the appellant applied for leave to remain  outside
      the Rules but that was refused on 11 March 2013.

   4. On 7 August 2013, the appellant made a claim for asylum.  The basis of
      her claim was that she and her husband would be subject to  an  honour
      killing by her parents because she had  married  "a  man  outside  her
      caste" in the UK without her parents' permission.

   5. On 5 September 2013, the Secretary of State  refused  the  appellant's
      claim for asylum, humanitarian protection and that her  removal  would
      breach Art 8.  As a consequence, on 9 January 2015, the  Secretary  of
      State refused to vary the appellant's  leave  to  remain  and  made  a
      decision to remove her to Pakistan  under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,
      Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

The Appeal

   6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal with her husband and
      two children as her dependants.

   7. In  a  determination  promulgated  on  23  October  2015,  Judge  Page
      dismissed the appellant's appeal.   He  made  an  adverse  credibility
      finding and did not accept the appellant's account that she  would  be
      at risk (together with her husband) from her family in Pakistan  as  a
      result of her marriage.  He also dismissed the appeal under Art  8  of
      the ECHR.

   8. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.   On
      16 November 2015, the First-tier  Tribunal  (DJ  Zucker)  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal.

   9. On 4 December 2015, the Secretary of State filed a  rule  24  response
      seeking to uphold the decision.

  10. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

  11. At the hearing, Mr Richards, on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State
      conceded that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  could  not
      stand and should be  set  aside.   He  accepted  that  the  judge  had
      materially erred in law in para 66 of his determination  when  he  had
      counted against the  appellant  that  she  had  not,  in  her  earlier
      application for further leave to remain submitted on 22 January  2015,
      raised her fear that she would be at risk of an  honour  killing  from
      her family as a result of her marriage.  Mr Richards accepted that the
      appellant had, in fact, raised that matter in her application form  as
      set out in para 8 of the grounds of appeal.



Decision and Disposal

  12. Given the concession by the Secretary of State - which in my  view  is
      entirely properly made - the judge did materially err in law  in  para
      66 of his determination such  that  his  adverse  credibility  finding
      cannot stand and consequently his decision to dismiss the  appellant's
      appeal on all grounds must be set aside.

  13. For those reasons, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved
      the making of a material error of law.  The decision is set aside.

  14. Both representatives invited me to remit the appeal to the  First-tier
      Tribunal for a de novo rehearing.

  15. Having regard to the nature and extent of the  fact  finding  required
      and having regard to para  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
      Statement, the proper disposal of the appeal is to  remit  it  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal for a de novo rehearing before a judge other  than
      Judge Page.
