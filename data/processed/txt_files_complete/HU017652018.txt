Team)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Harold [R],  a  citizen  of  Colombia  born  13
       December 1965, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  22
       October 2018  dismissing  his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       refusal (of 20 December 2017) of his human rights claim.


    2. The application, made on 30 October 2017 and seeking further leave to
       remain with his British citizen partner  [MR],  was  refused  on  the
       basis that the Appellant had not shown that he had passed an  English
       language test at the relevant level. The Respondent  considered  that
       he had not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances warranting  the
       grant of leave outside the Rules.

    3. The Appellant had come to  appreciate  the  inadequacy  of  the  test
       results he had supplied in the course of the application process, and
       explained that he had submitted his application  relying  on  a  test
       result that he subsequently came to appreciate was not at  the  right
       level. He sought his passport's return (as such a document  would  be
       essential in satisfying any test provider as  to  his  identity),  it
       being  held  on  the  Home  Office  file  alongside  his  outstanding
       application, but without success.

    4. His appeal, lodged on 29 December  2017,  was  determined  without  a
       hearing. His submissions were to the effect that he had  been  unable
       to take the test in question because test providers had demanded  his
       passport as a condition of permitting him to sit for assessment.  The
       Respondent's refusal to  release  the  passport  had  frustrated  his
       attempts to obtain the correct results.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal noted that it was necessary for an  applicant
       to show they had demonstrated English language proficiency  at  Level
       A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference, and he had not done
       so. Accordingly he could not satisfy the Immigration Rules.

    6. His claim outside the Rules, based on requiring more time to sit  the
       test in question, did not have any compelling  element  demonstrating
       unjustifiably harsh consequences, and accordingly his appeal fell  to
       be dismissed.

    7. Grounds of appeal argued that the public interest  assessment  should
       have considered the extent to which the Appellant's inability to meet
       the Rules was caused by  the  Respondent's  failure  to  release  his
       documents.

    8. Permission to appeal was granted on 22 November 2018  by  the  First-
       tier Tribunal, on the basis that the Judge's conclusion that  it  was
       open to the Appellant to sit the test and re-apply  did  not  address
       the fact that his appeal's dismissal would render him  returnable  to
       Colombia, without having any further opportunity to  make  a  further
       application.

    9. Mr Nawaz submitted that there had been a technical  failure  to  meet
       the Rules, and the consequences for the Appellant and his partner  if
       he had to return abroad to seek entry clearance were disproportionate
       to the public interest sought to be achieved. Mr  Tufan  pointed  out
       that nevertheless the Rules were not met. Mr Tufan stated that it was
       clear from the Home Office file that a senior caseworker had begun to
       make arrangements for the return of the passport. Indeed he had hoped
       the document might have  reached  him  for  today's  appeal  hearing.
       However, nothing had eventuated. He noted that  the  Rules  were  not
       met, though  acknowledged  that  one  solution  to  justice  in  this
       particular case might be for the Upper Tribunal to retain the appeal,
       if it found a material error of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
       decision, and to issue directions for the passport's  return  to  its
       rightful owner.

Findings and reasons

   10. This appeal  turns  on  a  narrow  point.  On  his  application,  the
       Appellant provided a Grade 2 Graded  Examination  in  Spoken  English
       certificate in ESOL (CEFR Level A1). This was not sufficient to  meet
       the requirements of the Appendix  FM  partner  route,  which  demands
       proficiency at Level A2. The parties agreed before me that more  than
       one request had been made for the return of the  passport,  including
       one on 8 November 2017.


   11. Article 8 ECHR affords some degree of procedural  protection  to  the
       right to private and family life. Thus the Master of  the  Rolls  for
       the Court of Appeal in Gudanaviciene [2014] EWCA Civ 1622 stated:

           "Article 8 is frequently engaged in immigration decisions. The
           procedural protections inherent in article 8 are necessary in
           order to ensure that article 8 rights are practical and
           effective. The necessity for this is at least as important in
           immigration cases as in any other cases."

   12. In a similar vein, the ECtHR in Ciubotaru  v  Moldova  (27138/04;  27
       April 2010) stated that effective protection of Article 8 rights "may
       require the existence of an effective procedural framework whereby an
       applicant can  assert  his  or  her  rights  under  Article  8  under
       conditions of fairness including as  regards  matters  of  proof  and
       evidence."


   13. It seems to me that on the uncontested evidence,  the  Appellant  was
       prevented from satisfying the Immigration Rules by the refusal of the
       Respondent to return to him his  passport.  The  original  fault,  of
       course, lay with the Appellant, and one response to this appeal would
       be to consider that determinative; the making of a  further  fee-paid
       application would be appropriate and  proportionate.  However,  given
       the extended period over which the passport  has  been  held  by  the
       Respondent, it was essential for the First-tier Tribunal to carefully
       evaluate whether  any  further  application  was  in  fact  feasible.
       However it failed to do so. This is particularly important given that
       the Appellant potentially faced removal from the UK  upon  exhaustion
       of his appeal rights. Indeed the refusal letter stated "If you do not
       appeal you will be liable to enforced removal to Colombia".

   14. At the error of law hearing, I considered this was a  material  error
       of law and that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  accordingly
       could not stand.

   15. As Mr Tufan very fairly indicated at the error of  law  hearing,  the
       Secretary of State had in fact recognised that returning the document
       was an appropriate step to take, but the  administrative  systems  in
       place proved inadequate to  the  task.  This  demonstrates  that  the
       Respondent recognised the need to assist with ensuring the procedural
       protection of the Appellant's right to family life (and that  of  his
       wife).

   16. The parties invited  me  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  event  I
       identified a material error of law, though giving an  opportunity  to
       the Secretary of State to make good the procedural unfairness so  far
       occasioned by retaining the Appellant's passport. I  considered  this
       to be appropriate in the interests of justice.

   17. At a case management review hearing of 25 May 2019, the  appeal  came
       on again before me, and it was agreed that in the circumstances,  the
       appeal could be allowed. The Secretary of State having  returned  the
       Appellant's passport to him, the Appellant had been able to  take  an
       English language test. He now provided a Grade 3  Graded  Examination
       in Spoken English from Trinity College London dated 25 February  2019
       from London Holborn SELT Centre (No 58506),  recording  that  he  had
       passed the speaking and listening dimension at CEFR Level A2.1.

   18. If the Appellant has a viable case under the Rules, then so  long  as
       he can establish private and family life in the UK, his appeal  would
       inevitably succeed: see TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA  Civ
       1109 ï¿½35. It seems to me that that is the case here. The  Appellant's
       relationship  with  his  partner  is  established  as   genuine   and
       subsisting,  they  intend  to  live  together  permanently,  and  the
       financial and  immigration  status  requirements  of  the  Rules  are
       satisfied. The one missing  ingredient  of  a  successful  case,  his
       English language test results, has now been supplied. Accordingly his
       appeal should succeed.

    Decision:


    There was a material error of law in the decision  appealed,  which  is
    set aside.
    The appeal is allowed.


Signed:                                            Date: 24 May 2019
