For the Appellant:     Ms R Harrington, Counsel instructed by Gloucester
Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


    1. This is the continuation of an appeal by the Appellant, a citizen  of
       Ecuador, against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Britton and Mr G H Getlevog) dismissing his appeal against a decision
       made on 29 August 2013 by the Respondent that section 32(5) of the UK
       Borders Act 2007 applied and that the Appellant's deportation was  in
       accordance with the Immigration Rules and would not breach Article  8
       of the ECHR.


    2. Following a hearing on 8 April 2014 we decided that the  decision  of
       the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appeal  under  Article  8
       involved the making of an error of  law  and  we  set  that  decision
       aside. In making this decision we found no error of law in the First-
       tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal on asylum,
       humanitarian  protection  and  Article  3  ECHR  grounds.  We   noted
       (paragraph  33  of  our  decision)  that  it  was  agreed   by   both
       representatives that it would be appropriate for us to  consider  any
       updating evidence, in  particular  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
       children, and that a mental health consultant's assessment  had  been
       requested by the consultant paediatrician dealing with the child 'NJ'
       and that this evidence would assist us in reaching our decision.


    3. At the hearing before us on 10 December 2014 the Appellant was  again
       represented by Ms Harrington and Mr Richards again appeared  for  the
       Respondent. Ms Harrington submitted a written skeleton  argument  and
       confirmed that there were no updated witness statements and no mental
       health  consultant's  assessment  in  respect  of  'NJ'.   The   only
       additional documentary evidence was to be three documents referred to
       in a letter from the Appellant's  representatives  being  letters  in
       respect of the minor children 'CJ' and 'NJ' and from the  Appellant's
       Probation Officer. Ms Harrington confirmed that at the  date  of  the
       hearing the Appellant's children were aged 20, 18, 16 and 14. 'OJ' is
       now a student at the University of  Plymouth.  'JJ'  has  joined  the
       army. 'NJ' is doing 'A' levels and 'CJ' is doing GCSEs.


Oral evidence

    4. The Appellant gave oral evidence in English and  answering  questions
       from Ms Harrington confirmed his identity and said that  since  being
       granted bail on 28 May 2014 he has been  living  with  his  children,
       bonding with them and coaching and helping  them  with  their  school
       work. He has been trying to make up for lost time. He  is  especially
       close to 'CJ'. He spent a lot of time with 'JJ' before he joined  the
       army. As an artist the Appellant is able to help out his eldest child
       'OJ' who is studying fashion design. He reads a lot of books with his
       children. He has written a further three books himself. The  fear  of
       separation makes his relationship with his children more special.


    5. The Appellant and his family still get support from  the  family  who
       used to help look after the children when they were in Australia. One
       member of this family has travelled from Australia and is present  in
       Court.
    6. The Appellant said that he reports as  required  by  his  immigration
       bail and also reports to his probation officer under the terms of his
       licence. He is involved with 'Changing Times' and composes music  and
       plays the guitar. He is making a contribution to society.


    7. Asked about 'NJ' the Appellant said that she has been  happier  since
       he came out of prison although she has a lot of sad and dark moments.
       He needs to reassure her and to care for her and  love  her.  She  is
       happy with him around. The question is what will happen when he goes.
       The problem is  with  'NJ'  and  'CJ'  mostly.  'NJ'  was  very  sick
       yesterday, he keeps an eye on her and he  sleeps  next  to  her.  The
       Appellant said that he gets depressed and anxious too and  they  help
       each other.


    8. Cross-examined by Mr Richards the Appellant said that it was about  7
       or 8 months between the time when his wife was arrested whilst  on  a
       visit to the UK and him coming here.  He  did  not  come  to  the  UK
       immediately when his wife was arrested because they had  a  house  in
       Australia and the children were in school. He spoke to a solicitor in
       Australia. The prosecution wanted ï¿½116,000 and the only asset was the
       house. He needed to sell it for this purpose and also to raise  money
       for the children to travel. It took a long time.


    9. The Appellant said that the children found the separation from  their
       mother difficult. He had to do everything for them. The Elich  family
       were close friends and helped out a  lot.  Christine  Elich  is  here
       today.


   10. The Appellant said that he and his wife have a friendly  relationship
       but are not living together as husband and wife. They care for  their
       children. Asked if there was any reason why the  children  could  not
       live in Ecuador the Appellant said that their mother and her  parents
       are here. The children have been raised in English culture. His  wife
       is totally against removing them. They do not speak the  language  or
       know the culture of Ecuador.


   11. Mr Richards suggested to the Appellant that  when  he  committed  the
       offences for which he was imprisoned  he  must  have  known  that  if
       detected this is what he would face. The Appellant said that  he  did
       not think of the scope. It is very complicated. He has made mistakes.
       The children are the most important thing. He has  learned  from  his
       mistakes.


   12. Asked about 'NJ' and her depression the Appellant said that  she  was
       in counselling but not now. He is her medicine.


   13. 'NJ'  gave  evidence  and  answering  questions  from  Ms  Harrington
       confirmed her date of birth (15 January 1998)  and  agreed  that  the
       content of her letter (page 24 of the Appellant's bundle)  was  true.
       'NJ' said that she is in college studying photography,  maths,  human
       health  and  sports  science.  Her  long  term  plans  are  to  study
       psychology and  human  biology  and  to  help  children  with  mental
       illnesses. She agreed that she received counselling  during  the  two
       and a half years she spent in high school. Now she is not getting any
       counselling. She did get some from college but  could  not  find  the
       time. 'NJ' said that she is coping better than last year. Asked  what
       the effect would be if her father was deported 'NJ' said when he  was
       in prison she sank into her deepest depression. Since he has been out
       she  has  been  better.  If  he  was  taken  away  it  would  destroy
       everything, she would  not  cope.  'NJ'  agreed  that  she  has  been
       involved with the Community Adolescent Mental Health  Scheme  (CAMS).
       This lasted about 6 weeks with one counsellor and then 6  weeks  with
       another.


   14. Cross-examined by Mr  Richards  'NJ'  said  that  she  last  received
       counselling in September 2014. She said that her  depression  started
       when her mother left and then got worse when her father left.


SUBMISSIONS

   15. For the Respondent Mr Richards said that  the  Immigration  Act  2014
       applied. It should be kept in mind that the public  interest  is  not
       the same as public opinion but public opinion  would be  outraged  if
       someone guilty of a serious crime, who had to be dragged back to this
       country using extradition now says that having been dragged  back  he
       is not going to leave. He adopted what Ms  Harrington   said  in  her
       skeleton argument that very compelling circumstances over  and  above
       the exceptions referred to in  section  117C(3)  to  (6)  Nationality
       immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and paragraph 399  and  399A  of  the
       Immigration Rules have to be demonstrated. The public interest is  so
       significant it will almost always outweigh family  and  private  life
       issues. Deportation is almost  always  proportionate.  In  this  case
       there are family life considerations. The Appellant currently  spends
       time with his children but, said Mr Richards, we should  be  cautious
       about the rosy picture painted by the Appellant. We  should  look  at
       'NJs' evidence and be conscious of her  vulnerability.  Her  problems
       were triggered by having two criminals as parents. There is no recent
       report from any professional medical practitioner.  The  evidence  is
       that 'NJ' is coping better. There is no doubt she will be affected by
       her father's deportation as will other members of the family, that is
       what deportation does. The seriousness  of  the  crime  needs  to  be
       balanced against the rights of the individuals. This is a man who did
       not want to come here to face justice. The public  interest  in  this
       case outweighs everything else.


   16. For the Appellant Ms Harrington referred to  her  skeleton  argument.
       There is no need to be cautious in accepting  the  Appellant's  word.
       Each child has given a statement or letter. The children's experience
       in this case is unusual in context of the children of criminals. They
       have been dragged around the world and uprooted from their home.  The
       circumstances are a consequence of their parents' decisions but these
       are particularly vulnerable children. We were asked to  look  at  the
       updated information in respect of 'CJ' and 'NJ'. 'NJ' does  not  know
       what the future holds but her  improvement  is  down  to  her  father
       coming back. Referring to the 2014 Act Mr Harrington  said  that  the
       Appellant is a low risk of reoffending. He is living in the community
       and he is not a danger. Referred by  us  to  the  Appellant's  wife's
       statement Ms Harrington agreed that the Appellant was living with his
       wife and family because he needed a bail address. This is  likely  to
       be a temporary arrangement and it is likely that the  children  would
       live with their mother in the longer term.


   17. We reserved our decision.


Discussion

   18. This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  a  decision  made  by  the
       Respondent on 29 August 2013. The Respondent's decision followed  the
       Appellant's conviction and sentence to five years imprisonment for 12
       offences of fraud involving the  sum  of  ï¿½847,575.  The  nature  and
       seriousness of the Appellant's  offences  is  clear  from  the  Trial
       Judge's sentencing remarks quoted in the decision of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. In summary this was a series of insurance frauds  involving
       the Appellant faking his  own  death  to  make  claims  on  insurance
       policies. The claims were made in the United Kingdom,  the  Appellant
       was said to have died in Ecuador and the proceeds of the  crime  were
       used by the  Appellant  and  his  wife  to  establish  themselves  in
       Australia. The Appellant's wife was detained when she returned to the
       United Kingdom for a family wedding in 2010 and,  on  conviction  for
       her part in the crime she was sentenced to  two  years  imprisonment.
       The Appellant returned voluntarily following the issue of  a  warrant
       of extradition. The Appellant's four children, all British  citizens,
       have settled in the United Kingdom as  a  result  of  their  parents'
       imprisonment here.


   19. This appeal is restricted to a consideration of Article 8 of the ECHR
       the decision of the First-tier Tribunal having  been  upheld  in  all
       other respects. In undertaking this  consideration  we  firstly  have
       regard to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  MF  (Nigeria)  v
       Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192;
       [2014] 1 WLR 544 holding  as  it  does  that  the  Immigration  Rules
       provide a  complete  code  for  dealing  with  Article  8  issues  in
       deportation cases  and  that  the  exceptional  circumstances  to  be
       considered in the balancing exercise involve  the  application  of  a
       proportionality test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  In
       considering Article 8 we therefore do so  within  the  terms  of  the
       Immigration  Rules.  Further  our  decision   is   made   after   the
       implementation of part 5A of the Nationality Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002  and  as  such  we  are  required  to  have  regard  to  the
       considerations listed in section 117C when  considering  whether  any
       interference with the Appellant's right to private and family life is
       justified under Article 8(2). It is accepted by  Ms  Harrington  that
       the Appellant is a 'foreign criminal' as defined by the Act  who  has
       been sentenced to a period of more than 4 years imprisonment. Section
       117C provides


          (1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
          interest.
          (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
          (3) In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.
          (4) Exception 1 applies where-
          (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
          C's life,
          (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
          and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to  C's  integration
          into
          the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
          (5) Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a   genuine   and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be  unduly
          harsh.
          (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
          requires   deportation   unless   there   are   very    compelling
          circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1  and
          2.
          (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
          into account where a court or tribunal is considering  a  decision
          to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that  the  reason
          for the decision  was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
          criminal has been convicted.


   20. The effect of the above is that  we  are  considering  Article  8  by
       reference to the  Immigration  Rules  and  section  117C  above.  The
       relevant rules, taking into account the Court of Appeal  decision  in
       YM (Uganda) [2014] EWCA Civ 1292, are those currently prevailing  and
       are as follows


          398. Where  a  person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
          contrary to the UK's obligations under  Article  8  of  the  Human
          Rights Convention, and
          (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public  interest  because  they  have  been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been  sentenced  to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
          (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public  interest  because  they  have  been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been  sentenced  to  a
          period of imprisonment of less  than  4  years  but  at  least  12
          months; or
          (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
          public good and in the public interest because, in the view of the
          Secretary of State, their offending has  caused  serious  harm  or
          they are a persistent offender who shows  a  particular  disregard
          for the law, the Secretary of State in assessing that  claim  will
          consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies  and,  if  it  does
          not, the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by
          other factors where there are very compelling  circumstances  over
          and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.


          399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies
          if -
          (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
          with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and
          (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
          (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7
          years immediately preceding the date of the immigration  decision;
          and in either case
          (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the  country
          to which the person is to be deported; and
          (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in  the  UK
          without the person who is to be deported; or
          (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
          partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen  or  settled  in
          the UK, and
          (i) the  relationship  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
          (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status was
          not precarious; and
          (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that  partner  to  live  in  the
          country to  which  the  person  is  to  be  deported,  because  of
          compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described   in
          paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
          (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain  in  the
          UK without the person who is to be deported.


          399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
          if -
          (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
          his life; and
          (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
          into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.


   21. Although we have quoted the relevant  rules  in  their  entirety  the
       situation for the Appellant, being a person sentenced to more than  4
       years imprisonment does not allow for the  application  of  paragraph
       399  and  we  have  therefore   highlighted   the   very   compelling
       circumstances provision being the means  through  which  we  consider
       Article 8. Section 117C makes it clear, and this is  accepted  by  Ms
       Harrington in her skeleton argument, that to succeed  in  his  appeal
       the Appellant needs to demonstrate very compelling circumstances over
       and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.


   22. Against this background we turn to  the  Appellant's  situation.  His
       criminality has been referred to above.  It  is  serious  criminality
       that resulted in a prison sentence of 5 years. The starting point  in
       considering the public interest question is that the public  interest
       requires his deportation unless very  compelling  circumstances  over
       and above Exceptions 1 and 2 apply. Exception 1 does not apply; there
       is no suggestion that the Appellant has been lawfully resident in the
       United Kingdom for most of his life. The first part  of  Exception  2
       does not apply. The Appellant does not have  a  relationship  with  a
       qualifying partner his marriage having broken down. The  second  part
       of Exception 2 has potential application because  the  Appellant  has
       two qualifying children,  'NJ'  and  'CJ'.  We  therefore  go  on  to
       consider whether the effect of his deportation  on  one  or  both  of
       those children would be unduly harsh to that child.


   23.  In  examining  the  children's  situation  there  is  no  chronology
       detailing significant dates so it is necessary to look at the various
       letters and statements. All of the Appellant's children were born  in
       the United Kingdom in the period from 1994 to  2000  and  the  family
       lived together in the United Kingdom during this  period  apart  from
       about 6 months sometime after the birth of 'NJ'  when  the  Appellant
       was working in the United States. The family left the United  Kingdom
       to live in Costa Rica in September  2004  and  remained  there  until
       December 2006 (Appellant's  wife's  letter  of  10  July  2013).  The
       longest period of settled family life with all four children  appears
       to have been in Australia between December 2006  and  September  2010
       when the Appellant's wife returned to  the  United  Kingdom  for  her
       sister's wedding but was arrested on arrival. Thereafter the children
       lived in Australia with the Appellant until November 2011  when  they
       returned to the United Kingdom. The eldest  child  'OJ'  remained  in
       Australia where she was studying. The Appellant was  extradited  from
       Australia to the United Kingdom in March 2012. The  younger  children
       appear to have lived with their  mother  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
       relative stability since November 2011. 'OJ' returned to  the  United
       Kingdom in November 2012.  The Appellant lived  separately  from  the
       children from November 2011 until his release on bail after  the  end
       of his custodial sentence in May 2014.


   24. What is abundantly clear is that the main cause of disruption to  the
       children's lives has been due to the choices made by  their  parents.
       Firstly in leaving the United Kingdom to set up home in  Costa  Rica.
       Secondly by leaving Costa Rica to set up home in  Australia.  Thirdly
       and most fundamentally by engaging  in  premeditated  and  continuing
       joint and  serious  criminal  activity.  We  have  no  hesitation  in
       concluding that their criminal activity was premeditated  because  it
       involved firstly the obtaining of  insurance  and  pension  policies,
       secondly the faking of the Appellant's death and the documentation to
       establish that death and thirdly the making  of  claims  under  those
       policies. We are satisfied that it was joint not  only  because  both
       parents were separately convicted by the same Court but also  because
       with the basis of the fraud being the Appellant's death  it  was  his
       wife who needed to make the fraudulent claims. It may well have  been
       their parents' criminality that helped  the  family  establish  their
       settled  family  home  in  Australia  and  it   was   certainly   the
       consequences of that criminality that blew apart that settled  period
       of their lives. The eldest child 'OJ' speaks with clear nostalgia for
       this period no doubt failing to understand that  the  basis  of  this
       period was her parents' criminality. Indeed it is  difficult  not  to
       agree with Mr Richards' submission that the children's problems  stem
       from having criminals as parents.


   25. So far as the two minor children are concerned we have carefully read
       both of their letters and have heard oral evidence from 'NJ'.  It  is
       impossible not to be moved by this evidence and we have no doubt that
       both children are devoted to their father and that they have  already
       been deeply traumatised by their parents' imprisonment and  the  loss
       of their home in Australia. This trauma is the direct effect of their
       parents' criminality. We have considered  the  effect  on  these  two
       children of their father's deportation and have no  doubt  that  this
       will come as a further blow to both children. In this respect we have
       considered the letters from Julie Fitzhenry concerning both 'NJ'  and
       'CJ' and the letter from Jennie Hamilton  concerning  'NJ'.  We  have
       also taken particular note of 'NJs' overdose. There  is  no  separate
       mental health assessment concerning either child. The  oral  evidence
       suggests that both, 'NJ' in particular, are causing less concern than
       they were a year ago although this may well be because the  Appellant
       has been at home with them since his release on bail in May.


   26. The absence of  professional  mental  health  assessments  inevitably
       means  that  a  consideration  of  the  effect  of  the   Appellant's
       deportation upon his children has to be, at  least  to  some  extent,
       speculative. The children's vulnerability appears to have a number of
       sources. These sources start with the movement of the family from the
       United Kingdom to Costa Rica ('OJ' refers in  her  statement  to  the
       difficulties caused in moving to a  different  school,  language  and
       culture);  they  continue  with  the  move  to  Australia;  they  are
       compounded by the sudden absence of their mother; they are compounded
       further by the detention of their father in Australia; added  to  all
       this is the loss of the home in Australia, the  move  to  the  United
       Kingdom and the re-establishment of their family here. For  the  last
       three years the children have had a settled home  with  their  mother
       and the intention, their parents' relationship having broken down, is
       that for the remainder of their childhood  they  will  remain  living
       with their mother and have  liberal  access  to  the  Appellant.  The
       current situation, the Appellant living with them in the family home,
       is intended to be temporary in any event.


   27. In our judgement the effect of the  Appellant's  deportation  on  the
       children would not be  unduly  harsh.  The  Appellant  is  a  foreign
       criminal who returned to the United Kingdom  subject  to  extradition
       proceedings to face the consequences of his crime and his deportation
       at the end of his criminal sentence is the final part of the process.
       There is no doubt that the consequences of their parents' criminality
       have already been harsh so far as the children are concerned  but  it
       is difficult to single out the final stage of those  consequences  as
       being unduly harsh. The elder children are no longer minors; both are
       living away from the family home  as  expected  when  children  reach
       adulthood. The younger children are now aged 16 and 14 and are moving
       towards adulthood. They are of an age where they understand  what  is
       happening and why it is happening and will be able to make their  own
       choices  about  their  communication  with  their  father  after  his
       deportation and will, if they wish, be able to travel to  visit  him.
       Deportation does not mean that the children will  lose  contact  with
       their father. Their contact with him has been limited by  the  events
       of the past 4 years and his deportation is  a  continuation  of  that
       limitation following from the lawful consequences of his own actions.




   28. In our judgement the Appellant does not fall within Exceptions 1 or 2
       and it must therefore follow that we do not consider there to be very
       compelling circumstances over and above the  circumstances  described
       in those exceptions. Ms  Harrington  submits  (paragraph  10  of  her
       skeleton) that this requirement should  be  interpreted  consistently
       with the Strasbourg jurisprudence and in doing so does  not  seek  to
       identify  any  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  the
       deportation having an unduly harsh effect on  the  Appellant's  minor
       children. The Respondent's guidance  does  indeed  suggest  that  all
       relevant  factors  should  be   taken   into   account   (Immigration
       Directorate Instructions -  Chapter  13  -  criminality  guidance  in
       Article 8  ECHR cases - Version 5.0 - 28 July 2014)


          6.6 When considering whether or  not  there  are  very  compelling
          circumstances decision-makers must consider all  relevant  factors
          that the foreign criminal raises.  Examples  of  relevant  factors
          include
          ( the best interests of any children who will be affected  by  the
          foreign criminal's deportation;
          ( the nationalities and immigration status of the foreign criminal
          and his family members;
          ( the nature and strength of the foreign criminal's  relationships
          with family members;
          ( the  seriousness  of  the  difficulties  (if  any)  the  foreign
          criminal's partner and/or child would be likely  to  face  in  the
          country to which the foreign criminal is to be deported;
          (  the  European  Court  of  Justice  judgment  in  Ruiz  Zambrano
          (European citizenship) [2011] EUECJ C-34/09;
          ( how long the foreign criminal has  lived  in  the  UK,  and  the
          strength of his social, cultural and family ties to the UK;
          ( the strength of the foreign criminal's ties to  the  country  to
          which he will be  deported  and  his  ability  to  integrate  into
          society there;
          ( whether there are any factors which might  increase  the  public
          interest in deportation - see section 2.3;
          ( cumulative factors, e.g. where the foreign criminal  has  family
          members in the UK but his family life does not provide a basis for
          stay and he has a significant private life  in  the  UK.  Although
          under the rules  family  life  and  private  life  are  considered
          separately, when considering whether  there  are  very  compelling
          circumstances, both private and family life  must  be  taken  into
          account


       The guidance does however make it clear that  the  more  serious  the
       offence the greater the  public  interest  in  deportation  and  that
       previous use of deception to obtain leave to  remain  is  capable  of
       adding weight to the public interest  (paragraph  2.3).  Further  the
       impact of deportation on a partner or child can be harsh,  even  very
       harsh, without being unduly harsh, depending on  the  extent  of  the
       public interest in  deportation  and  of  the  family  life  affected
       (paragraph 2.5). Further


          6.6  A  foreign  criminal  sentenced  to  at  least  four   years'
          imprisonment must be able to show that there are  very  compelling
          circumstances over and above the circumstances  described  in  the
          exceptions  to  deportation.  This  is  because   Parliament   has
          expressly  excluded  those  sentenced  to  at  least  four  years'
          imprisonment from the exceptions to deportation.  Missing  out  on
          the exceptions by a small margin, or a series of near misses taken
          cumulatively, will not itself be compelling enough to outweigh the
          public interest in deportation. The best interests of any child in
          the UK who will be affected by the decision are a,  but  not  the,
          primary consideration and must be not only  compelling,  but  very
          compelling, to outweigh the public interest.


   29. In balancing the Appellant's family life with his  children  and  his
       private life in the United Kingdom against  the  public  interest  in
       deportation it is almost beyond peradventure that the best  interests
       of the Appellant's minor children are for the Appellant to be allowed
       to remain in the United Kingdom. There  is  no  suggestion  that  the
       children will leave the country to live with the  Appellant.  However
       it is also in the best interests of the children to live  with  their
       mother who is their primary carer and has held this role for the last
       three years. Their mother's statement makes it very clear  that  this
       role will be maintained whether or not the Appellant remains  in  the
       country.


   30. In assessing the various factors put forward by Ms Harrington in  her
       skeleton the Appellant has committed a serious offence and whereas it
       was one of dishonesty rather than violence, drugs or an offence of  a
       sexual nature it was in our view, and in the view of the Trial Judge,
       at the very serious end of the dishonesty scale. Further this  is  an
       Appellant who used a false identity to  not  only  obtain  indefinite
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom  but  also  to  obtain  British
       nationality. The Appellant resided in the United Kingdom from 1992 to
       2004 but he did so unlawfully because  the  basis  of  his  stay  was
       through the adoption of a false identity. He has been residing in the
       community since May 2014  without  committing  further  offences  and
       remains subject to licence conditions and the risk of re-offending is
       low. However the Appellant is  only  living  in  the  United  Kingdom
       because he was subject to extradition proceedings to this country  to
       stand trial. Up to that point he had settled and  made  his  home  by
       choice in Australia. The Appellant does not, and has never  had,  any
       lawful status in the United Kingdom. His relationship with  his  wife
       has broken down so, even  without  his  previous  deception  and  his
       criminality, he would have no  basis  for  remaining  in  the  United
       Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration Rules.


   31.  Taking all of the above into account it is our finding  that  public
       interest in deportation far outweighs the  family  and  private  life
       that the Appellant has established in the United  Kingdom.  For  this
       reason this appeal is dismissed.


Conclusion

   32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the  making  of  an
       error of law and has been set aside.


   33. We remake the decision. This appeal is dismissed by virtue of Article
       8 ECHR.
