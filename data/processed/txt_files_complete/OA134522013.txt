Representation

For the Appellant:     Ms L Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Murtaza Kesaria, sponsor

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer  to  the  appellant  as  the
      entry clearance officer and the respondent as the claimant.


   2. The claimant is an Indian national, born on 20th May 1980. Her  appeal
      against the refusal by the entry clearance  officer  dated  20th  June
      2013 refusing her application for an entry clearance to settle in  the
      UK as a spouse was allowed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bell  in  a
      determination promulgated on 11th April 2014.


   3. The Judge concluded that there was a  valid  reason  why  a  specified
      document could not be supplied. The claimant  had  not  been  able  to
      provide  payslips  for  January  and  February  2013  although   still
      employed. He had a reasonable explanation for this, namely that he was
      on holiday and had already been paid  holiday  pay  that  was  due  in
      advance. He had provided evidence of his income from employment as and
      from April 2012. The evidence taken as a whole showed an annual income
      "well in excess of the required threshold."


   4. This was an appropriate case for  discretion  to  be  exercised  under
      paragraph D (e) of Appendix FM-SE. 7.  The Judge  concluded  that  the
      entry  clearance  officer  should  have   exercised   the   discretion
      differently and in the claimant's favour.


   5. On 11th July 2014, Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane granted  the  entry
      clearance officer permission to appeal on the basis that the Judge had
      arguably failed to  give  legally  adequate  reasons;  had  misapplied
      paragraph D (e) and had not had regard to the relevant date.


   6. Ms Kenny relied on the grounds of appeal. The claimant had  failed  to
      provide the requisite documentation for the  relevant  period  despite
      being afforded the opportunity to submit such documents.


   7. Having noted that there  was  nothing  to  show  that  the  claimant's
      sponsor had taken  up  any  further  assignments  with  his  "umbrella
      company" the Judge still went on to find that he remained employed  by
      them. In  the  absence  of  further  documentation  showing  continued
      employment or evidence of further  assignments,  those  findings  were
      "inadequately reasoned."


   8. With regard to the discretion provided under Appendix FM-SE, paragraph
      D(e) she submitted that this is not a case that the claimant could not
      provide the documents because it was not  issued  or  because  it  was
      permanently  lost,  but  rather  that  he  was  on  holiday.  He   had
      subsequently failed to produce this documentation even at  the  appeal
      hearing. Accordingly, he had simply failed to  provide  the  available
      documentation and this was not a case  where  discretion  should  have
      been exercised.


   9. Nor had the Tribunal had appropriate regard to the relevant  date  and
      in particular it has not addressed the  evidence  from  prior  to  8th
      March 2013, which was the date of application. Accordingly, it was not
      clear what the sponsor's actual gross annual income was at the date of
      application. He needed to show employment for the six months from  7th
      September 2012 until 8th March 2013. Under Appendix FM,  the  claimant
      must meet all the financial requirements  set  out  in  E-ECP.3.1  and
      provide the relevant specified evidence from the sources listed.


  10. The Judge found that the sponsor submitted either with the application
      or in response to requests for  further  information  from  the  entry
      clearance officer, payslips and bank statements from 5th October  2012
      until 28th December 2012 with bank statements going up to 5th  January
      2013. He did not appear to  have  submitted  any  bank  statements  or
      payslips for  the  period  following  this.  Accordingly  he  had  not
      submitted payslips and bank statements which are dated within 28  days
      of the date of application.


  11. The Judge had regard to the sponsor's application. He was on  a  seven
      week holiday at the  time  that  his  application  was  submitted.  He
      claimed to have received holiday pay in advance but  did  not  receive
      payslips during the seven week period. He contended that he was  still
      employed and relied on an email from Parasol.


  12. That email, which Ms Kenny accepted had been  properly  summarised  by
      the Judge at paragraph  18  of  the  determination,  stated  that  the
      claimant was considered to be on holiday for  seven  weeks  from  28th
      January 2013 and, as he had already been paid for the holiday,  or  it
      was part of his unpaid entitlement, he would not actually receive  any
      pay whilst away. It goes on to state that if he had decided  to  leave
      Parasol he needed to tell them that he wanted to resign and  give  the
      relevant notice.


  13. It was asserted in his grounds of appeal that based  on  the  payments
      between 5th October 2012 and 28th December 2012, including his holiday
      pay, the sponsor's income amounted to �9414.79, which he  asserts  was
      equivalent to a yearly income in  excess  of  �18,939.  Moreover,  his
      actual income in the previous 12 months had  been  far  in  excess  of
      this.


  14. There was also a letter dated 17th December 2012 from Parasol  setting
      out his pay from 20th April 2012 until 14th December 2012 amounting to
      �28,204.34. He asserted that this was  his  annual  income  from  this
      employment for the 12 months leading up to his application.


  15. The Judge found that although there was nothing  before  him  to  show
      that he took up any further assignments with Parasol after  the  seven
      week holiday, he  was  nevertheless  satisfied  from  the  email  from
      Parasol that he was considered to be on holiday and still employed  in
      the third week in March, and  was  therefore  satisfied  that  he  had
      remained employed by Parasol at the date of  application.  His  income
      from that employment covering  the  six  month  period  prior  to  the
      application being made, exceeded the financial threshold required.


  16. The Judge, as already indicated, had  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
      sponsor could not submit payslips for January and February 2013 as  he
      was on holiday and the  email  from  Parasol  confirmed  that  he  had
      already been paid holiday pay due in advance. Although he  could  have
      submitted further bank statements, these  would  not  have  shown  any
      additional salary deposits.


  17. The Judge had regard to Appendix FM-SE D(e) which was in force at  the
      relevant time, namely from 13th  December  2012.  That  provides  that
      where the decision maker is satisfied that there is a valid reason why
      a specified document cannot be supplied, e.g. because it is not issued
      in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he may  exercise
      discretion not to apply the requirement for the document or to request
      alternative or additional information or document(s)  be  supplied  by
      the applicant - HC760 13.12.2012.


  18. The Judge found there was a reasonable explanation, namely that he was
      on holiday for the seven week period and had been paid his holiday pay
      due in advance.


  19. On behalf of the claimant, the sponsor relied on  written  submissions
      that had been prepared for him by counsel, Mr Z Jafferji.


  20. The only issue raised by the entry clearance officer  in  the  refusal
      was that the claimant  had  not  demonstrated  that  her  sponsor  had
      continued to be employed between 28th  December  2012  and  8th  March
      2013. She had not submitted payslips for the period  in  question  and
      had failed to provide evidence that her sponsor had been  employed  as
      claimed with Parasol for the period requested.


  21. It was submitted that the exercise of  discretion  by  the  Judge  was
      "impeccable". She had focused on the shortcomings  in  the  claimant's
      evidence.  She  provided  reasons  why  they  were  not  substantially
      relevant and concluded that the failure was excusable,  having  regard
      to the claimant's "reasonable explanation."  Although  not  making  an
      express finding that the sponsor remained  employed  by  Parasol,  she
      found that he was employed at the date of  application  as  there  was
      evidence from Parasol that he was on leave  from  employment  at  that
      time.


  22. Moreover, she  focused  on  the  correct  date,  namely  the  date  of
      application. That was evident from her reasoning where she found  that
      the sponsor was employed at 8th March 2013.


     Assessment


  23. The entry clearance application was refused  on  the  basis  that  the
      sponsor had not shown that he had been in continued employment for the
      six months prior to the  date  that  the  application  was  submitted,
      namely 8th March 2013. The last date of employment  shown  by  way  of
      documentation was 28th December 2012. There were no payslips  for  the
      period after this, up to the date of application. He had  subsequently
      failed to provide the necessary documents that he had been employed as
      claimed with Parasol for the period requested.


  24. Accordingly, the issue raised by the entry clearance officer was  that
      the claimant had not demonstrated that her sponsor had continued to be
      employed between 28th December 2012 and 8th March 2013. He had  failed
      to submit payslips for the period in question showing that he had been
      employed as claimed.


  25. The First-tier Tribunal Judge had regard to the email submitted by the
      claimant on  17th  June  2013  in  response  to  the  entry  clearance
      officer's request for further evidence. That email from her  sponsor's
      employer was dated 25th January 2013. It stated that the sponsor would
      be on holiday from 28th January 2013 for seven weeks. It  also  stated
      that the sponsor would not receive any pay during this  period  as  he
      had either already been paid, or the holiday was part  of  his  unpaid
      employment.


  26. The seven week holiday period ended on 17th March  2013.  That  period
      included the date of the application, namely 8th March 2013.


  27. Judge Bell accepted the evidence from the claimant that  he  had  been
      employed on the date of application. The Judge  was  well  aware  that
      there were no missing payslips as the sponsor had not been issued with
      any payslips for the period that he was on holiday.


  28. From  the  email,  the  Judge  was  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  was
      considered to be on holiday and was still employed in the  third  week
      in March and was therefore satisfied  that  he  remained  employed  by
      Parasol at the date of application.


  29. Judge Bell also was alive to the entry clearance  officer's  assertion
      that the claimant  had  not  met  the  evidential  requirements  under
      Appendix FM-SE  but  considered  whether  the  discretion  granted  in
      paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-SE should be exercised in her favour.


  30. At paragraph 25 of the determination, she found that this was  a  case
      where it was appropriate for the discretion provided in the  rules  to
      have been exercised. The claimant had not been  able  to  provide  her
      sponsor's payslips for January and  February  2013,  although  he  was
      still employed. He had provided a  reasonable  explanation  for  that,
      namely that he was on holiday and had been paid holiday  pay  due,  in
      advance. He had provided evidence of his income from employment  going
      back to April 2012. The evidence taken as a  whole  showed  an  annual
      income well in excess of  the  required  threshold.  Accordingly,  she
      concluded that the entry clearance officer should have  exercised  the
      discretion contained in the rules differently and  in  the  claimant's
      favour.


  31. In exercising that discretion, Judge Bell focused on the  shortcomings
      in  the  claimant's  evidence.  She  explained  why  they   were   not
      substantially relevant and why in the circumstances the  omission  was
      excusable.


  32. In arriving at her conclusions  judge  Bell  has  taken  into  account
      relevant matters and has not had regard to any irrelevant  factors.  I
      accordingly find that  her  discretion  was  properly  and  rationally
      exercised.


  33. Moreover, I find that paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-SE does  not  seek
      to restrict the exercise of discretion to cases where  documents  have
      not been issued, or have been permanently lost. These, as submitted on
      behalf of the claimant, are simply  examples. I accordingly find  that
      ground 3 of the entry clearance  officer's  challenge  amounts  to  an
      unwarranted and restrictive application to the rule.


  34. I have also had regard  to  the  actual  payslips  relied  on  by  the
      claimant and referred to by Judge Bell.   The  Parasol  payslips  that
      were produced before the First-tier Tribunal show that holiday pay was
      made in advance. This resulted in earnings for the particular month in
      excess of the number of hours worked. The holiday  pay  is  calculated
      with regard to the basic pay.


  35. I also find that Judge Bell focused on the  correct  date  in  finding
      that  the  sponsor  was  employed  on  8th  March  2013.   There   was
      accordingly a  proper  basis  for  the  finding  that  the  claimant's
      sponsor's  gross  annual  income  exceeded  the  requisite  amount  of
      �18,600.


     Decision


The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not  involve  the
making of any error of law. The determination shall therefore stand.
