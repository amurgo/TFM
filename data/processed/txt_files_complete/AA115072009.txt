Representation:

For the Appellant: Mrs Chaggar instructed by Coventry Law Centre
For the Respondent: Mr Mills - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant is an Iraqi citizen born  in  1990.  He  entered  the
        United Kingdom in 2007 and claimed asylum. The claim  was  rejected
        by the Secretary of State who issued removal directions dated  22nd
        September 2009. The Appellant's appeal against  that  decision  was
        heard by Immigration Judge Rose sitting at Walsall on 28th  October
        2009.


     2. The Appellant told Judge  Rose  that  the  reason  he  was  seeking
        international protection was  as  a  result  of  an  incident  that
        occurred in August 2007. The Appellant stated that he worked  in  a
        teahouse and noticed that people would come into this teahouse  and
        exchange carrier bags. One night two people came to them  and  said
        they were leaving bags with the Appellant and  his  brother  to  be
        collected. They refused but were told they will be killed  if  they
        did not help. As a result the Appellant and  his  brother  made  an
        appointment for the individuals to return to discuss the matter the
        following night. They reported the matter to the  police  and  when
        those individuals returned they were arrested. The following  night
        two other individuals came to the teahouse. One had a gun and  shot
        the Appellant's brother although the Appellant himself was able  to
        escape. He called his uncle who  took  the  Appellant  to  his  own
        house. When the funeral  of  his  brother  took  place  the  family
        noticed people asking about him, as a result of  which,  his  uncle
        told him that he must not stay in the country.   Arrangements  were
        made to bring him to the United Kingdom.


     3. The Appellant claims that if returned to Iraq he will be killed  by
        the terrorist  group  to  which  his  attackers  belonged  who  had
        influence in the whole of Iraq.


     4. Judge Rose's  findings  are  set  out  from  paragraph  10  of  the
        determination, which include a finding that although  some  aspects
        of the Appellant's account appear improbable some  credence  should
        be attached to his evidence and that the risk upon return was to be
        assessed on that basis [23]. Judge Rose  found  that  although  the
        attacks occurred as a direct consequence  of  the  actions  of  the
        Appellant and his brother which led to the arrest of two members of
        the group, it was found implicit in his account  that  his  actions
        were likely to be  regarded  as  an  indication  of  his  political
        opinion and that if the account the Appellant has given  of  events
        that caused him to  leave  Iraq  is  correct  there  is  a  serious
        possibility that he will face persecution by members of  the  group
        if he were now to return to Kirkuk [28].


     5. At paragraph 33 Judge Rose specifically sets out a finding that the
        Appellant has established that if he were now to return to his home
        area there will be a real risk that he will suffer  persecution  or
        serious harm although the Judge also found there  was  an  internal
        flight option available and on that basis dismissed the appeal.


     6. The determination was challenged  and  reconsideration  ordered  by
        former Senior Immigration Judge Jarvis on 26th November 2009.   The
        case was remitted and came before Designated Judge McCarthy sitting
        in Birmingham on 23rd February 2010.  Judge McCarthy  records  that
        he was satisfied that in paragraph 32 of  his  determination  Judge
        Rose relied on an approach and analysis taken by the Tribunal in KH
        (Iraq) which were found to be conclusions  legally  flawed  in  the
        later case of QD (Iraq), a judgment handed down some months  before
        Judge Rose heard the appeal. As a result it was  found  Judge  Rose
        erred on a point of law.


     7. Designated Judge McCarthy  proceeded  to  remake  the  decision  by
        considering the internal relocation option and, having analysed the
        material made available to him, concluded that although Judge  Rose
        had made an error on a point of law it was not necessary to set the
        decision aside as  Judge  McCarthy  came  to  the  same  conclusion
        regarding the  availability  of  internal  relocation,  albeit  for
        different reasons.


     8. Application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against
        the findings of Designated Judge  McCarthy  was  refused  by  Upper
        Tribunal Judge Dr Kekic and again  by  the  Right  Honourable  Lady
        Justice Hallett, on the papers, on 13th July 2010. The  application
        was, however, renewed to the Court of Appeal and following an  oral
        hearing at which  the  Appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  Michael
        Fordham QC and Jessica Boyd, Lord Justice Ward granted permission.


     9. By an order  dated  28th  March  2011  Lord  Justice  Sullivan,  by
        consent, ordered that the appeal be allowed and the  case  remitted
        to the Upper Tribunal to determine  where  in  Iraq  the  Appellant
        could internally relocate  to  without  undue  hardship  given  the
        specific findings of fact in his case and taking into consideration
        the country guidance case of HM and others [2010] UKUT 331.


    10. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the statement  of  reasons  attached  to  the
        consent order are in the following terms:


              5.   It is accepted that the Appellant and  his  brother  were
             attacked in        August 2007 by former members of the  Ba'ath
             party,  that  his  brother          was  killed  and  that  the
             Appellant would be at risk in Kirkuk from         other members
             of  that  organisation  as  he  and  his   brother   had   been
             responsible for the arrest of two of the members of the  group.
             The       Appellant faces a real risk of persecution in Kirkuk,
             his home area,         and therefore cannot return  to  Kirkuk.
             Further, it was agreed before        IJ rose that the Appellant
             could not be expected to relocate to the          KRG area. The
             Appellant's  father  had  been   a   member   of   the   Ba'ath
             party and had carried out atrocities against Kurds up  to  1991
             when      he was killed by Kurdish people.


              6.   In the specific circumstances of this case as outlined in
             paragraph 5        above, the Respondent agrees  that  the  AIT
             materially erred in law by      failing  to  properly  consider
             where  in  Iraq  the  Appellant   could              internally
             relocate to  without  undue  hardship.  This  is  because  this
             case  does  not  concern  whether  the  Appellant  would   face
              indiscriminate violence which was  the  test  applied  by  the
             court in      respect of the appellants in HM , RM  ,  ASA,  AA
             (Iraq) v SSHD [2010]        UKUT  331.   Rather  this  case  is
             premised on the fact that this            particular  Appellant
             faces   very   particular   risks   as   a   result   of    the
             circumstances surrounding the deaths of his brother and father.




    11. It was established at an earlier hearing before the Upper  Tribunal
        that the Secretary of State was not making a  concession  that  the
        Appellant could not relocate to the  KRG  which  resulted  in  that
        hearing having to be adjourned as the  full  scope  of  the  issues
        under consideration had not previously been communicated adequately
        to both advocates.


    12. It is accepted by both Mr Mills and Mrs Chaggar that the issue  was
        one of the reasonableness of internal relocation.




Submissions



    13. On behalf of the Appellant it was submitted that he was  unable  to
        rely upon any protection from the  authorities  and  that  internal
        relocation is not an option for him  as  he  believes  he  will  be
        targeted by members of the former Ba'ath party.


    14. It is also submitted that the Appellant does  not  have  family  on
        whom he could rely to help him relocate and that he was  likely  to
        face economic destitution or an existence of  at  least  inadequate
        levels  of  subsistence.  Mrs  Chaggar  placed  reliance  upon  the
        decision of the House of Lords in Januzi v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5.


    15. In relation to the KRG Mrs Chaggar referred  the  Tribunal  to  the
        UNHCR  eligibility  guidelines  in  which  it  is  said  that  they
        generally consider that internal  relocation  in  the  KRG  is  not
        relevant to many Iraqis due to accessibility issues,  such  as  the
        ability to access a livelihood, affordable housing,  education  and
        food through the public distribution system. It is  also  submitted
        that the fact the Appellant's late father tortured  Kurdish  people
        through his membership of the  Ba'ath  party  may  be  relevant  to
        relocation to the Kurdish north.


    16. It was submitted that given the undue  hardship  the  Appellant  is
        likely to face if  returned  with  expectation  that  he  ought  to
        relocate to some other part of Iraq other than Kirkuk  there  is  a
        real possibility that he may be tempted to return  to  an  area  of
        persecution and so his appeal ought to be allowed.


    17. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Mills submitted that it  was
        reasonable to expect the Appellant to relocate if he cannot  return
        to Kirkuk.  He relies upon the case of MK (documents -  relocation)
        Iraq CG [2012]] UKUT 126, which post dates the date of the remittal
        from the Court of Appeal. The guidance in MK was of course  subject
        to challenge to the Court of Appeal as part of HS  and  others  and
        although MK has been remitted to the Tribunal to be reheard on  the
        basis of its facts, the country guidance aspects of MK were not set
        aside by the Court of Appeal.


    18. It was submitted that even if the Appellant was unable to  transfer
        his PDS card to the KRG, but felt unable to make visits  to  Kirkuk
        to receive his rations there, he would still be able  to  attain  a
        reasonable standard of living  in  the  KRG  area  by  working  and
        purchasing non-subsidised food locally and would also  be  able  to
        access support  provided  by  the  UNHCR  to  internally  displaced
        people.


    19. Mr Mills also submitted  that  evidence  considered  by  the  Upper
        Tribunal in the later  reported  determination  of  HM  and  others
        (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409 (IAC), at paragraphs  151
        to 152, noted there were difficulties in having the  PDS  card  and
        its associated entitlement to food rations transferred to  the  KRG
        area, not that it was impossible and that such  uncertainty  counts
        against a finding that it would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
        appellant to relocate to the KRG area.


    20. In the alternative Mr Mills submitted that as the preserved finding
        is that the Appellant had shown a real risk of  persecution  if  he
        returned to live in Kirkuk this did not necessarily acquaint  to  a
        real risk of harm if he made short visits to the city in  order  to
        collect food as the risk to him relates to events  in  August  2007
        and it was considered the likelihood  he  will  be  recognised  and
        targeted in 2014 in a city of some 500,000  to  700,000  people  is
        sufficiently slight that it cannot be said to render relocation  to
        the KRG area unreasonable.


    21. Mr Mills also submitted that even if the Appellant  was  unable  to
        relocate to the Kurdish north he has the option  of  relocating  to
        other parts of Central and Southern Iraq and that it would  not  be
        unduly harsh to expect him to do so to avoid harm  in  Kirkuk.   Mr
        Mills relies upon  the  country  guidance  case  law  including  SI
        (expert evidence, Kurd, SM confirmed) CG [2008] UKAIT 00094 as well
        as the more recent cases of MK, HM2 and HF in support.



Discussion



    22. In  relation  to  the  Immigration  Rules/Qualification  Directive;
        paragraph 339O of the Rules, which is intended to  incorporate  the
        Directive, states:

          (i)      The Secretary of State will not make:
              (a)  a grant of asylum if in part of the country of  origin  a
      person would              not  have  a  well  founded  fear  of  being
      persecuted, and the person can              reasonably be expected  to
      stay in that part of the country; or
              (b)  a grant of humanitarian protection  if  in  part  of  the
      country of return             a person would not face a real  risk  of
      suffering serious harm, and the             person can  reasonably  be
      expected to stay in that part of the country.
          (ii)     In examining whether a part of the country of  origin  or
      country of return         meets the requirements in (i) the  Secretary
      of State, when making his              decision on  whether  to  grant
      asylum or humanitarian protection, will  have          regard  to  the
      general  circumstances  prevailing  in  that  part  of   the   country
      and to the personal circumstances of the person.
          (iii)    (i) applies notwithstanding technical obstacles to return
      to the country of         origin or country of return.


    23. Judge Rose found in paragraph 32  of  his  determination  that  the
        Appellant is Kurdish, has no health issues, and is a young man only
        having been born in 1987. Judge Rose also records in  paragraph  27
        that the Appellant's evidence was that he had been in contact  with
        his uncle in order to obtain documents and that he did not indicate
        that he had since been unable  to  make  contact  with  him  again.
        Although Judge Rose  accepted  the  Appellant's  mother  has  since
        passed away there is no evidence the Appellant is not able to  make
        contact with his uncle and no evidence to show that family  support
        would not be available if he was required to  re-establish  himself
        in another part of Iraq, although the availability or lack of  such
        support is not determinative of the issue.


    24. Mrs Chaggar relies upon the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines but in  HF
        (Iraq) and others v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1276  the   Claimant   failed   asylum   seekers
        unsuccessfully  challenged  the  most   recent   country   guidance
        decisions relating to Iraq. The Court  rejected  an  argument  that
        there was justification  for  conferring  a  presumptively  binding
        status on UNHCR reports merely because of their source.  The  Court
        had to assess all the evidence affording such weight  to  different
        pieces of evidence as it saw fit.


    25. Although not mentioned  by  either  party  I  have  considered  the
        decision in M  A-H  (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2013] EWCA Civ 445 in which the Court of Appeal  upheld
        a First-tier Tribunal decision that an appellant who was the son of
        a former member of the Baath party and who was targeted by  members
        of a militia lead by Iraqi MP, Al-Daini would be  at  risk  in  the
        KRG. The Court of Appeal held that HM and  others  (Article  15(c))
        Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331 (IAC) did not address the issue of  whether
        relocation provided  security  for  an  individual  targeted  by  a
        specific terrorist group (paras 22 - 23).


    26. The Appellant does not claim he has been targeted by militia led by
        a prominent Iraqi politician but it  was  submitted  that  internal
        relocation to the Kurdish zone will be problematic if  the  actions
        of his father were discovered.


    27. There is no merit in a claim the Appellant can return as  a  result
        of risk associated with country conditions  in  general  and  there
        have been a number of recent cases decided by the  European  Courts
        that have considered this issue: In BKA v Sweden  (Application  no.
        11161/11) ECtHR (Fifth Section) (December 2013), it was  held  that
        although the Applicant would face a real risk of being subjected to
        treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR if returned to  Baghdad
        or Diyala, the Court found  that  he  could  reasonably  settle  in
        another governorate, for instance, the Anbar governorate, where  it
        had not been shown that he would face  such  a  risk.  Neither  the
        general situation in that governorate nor any  of  the  Applicant's
        personal circumstances indicated the existence of said risk. In  TA
        v Sweden (Application  no.  48866/10)  ECtHR  (Fifth  Section),  19
        December 2013 it was held that there was insufficient  evidence  to
        conclude that the  Applicant  would  face  a  real  risk  of  being
        subjected to treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of the ECHR  upon
        return to Iraq. In TKH v Sweden  (Application  no.  1231/11)  ECtHR
        (Fifth Section), 19 December 2013 it was held  that  the  Applicant
        would not face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary
        to Article 2 or 3 of the ECHR upon return to  Iraq.  Moreover,  his
        health status was not of such a serious nature that his deportation
        would give rise to a breach of those provisions.


    28. Mr Mills specifically referred me to the case of  MK  (documents  -
        relocation) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00126 (IAC) in which  the  Tribunal
        held that despite bureaucratic difficulties with  registration  and
        the difficulties faced by IDPs, it is wrong to say that  there  is,
        in general, no internal flight alternative in Iraq, bearing in mind
        in particular the levels of governmental and NGO support available.
        In HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq  CG  [2012]  UKUT  00409(IAC)
        (October 2012) the Tribunal decided that further evidence that  has
        become available since the Tribunal heard MK  does not warrant  any
        departure from its conclusions on internal relocation  alternatives
        in the KRG or in central or southern Iraq save that the evidence is
        now sufficient to establish the  existence  of  a  Central  Archive
        maintained  by  the  Iraqi  authorities  retaining  civil  identity
        records on microfiche, which provides a  further  way  in  which  a
        person can identify themselves and obtain a  copy  of  their  CSID,
        whether from abroad or within Iraq.


    29. The availability of an internal flight option was also confirmed in
        SI (expert evidence - Kurd - SM confirmed)  Iraq  CG  (2008)  UKAIT
        00094 in which the Tribunal confirmed the guidance given in SM  and
        Others (Kurds-Protection-Relocation) Iraq  CG  (2005)  UKAIT  00111
        that relocation of a Kurd from the KRG to central or southern  Iraq
        could in general be effected without this being  unduly  harsh  and
        without giving rise to a real risk "in all but the most exceptional
        high profile cases"  of  their  relocation  being  brought  to  the
        attention of any of the KRG authorities who might be interested  in
        them.  SI and SM were effectively confirmed by the Court of  Appeal
        in SH (Iraq) v SSHD (2009) EWCA Civ  462  in  which  the  Court  of
        Appeal also noted that there was a substantial  Kurdish  population
        in Baghdad.


    30. Designated Judge McCarthy noted in his  termination,  at  paragraph
        32, that in his asylum interview in  December  2007  the  Appellant
        confirmed he had received his Iraqi identity card from his uncle in
        Iraq.  This will enable him to obtain any other documentation  that
        he requires and to travel freely in Iraq.


     31. I note in MK the Tribunal held (i)   Entry into  and  residence  in
         the KRG can be effected by any Iraqi national with a CSID, INC  and
         PDS,  after  registration  with   the   Asayish   (local   security
         office).  An Arab may need a sponsor; a Kurd will not. (ii) Living
         conditions in the KRG for a person who has relocated there are  not
         without difficulties, but there are jobs, and there  is  access  to
         free health care facilities, education,  rented  accommodation  and
         financial and other support from UNHCR.


    32. It was never part of the Appellant's claim that he will be at  risk
        in all Iraq as his fear is based upon being attacked  in  his  home
        area of Kirkuk.  It has not been shown that those seeking him would
        have influence in the Kurdish  regions  and   he  has  not  adduced
        evidence to show that he will be at risk on return as a  result  of
        the activities of his father in all of Iraq. The subjective fear of
        risk from the small groups of former Ba'ath party members  it  said
        are spread throughout Iraq has not been proved  to  be  objectively
        well founded, especially as it has not been established  that  they
        will be aware of his return.


    33. Although the Immigration Rules refer to the need for the  Secretary
        of State to consider the situation that  prevails  in  a  potential
        point of relocation, in  AMM  and  others  (conflict;  humanitarian
        crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG  [2011]  UKUT  00445  (IAC) the
        Tribunal held that there is no legal burden  on  the  Secretary  of
        State to prove that there is a part of the country  of  nationality
        etc of an appellant, who has established  a  well-founded  fear  in
        their home  area,  to  which  the  appellant  could  reasonably  be
        expected to go and live. The appellant bears the  legal  burden  of
        proving entitlement to  international  protection;  but  what  that
        entails will  very  much  depend  upon  the  circumstances  of  the
        particular case. It will be for  the  appellant  to  make  good  an
        assertion that,  notwithstanding  the  general  conditions  in  the
        proposed place  of  relocation,  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
        relocate there. In an Article 3 claim, a similar position pertains,
        in that, although the test of reasonableness/undue  harshness  does
        not formally apply, unduly harsh living conditions etc - albeit not
        themselves amounting to a breach of Article 3 - may nevertheless be
        reasonably likely to lead to a person returning to their home area,
        where such a breach is reasonably likely.


    34. In GH (Iraq) CG [2004] UKIAT 00248 the Tribunal said that the UNHCR
        submission that the correct consideration of the issue of  internal
        flight required a particular area to be identified and the claimant
        to be provided with an adequate opportunity  to  respond  was  also
        unacceptable as it shifted the burden of proof to the host country.
         It was therefore an error of law to consider  internal  relocation
        by reference to the UNHCR guidelines on internal protection  of  23
        July 2003 as this did not  accord  with  UK  jurisprudence  on  the
        subject.


    35. I do not find that the Appellant has substantiated his  claim  that
        he will be at risk for the reasons stated throughout the  whole  of
        Iraq. I find he has not substantiated his claim  to  show  that  he
        does not have an internal flight option available to him to  either
        the Kurdish zone or one  of  the  other  provinces  of  Iraq.   The
        existence of such option is implicitly accepted as the  submissions
        made on behalf the Appellant are that it will not be reasonable  in
        all the circumstances to  expect  him  to  avail  himself  of  that
        option.


    36. In Januzi and others  v SSHD [2006]  UKHL  5  the  House  of  Lords
        appeared to suggest that the test was whether  an  applicant  would
        face conditions such as utter destitution or exposure to  cruel  or
        inhuman treatment, threatening his most basic human rights although
        in AH Sudan [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords said that, if the AIT
        considered that conditions in  the  place  of  intended  relocation
        could not be unreasonable or unduly harsh unless they  were  liable
        to  infringe  an  applicant's  rights  under  Article  3   or   its
        equivalent, it was plainly wrong.  Nothing  in  Januzi  or  in  the
        materials referred to in Januzi suggested such a test. No  argument
        to that effect was advanced in Januzi, because there was  no  issue
        on the point. To the extent that reference was made to Article 3 in
        Januzi it was to make clear, as might be thought  obvious,  that  a
        claimant for asylum could not reasonably or without undue  hardship
        be expected to return to a place where his rights under  Article  3
        or its equivalent might be infringed.


    37. In AH  (Sudan)  it  was  also  said  that  it  was  not  a  correct
        application of the test to only focus  on  the  comparison  between
        conditions in a claimant's  home  country  as  a  whole  and  those
        prevailing in the proposed area of relocation.  Nor was it  correct
        to only compare conditions in the place of habitual residence  from
        which a claimant had  fled  and  those  in  the  safe  haven.   The
        decision in Januzi supported both those bases of comparison and did
        not suggest that one was to be preferred: the weight to be given to
        each was a matter to be judged by the decision maker in the context
        of a particular claim.


    38. I have considered all elements relating to the general situation in
        Iraq and those applicable to the Appellant in person. I do not find
        that it has  been  established  that  the  Appellant  will  face  a
        situation  of  such  severity  that  will  prevent  him  having   a
        relatively normal life by Iraqi standards in all of  that  country.
        It has not been established that he will not be able to  enter  the
        KRG and as a Kurd he is not likely to require a sponsor or will not
        be able to obtain one if needed. It has not been  established  that
        he will not be able to avail himself of the support  that  will  be
        available from such as the UNHCR to enable him to  meet  his  basic
        needs.  It has not been established  that  he  is  unable  to  find
        gainful employment which will enable  him  to  secure  housing  and
        purchase food that he cannot acquire from other  sources.  This  is
        not a case in which it has been established that there would  be  a
        requirement to return to Kirkuk to collect rations as I accept that
        the country material does  not  state  that  it  is  impossible  to
        transfer an individual's ration card. Even though I accept that  it
        may be a difficult process it has not been shown  that  such  would
        make an expectation to relocate unreasonable.


    39. The language of the interpreter request by the Appellant is Kurdish
        (Sorani) and although there may be some parts of south  or  central
        Iraq to which a lack of Arabic may be seen as a barrier,  the  case
        law clearly identifies  the  existence  of  a  substantial  Kurdish
        population living in Baghdad. It has not  been  shown  that  it  is
        unreasonable to expect  the  Appellant  to  avail  himself  of  the
        opportunities  that  might  be  more  likely  to  assist   in   re-
        establishing himself within his own ethnic group, and  it  has  not
        been shown to be unreasonable in all the  circumstances  to  expect
        him to do so.


    40. The burden is upon the Appellant  to  substantiate  his  claim  and
        although there are a number of aspects which stand him  apart  from
        many who fail before the Tribunals, such as the acceptance  of  the
        core account of his claim to be at risk in Kirkuk, I  find  he  has
        failed to substantiate his claim that it is not reasonable  in  all
        the circumstances to expect him to avail himself  of  the  internal
        flight option, irrespective of whether his uncle is able to  assist
        or not.


    41. As there is such an option the Appellant has not substantiated  his
        claim that he is entitled to a grant  of  international  protection
        and accordingly this appeal is, again, dismissed.


Decision

    42. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.




   Anonymity.


    43. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make that  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
