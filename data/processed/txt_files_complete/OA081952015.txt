Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed of A1 Immigration Services Sheffield
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of the Dominican Republic whose date of  birth
    is 16th December 1997, appeals with permission against the decision  of
    a First-tier Tribunal (Judge Dearden) dismissing her appeal against the
    Respondent's refusal to grant her entry clearance to the United Kingdom
    as the dependent child of her mother Juliana Monegro De  Crookes  ("the
    Sponsor").

 2. The issue throughout these proceedings centres on  whether  it  can  be
    established that the Sponsor had retained sole responsibility  for  the
    Appellant.  The date of the application for entry was 4th  March  2015;
    the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision is 21st April  2015.
    By the time of the date of decision, the Appellant was 17ï¿½ years of age
    and by the time of the hearing before the FtT she had attained 18 years
    of age.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer in refusing the application considered that
    the Immigration Rules were not satisfied because;

       .  the  Sponsor  had  not  retained  sole  responsibility   for   the
         Appellant's upbringing; and;

       . there were no serious or compelling circumstances making  exclusion
         undesirable.

 4. When the appeal came before the FtT, Judge Dearden  correctly  directed
    himself that the Appellant's only avenue of appeal now  was  one  under
    Article 8 ECHR, and that any consideration under the Immigration  Rules
    was relevant only so far as any findings under the  Rules  factor  into
    the  consideration  when   conducting   the   balancing   exercise   on
    proportionality under Article 8 ECHR [8].

 5. Having found  that  the  Appellant's  Sponsor  did  not  exercise  sole
    responsibility for her daughter, Judge Dearden went on to  dismiss  the
    appeal.

Permission to Appeal

 6. Permission to appeal the FtT's decision was  granted  on  27th  October
    2016 and the relevant parts of the grant read as follows:

         "(1)   ........The FtT found that the Appellant did  not  meet  the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules for sole  responsibility
             because although Western Union receipts had been adduced, they
             did not cover the period prior to  the  ECO's  decision  dated
             21st April 2015 - a finding which  is  incorrect  because  the
             FtTJ records receiving receipts dated  February  to  September
             2015 at the hearing.

         (2)  The FtTJ has arguably erred in law by  wrongly  applying  para
             117B which relates to in-country Appellants seeking to  remain
             on private life grounds.  This is an out of country appeal and
             the FtT has therefore arguably erred by  making  an  incorrect
             finding which may have informed his decision.

         (3)  The FtTJ has also failed to consider and apply  relevant  case
             law of TD (Yemen) when considering sole responsibility."

    Thus the matter  comes  before  me  to  decide  initially  whether  the
    decision of the FtT discloses an error of law requiring it  to  be  set
    aside.

Submissions

 7. I heard submissions from both representatives.  Mr Ahmed's  submissions
    focused on saying that the judge had erred because of a failure to;

       . take into account and give weight to evidence of financial  support
         in the form of remittances sent by the Sponsor to the Appellant;

       .  properly  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the  Sponsor   was
         responsible for  giving  consent  to  her  daughter's  appendicitis
         operation;

       . properly apply the case law in TD (Yemen) [2006] UKAIT 00049

 8. Although Mr Ahmed made several other general criticisms of the  judge's
    decision, it is correct to say that  he  did  not  address  me  on  any
    arguable  error  made  by  the  judge  wrongly  applying  section  117B
    Nationality, Immigration Asylum Act 2002.

 9. Mrs Pettersen for the Respondent robustly defended the  decision.   She
    submitted that the judge had carefully set out the evidence before  him
    and had observed and noted at [17] that there was a lack  of  financial
    remittance receipts  dated  prior  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision. He noted that the Sponsor's evidence was that a large  number
    of financial receipts had been sent to the Entry Clearance Officer  and
    not returned. What was not before him however was evidence that efforts
    had been made to obtain copies of the receipts. The judge had  observed
    that  this  was  evidence  which  could  have  been  obtained  on   the
    Appellant's behalf if this evidence was necessary.  Therefore the judge
    did not have documentary evidence in the form of receipts of the number
    of remittances that it was claimed had been sent.  Although  the  judge
    accepted that some financial support had been provided, nevertheless he
    properly  directed  himself  that  financial  responsibility  does  not
    necessarily prove sole responsibility and it is clear from  [39],  that
    the judge had kept in mind the fact that financial  receipts  had  been
    submitted.  Therefore the first ground of the grant of permission  fell
    away.

10. So far as section 117B is concerned, whilst it may have been  an  error
    for the judge to have set it out, and taken account of it, nevertheless
    the judge did not materially err in his overall  consideration  of  the
    evidence.

11. So far as the criticism of the judge not having  proper  regard  to  TD
    (Yemen) is concerned, it is clear from a full reading of  the  decision
    that the judge has applied the ratio of that case and kept it in  mind.
    This is borne out when looking at [38] of the decision.

12. In short, Mrs Pettersen submitted, the grounds amount to no more than a
    disagreement with the judge's findings.  The judge had  looked  at  all
    the factors that he was obliged to look whilst  bearing  in  mind  that
    what was before him is an  Article  8  ECHR  appeal.  He  was  properly
    entitled therefore to  conclude  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    refusal would not result in a disproportionate  interference  with  the
    Appellant's Article 8  ECHR  rights  nor  those  of  the  Sponsor.  The
    decision was sustainable.

Consideration

13. Dealing firstly with the section 117B point, I find that I  agree  with
    Mrs Pettersen's submission that nothing turns on  this  point.   It  is
    correct that the judge erred by directing himself to matters which were
    in effect ones he had  no  need  to  consider  when  dealing  with  the
    question before him. However it is clear that the judge  kept  in  mind
    the central issue which was before him.   The  central  thrust  of  the
    Appellant's appeal is that the judge had erred  in  his  assessment  of
    what constitutes sole responsibility.  Sole responsibility is a factual
    matter to be decided on all the evidence. I find the  judge  has  dealt
    with all the relevant evidence before him.

14. Criticism is made of the judge for failing to  consider  and  apply  TD
    (Yemen).  I find this criticism unfounded. Whilst it  is  correct  that
    the judge did not mention the case by name there is no  requirement  to
    do so provided the principles of it are followed. TD  (Yemen)  provided
    guidance on the approach to be taken when deciding the  issue  of  sole
    responsibility and for the sake of convenience I set out that  guidance
    as contained in the head note:

         "Sole responsibility is a factual matter to be decided upon all the
         evidence.   Where  one  parent  is  not  involved  in  the  child's
         upbringing  because  he  (or  she)  has  abandoned   or   abdicated
         responsibility, the issue may arise between  the  remaining  parent
         and others who have day-to-day care of the child abroad.  The  test
         is whether the parent has continuing control and direction over the
         child's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
         the child's life.  However where both parents  are  involved  in  a
         child's upbringing, it will be exceptional that one  of  them  will
         have 'sole responsibility'."

15. Looking at the findings made by the FtT particularly those set  out  in
    [31 (1 to 7)] it is clear that the judge  took  into  account  all  the
    relevant  evidence  before  him  and  came  to  the   conclusion   that
    responsibility for the Appellant had been delegated to  her  aunt,  the
    Sponsor's sister.

16. The judge formed the view that the evidence showed that the  day-to-day
    care of the Appellant was exercised by her aunt,  who  clearly  oversaw
    that she received the medical treatment needed albeit that it was  paid
    for by the Sponsor.  It was the Appellant's aunt who communicated  with
    the Appellant's school. It was the Appellant's aunt who was responsible
    for exercising control over her and for bringing her up.   Even  taking
    into account the financial support  given  by  the  Sponsor  the  judge
    concluded that nevertheless the Appellant had been brought  up  by  her
    aunt for the last five years and had failed  to  discharge  the  burden
    upon her to show that her sponsoring mother had had sole responsibility
    for her.

17. For the sake of completeness I ought to mention that I  find  that  the
    judge did not ignore the evidence of the financial receipts. That  much
    is clear from [39].  He also took into account and gave credit for  the
    Appellant's mother's evidence that she had visited her daughter several
    times to keep in touch with her.

18. It is not an arguable error of law for  the  FtT  to  give  too  little
    weight or too much weight to a factor, unless irrationality is alleged.
     Nor is it an error of law for a judge  to  fail  to  deal  with  every
    factual issue of argument.  Disagreement with the FtT  judge's  factual
    conclusion, his appraisal of the evidence or assessment of  credibility
    does not give rise to an  error  of  law.   Unless  his  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being completely wrong there is no error
    of law.

19. I find that the judge having found, as was entitled  to  do,  that  the
    Immigration Rule concerned was not met in the Appellant's case, then he
    was bound to find when considering the Article 8  ECHR  proportionality
    exercise that the failure to meet the Immigration Rules weighed heavily
    against the Appellant in that consideration.  I see  no  error  on  the
    proportionality exercise as the judge found that,  although  there  was
    family life between the Appellant and  the  Sponsor,  the  Respondent's
    decision would not interfere disproportionately with the  enjoyment  of
    the family life currently experienced.

20. For the foregoing reasons, the  FtT's  decision  contains  no  material
    error of law requiring it to be set aside and remade.
