Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Sharma, Counsel, instructed by Malik
      Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born November 6, 1981 is a citizen of India. On May  28,
    2004 the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in  possession  of  an
    entry clearance visa as a visitor. Her visa  expired  on  November  21,
    2004 and she did not make  any  application  to  extend  her  stay  and
    therefore became an overstayer. The appellant lodged an application  to
    stay on January 13, 2010 under article  8  ECHR  but  no  copy  of  the
    refusal letter was produced and it was not until January 22, 2014  that
    the appellant was served with Form IS151A. On January 22, 2014 she  was
    served with a section 10 decision to remove her. The appellant was  not
    afforded an in-country right of appeal but in April 2014 a  Duty  Judge
    decided the appellant had  an  in-country  appeal,  as  the  respondent
    failed to provide evidence the appellant had not  raised  human  rights
    before Form ISI151A was served on her (this  was  correct  n  light  of
    subsequent evidence).

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  on  January  29,
    2014. On September 9, 2014 Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Aujla
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard her  appeal.  He  refused
    her appeal in a determination promulgated on September 16, 2014.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on September  25,  2014  and  on
    November 5, 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Osborne  granted
    permission to appeal finding  it  arguable  the  FtTJ  may  have  erred
    because there  was  no  evidence  the  respondent  had  had  regard  to
    requirements of paragraph 353B HC 395.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 4. Mr Sharma adopted his grounds of appeal and the permission granted.  He
    submitted that if the respondent considered the provisions of paragraph
    353B HC 395 in 2010 this was over four years ago and  these  provisions
    were not considered when the decision to remove was taken. The Court of
    Appeal in Qunwane and others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 957 makes clear the
    respondent should have regard to those factors and the  fact  the  FtTJ
    had no evidence this was done meant the decision was not in  accordance
    with the law. At paragraph [24] the Court of Appeal stated

            "... Paragraph 353B can be of relevance only to those who  have
            no right to remain in this country and whose claims  have  been
            finally determined (because their appeal rights  are  exhausted
            and there are no unanswered submissions). The discretion  is  a
            safety valve, pursuant to which  the  Secretary  of  State  may
            refrain from removing but only  in  such  circumstances,  which
            will necessarily be rare."

 5. Mr Walker discovered in his file a refusal letter dated June  17,  2010
    and a response from  Malik  Law  Chambers  dated  July  13,  2010  that
    acknowledged the refusal letter and invited the respondent to  issue  a
    section 10 removal decision as  this  would  enable  the  appellant  to
    appeal on human rights grounds  whereas  the  refusal  letter  did  not
    generate a right of appeal.  He  accepted  that  when  the  section  10
    decision was taken there was no evidence the respondent had  considered
    the paragraph 353B factors.

 6. Both parties invited me to find an error in law  because  the  decision
    was not in accordance with the law.

 7. In light of the submissions I agreed with the parties' request.

    DECISION


 8. There was a material error of law. I allow the  appeal  to  the  extent
    that the application would be remitted to  the  respondent  to  make  a
    fresh decision in compliance with the Immigration Rules.


 9. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
