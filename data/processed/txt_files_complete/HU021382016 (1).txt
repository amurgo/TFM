Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Burrett, instructed by AJA Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  SB's  appeal
   against the respondent's decision to refuse his application for leave  to
   remain on family and private life grounds.

2. For the purposes of this decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as the respondent and SB as the appellant,  reflecting
   their positions  as  they  were  in  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on  [  ]  1963.  He  initially
   entered the United Kingdom on 27 June 1994 with limited leave valid until
   27 December 1994. On 24 September 1994 he married AT, a British  citizen.
   On 15 February 1996 he was sentenced  to  three  years  imprisonment  for
   Class A drugs offences and on 25 June 1997 a deportation order was signed
   against him. On 16 July 1997 he was deported from the UK.  He  re-entered
   the UK in breach of the deportation order and claims  that  that  was  in
   March 1998.


4.  On 18 June 2004 the appellant applied for leave to remain in the  UK  as
   the spouse of a British national. His application was refused on  6  July
   2004. On 15 July 2006 he applied again on the same basis. His application
   was refused on 3 April 2008 with  a  right  of  appeal.  His  appeal  was
   dismissed on 11 June 2008 and he became appeal  rights  exhausted  on  19
   June 2008. On 16 October 2015  the  appellant  was  served  with  removal
   papers. On 27 October 2015 he  made  another  application  for  leave  to
   remain, on the basis of his family and private life. His application  was
   refused on 9 January 2016.

5. In refusing the appellant's application, the  respondent  noted  that  he
   had been convicted of six offences between February 1996 and April  2006:
   on 15 February 1996 he was convicted of possessing a Class  A  controlled
   drug (cocaine) and was sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment  of  three
   years; on 25  July  2001  he  was  convicted  of  possessing  a  Class  B
   controlled drug (cannabis) and was fined �100; on 27 April  2006  he  was
   convicted of possessing a Class B  controlled  drug  (cannabis)  and  was
   fined �100 and possessing an article with a blade or point  in  a  public
   place for which  he  was  fined  �300.  The  respondent  noted  that  the
   appellant had  previously  had  a  deportation  order  made  against  him
   following the three year prison sentence for possession of Class A  drugs
   and considered that his presence in the  UK  was  not  conducive  to  the
   public good because he was a persistent offender. He therefore failed  to
   meet the suitability provisions of the immigration rules, in S-LTR.1.2, S-
   LTR.1.4 and S-LTR.1.5 of Appendix FM and,  as  a  result,  he  could  not
   benefit from the criteria in EX.1 as a partner  or  parent,  and  neither
   could he  meet  the  criteria  in  paragraph  276ADE(1).  The  respondent
   considered that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  justifying  a
   grant of leave outside the immigration rules.


6. The appellant appealed against that decision. His  appeal  was  heard  by
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Clarke on 17 February 2017 and was allowed in a
   decision promulgated on 22 February 2017. Judge  Clarke  noted  that  the
   appellant had two children with his wife, the  youngest  of  whom  was  a
   minor aged 13 years for whom the appellant was the main carer  since  his
   wife worked. The judge accepted that the appellant had changed since  his
   convictions and had been rehabilitated and  did  not  pose  any  risk  of
   serious harm to the public. She noted that more than ten years had passed
   since the deportation was made, that there had been  a  very  significant
   change of circumstances since 2006 when the last conviction occurred  and
   that the most serious offences were committed in 1995. She concluded that
   it was not in the public interest for the appellant  to  be  removed  and
   that this was an exceptional case with very compelling circumstances. She
   accordingly allowed the appeal.

7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge was wrong to consider  revocation  as  that
   was not a matter before the Tribunal and that even if she was correct  to
   consider revocation she was obliged to undertake a full assessment of the
   public interest as advocated in Quarey, R (on the application of)  v  The
   Secretary of State for the Home Department (Rev 1) [2017] EWCA Civ 47.

8. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  4
   September 2017.

9. At the hearing before me I referred the parties to  the  recent  judgment
   of the Court of Appeal in The Secretary of State for the Home  Department
   v SU [2017] EWCA Civ 1069  which involved very similar circumstances.  Ms
   Pal relied on the  case  of  Smith  (paragraph  391(a)  -  revocation  of
   deportation order) [2017] UKUT 166 in submitting that the judge failed to
   give appropriate weight to the  public  interest  in  a  case  where  the
   appellant had returned to the UK in breach of  a  deportation  order.  Mr
   Burrett submitted that the judge had given adequate consideration to  the
   public interest and that it was relevant to note that the respondent  had
   not taken action against the appellant subsequent to the dismissal of his
   appeal in 2008. The respondent had failed to identify what the judge  had
   not taken into consideration. I advised the parties that, in my view, and
   given the judgment in SU, the judge's decision could not stand  and  that
   the decision in the appeal had to be re-made afresh.

10. It is the  case  that  the  respondent's  decision  was  not  made  with
   reference to paragraph 399D of the immigration  rules  and  that  it  was
   instead  based  upon  the  suitability   provisions   in   Appendix   FM.
   Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal made it clear in SU that a  failure  to
   have regard to paragraph 399D in any event was a material error  of  law.
   It is also clear that, as in SU, Judge Clarke accorded significant weight
   to the fact that more than 10 years had  elapsed  since  the  deportation
   order was issued against  the  appellant,  rather  than  approaching  the
   matter in the manner set out at [64] of SU. Indeed, aside from  the  fact
   that ten years had elapsed, the judge provided limited and, it  seems  to
   me, inadequate reasons for concluding that the appellant's  case  was  an
   exceptional or compelling one and failed to conduct  a  full  and  proper
   assessment of the public interest in accordance with the relevant factors
   in section 117B of the 2002 Act.

11. For all of these reasons the judge's decision is unsustainable and  must
   be set aside in its entirety. The appropriate course, as accepted by  the
   parties, is for the matter to be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to
   be heard afresh.

DECISION

12. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The Secretary of State's appeal  is
   allowed and the decision is set aside.

13. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  pursuant  to  section
   12(2)(b)(i) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and
   Practice Statement 7.2(b), to be heard before any judge aside from  Judge
   Clarke.
