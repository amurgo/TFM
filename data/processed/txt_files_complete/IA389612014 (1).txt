Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr Wainwright, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant ('the SSHD') appeals against a decision of First-tier
         Tribunal  Judge  Barcello  dated  6  February  2015  in  which  the
         respondent's ('the claimant') appeal was  allowed.   The  SSHD  was
         granted permission in relation to two grounds of appeal: first, the
         judge was wrong to find  that  the  claimant  had  an  'established
         presence'; second, the judge incorrectly found that the outstanding
         balance on the CAS was nil when it was �500.

      2. The issue before the First-tier Tribunal was  whether  or  not  the
         claimant met the maintenance requirements of the Immigration  Rules
         in order for his leave to be varied as a Tier 4 (General)  Student.
         Judge Barcello determined this issue on the papers  and  without  a
         hearing on 4 February 2015, as  requested  by  the  claimant.   The
         papers available to the judge were limited to the IATFT-1 form, the
         letter of refusal  and  a  bundle  of  documents  received  by  the
         Tribunal on  10  December  2014.  The  SSHD  did  not  provide  any
         documentation in response to directions dated 6 November 2014.  The
         SSHD was again directed to  serve  a  bundle  of  documents  on  10
         December 2014 but did not comply with these directions.

      3. At the hearing before me, after some preliminary  discussions,  the
         representatives were able to agree  the  issues  that  remained  in
         dispute in relation to the two grounds of appeal.

      4.  Mr  Wainwright  accepted  that  the  appellant  did  not  have  an
         'established presence' for the purposes of  the  Immigration  Rules
         and  the  judge  therefore  erred  in  law  in  basing  the   first
         calculation on that footing (para  14).   Mr  Wainwright  submitted
         that this could not be said to be  a  material  error  because  the
         judge went on to consider the position in  the  second  alternative
         calculation i.e. on the basis that the claimant  did  not  have  an
         'established presence' and needed to establish that he  could  meet
         the  relevant  living  expenses  of  �7380  in  addition   to   any
         outstanding fees.

      5. Both representatives accepted that there was evidence available  to
         the Judge that for the appropriate 28 day  period  the  appellant's
         balance did not  fall  below  �7,669.   The  only  factual  dispute
         between the parties was this: Mr  Wrainwright  submitted  that  the
         judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  there  was  no  fee   balance
         outstanding on the CAS dated 7 August 2014 before the judge.   That
         meant that the appellant met the  Rules  -  he  needed  to  show  a
         balance of �7380 for the relevant 28 day period and the  judge  was
         entitled to find that he did.  On  the  other  hand,  Ms  Johnstone
         submitted that the CAS (also dated 7 August 2014) that was attached
         to the application form indicated a �500 outstanding balance.   She
         submitted that it followed that the claimant  could  not  establish
         that he had �7380+�500=�7880 as he only had �7669.

      6. Both representatives accepted that in these circumstances, the sole
         issue before me was whether or not the judge made an error  of  law
         in finding the outstanding balance on the CAS to be nil.

      7. Ms Johnstone submitted that the judge made a  mistake  of  fact  in
         finding that �500 was not outstanding  and  this  caused  the  SSHD
         unfairness.  The nine- page bundle provided to  the  judge  by  the
         claimant included an original CAS dated  7  August  2014  (the  day
         before the application was made).  I have considered that document.
          It clearly shows the outstanding balance as nil.   The  judge  was
         entitled to conclude that the outstanding balance  on  the  CAS  is
         nil, on the basis of this  document  and  in  the  absence  of  any
         documentation from the SSHD at all (in breach of two directions).

      8. Ms Johnstone sought to demonstrate that the CAS relied upon by  the
         judge and the appellant was the wrong CAS, and not the one that was
         attached to his application.  She sought to do  this  by  providing
         fresh evidence to this Tribunal: an alternate version of  the  CAS,
         which she said was attached to the application.

      9. In MM (unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 (IAC), the Tribunal
         discussed the applicable principles in play  when  an  argument  is
         made that an error of law was brought about by a mistake  of  fact.
         MM reviews the relevant authorities, which make it clear  that  one
         of the necessary ingredients is normally that  the  party  alleging
         the mistake "could not fairly be held responsible for  the  error".
         In addition, the appellate  court  could  not  identify  a  mistake
         unless it was willing to admit new evidence in  order  to  identify
         it, and this should be done by a flexible interpretation of Ladd  v
         Marshall  principles.   The  reference  to  the  Ladd  v   Marshall
         principles is a reference to that part of the judgment  of  Denning
         LJ in [1954] 1 WLR 1489 when he said (at p 1491) that  where  there
         had been a trial or hearing on the  merits,  the  decision  of  the
         judge could only be overturned by resort to further evidence if  it
         could be shown that: (1) the new evidence could not with reasonable
         diligence have been obtained for use at the trial (or hearing); (2)
         the new evidence must be such that, if  given,  it  would  probably
         have had an important influence on the result of the  case  (though
         it need not be decisive);  (3)  the  new  evidence  was  apparently
         credible although it need not be incontrovertible.

     10. I have no doubt that the copy of the CAS that Ms  Johnstone  sought
         to admit in order to demonstrate a mistake could have been provided
         with  reasonable  diligence  to  the   First-tier   Tribunal,   had
         directions been complied with.  Ms Johnstone argued that  the  SSHD
         did not receive a copy of the claimant's bundle and  therefore  did
         not realise that it was necessary to provide the 'correct' CAS.   I
         do not accept this submission.  The SSHD was put on notice  on  two
         occasions  that  documentation  was  required.   The  SSHD  failed,
         without any explanation whatsoever, to provide  any  documentation.
         The application form and the CAS were  very  basic  documents  that
         could have and should  have  been  provided.  Prior  to  the  paper
         hearing the SSHD twice failed to comply with directions.  In  these
         circumstances the judge was fully entitled to make findings on  the
         information provided by the appellant, there being  no  information
         forthcoming from the SSHD.  This information could and should  have
         been forthcoming.

     11. In any event, Ms Johnstone submitted a copy of a CAS  and  asserted
         it was attached to the claimant's application form.  There  was  no
         evidence that this was in fact the version  of  the  CAS  that  was
         attached.   There was no evidence available to  me  that  this  CAS
         accompanied the form and no explanation for there being two CAS  of
         the same date.  The appellant's witness statement before the  judge
         states: "I have NIL fees as stated in my CAS.   This  CAS  was  the
         same CAS that was used  in  my  application".   The  SSHD  has  not
         provided any  evidence  whatsoever  to  contradict  that  evidence,
         plainly accepted by Judge Barcello, beyond the production of a copy
         of an alternate CAS.

     12. Furthermore, Ms Johnstone provided the appellant's Counsel  with  a
         copy of the fresh evidence on the day of  the  hearing  before  me.
         This was not mentioned in the grounds of appeal and there has  been
         a failure to comply with rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  In all the circumstances, it  is  not
         in the interests of justice for the documentation belatedly  sought
         to be relied upon by the SSHD to be  admitted,  and  I  decline  to
         admit it.

     13. In the absence of this evidence the SSHD  is  unable  to  establish
         there was any mistake of fact or a material error  of  law  in  the
         decision.

     14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making
         of a material error of law.
