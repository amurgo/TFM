Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Mackenzie, Counsel, instructed by Wilsons
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal from a determination promulgated on 15 September 2014
    when First-tier Tribunal Judge Aziz dismissed the appeal of Ms  Natalia
    Yudina against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. That decision refused her  application  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant.  She appeals  to  us
    against the determination.

 2. Ms Yudina comes from the  Russian  Federation.   She  had  entered  the
    United Kingdom in 2010  as  a  Tier  4  Student  and  obtained  various
    qualifications. Then in early 2014 she made an application for leave to
    remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system.  She claimed 75 points for  having  access  to  not  less  than
    ï¿½50,000 for the purposes of the  application.   There  was  a  covering
    letter from her solicitors stating that she had been working as a self-
    employed project manager and marketing consultant since 2012.   If  her
    application were granted, the letter added, she would work as a project
    manager.

 3. With that application was a declaration of third party support  from  a
    Miss Saiqa Javed. That declaration complied with what was paragraph 41-
    SD of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules. The Secretary of State on 21
    March 2014  refused  the  application.   In  the  decision  letter  the
    Secretary of State stated that there was no  letter  from  a  financial
    institution in compliance with paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) of Appendix  A  of
    the Immigration Rules. If a bank statement had been submitted - because
    the solicitor had stated that a bank statement was being forwarded even
    though it had not - that would not be sufficient.  The decision  letter
    also stated that the Secretary of State  had  decided  not  to  request
    additional documentation  under  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The appellant appealed. In her evidence before the  Tribunal  she  said
    that the documents she had submitted were because of her lawyer and she
    must have been  confused, because they thought  a  bank  statement  was
    equivalent to a bank letter.  They had contacted the bank and the  bank
    said it would not provide a bank letter.

 5. In his determination the judge canvassed the issues, the  evidence  and
    the  law.  He  quoted  paragraph  41-SD(c)(i)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules as regards  the  bank  letter,  which  the  appellant
    should have submitted. The judge also quoted  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   After  recording  that  a  third   party   letter
    containing all the mandatory information was submitted, the judge  said
    that he accepted that there seemed to be a misunderstanding.  While  he
    had sympathy for the appellant who appeared to have acted diligently in
    seeking legal advice, he came to  the  conclusion  this  there  was  no
    discretion within the rules and that the requisite bank letter had  not
    been provided.  The judge added that the appellant's application  could
    not succeed under paragraph 245AA because, under that  rule,  documents
    will  not  be  requested  where  a  specified  document  has  not  been
    submitted.

 6. The appellant  appealed.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  considering
    permission granted it on the grounds that the judge had  misquoted  the
    rule, that he had used a rule which was not in force at the date of the
    application and decision, and that if the judge  had  used  the  proper
    rule it contained an ambiguity and that  ambiguity  was  such  that  an
    applicant who was relying on third  party  funds  need  only  submit  a
    letter from the third party backed by the solicitor's letter.

 7. We had considered this argument before the  hearing  and  had  decided,
    subject to argument, that it had no basis.  It seemed to us that a fair
    reading of the substance of paragraph 41-SD(c)(d), even  prior  to  the
    amendments inserted on 6 April 2014, made plain that  the  bank  letter
    needed to be provided where there were third party funds  being  relied
    on.  It seemed to us not to be a sensible interpretation that all  that
    an applicant needed to provide was a letter from the third party backed
    by a solicitor's letter verifying the signatures.   In  any  event,  we
    took the view that on the facts the solicitor handling the  matter  had
    not taken that narrow view of what was required  because  he  had  said
    that he was providing a bank statement.

 8. This morning before us Mr Mackenzie has very fairly conceded  that  the
    argument advanced in the grounds on which permission  was  granted  are
    not sustainable in the light of Iqbal v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 169.  In that case Lord Justice Sullivan  in
    giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal dealt with  a  very  similar
    argument being advanced there in  relation  to  the  interpretation  of
    paragraph 41-SD.  In  his  judgment  Lord  Justice  Sullivan  not  only
    addressed the wording of the rule but underlined  the  purpose,  namely
    that the documents needed to demonstrate that the applicant had  access
    to the necessary funds  and  that  the  interpretation  being  advanced
    before the Court of Appeal would not have addressed the purpose  behind
    the rules.

 9. That concession by Mr Mackenzie was  realistic  and  commendable.   The
    second issue in terms of Section 245AA does not arise  once  the  issue
    about ambiguity fails.  We dismiss the appeal.
