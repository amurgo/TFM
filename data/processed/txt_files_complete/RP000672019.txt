Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Appiah instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
                    Solicitors (Sackville House, London)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Somalia.  He appealed to the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the respondent's decision of 13 May 2019 revoking  his
    refugee status, and a decision of 23  May  2019  to  deport  him  as  a
    foreign criminal.  The judge dismissed his appeal, concluding that  the
    respondent was correct in revoking the appellant's refugee  status  and
    not  accepting  that  his  appeal  under  Article  3  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights could succeed.

2.    The  appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  the   judge's
    decision.   Permission  was  refused  by  a  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, but subsequently  a  Judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  granted
    permission, limiting her grant of permission to two matters.  The first
    of these was that it was arguable that the judge had failed  to  engage
    in any meaningful way with the expert report that had been provided  in
    deciding not to depart from the country guidance in MOJ [2014] UKUT 442
    (IAC), and also in  failing  to  apply  the  country  guidance  in  MOJ
    adequately.  It was noted that there was no challenge  to  the  judge's
    reasoning and findings on section 72 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 and that therefore Grounds 1 and 2 could only refer
    to the  appellant's  humanitarian  protection  claim  and  the  related
    Article 3 claim.  Ground 3, which argued that the judge  had  erred  in
    finding that the appellant did not have family life with his mother and
    sister was regarded as being unarguable.

3.   Following a note and directions of 16 April  2020  both  the  appellant
    and the respondent provided written submissions, and subsequently on  7
    July 2020 Upper Tribunal Judge  Finch  considered  the  matter  on  the
    papers and found an error of law, setting aside  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

4.   Among other things she noted the limitation in the grant of  permission
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill, and a contention made on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that the grounds could only  relate  to  Article  3.   Judge
    Finch however considered that in fact the appellant was correct in this
    regard in  that  the  issues  before  the  Tribunal  were  humanitarian
    protection and Article 3.

5.   At the hearing before me it was agreed that there was no need  to  call
    the character witnesses Mr  Blackwood  and  Mr  Hassan,  who  had  both
    provided witness statements.  Mr Tufan was happy for their evidence  to
    stand and that they would not be criticised on the basis that there had
    not been an opportunity to cross-examine them.

6.   The appellant gave evidence.  He was referred to his witness  statement
    of 18 September 2019 and his more recent statement of 20 May  2021  and
    confirmed that he had signed then and read them and that  the  contents
    were true.

7.   In cross-examination he was asked what language he spoke to his  mother
    in and he said in English and broken Somali.  He was asked whether  his
    mother spoke English and said that she understood it  better  than  she
    spoke it.

8.   His brother was still in  prison.   As  to  whether  he  was  supported
    financially by the family he had a job while in prison  and  of  course
    had no rent to pay.

9.   There was no re-examination.  The  next  witness  was  the  appellant's
    mother.  She was referred to her witness  statements  of  18  September
    2019 and 1 June 2021 (the latter  of  which  she  signed  on  her  copy
    today).  She had had the opportunity to read them and had them read  to
    her in a language she understood and they were true.

10.  In cross-examination she was asked which  language  she  spoke  to  the
    appellant at home in and she said English but sometimes the words  were
    difficult and they had a way to understand each other.  She  was  asked
    whether she spoke Somali to him and said he did not know  Somali:  very
    little.

11.  Her other son was still in prison.  She did not see him  but  supported
    him financially, sometimes but not all the time.  On re-examination she
    was asked to explain  the  last  answer  and  said  that  she  received
    benefits so she could not support him all the time and as to how  often
    she supported him, it was every couple of  months  perhaps  every  four
    months when she would send �30.

12.  In his submissions, Mr Tufan argued that the appellant  was  a  serious
    criminal with a plethora of convictions including most recently one for
    90 months.  He had been assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to the
    public.

13.  There was an expert report and a more recent update.  This went  behind
    the current guidance in MOJ, but it was argued that it was insufficient
    to depart from the country guidance.  It had  been  made  clear  in  SG
    (Iraq) [2012] EWCA 940, that decision makers and Tribunal  Judges  were
    required to take country guidance determinations into  account  and  to
    follow them unless very strong grounds  supported  by  cogent  evidence
    were adduced justifying their not doing so.  It had been  held  in  MOJ
    that Mogadishu was a safe place to return to and  Al  Shabaab  did  not
    have a material force there and there were more recent authorities such
    as Saeed and MS (Somalia).  Even if the appellant ended up  in  an  IDP
    camp his Article 3 rights would not be breached.

14.  There was evidence from an earlier decision that  the  appellant  spoke
    some Somali and was from a majority clan,  the  Dawod.   Reference  was
    made to a recent Upper Tribunal case in SB [2019] UKUT 00358.

15.  From the evidence at the hearing the appellant's mother sent  money  to
    the brother: intermittently but funds were provided.  In SB  there  was
    emphasis on the availability of �1,500 for a facilitated return scheme.
     The appellant in that case had been a minority clan  member  from  the
    Bajuni and it was held that he could be safely returned  to  Mogadishu.
    It was also the case that that appellant, like  the  appellant  in  the
    instant appeal, spoke some Somali.

16.  There was nothing to indicate that the appellant would  end  up  in  an
    IDP camp as his mother could send money, but even if he did, that would
    not be a breach of Article 3  on  the  basis  of  the  current  country
    guidance.  There were no Article 15(c) issues.  The appellant would not
    be at risk in Mogadishu by his mere presence.  It was relevant to  bear
    in mind, with respect to the point that  he  had  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom at the age of 1, what had been said by Lord  Justice  Sales  in
    Mwesezi [2018] EWCA Civ 1104 where the appellant had come to the United
    Kingdom at the age of 2.  That was  a  case  involving  a  national  of
    Sierra Leone and the case was on its own facts.  The appellant had been
    exposed to Somali culture and spoke some Somali and  would  not  be  at
    risk in Mogadishu on the basis of the current case law.   Reliance  was
    also placed on the earlier written submissions of Mr Clarke.

17.  In her submissions Ms Appiah argued that with  regard  to  the  serious
    offence and medium risk  of  harm  points  the  assessments  spoke  for
    themselves with regard to past conduct but it was necessary to look  at
    the position as of today and how the appellant would fare  if  he  were
    deported to Somalia.  The Devaseelan guidance applied, but the  passage
    of time could lead the Tribunal to find that it  could  go  beyond  the
    earlier findings.

18.  The appellant had set out in his most recent statement the work he  was
    currently doing and there was also the evidence of Mr Blackwood and  Mr
    Hassan in this regard.  He was trying to behave differently  from  what
    he had been.  His mother's witness statements were  also  relevant  and
    there were also the emails from the most recent  probation  officer  Ms
    Rodgers in the bundle at pages 23 to 24.  The  theme  was  constant  as
    being one of someone who had managed to turn his life around.

19.   The  main  thrust  of  the  appeal  was  Article  3  and  humanitarian
    protection.  Ms Appiah relied on her  written  submissions  as  to  the
    situation for the appellant in Somalia.  As regards  the  first  expert
    report there should be a departure from the country guidance in MOJ and
    it was questioned at paragraph 18 of the written submissions whether it
    was good law.  The Secretary of State said that on  the  cases  it  was
    very safe for the appellant to return to Somalia.  It was said that  he
    will have support from his mother and can be in a refugee camp but  the
    Tribunal was asked to look at the situation for the appellant  and  the
    evidence about him.  It had not been said that  the  expert's  evidence
    was inaccurate and it had not  been  criticised  today.   There  was  a
    challenge in the earlier Secretary of State's submission  that  it  was
    general rather than specific but that was disagreed with and there  was
    a lot of information about the position in Somalia on the ground.

20.  As regards the �1,500 relocation grant, Ms Appiah did not know if  that
    still existed and as the point that had been  made  about  money  being
    sent to the appellant's brother and potentially to him it was �30 every
    four months.  It was unclear how that would begin to assist someone who
    had not lived in Somalia since he was aged 1.  He and his  mother  said
    he spoke English and it  was  accepted  that  there  was  some  limited
    evidence that he spoke a little Somali but not enough to  get  through.
    Reference was made to the  expert  report  in  this  regard  concerning
    westernised people in Somalia and  this  was  relevant  to  risk.   The
    report also looked at the general security situation and  the  evidence
    as to indiscriminate acts and with regard to clans, which  was  also  a
    point that had been made by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch in her error  of
    law decision.  There was not clan protection now.

21.  The expert report also dealt with the humanitarian situation  and  gave
    up-to-date evidence, in contrast to what Mr Tufan cited.  The appellant
    argued that the appeal should be allowed in the  current  circumstances
    as he had effectively spent all his life in the United Kingdom and  had
    his family here and had been brought up  in  a  multicultural  country.
    The expert report also dealt with  the  situation  of  the  appellant's
    brother who, since he was still in prison, would be  unable  to  assist
    the appellant in Somalia and  so  was  essentially  irrelevant  to  the
    appellant's return.  The  expert  had  also  referred  to  the  current
    material about risk on return.  The appeal should be allowed.

22.  I reserved my decision.

23.  The appellant came to the United Kingdom on 24  January  1990  when  he
    was 1 year old.  The family were granted refugee status later that year
    and subsequently limited leave  to  remain  and  thereafter  indefinite
    leave to remain.

24.  The appellant has a criminal record relating back to an  appearance  at
    Harrow Crown Court on 19 May 2006 on charges of burglary and theft  and
    common assault, and a number of offences thereafter  culminating  in  a
    conviction on 14 December 2012 of two counts of wounding with intent to
    do grievous bodily  harm,  assaulting  a  person,  thereby  occasioning
    actual bodily harm, violent  disorder.   He  was  sentenced  to  ninety
    months' imprisonment concurrent in relation to count two, three  years'
    imprisonment concurrent in relation to count  three  and  three  years'
    imprisonment concurrent in relation to count  four  and  this  amounted
    therefore to a total of seven years and six months' imprisonment.

25.  He had previous appeals against deportation  decisions  and,  as  noted
    above, the most recent decision was made in 2019 which led  the  appeal
    to Judge Khan, which was dismissed but that decision, as  noted  above,
    was subsequently set aside.

26.  The appellant's evidence in his witness statement of 18 September  2019
    states, perhaps not surprisingly, that he has no memories  of  Somalia.
    He got involved while in prison with a project with Queens Park Rangers
    Football Club and his mentor there was Mr Blackwood who has also  given
    evidence on his behalf.   He  expresses  sorrow  and  remorse  for  his
    previous convictions and says that he has matured a great deal  and  is
    determined to turn his life around, particularly in working with  young
    people.

27.  He refers to  the  fact  that  since  the  previous  statement  he  has
    completed a course  arranged  through  the  Probation  Service  and  he
    continues to volunteer at the  football  academy  and  is  still  being
    mentored by Mr Blackwood.  He refers to difficulties he would  have  in
    Somalia from such things as wearing shorts for football and the lack of
    money that he has and the passion that he now has for mentoring youths.
     He again expresses remorse for his previous offending and for the pain
    that he caused.

28.  In her earlier witness statement the appellant's mother refers  to  the
    fact that her sons can speak a bit of Somali but she says she sometimes
    cannot help but laugh when they do  so  as  they  have  strong  British
    accents.  She refers to the unsafeness in Somalia.  She also refers  to
    the help that she has from her son  since  his  release  on  bail  from
    immigration detention.

29.  In her most recent statement she referred to her  health  problems,  to
    the danger of the situation in Somalia and the fact  that  if  her  son
    were taken away and sent to Somalia her life and health would collapse.
     She asked that he be given another chance.

30.  In his statement Mr Blackwood, who is a youth and  communities  officer
    at QPR Trust at Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium, refers to having known
    the appellant since 2017 and  the  role  played  by  the  appellant  in
    supporting the programme.  He refers to the value  of  the  appellant's
    lived experience and transformation and the fact that his  safeguarding
    team are satisfied that the appellant poses no significant risk,  hence
    him being allowed to volunteer with them.  He said that  the  appellant
    has remained steadfast in his attitude and application and is genuinely
    a pleasure to work with  as  he  holds  no  animosity,  rarely  looking
    backwards and wants to give and help the potential younger versions  of
    himself.  He considers that given the chance to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom this would prove a positive and  productive  decision  for  the
    appellant's benefit and the many young people he has supported.

31.  In his letter Mr Hassan, who  is  the  chairman  of  Hillside  Athletic
    Football Club, says that he has known the appellant since 2004 and that
    the appellant as an assistant coach and  fitness  coach  is  an  active
    member in the team and plays a vital role  in  helping  youths  enhance
    their fitness levels and playing ability and that he gives back to  the
    community and that his story is inspired by many  young  people  to  do
    well and stay on the right track.  He speaks  very  positively  of  the
    appellant.

32.  In the email from Ms Rogers, to whom the appellant's  case  was  handed
    on 12 December 2019 there is reference to the  work  sheets  that  have
    been completed  by  the  appellant,  and  the  fact  that  he  remained
    motivated to  complete  the  work  sheets  at  home  and  during  their
    supervision sessions.  He was willing  to  discuss  all  areas  of  his
    offending behaviour whilst showing continuous regret  and  remorse  for
    what he had done.  During  this  period  he  had  recognised  that  his
    maturity had an impact on his decision making and recognised the impact
    this had on his behaviour.  She was impressed with  his  motivation  to
    change and his  dedication  to  return  to  football  to  continue  his
    passion.  She said that although she did not  supervise  the  appellant
    for a long period of time, he was very polite and respectful throughout
    their supervision appointments, complied with  all  licence  conditions
    and remained motivated to change his offending lifestyle and  use  that
    experience to guide teenagers away from engaging in offending behaviour
    in the local community.

The Law

33.  The burden of proof is on the appellant to show that there are  serious
    grounds for believing that he will suffer serious harm and is therefore
    entitled to humanitarian protection in accordance with  the  provisions
    of paragraph 339C of HC 395.  This states as follows:

         "A person will be granted humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
         Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:
         (i)  he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at a port of  entry
             in the United Kingdom;


         (ii) he does not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2 of
             the Refugee or Person  in  Need  of  International  Protection
             (Qualification) Regulations 2006;


         (iii)    substantial reasons have been shown for believing that the
             person concerned, if he is returned to the country of  return,
             would face a real  risk  of  suffering  serious  harm  and  is
             unable, or owing to such risk, unwilling to avail  himself  of
             the protection of that country; and


         (iv) he is not excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection.


         Serious harm consists of:


           i) the death penalty or execution;


          ii) unlawful killing;


         iii) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of  a
              person in the country of return; or


          iv) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or  person
              by  reason  of  indiscriminate  violence  it  situations   of
              international or internal armed  conflict."

34.  Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits  torture
    or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the  appellant  has
    to show that there are substantial grounds for believing that there  is
    a real risk of such prohibited ill-treatment and  that  that  treatment
    would meet the minimum level of severity required under Article 3.

Discussion

35.  In the country guidance in MOJ (Return to Mogadishu)  [2014]  UKUT  442
    (IAC), it was  said  that  generally  a  person  who  is  "an  ordinary
    civilian" (i.e. not associated with the security forces; any aspect  of
    government or official  administration  or  any  NGO  or  international
    organisation) on returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence  will
    face no real risk of persecution or risk of harm  such  as  to  require
    protection under Article  3  of  the  ECHR  or  Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive.  In particular, he will not be  at  real  risk
    simply on account of having lived in a European location for  a  period
    of time of being viewed with suspicion either by the authorities  as  a
    possible supporter of Al-:Shabaab or by Al-Shabaab as  an  apostate  or
    someone whose Islamic integrity has been compromised  by  living  in  a
    western country.  It was said that there had been durable change in the
    sense that Al-Shabaab's withdrawal  from  Mogadishu  was  complete  and
    there was no real prospect of  a  re-established  presence  within  the
    city.  There had been a reduction in the level of  civilian  casualties
    since 2011, largely due to the  cessation  of  confrontational  warfare
    within the city and Al-Shabaab's  resort  to  asymmetrical  warfare  on
    carefully selected targets.  It was said  that  the  present  level  of
    casualties did not amount to a sufficient risk  to  ordinary  civilians
    such as to represent an Article 15(c) risk.

36.  It was further said  that  it  was  open  to  an  ordinary  citizen  of
    Mogadishu to reduce further still his personal exposure to the risk  of
    "collateral damage" in being caught up in an Al-Shabaab attack that was
    not targeted at him by  avoiding  areas  and  establishments  that  are
    clearly identifiable as  likely  Al-Shabaab  targets,  and  it  is  not
    unreasonable for him to do so.  It was said that there was no real risk
    of forced recruitment of Al-Shabaab for civilian citizens of Mogadishu,
    including for recent returnees from the rest.  A  person  returning  to
    Mogadishu after a period of absence would look to his  nuclear  family,
    if he has one living in the city,  for  assistance  in  re-establishing
    himself and securing a livelihood.  Although a returnee may  also  seek
    assistance from his clan members who are not close relatives, such help
    is only likely  to  be  forthcoming  from  majority  clan  members,  as
    minority clans may have little to offer.  It was said further that  the
    significance of clan membership in Mogadishu had  changed.   Clans  now
    provide, potentially, social support mechanisms and assist with  access
    to  livelihoods,  performing  less  of  a  protection   function   than
    previously.  There are no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan  violence
    and no clan based discriminatory  treatment,  even  for  minority  clan
    members.  It is further said that if it  was  accepted  that  a  person
    facing a return to Mogadishu after a period of absence has  no  nuclear
    family or close relatives in the city to assist him in  re-establishing
    himself on return, there will need to be a careful  assessment  of  all
    the circumstances.  Those considerations would include,  but  were  not
    limited to, circumstances in  Mogadishu  before  departure,  length  of
    absence from Mogadishu, family or clan associations  to  call  upon  in
    Mogadishu, access to  financial  resources,  prospects  of  securing  a
    livelihood, whether that be employment or self-employment, availability
    of remittances from abroad, means of support during the time  spent  in
    the United Kingdom, why his ability to fund the journey to the West  no
    longer enabled the appellant to secure financial support on return.  In
    effect therefore the person facing return will have to explain  why  he
    would not be able to access the economic opportunities  that  had  been
    produced by the economic boom, especially as there is evidence  to  the
    effect that returnees are taking jobs at the expense of those who  have
    never been away.  Therefore only those with no clan or  family  support
    who would not be in receipt of remittances from abroad and who have  no
    real prospect of securing access to a livelihood on return  would  face
    the prospect of living in circumstances falling  below  that  which  is
    acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.  It was not  simply  those
    originating from Mogadishu who might now generally return  to  live  in
    the city without being subjected to an Article 15(c) risk or  facing  a
    real risk of destitution.   However,  relocation  in  Mogadishu  for  a
    person of a minority clan with no formal links  to  the  city  and,  no
    access to funds and no other form of clan,  family  or  social  support
    would be unlikely to be  realistic  as  in  the  absence  of  means  to
    establish a home and some form of ongoing financial support, there will
    be a real risk of having  no  alternative  but  to  live  in  makeshift
    accommodation within an IDP camp where there was a real possibility  of
    having  to  live  in  conditions  that  would  fall  below   acceptable
    humanitarian standards.

37.  In her first report, dated 17 September 2019, Ms Karen O'Riley who  has
    written a number of publications and in the past has filled such  roles
    as human rights education officer for Amnesty International, protection
    officer for UNHCR in  Uganda,  refugee  resettlement  expert  UNHCR  in
    Jordan and  refugee  re-settlement  expert  UNHCR  in  Central  African
    Republic, Kenya and West Africa, states  that  at  the  time  when  the
    appellant's family fled, members of the Darood clan were forced out  of
    Mogadishu.  She says that currently security in  Somalia  is  extremely
    high, the humanitarian situation is dire and the number  of  internally
    displaced people, many living at risk of serious abuse, has reached  an
    estimated 2.7 million.  She says that since the Home Office referred to
    Al-Shabaab withdrawing from Mogadishu in August 2011,  since  2014  Al-
    Shabaab have regained power in the last two years and are  reported  to
    be more powerful about any time since 2011.  There is reference to  Al-
    Shabaab continuing to carry out deadly attacks throughout  the  country
    including Mogadishu and that it holds territories surrounding Mogadishu
    from which it coordinates complex attacks targeting the Somali  Federal
    Government.

38.  She says that clan militias are now present and accurate in Somalia  in
    a variety of areas and that clan conflict has increased as a result  of
    drought and food shortage in the last two years.

39.  She says that  the  humanitarian  situation  in  Somalia  has  severely
    deteriorated in recent years and remains precarious  for  much  of  the
    population.  She considers that the  appellant  is  at  risk  of  being
    attacked, killed, abducted or forcibly recruited  by  Al-Shabaab.   The
    report for the Norwegian  Association  for  Asylum  Seekers  says  that
    though Mogadishu is formally under government  control,  Al-Shabaab  is
    everywhere.  There is also  reference  to  evidence  stating  that  Al-
    Shabaab is always suspicious  of  migrating  people  so  relocation  to
    Mogadishu can itself lead to suspicion.  Even if he were able to resist
    joining the group, the appellant would be at  risk  of  being  forcibly
    recruited or kidnapped by Al-Shabaab.

40.  He would be at risk as a returnee from the West as he has  been  living
    in the West for almost his entire life and has un-Islamic  habits  such
    as drinking alcohol.  He does not have family or community he can  rely
    on for support in Somalia, which makes  him  even  more  vulnerable  to
    persecution from Al-Shabaab.  There is a lack of state  protection  and
    lack of government control.  It is said that clan protection  functions
    better than protection by the state or the  police,  as  he  has  lived
    outside Somalia since he was a baby and does not have  any  connections
    to or within his own clan., as such this is not a guaranteed source  of
    protection to him.

41.  She refers to deterioration in the economic situation in Somalia  since
    MOJ and there is reference to the US State Department report of 2017 to
    limited employment opportunities in the southern and  central  sections
    of the country for  refugee  returnees  from  Kenya.   There  are  high
    chances of the appellant being forced to relocate to an IDP  settlement
    given how difficult it would be for him to support himself in Mogadishu
    or another town, the conditions in IDP camps in Somalia are  dire  with
    extremely poor living conditions and they are also dangerous.

42.  This report was criticised in written submissions put in on  behalf  of
    the respondent, dated 7 May 2020.  It was argued that in general  terms
    the report cannot conceivably amount to the strong grounds  and  cogent
    evidence required to depart from MOJ.  It was argued that the  report's
    reasoning  is  flawed  and  that  citation  is  limited  and  that   it
    erroneously uses examples of conditions outside Mogadishu  as  evidence
    of a change in country conditions within Mogadishu.

43.  It is noted that in MOJ the Upper Tribunal had accepted that since  Al-
    Shabaab's withdrawal from Mogadishu in 2011  if  it  had  continued  to
    carry out targeted attacks on politicians, police officers,  government
    officials  and   those   associated   with   NGOs   and   international
    organisations and as such found no Article 15(c) risk  to  an  ordinary
    civilian even if they had lived in Europe and were perceived as someone
    whose Islamic integrity was compromised.  They could  avoid  high  risk
    areas.

44.  It was argued that the expert gave no casualty figures to quantify  any
    alleged increase in violence, let alone also, it is said, the fact that
    the expert gives no example of indiscriminate  attacks  as  opposed  to
    targeted attacks.  It is argued that the expert relies throughout pages
    28 to 39 of her report on evidence relating  to  the  position  outside
    Mogadishu  without  acknowledging  the   geographical   and   political
    distinction between Mogadishu and elsewhere.  The fact that  Al-Shabaab
    continue to carry out attacks was evidence that was  accepted  in  MOJ.
    Evidence suggesting an ability to conduct attacks and  that  Al-Shabaab
    might be preparing targeting showed a limit on the evidence provided.

45.  It is also argued that the country guidance is  specific  to  Mogadishu
    and that where the expert claims that since the  country  guidance  the
    position regarding clan militias had deteriorated, there was a  failure
    to mention Mogadishu but there was reference to areas outside Mogadishu
    and there was no evidence that the position in Mogadishu  had  changed.
    Again, with regard to the reliance on pages 46 and 47 of the report  to
    support the contention that a range of abuses awaited the appellant  on
    return, neither  paragraph  referred  to  Mogadishu  and  there  was  a
    reference simply to Somalia at paragraph 58.

46.  The report is criticised for relying on  historic  reports  from  2013,
    relied on in turn by the  Norwegian  Association  for  Asylum  Seekers,
    which was old and also based exclusively on anecdotal evidence.   Again
    it was argued with regard to paragraphs 45  to  52  that  the  expert's
    response failed to engage with any evidence specific to Mogadishu.   It
    was argued in summary that the expert has failed entirely  to  identify
    any evidence to suggest that  the  appellant's  presence  in  Mogadishu
    would be any different from when MOJ was promulgated and had failed  to
    identify in evidence that  targeting  of  civilians  in  Mogadishu  has
    changed since MOJ.  There was therefore no  evidential  basis  for  the
    suggestion that the appellant might voluntarily join  Al-Shabaab.   The
    evidence was criticised as being anecdotal and insufficiently referring
    to the situation in Mogadishu.  It was also argued that  the  assertion
    the appellant would have no clan support because he has been away  from
    Somalia is  not  founded  upon  any  examples  at  all.   There  is  no
    addressing of the present circumstances of the majority Darood clan and
    no evidence that that clan would be unwilling to assist the  appellant.
    On the basis that the evidence  is  not  properly  made  out  that  the
    appellant would be extremely vulnerable to persecution at the hands  of
    Al-Shabaab  and  at  risk  of  interclan  violence  and  at   risk   of
    destitution, it is argued that there is not cogent  evidence  that  the
    position in Mogadishu has changed.

47.  In Ms Appiah's written submissions on 13 May 2020 the  expert's  report
    is defended.  Reference is made to the differences between 2014 and the
    time when the expert  report  was  written.   It  is  argued  that  the
    respondent is wrong to suggest that the expert barely touches upon  the
    clan issue.  It  is  said  to  be  clear  from  her  report  that  clan
    membership does not assist a person from a majority clan  where  events
    have been taken over by the general  country  hardships  and  attitudes
    being largely mercenary and political in nature.  It is argued that the
    evidence from the case clearly departs from that when MOJ was  decided.



48.  In her updated report the expert states among things that the  security
    situation in Mogadishu has severely deteriorated in recent months  with
    the city enduring some of the worst conflict in years.  There has  been
    fighting  between  security  forces  and  opposition   soldiers.    The
    political furore threatens to  distract  Somalia's  armed  forces  from
    fighting Al-Qaeda linked insurgents.  Residents of Mogadishu have  been
    forced to flee their homes as a  result  of  the  violence.   There  is
    reference to Al-Shabaab killing five people and injuring ten  civilians
    at a hotel in Mogadishu and also a suicide bombing near  Mogadishu,  in
    January 2021, to a car bomb in Mogadishu which killed three and wounded
    eight and gunfire in Mogadishu  with  five  soldiers  killed  and  many
    civilians injured in February, a suicide car bombing in Mogadishu  with
    twenty people killed and 30 wounded in March and six people killed in a
    suicide attack on a  restaurant  in  Mogadishu  in  April.   Al-Shabaab
    claimed to be responsible for the 9 May bombing in Mogadishu  in  which
    six police officers were killed  and  six  others  injured.   Also  Al-
    Shabaab continued to target civilians deliberately,  being  responsible
    for 60% of civilian casualties between 2019  and  2020.   Human  Rights
    Watch in its 2021 report noted  that  Al-Shabaab  continued  to  target
    civilians and that by early August  (presumably  in  2020)  the  United
    Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia recorded at  least  596  civilian
    casualties, including 296 killings, by early August, the majority being
    due  to  Al-Shabaab-targeted  in  indiscriminate  attacks.   Al-Shabaab
    committed religiously and politically motivated killings that  targeted
    civilians affiliated with the government and attacked humanitarian  NGO
    employees.  It is said that Al-Shabaab  has  increased  drastically  in
    strength and reach since  2018.   Amnesty  in  its  April  2021  report
    referred to Al-Shabaab continuing to enjoy impunity  for  frequent  and
    indiscriminate   attacks   targeting   civilians   and   in    civilian
    infrastructure  including   restaurants   and   hotels.    Those   more
    "westernised" are all routinely suspected of being spies and Al-Shabaab
    continued to execute those accused of spying for  foreign  forces.   It
    has an extensive intelligence network, which increases the chances that
    they will know about an individual and their background and identity.

49.  The appellant is said to be at risk on the basis of being  westernised,
    having lived almost his entire life in the West.  The expert refers  to
    the appellant's mother saying that she cannot help  but  laugh  at  the
    appellant's Somali accent, and she also refers to his lifestyle and his
    interests and his essential westernisation.  He would be at risk  as  a
    consequence of detention, torture death at the hands of  Al-Shabaab  in
    areas they control.  His British accent, lack of fluent Somali and lack
    of knowledge about/background in Somalia or Somali customs that put him
    at risk of being seen as someone who  is  clearly  "westernised".   She
    says that he would be at risk from  Al-Shabaab  in  areas  outside  its
    control as well given that it has a presence and carries out attacks in
    areas that it does not control such as Mogadishu.

50.  She states that the security situation  in  Somalia  has  continued  to
    deteriorate, citing the US State Department and  Amnesty  International
    referring to ongoing conflict including the government militias in  Al-
    Shabaab and  indiscriminate  attacks  against  civilians  and  civilian
    targets.  She refers to an article quoted by the Home Office  that  Al-
    Shabaab's forces have lost control of the capital and other cities  but
    retained control of large rural swathes of the country.

51.  She also refers to interclan  violence  and  the  rift  between  forces
    loyal to the president and his rivals being influenced by the  powerful
    clan divisions in Somalia.

52.  She says that the current humanitarian situation in Somalia is dire  as
    a result of prolonged drought,  floods,  resulting  disease,  COVID-19,
    food insecurity and a locust invasion and the situation is not expected
    to improve in 2021.  The level  of  food  insecurity  is  critical  and
    health outcomes are among the worst in the world.  The appellant is  at
    risk of destitution, in a country where the majority  of  young  people
    are unemployed, there is a poverty rate of 73%.  There is a severe lack
    of access to the labour market in urban settings and the  appellant  is
    said to be highly likely to be homeless and destitute  if  returned  to
    Somalia, which increases  his  vulnerability  to  disease,  insecurity,
    violence, persecution and recruitment by Al-Shabaab.  He may be  forced
    to move around in order to find  work  and  to  find  shelter  and  his
    vulnerability will be  at  least  as  great  as  any  other  internally
    displaced person.   Such  people  are  the  most  vulnerable  group  in
    Somalia, being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
    being forced to live in severely overcrowded conditions.   Though  many
    of them earned an income from the informal  economy,  COVID-19  related
    restrictions prevent them from earning a living and meeting basic needs
    like water, food and sanitary items.  In sum  she  concluded  that  the
    appellant  is  in  need  of  international   protection   and   it   is
    overwhelmingly likely that his return to Somalia would  expose  him  to
    inhumane and degrading  treatment,  and  his  brother  who  is  equally
    vulnerable would not be able to provide him with protection.

53.  In light of Ms O'Riley's conclusions, it is clear that in her view  the
    appellant's profile is such as to place him at Article 15(c)/Article  8
    risk on return to Somalia.  I will come back to her  evidence  shortly.
    But before that it is necessary to consider whether, if the guidance of
    the MOJ is not be departed from, the  extent  to  which  the  appellant
    falls within that guidance.

54.  He is clearly an ordinary civilian as defined in that decision, and  as
    such it is said he would generally face no risk  of  harm  such  as  to
    require protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c) of  the
    Qualification Directive.  In particular, as noted in that decision,  he
    will not be at real risk  simply  on  account  of  having  lived  in  a
    European location for a period of time of being viewed  with  suspicion
    either by the authorities as a possible Al-Shabaab supporter or by  Al-
    Shabaab as an apostate or someone  whose  Islamic  integrity  has  been
    compromised by living in a western country.  The level of casualties at
    that time was not said to amount to a sufficient to  risk  to  ordinary
    civilians such as to represent an Article 15(c) risk.  In  addition  it
    would be open to the appellant as an ordinary citizen in  Mogadishu  to
    reduce risk by avoiding areas and establishments  clearly  identifiable
    as likely Al-Shabaab targets.  With regard to headnote (vi) in MOJ,  it
    was found that there was no real risk  of  forced  recruitment  by  Al-
    Shabaab for a civilian citizen of Mogadishu including a recent returnee
    from the West, such as the appellant.   As regards headnote (vii),  the
    appellant does not have a nuclear family living in the city, but  as  a
    majority clan member, a member of the Darood clan, as a  majority  clan
    it would seem that he would  be  able  to  seek  assistance  from  clan
    members.  The clan potentially provides social support  mechanisms  and
    assistance with access to livelihoods, performing less of a  protection
    function than previously.  At the time it was said that there  were  no
    clan  militias  in  Mogadishu,  no  clan  violence  and  no  clan-based
    discriminatory treatment, even for minority clan members, of  which  of
    course the appellant is not one.

55.  As regards (ix)  of  the  guidance,  the  situation  in  Mogadishu  was
    clearly very different before the appellant left and he has been absent
    for the best part of 30 years.  He has no family in  Mogadishu  but  he
    can call upon the Darood, a majority clan, of which he is a member.  As
    regards access to financial resources, it seems from the guidance in SB
    to which I was referred above, that he may be eligible  for  a   �1,500
    relocation grant, and also might receive some minimal  funds  from  his
    mother, who provides a small level of  assistance  to  his  brother  in
    prison currently.  He has little by way of employment record, though he
    is currently working as  a  motivator  for  young  people.   There  is,
    looking at (x) of the country guidance, no reason shown  why  he  would
    not be able  to  access  the  economic  opportunities  that  have  been
    produced by the economic boom in  Mogadishu,  particularly  bearing  in
    mind the evidence to the effect that returnees were taking jobs at  the
    expenses of those who have never been away.  So  he  is  not  a  person
    without clan  support  though  he  does  not  have  family  support  in
    Mogadishu and he may be in receipt of some small  level  of  remittance
    from the United Kingdom and has not shown that he has no real  prospect
    of securing access to a livelihood on return.  As a consequence he does
    not, on my findings on the evidence, satisfy the requirement in (xi) of
    the country guidance of showing that he  would  face  the  prospect  of
    living in circumstances falling below that acceptable  in  humanitarian
    protection terms.

56.  As regards Ms O'Riley's evidence, I remind myself that  I  am  required
    to take the country guidance into account and follow  it  unless  there
    are very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence justifying  me  in
    not doing so.

57.  As noted above, the written submissions  of  Mr  Clarke  in  particular
    subjected the first report of Ms O'Riley to cogent  criticism.   It  is
    relevant to note that in the country guidance in MOJ it was  said  that
    the Al-Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu was complete and there was  no
    real prospect of a re-established presence  within  the  city.   It  is
    relevant to bear in mind the point made at paragraph 8 of the Secretary
    of State's written submissions that no casualty figures are offered  by
    Ms O'Riley to quantify the alleged increase in violence, and though the
    evidence cited by Ms O'Riley refers to a resurgence by  Al-Shabaab,  it
    appears to remain  the  case  that  Al-Shabaab  does  not  have  a  re-
    established presence within Mogadishu though it is carrying out attacks
    there, but of course it was the case that attacks  were  being  carried
    out by Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu at the time when the guidance in MOJ was
    provided, and it was it taken into account.  It appears that  there  is
    no re-established presence, though there may have been an  increase  in
    the level of attacks.  It  is  necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  the
    guidance in MOJ was essentially in connection  with  Mogadishu,  and  I
    consider there is some force  to  the  point  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State that a good deal of the  evidence  provided  by  the
    expert at paragraphs 28 to 39 concern the situation outside  Mogadishu.



58.  As regards the position of the clans, it is said  that  now  there  are
    clan militias present and active in Somalia contrary to the position in
    MOJ, but the expert refers to  the  clan  militias  being  present  and
    active in Somalia in a variety of  areas  rather  than  addressing  the
    position specific to Mogadishu, and I agree with the submission made on
    behalf of the respondent that the expert report does not refer  to  any
    evidence that the position in Mogadishu has changed.

59.  Again there is no specific reference to Mogadishu in the evaluation  of
    the current humanitarian situation in  paragraphs  46  and  47  of  the
    expert report and in the subsequent paragraphs also the references  are
    to the general situation in Somalia rather than  specific  position  in
    Mogadishu.

60.  There is also some force in the criticism of part of the expert  report
    on risk of forced recruitment or  targeted  violence  from  Al-Shabaab,
    that there is a good deal of reliance upon evidence from  2013  and  is
    also essentially anecdotal.  I consider there is  force  to  the  point
    made that the expert has failed to reference  any  actual  evidence  of
    attacks in Mogadishu that are different from those in MOJ.   It  should
    be recalled that attacks from Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu were  taken  into
    account in the guidance in MOJ.

61.  I think there is some force in the point  made  in  the  expert  report
    that the economic boom may to an extent have come to an end in  Somalia
    and that is hardly unsurprising given, quite apart from  anything  else
    the pandemic of the last twelve to fifteen months.  With regard to what
    she says about returnees  to  Somalia  have  very   limited  access  to
    support from clan and  family  members,  this  is  fairly  generalised,
    referring to such points as the Ministry of Education saying there  are
    no  basic  services  available  for  returnees  from  the   government,
    institutions or community, but INGO(D) believed it is difficult  for  a
    person who returns from abroad to access the necessary support and that
    a research centre (b) stated that since everyone  is  now  fighting  to
    survive in Mogadishu people have a limited ability to  support  others.
    It was said that returnees cannot rely on support from clan members  or
    family members.  INGO(D) said that clans constituted a type  of  safety
    net, but it could not be relied upon as  a  long-term  solution,  other
    sources referring to support for a day or two or around a week.   Again
    therefore the position may have deteriorated  to  an  extent,  but  the
    existence of the difficulty that is pointed to  does  not  in  my  view
    amount to such as to give rise to a need for Article 15(c) or Article 3
    protection.  It was said by the Home Office  in  June  2017  that  clan
    protection functions better than protection by the state or police, and
    the expert says with regard to this that since the appellant has  lived
    outside Somalia since he was a baby and has no connections to or within
    his clan and as such this is not a guaranteed source of protection  for
    him.  She does not make clear why the lack of any immediate connections
    to the clan would leave him unprotected or unassisted, and the test  is
    not one of a guaranteed source of protection in any event.   There  is,
    as the respondent has argued, no evidence that the Darood clan would be
    unwilling to assist the appellant.

62.  I do not consider that the  more  recent  report  of  Ms  O'Riley  adds
    anything of any materiality to the earlier report.  I accept the  point
    made that the appellant could  not  place  any  real  reliance  on  his
    brother since he remains in prison and would not be accompanying him to
    Somalia.  But the summary in particular, as set out at paragraphs 94 to
    101 of Ms O'Riley's second report, is in essence very similar  to  what
    was said in the earlier report, focusing it does on  the  deterioration
    and the security situation in Somalia, increase in  Al-Shabaab's  power
    and the  attacks  it  carries  out  throughout  the  country  including
    Mogadishu, its targeting of civilians and the very high  risk  that  is
    identified with the appellant being homeless and destitute in  Somalia.
    I do not consider, taking matters as a whole, that  the  high  test  of
    very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence has been made  out  in
    this case such as to show that  the  country  guidance  should  not  be
    followed.  On the basis of the guidance set out in MOJ I consider  that
    the appellant has not shown that he faces a real risk of Article  15(c)
    ill-treatment or Article 3 ill-treatment.
