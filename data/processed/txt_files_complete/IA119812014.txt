                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Niita Emvula Eins against the  decision  of  Judge
    Fletcher-Hill from a decision made at  Hatton  Cross  on  the  28th  of
    October 2014 in a decision promulgated on the  8th  of  December  2014.
    The appellant who entered the UK in  2005  with  a  residence  card  is
    married, or was married to a German national who throughout the  period
    appears to have exercised treaty  rights  under  the  EEA  Regulations.
    Following their divorce on the 13th  of  December  2012  the  appellant
    applied for a permanent residence card reflecting a right of  permanent
    residence in the UK.  The Regulation that deals with that is Regulation
    15(1)(b) which states that a person qualifies for  permanent  residence
    if they are a family member of an EEA national who is not themselves an
    EEA national but who has resided in the UK with  the  EEA  national  in
    accordance with these Regulations  for  a  continuous  period  of  five
    years.

 2. Having entered as the spouse of Mr Eins the  Appellant  was  granted  a
    residence card which was valid from the 8th of October 2005 to the  4th
    of October 2010.  In August of 2010 a renewed application was made  and
    a further residence card was granted valid until December 2015.  In the
    interim, as I have noted, they divorced in December 2012.

 3. The case has not been helped by the absence of  the  Home  Office  file
    which appears to have gone  missing  but  the  determination  of  Judge
    Fletcher-Hill makes a suggestion  that  no  further  documentation  was
    supplied and available to him.   We  have  before  us  the  Notice  and
    Grounds of Appeal which appear to have  been  submitted  with  a  large
    amount  of  documentation  including  copies  of  passports  and  other
    supporting documentation such as a business rate bill, phone  line  and
    the like.  It is clear to us that information that perhaps should  have
    come to the attention of Judge Fletcher-Hill did not.

 4. The issue is straightforward.  The issue of a  residence  card  by  the
    Secretary of State can be taken by  us  to  be  an  acceptance  by  the
    Secretary of State of the facts that underlie it.  In  this  case  that
    the applicant or the appellant had been in the UK,  residing  with  her
    German husband and that in the circumstances she was  entitled  to  the
    grant of a residence card  and  that  means  that  he  must  have  been
    exercising treaty rights at all relevant times.  Having entered in 2005
    and divorced in 2012 that would give her a continuous period  of  seven
    years' residence in the UK with a  German  national  exercising  treaty
    rights.  That length of residence in those circumstances clearly  meets
    the requirements of Regulation 15(1)(b) and in those circumstances  the
    appellant's appeal ought to have been allowed.

NOTICE OF DECISION

 5. On the basis of the evidence before us we set  aside  the  decision  of
    Judge Flether-Hill.  We re-make the decision and allow the  appellant's
    appeal.

 6. No anonymity direction is made.
