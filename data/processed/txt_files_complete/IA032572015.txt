                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal
    dated 1 April 2015.  The appellant is a Nigerian national born 16 May
    1990.   On 30 September 2014 he made an application for a resident card
    as a confirmation of a right to reside  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    respondent refused that application in a letter of 7 January 2015.

2.   The respondent had not been satisfied that the appellant  had  provided
    sufficient evidence to demonstrate that their EEA Family Member (  "the
    sponsor") was in employment in the UK and therefore  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom as  defined  under  Regulation 6  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The sponsor was his wife who is a
    Portuguese national and a student in the United  Kingdom  but  who  was
    said to have employment in order to have sufficient resources  to  live
    in the United Kingdom.

3.   The Tribunal was presented  with  certain  documentary  evidence  which
    purported to relate to the sponsors  employment  and  in  particular  a
    letter dated 4 March 2015 from "So Clean"  which  confirmed  that  the
    sponsor started working with that company on 14 February 2015 and  had
    worked a total of 50 hours.  The Tribunal concluded at paragraph 11:

         "In any event it is clear that the sponsor was not working for this
         organisation at the time of the application or at the date  of  the
         decision."

    It was not satisfied that the appellant had shown that the sponsor  was
    a qualified person as a worker within the United Kingdom.   The  appeal
    was therefore refused.

4.   The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal on the basis of  an  error
    of law in that the First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to  accept  the
    sponsors then present work as admissible to satisfy the requirements of
    the EEA Regulations.  In particular, it had failed to  have  regard  to
    documentary evidence which demonstrated that sponsor's employment after
    the date  of  the  appellant's  application  or  the  decision  of  the
    respondent appealed against.

5.   Mr Akindele for the appellant submitted further  documentary  evidence
    to us which purported to demonstrate  that  the  sponsor  had  been  in
    employment.  In  particular  payslips  in  the  name  of  the  sponsor,
    apparently issued by So Clean were  produced  which  appeared  to  show
    payments made to the sponsor from 1 April to  16 September  2015  and
    which  show  fortnightly  payments  of  �91.80.   Those  payments   are
    supported by bank  statements  in  the  name  of  the  sponsor  showing
    payments appearing a few days after the date of the payslip in the same
    amount.

6.   Miss Fijiwala for the respondent did not object to this material being
    produced to us at this stage.   She confined herself  to  pointing  out
    that in respect of a payment of �254.30 appearing on the sponsors  bank
    statement of 6 March 2015 there was no vouching for a payment of  that
    amount from So Clean to the sponsor.

7.   We are satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred  in  law
    in failing to have regard to documentary evidence which post-dated  the
    date of the decision appealed against which was before  that  Tribunal.
    It is clear in our view that the unchallenged evidence  was  sufficient
    to establish that, at the date of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal the sponsor was exercising Treaty Rights.  We  set  aside  the
    decision and remake it. We therefore are able to examine  the  material
    provided to us during this appeal in the absence of  objection  by  the
    respondent  or  any  application  for  the  matter  to  defer  for  the
    respondent to check the provenance of the documents provided.

8.   Having examined the documents  offered,  together  with  the  documents
    already produced, we are satisfied on balance, that the  appellant  has
    demonstrated that the sponsor was in employment for the  period  up  to
    16 September 2015 and, accordingly, that she is exercising her  treaty
    rights and is employed by So Clean under a contract of employment dated
    3 September 2014.  We  therefore  allow  this  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulation.

9.   No anonymity direction is made.
