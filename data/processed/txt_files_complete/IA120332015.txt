Representation:

For the claimant: No attendance or representation
For the appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Muhammad Osama Nasir, date of birth 2.11.90, is a citizen
    of Pakistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Monaghan promulgated 18.11.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    18.3.15, to refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK  as  a
    Tier 4 student.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.11.15.

 3. Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting  as  a  judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, granted permission to appeal on 28.4.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.6.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found clear error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Monaghan to be set aside and the decision in  the
    appeal remade by dismissing it.

 6. There was no attendance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  claimant.  I  was
    satisfied from the correspondence in the case file  that  the  decision
    granting permission to appeal and the notice of the hearing  before  me
    was sent by post to the claimant at the same address he listed  in  his
    notice and grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. There has been
    no correspondence from him since. No representative is listed  on  file
    and I note that he appeared in person and unrepresented at  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  hearing.  In  the  circumstances,  I  found  that   the
    overriding objective was best met in this case by  proceeding  to  hear
    the case as I am permitted to do by virtue of the Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules, as amended.

 7. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    claimant first came to the UK in 2011 with leave as a student. He seems
    to have been rather unfortunate in his choice of  educational  sponsor,
    the licence of both the first and second colleges he enrolled  at  were
    revoked and his leave was curtailed. His application was suspended  for
    60 days, to enable him to find a new licensed educational  sponsor,  or
    submit a fresh application in a different category for leave to remain.
    The claimant was apparently unable to find any  new  sponsor  and  thus
    when considered his application was without any valid  confirmation  of
    acceptance  for  studies  (CAS).  Consequently,  the  application   was
    refused.

 8. At �29 the judge noted that the refusal  decision  referred  to  a  CAS
    assigned by London School of Commerce and that  this  college  was  not
    listed in the register of licensed sponsors when  checked  on  15.1.15.
    The claimant's application did not relate to London School of Commerce.
    The CAS he submitted was issued by  Westbridge  College,  which  was  a
    licenced sponsor when the CAS was issued but whose  licence  had  since
    been revoked. The reference to London School of Commerce was clearly an
    error. At the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing the representative  of
    the Secretary of State sought to amend the refusal decision to  correct
    this error, which the judge refused.

 9. At �32 the judge considered that the refusal decision was in  error  in
    identifying the CAS as being from London School  of  Commerce  and  had
    provided no evidence to show that London  School  of  Commerce  is  not
    listed in the Tier 4 register. At �33  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was in error and allowed the  appeal
    on that limited basis.

10. That decision was in plain error of law. It is clear, and the  claimant
    did not assert otherwise, that despite being given the  opportunity  to
    find a new sponsor, or make a new application on other grounds, he  did
    not have a CAS from a college listed in the register of Tier 4 licensed
    educational  sponsors.  In  the  circumstances,  the  refusal  of   the
    application was inevitable. There was no valid ground of appeal against
    that refusal decision and Judge  Monaghan  should  have  dismissed  the
    appeal on the Immigration Rules.

11. Having, in error of law,  allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  obviously  did  not  go  on  to
    consider any article 8 private or family life claim.

12. It is clear that the appellant does not come within either Appendix  FM
    or paragraph 276ADE. In particular he has not shown that there are  any
    very significant obstacles to his integration in Pakistan, where he has
    lived most of his life before coming to the UK on an entirely temporary
    basis to study. He has family, social and cultural ties to Pakistan.

13. However, before article 8 ECHR can be considered outside the Rules  the
    claimant must demonstrate that  there  are  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside Rules under article  8  ECHR,  on  the
    basis that the decision is unjustifiably harsh. In SSHD v SS (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal re-stated the context  and
    considered the role of public policy as expressed in the Rules  in  the
    proportionality assessment. The decision maker is  entitled  to  decide
    that Article 8 considerations have been fully addressed  in  the  Rules
    when dealing with 'stage two'.  If they have, it is enough to  say  so.
    This will necessarily involve deciding whether there is a 'gap' between
    the Rules and Article 8, and then whether there  are  circumstances  in
    the case under consideration which take it outside the class  of  cases
    which the Rules properly provide for.  Whether these circumstances  are
    described  as  'compelling'  or  'exceptional'  is  not  a  matter   of
    substance.  They must be relevant, weighty, and not fully provided  for
    within the Rules.  In practice they are likely to  be  both  compelling
    and exceptional, but this is not a legal requirement.  The first stage,
    therefore, is to assess how completely  the  Rules  reflect  Article  8
    considerations.


14. Whilst one may have some sympathy for the claimant's situation,  I  can
    see  no  rationally  identifiable   compelling   reasons   inadequately
    recognised under the Immigration Rules so as to justify granting  leave
    to remain outside the Rules on the basis  of  article  8  ECHR  private
    and/or  family  life.  The  Rules  provide  a  fair  and  comprehensive
    framework to enable  students  to  pursue  study  in  the  UK  and  for
    extension of leave. That system includes the requirements to have a CAS
    and to meet other specific evidential requirements.  Whatever  sympathy
    one might have for the appellant's  predicament,  article  8  does  not
    grant a right of education.

15. Even if, in the alternative, article 8 is to be considered on a  Razgar
    stepped approach, there is no evidence of any family life sufficient to
    engage article 8 and there is clear case authority, including Nasim and
    Patel that private life as a student does not normally engage the moral
    and physical integrity article 8 is intended to protect.

16. In any article 8 assessment I would have to have regard to the relevant
    case law of Nasim & Ors (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025  (IAC),  limiting
    the ambit of a student's private life engagement with article 8 ECHR.

17. In Nasim,  the  Upper  Tribunal  considered  whether  the  hypothetical
    removal of the 22 PBS claimants, pursuant to the decision to refuse  to
    vary leave, would violate the UK's obligations under  article  8  ECHR.
    Whilst each case must be determined on its merits, the  Tribunal  noted
    that the judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel  and  Others  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and  purpose
    of article 8  of  the  ECHR  and,  in  particular,  to  recognise  that
    article's limited utility in private life cases that  are  far  removed
    from the protection of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

18. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

19. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

20. The panel pointed out that at this point on the continuum,

         "the essential elements of the private life relied on will normally
         be transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in
         their essential respects, following a person's return to their home
         country, (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its  limited  utility  to  an
         individual where one has  moved  along  the  continuum,  from  that
         Article's core area of operation towards what might be described as
         its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises, both from what  will  at
         that point normally be the tangential effect on the  individual  of
         the proposed interference and from the fact that, unless there  are
         particular reasons to  reduce  the  public  interest  of  enforcing
         immigration controls, that interest will  consequently  prevail  in
         striking the proportionality balance (even assuming that  stage  is
         reached)."

21. Applying that law to the present case, whilst each case must be decided
    on its own facts, the desire of the appellant to  continue  studies  in
    the UK does not on the facts of this case engage article 8 private life
    at all. He is free to pursue studies in Pakistan or  elsewhere,  or  to
    make a fresh application from outside the UK for  entry  clearance  for
    that purpose. It is not essential to his right to a private  life  that
    he be permitted to  continue  studies  in  the  UK  and  the  right  to
    education is not protected under article 8. In the circumstances, it is
    difficult to see how any compelling circumstances could  be  identified
    on the facts of this case that would justify granting leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR. There is no  credible
    article 8 claim in this case.

22. Further, I find that there  was  nothing  procedurally  unfair  in  the
    application of the Rules to the  appellant's  circumstances,  when  the
    Rules provide a fair and coherent system of immigration control. It  is
    not the fault or responsibility of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  he
    failed to obtain a CAS. The Secretary of State is not obliged to enable
    students to study or obtain certain qualifications or life ambitions.

23. In Marghia (procedural fairness) [2014] UKUT  00366  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal held that the common law duty of fairness is essentially about
    procedural fairness. There is no absolute duty at common  law  to  make
    decisions which are  substantially  "fair,"  and  the  court  will  not
    interfere unless the decision in question fall foul of  the  Wednesbury
    test, i.e. that no reasonable decision-maker or public body could  have
    arrived at such a decision.

24. In EK (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517, the  Court  of  Appeal
    was dealing with an appellant whose CAS had expired by the date of  the
    Secretary of State's decision. The Court held at �25 that there was  no
    breach of the public law duty to act fairly, stating, "The Secretary of
    State is not responsible for the general unfairness which the appellant
    has suffered. That is  the  result  of  actions  and  omissions  by  St
    Stephen's. There is no basis on which  any  of  the  decisions  of  the
    Secretary of State, the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal  can
    be impugned as unlawful." It was  also  held  that  fairness  does  not
    require the Secretary  of  State  to  correct  applications,  or  delay
    decisions to enquire about a CAS.

25. When considering article 8 outside the Rules the Tribunal would have to
    consider section 117B of the 2002 Act, to the effect that little weight
    should be given to  a  private  life  developed  in  the  UK  when  the
    claimant's immigration status was at all times precarious. AM (S  117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) held, inter alia, that:

         (3)  Parliament has now  drawn  a  sharp  distinction  between  any
         period  of  time  during  which  a  person  has  been  in  the   UK
         "unlawfully", and any period of time  during  which  that  person's
         immigration status in the UK was merely "precarious".

          (4) Those who at any given  date  held  a  precarious  immigration
         status must have held at that date an  otherwise  lawful  grant  of
         leave to enter or to  remain.  A  person's  immigration  status  is
         "precarious"  if  their  continued  presence  in  the  UK  will  be
         dependent upon their obtaining a further grant of leave.

26. The appellant's immigration status was at all times precarious and thus
    little weight attaches to any private life developed in the UK. In  any
    event, article 8 ECHR is not a general dispensing power for  those  who
    do not meet the requirements of the Rules.

27. It is thus clear that  there  is  nothing  disproportionate  about  the
    refusal decision and no basis to allow the  appeal  outside  the  Rules
    under article 8 ECHR.

28. On the facts of this case, even as set out in the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, it was inevitable that the application would be  refused
    and the appeal should have been dismissed at the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

29. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    both immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the claimant has been dismissed.
