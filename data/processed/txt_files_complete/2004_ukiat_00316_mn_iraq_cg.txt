|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                          |

For the Appellant:           Mr C Yeo, a Legal Representative of the IAS
                       (Tribunal Unit)
For the Respondent:    Mr A Hutton, a Home Office Presenting Officer

1.    This appeal is being issued to give country guidance on  the  question
of proportionality of removal of Iraqi  citizens  under  Article  8  of  the
European Convention having regard to the  availability  of  entry  clearance
facilities in  Jordan  for  Iraqi  citizens.   It  follows  and  adopts  the
reasoning  of  the  Tribunal  in   two   reported   decisions,   namely   HC
(Availability  of  Entry  Clearance  Facilities)  Iraq  2004   UKIAT   00154
promulgated on 9 June 2004 and EA (Article 8  -  Entry  Clearance  -  Delay)
Iraq [2004] UKIAT 00236 promulgated on 25 August 2004.

     2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 21 March 1982 in Jalola.
         He is of Kurdish ethnicity.  He  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom
        clandestinely on 22 February 2002 and claimed asylum on that  date.
        Following the submission  of  a  statement  and  an  interview  the
        Secretary  of  State  refused  his  application  for  the   reasons
        contained in  a  letter  dated  9  December  2003.   There  was  no
        consideration in that letter of the basis of the  Article  8  claim
        which the appellant subsequently made before the  Adjudicator.   On
        15 December 2003 the  Secretary  of  State  issued  notice  of  his
        decision to remove the Appellant to  Iraq  as  an  illegal  entrant
        after refusal of his asylum claim.  Illegal  entry  papers  had  in
        fact been served on him on 22 February 2002, the day of his arrival
        in the United Kingdom.


     3. The Appellant appealed against that decision  on  both  asylum  and
        human rights grounds and his appeal was heard on 4  March  2004  by
        Mrs N A Baird,  an  Adjudicator.   She  did  not  accept  that  the
        Appellant would have any problems on account of the  accepted  fact
        that he had in the past sold car parts belonging to the army, given
        that the Ba'ath party were no longer in power  and  the  regime  of
        Saddam Hussein had fallen.  This was  accepted  by  the  Appellant.
        She rejected his claim based on  a  blood  feud  as  there  was  no
        credible evidence that the Appellant would be at any risk for  this
        reason in his home area.  For those reasons  both  the  asylum  and
        Article 3 claims were dismissed.  The Appellant does  not  seek  to
        challenge the findings of the Adjudicator in this respect.

     4. Before the Adjudicator he also claimed that his removal would be in
        breach of his right to family life under Article 8 of the  European
        Convention by reason of the relationship which he had entered  into
        with      [                    ].   At  the  date  of  the  hearing
        before  the  Adjudicator  it  was  some  eleven  months  since  the
        commencement  of  their  relationship  and  they  had  been  living
        together for the previous five  months.   They  became  engaged  in
        January  2004   and   planned   to   marry   in   the   future.   [
        ]         had a 5 year old daughter from her  former  marriage  who
        had regular weekend contact with her father but since they had been
        together the Appellant had developed a relationship with the  child
        also. [               ] said that she could not go to live in  Iraq
        because this would interfere with her daughter's contact  with  the
        daughter's father.  The Appellant  had  explained  his  immigration
        status to [               ] soon after they had met.

     5. The Adjudicator dealt with the Article 8 claim at paragraphs 45  to
        49 of her determination in the following terms:

      "45.  The fact is that both parties knew that  the  Appellant  had  no
          status  in  this  country  when  they   became   involved   in   a
          relationship.  When they got engaged in January  this  year,  they
          knew this appeal was pending.


      46.   I accept that they live together.  I accept  that  they  have  a
          family  life  together.   I  accept  that  there   would   be   an
          interference with this family life if the Appellant had to  return
          alone to Iraq.


      47.   In considering whether there are insurmountable obstacles to the
          Appellant's fianc�e travelling with him to Iraq, I find  that  the
          fact that she had a 5 year old child who lives with her own father
          every weekend does constitute an insurmountable  obstacle.   There
          is a court order granting contact.  I do accept that this could be
          varied but I see no reason why it  should  be.   The  child  would
          suffer if she did not have regular contact  with  her  father.   I
          therefore think that this is an insurmountable obstacle.


      48.   I turn now to the question of whether the interference with  the
          family life of the couple which would result from  him  having  to
          return to Iraq to seek  entry  clearance  as  a  fianc�  would  be
          disproportionate to the need for effective immigration control.  I
          understand that the British Embassy  in  Jordan  is  dealing  with
          applications from Iraqi citizens who want entry clearance to  come
          to the United Kingdom.  The system  appears  to  be  working.   Ms
          Taylor [who represented  the  Appellant  before  the  Adjudicator]
          suggested that the ECO dealing with  the  Appellant's  application
          might be biased.  I cannot assume this.  I do not think I can take
          this  into  account.   The  ECO  is  charged  with  the  task   of
          establishing  whether  or  not  an  applicant  complies  with  the
          Immigration Rules,  and  given  the  support  of  the  Appellant's
          fianc�e and her family and the fact that they have  been  together
          for eleven months, I must take the view that any application  made
          by the Appellant would be dealt with  fairly,  and  in  accordance
          with the Immigration Rules.  There would also of course be a right
          of appeal if the application were refused.


      49.   In finding  that  it  would  not  be  disproportionate  for  the
          Appellant to have to apply for entry clearance, I take account  of
          the fact that his girlfriend does have family  here.   The  couple
          are not married.  She has her daughter here.  She and  her  family
          would be able to provide documentary evidence of the  strength  of
          their relationship.  I take account of the  fact  that  they  both
          knew that he had no status when  they  became  engaged,  and  that
          there was a possibility that he might have to return to Iraq."


6.     The  Adjudicator  then  went  on  to  find  there  would  not  be   a
disproportionate interference with the family life  of  the  Appellant  with
his fianc�e and her child if he had to return to Iraq and proceed to  Jordan
to make an application for clearance as the fianc�  of  a  British  citizen.
She accordingly dismissed the Article 8 claim also.

7.    The Appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal to  the
Tribunal on the practicability of applying as an Iraqi for  entry  clearance
from Jordan.  This was put in the grounds of appeal in the following terms:

      "1.   The Appellant does not have any  kind  of  passport  or  Interim
          Travel Document (ITD).  The British Embassy in Amman  makes  clear
          in  its  procedures  for  Iraqi  nationals  that  'Interim  Travel
          Documents are acceptable for travel to  the  UK'.   The  Appellant
          would be in difficulties obtaining an ITD as there is currently no
          Iraqi consular presence in  the  UK  to  issue  such  a  document.
          Moreover, there is  some  suggestion  that  the  ITD's  have  been
          restricted to 'senior  officials,  businessmen  and  journalists',
          according to Tareek al-Shaab, a publication issued  by  the  Iraqi
          Communist party.
            Therefore the Appellant would not be able to travel to Jordan to
          make the relevant applications.


      2.    The IAS Counsellor who had conduct of this matter before the IAA
          made submissions to the  Adjudicator  on  this  very  point.   The
          Adjudicator appears not to have considered  or  alluded  to  these
          submissions.


      3.    The Adjudicator states  the  system  'appears  to  be  working'.
          However she does not state where this information emanates from."


8.    At the hearing  Mr  Hutton  relied  upon  the  two  Tribunal  reported
decisions to which we have referred in paragraph 1 above.  Mr  Yeo  accepted
that  in  light  of  these  decisions  he  was  in  some  difficulties   but
nevertheless drew our attention to a feature article broadcast  on  Radio  3
Europe/Radio Liberty on 3 February 2004 entitled "Iraq:  Now  that  Saddam's
gone, Iraqis are free to travel the world  -  at  least  in  theory".   This
article  claimed  that  obtaining  ITDs  from  the   Coalition   Provisional
Authority in Iraq (which was the responsible authority at the  date  of  the
hearing before the Adjudicator) was a problem "due to the  high  demand  and
long lines".  It was  also  claimed  that  possession  of  an  ITD  did  not
necessarily result in admission to Jordan although under  Jordanian  law  no
visas for Iraqi citizens are required before  they  are  admitted.   It  was
claimed that Iraqis are subjected to special security checks at  the  border
and many are turned back despite having the proper  documents.   The  report
went on to say,  however,  that  the  Charg�  d'affaires  at  the  Jordanian
Embassy in Baghdad said that it was simple for Iraqis  to  reach  Jordan  as
they did not require  visas  but  simply  a  valid  ITD  or  a  valid  Iraqi
passport.   He  did,  however,  say  that  the  Jordanian  authorities  were
concerned by the number of forged travel  documents  presented  which  would
result in people being turned away at the border.   Those  who  had  genuine
travel documents, however, could travel into Jordan.

9.    It seems to us clear - and Mr Yeo did not demur from this -  that  the
article in question does  confirm  on  the  basis  of  what  is  said  by  a
Jordanian official that a regularly issued ITD or  a  valid  Iraqi  passport
previously issued will each be accepted as a proper basis for entry  without
further requirements into Jordan where, as the Adjudicator  rightly  states,
the British Embassy has made special arrangements  to  process  applications
for entry clearance to the United Kingdom from Iraqi citizens provided  that
they can attend at an interview in the British Embassy at Amman.

10.   The facts of the present appeal are very similar to  those  considered
by the Tribunal in HC where the appellant had married a British national  in
June 2003 following a relationship which  commenced  in  February  2002  and
their living together  since  May  2002.   In  that  case  also  there  were
children of a former marriage. There were also claimed difficulties for  the
British spouse and her children  in  accompanying  the  appellant  to  Iraq.
Proportionality of removal was the issue before the Tribunal.

11.   Applying the ratio  in  Mahmood  [2001]  INLR  1,  absent  exceptional
circumstances, it is not disproportionate to  require  a  claimant  who  has
entered into a family relationship in the United Kingdom whilst his  or  her
own immigration status is uncertain, to return to his  or  her  own  country
for the purpose of making  a  relevant  application  under  the  Immigration
Rules for admission as a spouse or fianc�e as the case  may  be.   The  fact
that the application may not be successful does  not  affect  the  issue  of
proportionality of removal for the purposes of  Article  8,  the  underlying
reason for such a requirement for  making  an  out  of  country  application
being that it is to avoid those in the country securing an unfair  advantage
over those waiting to make the relevant application from their own  country.
It is also implicit that any normal  procedural  delays  in  the  course  of
making such an application cannot affect issues of proportionality either.

12.   The impossibility of making an application from a  foreign  national's
own country is not restricted to Iraq. A similar situation  applies  in  the
province of Kosovo in the Republic of Serbia and  Montenegro  and  this  was
considered by the Tribunal in [2003] UKIAT 00011 J (Serbia and  Montenegro).
 The Tribunal  held  that  the  absence  of  any  facilities  within  Kosovo
operated by the United Kingdom to manage the grant of visa applications  did
not make it  disproportionate  to  expect  the  claimant  to  make  such  an
application from neighbouring countries to which he would  have  access  and
where the appropriate Embassies or High Commissions existed.

13.   In the case of Iraq the objective evidence shows that since  at  least
18  September  2003  the  British  Embassy  in  Amman  in  Jordan  has  been
designated as the appropriate point  at  which  Iraqi  citizen  should  make
applications under the Immigration Rules,  HC  395.   Paragraph  28  of  the
Rules, dealing  with  applications  other  than  for  European  Area  family
permits, provides that they:

      "...must be made to the post in the country  or  territory  where  the
      applicant is living which has been  designated  by  the  Secretary  of
      State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose  and
      from that category of applicants.  Where there is  no  such  post  the
      applicant must apply to the appropriate designated  post  outside  the
      country or territory where he is living."


14.   The post in Amman is so designated and a letter of 18  September  2003
from UK  Visas  (whose  headed  notepaper  mentions  both  the  Foreign  and
Commonwealth Office and the Home Office) states that  15  per  cent  of  the
caseload  of  the  visa  section  in  Amman  is  spent  dealing  with  Iraqi
applications and that "Iraqi applications are made every day of the week".

15.   In HC the Tribunal, after reviewing all the  relevant  evidence  about
the practicality of making  applications  through  the  Embassy  in  Jordan,
summarised the situation as follows at paragraph 17 of their determination:

      "The Tribunal is able to deduce the following from this material:


          a.      Iraqi citizens are able to travel to Jordan either using a
              passport issued under the regime  of  Sadaam  Hussein  or  an
              Interim Travel Document issued by the  Coalition  Provisional
              Authority or the present Iraqi Ministry of Interior Office.
          b.      There is  no  suggestion  that  the  Jordanian  government
              itself requires a visa for entry.
          c.      Were the Jordanian government preventing  Iraqi  nationals
              entering the country, we  would  expect  this  to  have  been
              mentioned.
          d.      There is no suggestion that any distinction can  be  drawn
              between an  Iraqi  passport  holder  and  an  Iraqi  national
              holding an ITD.  There would be  very  little  point  in  the
              present Iraqi authorities issuing ITDs if they were unable to
              perform the task for which  they  were  issued,  namely,  the
              facilitation of international travel.
          e.      From time to time, the border between Jordan and Iraq  may
              be closed for security reasons  but  this  does  not  prevent
              travel to Jordan and but [sic] may delay it.
          f.      The fact that 15 percent of the workload  of  the  British
              Embassy  in  Amman  is  concerned  with  Iraqi   applications
              indicates that  there  is  a  substantial  traffic  of  Iraqi
              nationals into Jordan for the purpose, at least in  part,  of
              applying for entry clearance. "


16.   The Tribunal then went on to consider claims that  such  travel  would
be too dangerous  but  rejected  such  claims  saying  that  whilst  it  was
accepted the background evidence established that there  was  a  possibility
that there might be dangers involved for those travelling  from  Baghdad  to
Amman (especially for Western journalists and Coalition soldiers), they  did
not consider it established a reasonable likelihood that the claimant  could
not make the journey without adverse consequences  or  a  violation  of  his
human rights.  It was pointed out that  it  was  accepted  that  there  were
large numbers of persons making the journey.   They  noted  that  the  Royal
Jordanian Airline operated an almost daily flight between Amman and  Baghdad
which was said to be popular  among  Iraqi  and  Jordanian  businessmen  and
diplomats from some western countries and that more than 600 Iraqi  citizens
legally cross the border between Iraq and Jordan  on  a  daily  basis  where
they could enter without a visa and stay for up to six months (derived  from
the British/Danish Fact-finding Report on Iraq of July 2003).  The  Tribunal
noted further that cost to the appellant  was  rarely  considered  to  be  a
decisive factor in Article 8 appeals and that there  was  no  evidence  that
cost was so prohibitive as to render its use by HC impossible.

17.   For those reasons the Tribunal considered  that  there  was  a  viable
option available to HC to return to Iraq and apply for entry clearance as  a
spouse and that "although this will involve travel  to  Jordan,  we  do  not
consider the difficulties are  such  as  to  render  this  decision  of  the
Secretary of State disproportionate."

18.   There has been no evidence produced to  us  to  persuade  us  that  it
would be appropriate to differ from the views of the Tribunal  as  expressed
in HC.  Taking into account the totality  of  the  evidence  before  us,  we
therefore conclude that even if  there  are  insuperable  obstacles  to  the
family travelling to Iraq, it would nevertheless not be disproportionate  to
the right to family life of the Appellant for him to be required  to  return
to his own country where appropriate facilities via the British  Embassy  in
Jordan for making an application for entry clearance under  the  Immigration
Rules HC 395, as amended, exist.  There  are  no  exceptional  circumstances
which would render removal disproportionate.

19.   It follows that the grounds of appeal before us do  not  identify  any
material error of law on the part  of  the  Adjudicator  but  that,  on  the
contrary, on the evidence before her and  by  reference  to  the  principles
enunciated in HC, which were followed and applied by  the  Tribunal  in  EA,
the decision of the Adjudicator  is  clearly  sustainable.   Absent  such  a
material error of law, and since this is an appeal to which  the  provisions
of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,   we   have   no
jurisdiction to interfere with the decision of the Adjudicator.  On  similar
evidence, however,  had  it  been  appropriate  for  us  to  reconsider  the
position as at the date of this hearing, we  would  have  reached  the  same
conclusion.

20.   This appeal is accordingly dismissed.
