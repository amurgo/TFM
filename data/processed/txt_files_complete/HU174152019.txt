This is a decision on the  papers  without  a  hearing.  On  behalf  of  the
Secretary of State, it was confirmed that a decision could appropriately  be
made on the papers. The respondent objected and requested an  oral  hearing.
The documents described at para  4  below  were  submitted.  A  face-to-face
hearing or a remote hearing was not held for the reasons given at  paras  6-
18 below. The order made is  set  out  at  para  43  below.  (Administrative
Instruction No. 2 from the Senior President of Tribunals).

Representation (by written submissions):
For the appellant:     Mr  Z  Jafferji,  of  Counsel  instructed  by  London
                    Imperial Immigration Services.
For the respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer.


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Rothwell who, in a decision promulgated on 2 January 2020
    following a hearing on 20 December  2019,  allowed  the  appeal  of  Mr
    Patel, a national of  India  born  on  10  March  1963  (hereafter  the
    "claimant") on human rights grounds (Article 8) against a  decision  of
    the Secretary of State of 15 October 2019 to refuse leave to remain  on
    human rights grounds after  having  considered  his  application  of  2
    October 2019 for leave to remain under the 10-year parent route of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")  in
    a decision signed on 31 March 2020 and sent to the parties  on  28  May
    2020.

 3. On 22 June 2020, the Upper Tribunal sent to the  parties  a  "Note  and
    Directions" issued by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley dated 12 June 2020.
    Para 1 of the "Note and Directions" stated that, in light of  the  need
    to take precautions against the spread of Covid-19, Judge Lindsley  had
    reached the provisional view, having reviewed the file  in  this  case,
    that it would be appropriate to determine questions (a) and (b) set out
    at para 1 of her "Note & Directions", reproduced at my para 5(i)(a) and
    (b) below,  without  a  hearing.  Judge  Lindsley  gave  the  following
    directions:

         (i)  Para 2 of the "Note and Directions"  issued  directions  which
         provided  for  the  party  who  had  sought  permission   to   make
         submissions in support of the assertion of an error of law  and  on
         the question whether the decision of the FtT should be set aside if
         error of law is found, within 14 days of the "Note and  Directions"
         being sent to the parties; for any other party to  file  and  serve
         submissions  in  response,  within  21  days  of  the   "Note   and
         Directions" being sent; and, if such submissions in  response  were
         made, for the party who sought permission to file a reply no  later
         than 28 days of the "Note and Directions" being sent.

         (ii) Para 3 of the "Note and Directions" stated that any party  who
         considered that despite the  foregoing  directions  a  hearing  was
         necessary to consider questions (a) and (b) may submit reasons  for
         that view no later than 21 days of the "Note and Directions"  being
         sent to the parties.

 4. In response to the  "Note  and  Directions",  the  Upper  Tribunal  has
    received the following:

         (i)  on the  Secretary  of  State's  behalf,  a  document  entitled
         "Secretary of State's submissions" dated 29 June 2020 by Mr Clarke,
         submitted to the Upper Tribunal under cover of an  email  dated  29
         June 2020 timed at 13:58 hours; and

         (ii) on the claimant's behalf, the following documents:

             (a)  a document entitled: "Appellant's Submissions re Error of
             law" dated 13 July 2020 by Mr Jafferji submitted by post under
             cover of a letter from London  Imperial  Immigration  Services
             dated 13 July 2020 and by email of  the  same  date  timed  at
             14:28 hours; and

             (b)  a document entitled:  "Appellant's  Submissions  re  Oral
             Hearing" dated 16 July 2020 by Mr Jafferji submitted  by  post
             under cover of  a  letter  from  London  Imperial  Immigration
             Services dated 16 July 2020 and by  email  of  the  same  date
             timed at 15:21 hours.

The issues

 5. I have to decide the following issues (hereafter the "Issues"),

         (i)  whether it is appropriate to decide  the  following  questions
         without a hearing:

             (a)  whether the decision of the Judge involved the making  of
             an error on a point of law; and

             (b)  if yes, whether the Judge's decision should be set aside.



         (ii) If yes, whether the decision on the claimant's appeal  against
         the Secretary of State's decision should be re-made  in  the  Upper
         Tribunal or whether the appeal should be remitted to the FtT.

Whether it is appropriate to proceed without a hearing

 6. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Clarke submitted  (at  para  2)
    that the issue of whether the Judge's decision contains an error of law
    can be decided appropriately on the papers.

 7. On the claimant's behalf, Mr Jafferji requested an oral hearing (para 1
    of the submissions dated 16 July 2020). He submitted that the appeal is
    not straightforward, that there is a  complex  factual  background  and
    that the legal issues are also not straightforward. He goes on  to  say
    that without the ability to address the judge deciding these issues and
    any concerns that he or she might have with respect to  the  case,  the
    claimant will be deprived of a full and proper opportunity  to  advance
    his case.

 8. Mr Jafferji's submissions go on to rely  upon  Laws  LJ's  judgment  in
    Sengupta v Holmes [2002] EWCA Civ 1104 at paras 38 and 47 and  extracts
    including the judgment of Lord Bingham at para 35 and the  judgment  of
    Lord Slynn at para 48 of Smith v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 1.

 9. Mr Jafferji submitted that an oral hearing is  fundamentally  important
    in order to ensure that the claimant is able to advance his case  fully
    and properly; that, as the claimant is presently unaware of the view of
    the Upper Tribunal, he is unable to address  any  concerns  or  issues.
    Furthermore, the outcome of this appeal will have a profound impact  on
    the Article 8 ECHR rights of the claimant, his ex-wife, his daughter by
    his  ex-wife  and  his   ex-wife's   second   daughter   and   includes
    consideration of the best interests of a minor child. He submitted that
    there is a serious risk that a  decision  on  the  papers  alone  would
    result in an unfair hearing and an unfair and unsafe decision  on  this
    appeal.

10. I have carefully considered Mr Jafferji's submissions.

11. I am aware of the guidance  in  the  case-law,  including  the  Supreme
    Court's judgment in Osborn and others v Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61.  I
    have taken into account the guidance at para 2 of the  Supreme  Court's
    judgment.

12. Given that my decision is limited to the Issues, there is  no  question
    of my making findings of fact or hearing oral evidence  or  considering
    any evidence at this stage.

13. I take into account the force of the points made in Sengupta  v  Holmes
    [2002] EWCA Civ 1104 at para 38 and Wasif v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 82  at
    para 17(3) concerning the  power  of  oral  argument  as  well  as  the
    decision in R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB  256  to
    the effect that justice must be done and be seen to be done.

14. In addition, I take into account the seriousness of the issues at stake
    for the individuals concerned. For example, the principles explained in
    all of the cases I have mentioned are all the more  critical  when  the
    case concerns a claim for international protection. Although the appeal
    in the instant case was not brought on asylum grounds, the appeal  does
    concern the claimant's Article 8 claim which does involve consideration
    of the  rights  of  others,  including  a  minor  child  and  her  best
    interests. These are matters of some seriousness.

15. I have considered  all  the  circumstances  very  carefully  and  taken
    everything into account, including the overriding objective.

16. I do not agree with Mr Jafferji that this appeal is not straightforward
    or that there is a complex factual background in this case or that  the
    legal issues are not straightforward. It is self-evident, from para  19
    of this decision onwards, that none of  these  epithets  apply.  In  my
    view, none of these reasons, advanced by Mr Jafferji, are tenable.

17. Taking a preliminary view at this  stage  of  deciding  whether  it  is
    appropriate and  just  to  decide  the  Issues  without  a  hearing,  I
    considered the Judge's decision, the grounds and the submissions before
    me. I was of the view, taken provisionally at this  stage,  that  there
    was nothing complicated at all in the assessment of the Issues  in  the
    instant case, given that the grounds are simple and straightforward and
    the Judge's decision straightforward. I kept the  matter  under  review
    throughout  my  deliberations.  However,  at  the  conclusion   of   my
    deliberations, I was affirmed in the view I had taken on a  preliminary
    basis.

18. In all of the circumstances, and taking  into  account  the  overriding
    objective and having considered Osborn and others  v  Parole  Board,  I
    concluded that it is appropriate, fair and just for me to  exercise  my
    discretion and proceed to decide the Issues without a hearing.

Questions (a) and (b) - whether the Judge  erred  in  law  and  whether  her
decision should be set aside

The basis of the claimant's Article 8 claim

19. The claimant, his then wife, Rina Piyushkumar Patel (hereafter referred
    to "RP") and his daughter, Isha Piyushkumar Patel  (hereafter  referred
    to as "IP"), came to the United Kingdom on 23 April  2005  as  visitors
    and were granted six months' leave to  enter  in  that  capacity.  They
    overstayed. In 2009, RP met and started a relationship with Mr Satinder
    Singh (hereafter referred to as "SS") and she had a daughter ("M", born
    on 2 November 2010) with SS. However the claimant did  not  know  about
    the relationship and he believed that M was his child. He is  named  as
    M's father on her birth certificate.

20. The claimant and RP stopped living together in  2013  when  M  was  old
    enough to know about the situation.  But  RP  and  M  remain  in  close
    contact with him and see him very regularly. On 23  May  2019,  RP  was
    granted leave to remain because of M who is a British citizen.

21. The claimant lives with IP and has regular contact with  M.  She  calls
    him "Papa" and believes she has two fathers.

22. The claimant's Article 8 claim was also based on private life  said  to
    have been established in the  United  Kingdom  since  his  arrival  and
    difficulties that it is said he will  experience  on  reintegrating  in
    India  such  as  to  amount  to  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
    reintegration.

The Judge's decision

23. The Judge heard oral evidence  from  the  claimant,  RP  and  IP.   The
    evidence before the Judge was that M  lives  with  SS,  her  biological
    father, and RP and that she calls both SS and the claimant father/papa.



24. The Judge said that she found the claimant, RP  and  IP  were  credible
    witnesses (para 30).

25. The Judge found that there would not be very significant  obstacles  to
    the claimant's reintegration in India and therefore concluded  that  he
    did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  para  276ADE(1)(vi)  of   the
    Immigration Rules.

26. The Judge then considered the claimant's Article 8  claim  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

27. The Judge found that the claimant does have family  life  with  M.  Her
    reasons are given at paras 36-37 which read:

         "36. I find that the [claimant] does have a family life  with  [M].
             This is a very unusual case as for the first  three  to  three
             and a half years of her life he believed  that  he  was  [M's]
             birth father. He is named on  her  birth  certificate  as  her
             father as he had no idea about [RP's] relationship with [SS].

         37.   The  [claimant]  and  [M]   established   a   father/daughter
             relationship when they lived together in a family unit for the
             first 3-3 1/2 years of her life. [M] believed him  to  be  her
             father and I accept she believes that he is her father and she
             calls him papa."

28. At paras 40-42, the Judge considered whether the claimant had a genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with M and  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect M to leave the United Kingdom. She found that  the
    claimant did have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with M
    and gave her reasons for this finding at paras 40-42. She found that it
    would not be reasonable for M to leave the United Kingdom. Her  reasons
    for this finding are given at paras 42-45.  I shall now quote paras 40-
    45 of the Judge's decision:

         "40. The [claimant] falls within  section  117B(6)  as  he  is  not
             liable for deportation. I have considered the case  of  RK  as
             referred to by Mr Jafferji. This case held:[pic]

                  It is not necessary for an individual  to  have  "parental
                  responsibility" in law  for  there  to  exist  a  parental
                  relationship.

                  Whether a person who is not a biological parent  is  in  a
                  "parental relationship" with a child for the  purposes  of
                  s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
                  2002 depends on the individual circumstances  and  whether
                  the role that individual plays establishes he or  she  has
                  "stepped into the shoes" of a parent.

         [pic]41. I find that he  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with a qualifying child and it is not  reasonable
             to expect [M] to leave the United Kingdom. I find  that  there
             is a genuine and subsisting parental relationship because as I
             have found above that for the first 3-3  1/2  years  of  [M's]
             life he believed he was her birth father. He is named  on  her
             birth certificate as her father. If anything I find that it is
             [SS] who has "stepped into the shoes of a parent"[pic]

         42.  I accept that [M] believes the [claimant] is  her  father  and
             she calls him Papa. She is now aged 9 and has had two  fathers
             in her life  from  when  she  [sic]  aged  3-3  1/2.  But  the
             [claimant] has been there all her life. He still treats her as
             his daughter and I find takes  a  parental  role  in  that  he
             collects her from  school  and  looks  after  her  until  [RP]
             collects her after she finishes work.  He  takes  her  to  the
             Gujarati community school at the weekends  and  she  sometimes
             stays over. I accept that when she stays with  the  [claimant]
             she has contact with her sister [IP], but I do not  find  that
             this is [sic] reason  for  being  at  the  [claimant's]  home.
             Because I have seen photographs of the  [claimant]  with  [M],
             and photographs of him with [M], [RP]  and  [IP].  Further  he
             collects [M] from school and stays with him [sic]  until  [RP]
             collects her. [IP] works and would not be  at  home  at  these
             times during the week.

         43.  The case of KO (Nigeria) [20181 UKSC 53 held that the  conduct
             of the [claimant] is not a relevant consideration and children
             ought not to be punished for the situation of their parents.

         [pic]44. I consider s 55 and best interests of [M]. I find that  it
             is in [M's] best interests to maintain the status quo  in  her
             life. [M] believes that the [claimant] is her father and  that
             she has two fathers, as her 2nd father is  [SS].  He  was  not
             introduced into her life until she was aged 3-3 1/2.[pic]

         45.  The [Secretary of State] has not suggested that  [M]  goes  to
             India and I do not find it would be reasonable for her  to  do
             so. She lives here with her mother and her biological  father,
             [SS] who she now has a relationship. She is now aged 9 and  is
             British."

29. The Judge then considered the public interest considerations in  s.117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 at paras 46-47, the
    claimant's relationship with his daughter IP at para 48  and  concluded
    at para 49 that the decision was disproportionate  because  there  were
    exceptional circumstances in the instant case. Paras 46-49 read:

         "46. However I do consider the public interest. I apply the case of
             AM (Malawi) [20151 UKUT 260 and the [claimant's] situation has
             always been precarious here. He came as  a  visitor  and  then
             overstayed his visit visa and it is clear to me that they  had
             no intention of returning to India.[pic]

         47.  The [claimant] speaks English and there was no  evidence  that
             there is reliance on public funds. I accept he is supported by
             his daughter, [IP]. But he has used the NHS for treatment  for
             his diabetes.

         48.  I have accepted that the [claimant]  and  [IP]  have  a  close
             relationship. They live together and she cares for him and are
             mutually dependent upon each other.

         49.  Therefore balancing the rights of the [claimant] and [M], plus
             [IP]  against  the  public  interest  I  find   that   it   is
             disproportionate for the [claimant] to return to India because
             of the exceptional circumstances in this case."

The grounds

30. The grounds challenge the Judge's  finding  that  the  claimant  had  a
    parental relationship with M. The grounds contend that the Judge made a
    "material misdirection of law" and may be summarised as follows:

         (i)  The finding that the claimant has a parental relationship with
         M despite the  claimant  not  being  her  biological  parent   runs
         contrary to  the  guidance  in  Ortega  (remittal:  bias;  parental
         relationship) [2018] UKUT  00298  [pic](IAC)  and  R  (RK)  v  SSHD
         (Section 117B(6): "parental relationship") IJR  [2016]  UKUT  00031
         (IAC).  The grounds rely, inter alia, upon head-note (3) of  Ortega
         which states (emphasis supplied in the grounds):

             As stated in paragraph 44 of R (on the application  of  RK)  v
             Secretary of  State  for  the  [pic]Home  Department  (Section
             117B(6): "parental relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC),
             if a non-biological parent ("third party") caring for a  child
             claims  to  be  a  step-parent,  the  existence  of   such   a
             relationship will depend upon all the circumstances  including
             whether or not there  are  others  (usually  the  biologically
             parents) who have such a relationship with the child also.  It
             is unlikely that a person will be able to establish they  have
             taken on the role of a  parent  when  the  biological  parents
             continue to be involved in the child's  life  as  the  child's
             parents.

         (ii) As M currently resides with her biological father and  mother,
         the grounds contend that the claimant cannot be said to have  taken
         on the role of parent when "the  contrary  situation  is  correct".
         [pic]

         (iii)    The grounds contend that  "the  full  involvement  of  the
         child's biological parent would mean that the [claimant] no  longer
         has a "parental relationship" with the child as the role  is  taken
         on by the  child's  biological  parent  with  whom  they  currently
         reside".

         (iv) The Judge "... erred in  finding  that  the  [claimant]  being
         removed from the UK would not[1] result  in  the  child  having  to
         leave the UK. As the child currently resides  with  her  biological
         parents, there would be no requirement for the child to  leave  the
         UK in any event".

Submissions

31. In the Secretary of State's submissions, reliance is placed on paras 42-
    44 of RK which I have considered very carefully and which read:

         "42. Whether a person is in a "parental relationship" with a  child
             must, necessarily, depend  on  the  individual  circumstances.
             Those circumstances will include what role they actually  play
             in caring for and making decisions in relation to  the  child.
             That is likely to be a most significant  factor.  However,  it
             will also include whether that relationship arises because  of
             their legal obligations as a parent or in  lieu  of  a  parent
             under a court order or other legal obligation. I  accept  that
             it is not necessary for an [pic]individual to  have  "parental
             responsibility  in  law  for  there  to  exist   a   "parental
             relationship", although whether or not that is the  case  will
             be a relevant factor. What is important is that the individual
             can establish that they have taken on the role that a "parent"
             usually plays in the life of their child

         43.  I agree with Mr Mandalia's formulation  that,  in  effect,  an
             individual must "step into the shoes of a parent" in order  to
             establish a "parental relationship". If the  role  they  play,
             whether as a relative or friend of the family, is as a  caring
             relative or friend but not so as to take  on  the  role  of  a
             parent then it cannot be  said  that  they  have  a  "parental
             relationship" with the child. It is perhaps obvious  to  state
             that "carers "are not per se  "parents".   A  child  may  have
             carers who do not step into the shoes  of  their  parents  but
             look after the child for specific periods of time (for example
             whilst the parents are at  work)  or  even  longer  term  (for
             example where the parents are travelling abroad for a  holiday
             or family visit). Those carers may be professionally employed;
             they may be relatives; or they may be friends.  In  all  those
             cases, it may properly be said that there  is  an  element  of
             dependency between the child and his or her  carers.  However,
             that alone would not, in my judgment, give rise to a "parental
             relationship.

         44.  If a non-biological parent ("third party") caring for a  child
             claims such a relationship, its existence will depend upon all
             the circumstances including whether or not  there  are  others
             (usually  the  biologically   parents)   who   have   such   a
             relationship with the  child  also.  It  is  unlikely,  in  my
             judgment, that a person will be able to  establish  they  have
             taken on the role of a  parent  when  the  biological  parents
             continue to be involved in the child's  life  as  the  child's
             parents as in a case such as the present  where  the  children
             and parents continue  to  live  and  function  together  as  a
             family. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to say that a
             third party has "stepped into the shoes" of a parent."

32. Para 13 of the Secretary of State's submissions draws attention to  the
    fact that nowhere in  the  Judge's  reasoning  was  there  anything  to
    suggest that the  claimant  makes  any  decisions  in  respect  of  M's
    upbringing, a factor identified as a significant one in  RK,  and  that
    the "parental role" of the  claimant  identified  at  para  42  of  the
    Judge's decision was indistinguishable from that of a carer  who  looks
    after a child for specified periods.

33. In his submissions, Mr Clarke draws attention to the following: that  M
    does not live with the claimant; that there was no  evidence  from  M's
    school regarding the claimant's role; that there was no  evidence  from
    the Gujarati community regarding the claimant's role; that there was no
    evidence of financial support; that there was no evidence from  M;  and
    that there was no evidence from M's biological father.

34. Mr Clarke submits that it was not open to the Judge to  find  that  the
    claimant enjoyed a parental relationship with M  for  the  purposes  of
    s.117B(6), given:

         (i)  the paucity of evidence before the Judge;

         (ii) the lack of any evidence or findings by the Judge  as  regards
         decisions that the claimant takes with regard  to  M's  upbringing;
         and

         (iii)    that RK states that "it is unlikely, in my judgment,  that
         a person will be able to establish they have taken on the role of a
         parent when the biological parents continue to be involved  in  the
         child's life".

35. I incorporate Mr Jafferji's submissions in my assessment.

Assessment

36. The Judge was plainly aware of the decision in RK.  She referred to the
    case at para 40 of  her  decision  and  specifically  quoted  from  the
    salient paragraph, i.e. para 42 of RK. She  was plainly  aware  of  its
    guidance to the effect that, in the case of a non-biological parent, it
    is necessary to consider the role that the individual plays and whether
    this establishes that he or she has  "stepped  into  the  shoes"  of  a
    parent.

37. Whilst it is the case that M was not living with the claimant and  that
    there was no evidence before the Judge concerning the matters to  which
    Mr Clarke has drawn attention and which I have summarised  at  para  33
    above, the Judge was dealing with an unusual case, in that, M was  born
    into a family  unit  with  the  claimant  believing  that  he  was  her
    biological father and M looking to him as her biological father for the
    first 3-3 1/2 years of her life. In contrast, the decision  in  RK  did
    not concern a case that involved the unusual circumstances  that  arise
    in this case.

38. If the question whether the claimant had a parental relationship with M
    had been considered at a time when neither he nor M were aware  of  the
    true position, it is inevitably the case, on any legitimate view,  that
    the conclusion would have been that he did have a parental relationship
    with M notwithstanding that, on the true facts unknown to him and M, he
    was the third party and another man was the biological father.  If  the
    relationship did exist then, it is somewhat unrealistic to  think  that
    the claimant suddenly ceased to have a parental relationship with M the
    moment the true facts were revealed. Whether the parental  relationship
    that had undoubtedly existed between the  claimant  and  M  during  the
    first 3- 1/2 years of M's life had ceased as at the date of the hearing
    before the Judge was a matter for her.

39. The Judge was fully aware that the question was  a  case-specific  one.
    She found, having heard the evidence, that, if anything, it was SS  who
    had "stepped into the shoes of a parent".  She  was  therefore  plainly
    aware of this aspect of the guidance in RK and that it was the claimant
    who was the third party and not the biological parent.

40. The facts of this case are  unusual,  as  I  have  explained.  For  the
    reasons given above, I agree with Mr  Jafferji's  submission  that  the
    Secretary of State's submissions, summarised at my paras  31-33  above,
    amount to no more than a disagreement with the Judge's finding, in  the
    particular circumstances of this case.

41. I also agree with Mr Jafferji that the  submission  (summarised  at  my
    para 34 above), that it was not open to the  Judge  to  find  that  the
    claimant enjoyed a parental  relationship  with  M,  is  essentially  a
    submission that the finding was irrational.  As  Mr  Jafferji  submits,
    irrationality was not pleaded in the grounds. In any event,  given  the
    unusual facts of this case,  I  simply  cannot  say  that  the  Judge's
    finding that the claimant had a parental relationship with  M  was  not
    reasonably open to her.

42. For all of the reasons give above, I am satisfied that  the  Judge  did
    not err in law. The Secretary of State's appeal is therefore dismissed.
