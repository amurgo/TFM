Representation:
For the Appellant:     MR I MAKA (Counsel )
For the Respondent:    MR P ARMSTRONG (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this matter  is  Mr  Kayran.  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as "the appellant" and to "the Respondent" who is the Secretary
    of State.  This is an error of law hearing.  It  comes  before  me  for
    consideration as to whether or not there is a material error of law  in
    the decision the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Flynn)("FTT")  promulgated
    by on 18th August 2016  .

Background

2.  The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey.  He applied for leave to enter  to
    establish a business under paragraph 31 of HC 509, in  accordance  with
    the Ankara Agreement.  He wishes to start up a business selling  ethnic
    products in Skegness.

3.   The  Respondent  refused  the  application  on  the  grounds  that  the
    appellant failed to show  that  he  genuinely  wished  to  establish  a
    business, that he had insufficient funds to do so and that he would  be
    actively concerned in the running of the  business.   Specifically  the
    respondent found that the appellant  was  unable  to  explain  how  his
    forecast sales of �220,000 could be achieved in the first year.   There
    was no evidence that he had been a businessman for 20 years as claimed,
    his annual profit for 2011 was 573 TL (�198.00), there was no  evidence
    of savings of �41,000 and he had made no attempt to improve his English
    language skills since deciding to set up a business.

FTT decision

4.  In  a  decision  the  FTT  clearly  and  fully  set  out  the  evidence,
    submissions and her conclusions citing the relevant  guidance  in  case
    law Akinci(paragraph 21 HC 510- correct approach)[2012] UKUT 00266(IAC)
     [37] and EK(Ankara Agreement-  1971  rules-  construction)Turkey[2010]
    UKUT 425(IAC) [36].

5.  The FTT found that the appellant had not shown  satisfactorily  that  he
    would be able to communicate in English to be able to run his  business
    [40].  The FTT found that the appellant's business plan was  inadequate
    in that it failed to show that he had conducted research  into  how  he
    intended to achieve his proposed turnover of �220,000.   He  failed  to
    name anything apart from Turkish beer and pastries that he intended  to
    sell  and  had  not  carried  out  adequate  research  into   potential
    competitors or customers [43-44]. The FTT found evidence lacking as  to
    the source of the funds of  �40,000  that  the  appellant  proposed  to
    invest in his business as shown in his bank statement  [46].   The  FTT
    considered the expert's evidence as to the  appellant's  businesses  in
    Istanbul.  It was asserted that he ran 6  market  stalls  and  owned  a
    number of properties whose leases and tenancy agreements were  verified
    by the expert, who was a member of the Istanbul Bar [47].   As  to  the
    payment for a lease the FTT expressed difficulty in  understanding  why
    the lease  had not been signed some 9 days after the deposit was  paid.
    The FTT found inconsistency in the evidence of the lease for 48  market
    stalls run by the appellant, when it was claimed that he ran  6  stalls
    [49]. The FTT found the evidence of a cash payment for a  lease  signed
    in September 2015 purporting to  lease  out  42  market  stalls  to  be
    lacking [50-52].  The FTT found that the appellant had not  shown  that
    he either had the funds available  or  the  source  of  the  funds  for
    investment [52-54]. The FTT found  that  the  appellant's  brothers  in
    general terms gave  credible  evidence  but  that  it  was  of  limited
    relevance since they had last lived in Turkey in 2003 and  2004.  [54].
    The FTT found that the appellant could  not  demonstrate  that  he  had
    sufficient resources (by way of an estimated net profit of �12,000)  to
    meet his costs and outgoings during the first year of trading [55-57].



Application for permission to appeal

6.  In lengthy  grounds  the  appellant  argued  that  the  FTT's  delay  in
    reaching a decision caused her to overlook matters  of  relevance.   It
    was argued that  the FTT erred  by  placing  weight  on  an  incomplete
    interview record which was quoted heavily by the FTT (para 5ii).  There
    was no requirement for an applicant to speak English and the FTT was in
    error to find this a relevant factor. The  FTT's  findings  as  to  the
    existence of a grocer were inconsistent.  The  FTT  erred  because  she
    misunderstood  the  evidence  of  finances  and  was  wrong   to   find
    inconsistencies as to the number of market stalls (para 6i & ii).   The
    FTT failed to take into account the evidence of the expert  (para  5i).
    The FTT was in error by expressing a negative view as to the delay of 9
    days in the signing of a lease (para 5iii).  The  FTT  expectations  of
    evidence of the research conducted and shown in the business plan  went
    beyond that envisaged in the Rules.

Grant of permission to appeal

7.  Permission was granted by  UTJ  Allen  who  found  arguable  grounds  in
    paragraphs 5 and 6 of the further grounds (as identified above).  There
    was no merit in the argument as to the English language ability as  the
    FTT was entitled to reach and make such a finding in the context of the
    ability to run a business.

Rule 24 response

8.  The respondent opposed the application on the grounds that the  FTT  had
    directed herself  appropriately  and  prepared  a  detailed,  carefully
    considered and adequately reasoned  determination.  The  issues  raised
    amounted to disagreement with her findings and conclusions.

Preliminary issues

9.  Mr Maka sought to make an application under Rule 22(4) Procedure  Rules.
     I declined to hear this application on the grounds that the provisions
    in the Rules were not met as the FTT(IAC) was not included in the  list
    of Tribunals and the application was not made within the  correct  time
    limits.  Mr Maka did not pursue the matter further.  He confirmed  that
    he did not propose to make his application under Rule 15 at this  stage
    given that this was an error of law hearing only and new  evidence  was
    not admissible.

Submisssions

10.  Mr Maka relied on the detailed grounds in support  of  the  application
    and his skeleton argument.  It was a matter of unfairness that the  FTT
    proceeded to  hear  the  appeal  without  having  the  full  record  of
    interview with the appellant.  This had been drawn to the attention  of
    the FTT. The respondent did not have a complete record. No  application
    for an adjournment was made.  The hearing proceeded on the  basis  that
    the record was incomplete.  As a matter of fairness the FTT  ought  not
    to have placed  weight on an incomplete document and the  matter  ought
    to have been the subject of a preliminary issue.

11. The FTT failed to consider the expert report who had confirmed that  the
    lease payment was genuine.  The  FTT  overlooked  the  content  of  the
    report and/or failed to give reasons for  rejecting  it.  Her  comments
    about the late signing were irrelevant and ought not to have been made.
     The FTT relied on a document that had been translated  incorrectly  in
    that it referred to 48  wooden  boards  which  the  FTT   found  to  be
    inconsistent with the appellant's evidence that he had 6 market stalls.
     The FTT misunderstood the financial evidence and  she  did  not  raise
    this at the hearing.  Mr Maka explained how there  was  a  clear  paper
    trail to support that the funds  were  available  and  which  had  been
    converted to US dollars.

12.  Mr Armstrong relied on the Rule 24 response.  The  FTT  had  considered
    the expert report at [47] and quoted from the same.   The  question  of
    weight was a matter for the FTT.  No blame could be placed on  the  FTT
    for relying on a translation produced by the appellant which  contained
    a mistake.  That evidence was adduced  by  the  appellant.  As  to  the
    incomplete interview, Mr Armstrong submitted that no application for an
    adjournment was made by the appellant or for contact to  be  made  with
    the ECO. The appellant had not raised concerns as to the content of the
    interview and the onus was on him to make an  adjournment  application.
    It was clear that the appellant agreed to proceed with hearing  and  no
    request for determination of a preliminary issue was made. The  comment
    made about 9 days  was  not  material  to  the  appeal.   The  apparent
    misunderstanding of the finances was not material in the light  of  the
    fact that the FTT considered oral and other evidence of the appellant's
    business in Istanbul [15][23][33][28][40] and which  she  found  to  be
    inconsistent.  There was sufficient evidence for the FTT  to  make  her
    findings aside from the bank statements.  In  short  the  determination
    showed that the FTT had considered all of the evidence in the round and
    none of the issues raised were material but amounted to a disagreement.

13.  Mr Maka clarified  that  the  appellant's  brothers  had  travelled  to
    Turkey on several occasions in more recent years and their evidence was
    reliable. The FTT had imposed exacting standards to the evidence  which
    was not consistent  with  the  guidance  in  EK  or  Acinki.   Mr  Maka
    emphasised that there was no evidence  that  the  appellant  could  not
    speak English, the FTT was wrong to  find  that  he  could  not  run  a
    business, which was unrealistic given that he was  buying  an  existing
    business and he could speak some English.

14.   At the end of the hearing I reserved my  decision  which  I  now  give
    with my reasons.  It  was  accepted  by  both  representatives  that  a
    hearing de novo would be the best disposal in the event  that  I  found
    material errors in law.

Discussion and conclusion

15.  I heard the detailed submissions from Mr Maka and have  considered  the
    grounds and skeleton argument. I have decided that there is no material
    error of law in the determination by the  FTT.   Even  considering  the
    points raised cumulatively I am satisfied that the FTT looked at all of
    the evidence in the round and reached a sustainable decision  which  is
    fully reasoned and clearly set out.



16.  The appellant had every opportunity  to  make  an  application  for  an
    adjournment or for a  determination  of  a  preliminary  issue  on  the
    subject of the incomplete record of interview and did not do so.  There
    was no application made in advance of the hearing  either.  Clearly  it
    would have been preferable for the whole record to have  been  adduced,
    but given that no concerns were raised as to the content or absence  of
    content, I am satisfied that this is not a material matter.

17.  The FTT did not err  by  relying  on  the  translation  of  a  document
    adduced by the appellant albeit that it was apparent after the  hearing
    that the translation was incorrect.  It was accepted in  any  event  by
    the FTT that the appellant had 6 market stalls.

18.  The FTT referred to the evidence from  a  member  of  the  Turkish  Bar
    Association at [47] and it is clear that she considered that  evidence,
    that the appellant was the holder of 6 market stalls,  the  leases  and
    tenancy agreements were genuine and that he owned a property from which
    he received income. Whilst accepting that the FTT did not  specifically
    accept or reject the evidence of Mr Baglan, I  am  satisfied  that  she
    considered it and the question of what weight she attached was a matter
    for the FTT.  I am  satisfied  that  the  FTT  considered  all  of  the
    evidence in the round  in  reaching  her  decision  that  she  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant had shown he had the  experience,  ability
    or resources to run a business.

Decision

19.  There is no material error of  law  disclosed  in  the  decision  which
    shall stand.
