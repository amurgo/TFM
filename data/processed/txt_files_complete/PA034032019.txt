                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Zimbabwe born  in  1990.   He  appeals
       with permission against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge McAll) to dismiss his human rights and protection appeal.

    2. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that he faced  a  well-founded
       fear of persecution in Zimbabwe for reasons of his political  opinion
       (member of MDC-T). At the hearing the Respondent  accepted  that  the
       Appellant was in fact a member of the  MDC,  but  put  in  issue  his
       contention that this would place him at risk in Zimbabwe today.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the Respondent's concession that the
       Appellant was a member of the MDC whilst in Zimbabwe [�33] but it did
       not accept his account of joining the organisation in 2009 because he
       had  witnessed  human  rights  abuses  being  committed  by   Zanu-PF
       activists [�36-39].  Nor did it believe that he had been very  active
       in recent years, in particular that he organised "roughly 16" rallies
       and meetings in 2018 [�41], that he had been detained and ill-treated
       in 2016 [�42] or that there was now a  warrant  out  for  his  arrest
       following his failure to attend a Magistrates' court hearing in  July
       2018 [�44-46].  Letters purportedly from the MDC,  attesting  to  the
       Appellant's persecution,  are  found  to  be  unreliable  [�4-49].  A
       medical report confirms that he  has  an  injury  to  his  tooth  but
       nothing more [�51]; a print out of the Appellant's Facebook  page  is
       consistent with him being member of the MDC [�50]. The  determination
       then refers to CM  (EM  country  guidance;  disclosure)  Zimbabwe  CG
       [2013] UKUT 59 and finds, with reference to that  guidance  that  the
       Appellant is an ordinary member of the MDC who will be  returning  to
       Harare where he has family and social ties.  The  Tribunal  concludes
       that there is no risk of harm made out and the appeal is dismissed.

    4. The Appellant now appeals on the grounds that the First-tier Tribunal
       made the following errors of law:

             i) Failing to weigh in the balance the accepted fact  that  the
                Appellant is a member of the MDC;

            ii) Failing to weigh evidence in the round. It is submitted that
                the Judge made negative credibility findings and  then  went
                on to dismiss otherwise credible evidence on  the  basis  of
                the negative findings he had already  reached,  contrary  to
                established principle: see for instance Mibanga v  Secretary
                of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 367.




       Discussion and Findings

    5. The country guidance on Zimbabwe  remains  CM.  Although  a  lot  has
       happened in that country since  that  decision  was  promulgated  the
       parties are in agreement  that  it  remains  relevant.  The  test  is
       therefore whether the Appellant has demonstrated that he has a  well-
       founded fear of persecution as an individual with a "significant  MDC
       profile".

    6. The HOPO on the day of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal was
       prepared to accept that the Appellant  is  a  member  of  MDC-T.  The
       Tribunal accepted that concession, and reference to  it  is  made  at
       several points in the determination. I  am  not  therefore  persuaded
       that there is any merit in ground (i), since the Tribunal was plainly
       aware that the Appellant is a member of the MDC, and of  the  country
       guidance  underlining  that  this  is  itself  significant,  but  not
       determinative, in any risk assessment. The answer  to  the  arguments
       put in the grounds on this point is found at paragraphs 39 and 40  of
       the decision: "whilst I accept that the Appellant is a member of  the
       MDC I do not accept his claims as to what he says happened to him  in
       2008/2009" and "I find the Appellant's  responses  to  be  vague  and
       suggest that he had little involvement with the MDC prior to 2018 and
       after 2018 his role was a minor one limited  to  his  membership  and
       nothing more".

    7. No doubt mindful  of  those  difficulties  Mr  Ell  concentrated  his
       submissions on ground (ii). That is that the Judge is  said  to  have
       erred in failing to consider all of the evidence in the round. Mr Ell
       took me to paragraphs 39 to 42 where  the  Tribunal  reaches  adverse
       conclusions on the Appellant's  account,  before  going  on  to  then
       discount the documentary evidence that the Appellant had  adduced  in
       support of his claim. Mr Ell submitted that this is a classic Mibanga
       error, where the Judge has first reached a  negative  conclusion  and
       then rejected evidence capable of lending support to the account.

    8. I am not satisfied that this ground is made out. Judges have to start
       somewhere in making their findings. It is therefore  inevitable  that
       the Judge will start by making his findings  on  one  aspect  of  the
       evidence first. Where an error would arise  is  if  a  Judge,  having
       discounted an appellant's evidence, went to on diminish the weight to
       be attached to remaining evidence because that negative  finding  had
       already been made.    That is simply not what has happened here. What
       Judge McCall has in fact done is given cogent  and  discrete  reasons
       for rejecting each of the items of documentary evidence submitted.  I
       note that the grounds take no issue with any of the  reasons  he  has
       given in that regard. It is  therefore  impossible  to  see  how  the
       Appellant would have gained anything if Judge McAll had  started  his
       analysis with the documents, or indeed waited until the  end  of  his
       evaluation before he set out his conclusion that the claim is without
       merit.   Nowhere does the reasoning betray a Mibanga type error.




       Decision

    9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error  of
       law and it is upheld.

   10. There is no order for anonymity.
