                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Farrelly, promulgated on 30 June 2016. Permission to appeal was granted
    by Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R C Campbell on 24 April
    2017.

Anonymity

   2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason for  one
      now

Background

 3. The appellant sought entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM  of
    the Rules. That application was refused on 22 September 2015 solely  on
    the basis that the financial requirements were not  met.  Firstly,  the
    sponsor was relying on cash savings of �47,586.14,  whereas  a  sum  of
    �54,115 was required. Secondly, the funds  had  not  been  held  for  a
    minimum of 6 months prior to the submission of the application form and
    thirdly the source of �30,000 of those funds had not been demonstrated.
    Article 8 ECHR was considered however the Entry Clearance  Officer  did
    not consider there to be any exceptional circumstances.

 4.  An  Entry  Clearance  Manager  reviewed  the  decision  following  the
    appellant lodging an appeal against the  decision.  It  was  explicitly
    accepted that cash savings of �47032.50 would be required  to  make  up
    the deficit in the sponsor's income and that  this  amount  had  indeed
    been held for the  6  months  immediately  prior  to  the  application.
    Nonetheless, the original decision was maintained because there was "no
    evidence regarding where these funds have originated" and the  ECM  was
    not satisfied that they were under the control of the sponsor.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, proceeded on the  papers  as
    requested by the appellant in her notice of appeal. The judge dismissed
    the appeal because the sponsor's grant income was less  than  the  tax-
    free equivalent of �18,600, which she calculated at around �15,800. She
    concluded that the sponsor could not  combine  his  grant  income  with
    savings. The Article 8 ground of appeal was also dismissed.

The grounds of appeal

 6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable that  the
    judge erred in her assessment because the evidence before the  Tribunal
    appeared to show that combining the sponsor's grant and  the  available
    cash savings produced an amount, over �15,800,  arguably  showing  that
    the requirements of the Rules were met.

 7. The respondent's Rule 24 response, received on 10 May 2017 said  little
    other than that the appeal was opposed.

The hearing

 8. There was no attendance on behalf of the appellant. She has never  been
    legally represented. I was satisfied that the  notice  of  hearing  had
    been posted, in good time, to the appellant in Pakistan as well  as  to
    her sponsor in Luton. I therefore proceeded to hear the appeal  in  the
    absence of either a sponsor or a representative.

 9. Mr Jarvis commented that the appellant's grounds were well-written  and
    that the respondent accepted her complaint as to the judge's  findings.
    He referred to the Secretary of State's guidance,  which  said  that  a
    person can add other income or savings to a tax-free source  of  income
    and the judge was wrong to say otherwise. Mr Jarvis accepted  that  the
    documents  showed  that  sufficient  sums  were   available   for   the
    appellant's maintenance  and  invited  me  to  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision and remake it, allowing the appeal.

10. While I had no hesitation in setting aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for the same reasons indicated by Mr Jarvis,  I  declined
    to remake the decision for the following reasons.

11. There was only one matter at issue  at  the  time  of  the  appellant's
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, that of the source of the funds  and
    whether they remained under the control of the  sponsor.  The  ECM  had
    conceded the remaining issues following the review. The judge  did  not
    address this issue, even indirectly.

12. While I note that it is said that the appellant's brother in  law  gave
    the sponsor the �47,000 in question, the material before  me  does  not
    appear to address the absence of supporting evidence remarked  upon  by
    the ECM or the concern as to whether  these  funds  genuinely  remained
    under the sponsor's control.

13. Given that the appellant may not have expected the focus of the  appeal
    to have changed before the Upper Tribunal, I decided, in the  interests
    of justice, to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, de novo, to
    afford her the opportunity to address this matter at a further hearing.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at any hearing centre, with a time estimate of 1 hour by  any  judge  except
First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly.
