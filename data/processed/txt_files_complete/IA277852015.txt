Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Jacquisse, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant a national  of  Ghana,  date  of  birth  7  August  1987,
    appealed against the decisions of the Secretary of State, dated 22 July
    2015 and 19 August 2016, to refuse leave to remain.  Her appeal against
    the decisions came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bart-Stewart  (the
    Judge) who on 8 November 2016 dismissed her appeals with  reference  to
    the Immigration Rules and Article 8, ECHR.

2.   On  31  May  2017  I,  having  heard  submissions  from  Ms  Jacquisse,
    concluded that the Judge had erred in failing to consider the  Zambrano
    rights which the two children of the Appellant, by  different  fathers,
    enjoyed in the United Kingdom and in particular because the  Judge  had
    found that neither of the children's fathers had any intention  of  the
    children living with them permanently. Indeed in the case of one of the
    fathers there was direct opposition from the father's present wife with
    the access position in respect of the child called A.

3.   In respect of the child G, date of birth 20 May 2015, she as a  British
    national, born in the UK, living with her mother and there was  limited
    staying access to the child's father but again no  suggestion  that  he
    was an alternative parent with whom  the  child  could  reside  if  the
    Appellant left the  UK.   In  those  circumstances  in  my  decision  I
    restricted the appeal to the issue of whether or not the outcome of the
    appeal would be different if Zambrano implications had  been  addressed
    in the context of the children's best interests.

4.   Mr Jarvis considered my decision and bore in  mind  the  sustained  and
    retained  findings  of  fact  which  the  Judge  had  made.    In   the
    circumstances  he  accepted  that  on  the  basis   of   the   Zambrano
    considerations the Appellant could not be removed.

5.   It was argued therefore with reference to the case  of  Chavez-Vhilchez
    and Others C-133 10 May 2017 that the circumstances strongly pointed to
    the conclusion that the removal of the Appellant was essentially  going
    to force the removal, which could otherwise not occur, of the children.
     In those circumstances the best interests of the child, the age of the
    children, their physical and emotional development, extent of emotional
    ties and limited connections with both children's fathers,  the  effect
    of separation in terms of removing the children to a country  to  which
    they are complete strangers strongly suggested that that was not in the
    best interests of the children nor was it appropriate not least when in
    respect of the child D: There is a court order restricting his  removal
    from the UK.

6.   It is also clear on  the  evidence  that  the  fathers  and  their  new
    families were not willing to take on the general care of  the  children
    thus shared parental controls and the exercise of those rights was  not
    an issue.

7.   In those circumstances, I was similarly in agreement  with  Mr  Jarvis,
    the effects of the Judge's decision in terms of the  findings  of  fact
    established  the  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  between   the
    Appellant and the children and that to remove the Appellant would force
    the children also to leave  the  United  Kingdom  which  would  not  be
    acceptable.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.
