                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original
Appellant/parties in this determination identified as MS and her son AM.
This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to
comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of court
proceedings

   1. MS, a Somali citizen, arrived in  the  UK  on  30  December  2012  and
      claimed asylum on 22nd January 2013. Her asylum claim was  refused  on
      21st February 2013 and her appeal against that decision dismissed in a
      decision promulgated on 29th April 2013. Applications  for  permission
      to appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  were
      refused and she became appeal rights exhausted on 3rd July  2013.  She
      did not leave the UK. She made further  submissions  on  21st  October
      2013, 8th August 2016 and 11 August 2016. These were  treated  by  the
      respondent as a fresh claim under paragraph 353 Immigration Rules. Her
      asylum claim was refused for reasons set out in a decision  dated  1st
      September 2016. MS' appeal against that decision  came  before  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Lodge on 2nd  December  2016  and  in  a  decision
      promulgated  on  11  December  2016  he  dismissed   her   appeal   on
      international protection  and  human  rights  grounds.  Permission  to
      appeal that decision was sought on the grounds, in summary,


   a) The judge erred in failing to make a finding that MS is the mother  of
      AM, who is a member of the Ashraf clan and has been  recognised  as  a
      refugee in the UK;
   b) Erred in failing to make an adequately reasoned finding whether MS was
      or was not a member of the Ashraf clan;
   c) Erred in failing to make an adequate assessment whether relocation  to
      Mogadishu would be unduly harsh. MOJ does not relate to lone women; NM
      and others (lone women - Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKIAT  00076  (IAC)
      and AMM and others (conflict;  humanitarian  crises;  returnees;  FGM)
      Somalia CG [2011] UKUT 0045(IAC) apply and have not been considered.
   d) Erred in failing to have  adequate  regard  to  the  evidence  of  the
      dependency between MS and AM in reaching his conclusion that Article 8
      was not engaged.


   2. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated  Judge  Peart  on  13th
      April 2017 on all grounds.


   3. The appellant had pleaded before the First-tier Tribunal that she  was
      the mother of AM. She produced DNA evidence  to  that  effect.  It  is
      surprising that First-tier Tribunal judge stated in ï¿½23

        "...For what it is worth if I had to make a finding  I  would  find
        that the Appellant is the mother of [AM] and is  younger  than  she
        says..."


         It may be that the judge did not consider that  an  actual  finding
        was relevant, but the appellant was entitled to have a finding made
        on a matter that she considered underpinned her  asylum  and  human
        rights claim. MS claims a date of birth of 1st January 1942. AM  in
        his SEF dated 28th May 2004 said his  mother  was  aged  about  50.
        Judge Lodge considers  the  discrepancy,  refers  to  judge  Broe's
        decision in 2013 which refers to AM taking that view based  on  his
        memory when he last saw her, considers that if she were the age she
        claimed she would have been aged about 47 or 48 when she gave birth
        to AM (unlikely but not impossible) whereas if she had  been  about
        50 as AM claimed, she would now be about 62. Judge  Lodge  set  out
        the evidence he considered in reaching his 'possible' finding.  The
        grounds of appeal relied upon do not dispute that evidence,  rather
        they challenge the failure to make an actual finding.  I  took  the
        view, which I expressed to the parties that although  expressed  as
        "for what it's worth" this could be treated as a  finding  of  fact
        namely that MS is the mother of Am and  she  is  younger  than  she
        claims. There was no dissension to this.


   4. It was submitted to the First-tier Tribunal that because  she  is  the
      mother of AM and it has been accepted by the  respondent  that  he  is
      Ashraf, then so is she. The evidence before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Broe led him to conclude that she was not Ashraf. MS'  appeal  against
      that decision was unsuccessful. The new evidence, which Judge Broe did
      not have, was that MS and AM are mother and son. Judge Broe did accept
      there was a connection between MS and AM. Judge Broe records,  in  his
      decision, MS' lack of knowledge of the Ashraf clan. It is  well  known
      that intermarriage between clans occurred and occurs  in  Somalia.  It
      does not necessarily follow that because AM is Ashraf then so  is  his
      mother.


   5. Judge Lodge took the view that whether she was Ashraf  was  immaterial
      to his decision in  the  light  of  MOJ.  Judge  Broe  considered  the
      evidence before him which was, in summary, as follows:

        *    MS had previously applied for family settlement in 2007,  from
        Ethiopia, such application being refused and her appeal  dismissed;
        her application had not included the name 'Sharif';
        *    she had memory problems and suffered from headaches and  pains
        in her knees; she had been tired when she was  interviewed  by  the
        SSHD;
        *    her husband and eldest son were killed  by  the  Hawiye  about
        1995 or 1985, the latter date being some two years before the birth
        of AM;
        *    she claimed to be Ashraf but did not know any of  the  customs
        peculiar to the Ashraf; she claimed they lived peacefully alongside
        the Hawiye although she also said they lived alongside the Hawiye;
        *    she had said that the Ashraf minority clan  were  farmers  and
        livestock traders whereas the background  material  indicated  that
        they were almost exclusively involved in commercial operations; her
        evidence was that her family had a house and a shop  until  it  was
        taken away by the Hawiye;
        *    she had no relatives in Somalia but in oral evidence she  said
        she had many family members in Somalia, distant and near  relatives
        and her clan was in Somalia;
        *    she had a brother in Saudi Arabia who had paid for her to  get
        to the UK; AM in his evidence said her brother was in Somalia,  was
        aged over 80 and too old to look after her; the appellant  accepted
        in oral evidence she had a brother in Somalia;
        *    she claimed to have left Somalia in 2007.


   6. Judge Broe took account of her inability to answer questions about the
      Ashraf clan, that she had lived in Somalia until at least  2007,  that
      she had initially denied having any relatives in  Somalia  but  during
      the hearing had accepted she did have relatives there and it  was  not
      credible that, as a lone female she did not have  support  during  the
      time she was there - a very volatile period. There was no DNA evidence
      before him. He concluded that she was not related as claimed to AM and
      that she was not Ashraf.


   7. There was DNA evidence before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lodge.  Judge
      Lodge took the view that the relationship between AM and  MS  was  not
      material to the decision whether MS was Ashraf. Before Judge Broe  and
      Judge Lodge it was submitted that MS suffered from dementia  and  this
      affected her ability to provide accurate answers to questions and give
      consistent evidence. Although AM gave evidence of his need to take  MS
      to hospital and wake her at midnight for her  medication,  the  actual
      medical evidence before the First-tier Tribunal on both occasions  did
      not give rise to any  indication  that  either  her  ability  to  give
      evidence was impaired or that her  'late  onset'  Alzheimer's  disease
      (not late stage as pleaded in the grounds seeking permission to appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal) impaired her evidence before  Judge  Broe.  She
      was not called to  give  evidence  before  Judge  Lodge.  The  medical
      evidence before Judge Lodge stated: "Due  to  her  condition  she  has
      moderate problems with short term memory as well as motivation".

   8. The fact that AM was recognised by the SSHD as a refugee based on  his
      claimed clan membership as Ashraf does not  necessarily  result  in  a
      finding that MS is Ashraf. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Broe  found,  on
      the evidence before him to find that she was not Ashraf and  this,  as
      identified by Judge Lodge, is his starting  point.  The  claimed  clan
      membership of AM  was  not,  on  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal,
      established through any judicial  process  but  was  accepted  by  the
      respondent to be  as  claimed.  Families  may  be  of  differing  clan
      affiliation. The grounds relied upon assert that Judge Lodge found the
      appellant was not Ashraf and refer to [20] of the decision. [20]  does
      not set out such a finding but states that he, Judge Lodge,  does  not
      accept that having a mother/son relationship is material  to  deciding
      whether she is Ashraf. He rejects the contention that  because  AM  is
      Ashraf then MS must be Ashraf in [25]. It is  difficult  to  see  what
      conclusion Judge Lodge  reaches  with  regards  to  her  claimed  clan
      membership. There is certainly no finding that she is not  Ashraf.  On
      balance I take the view, that Judge Lodge concludes that MS is  Ashraf
      and I have proceeded on that basis.


   9. In any event, as has been made plain in MOJ,  clan  membership  is  no
      longer a significant  matter  in  terms  of  establishing  whether  an
      individual should be recognised as a refugee.

  10. The evidence before Judge Broe, although denied before Judge Lodge  by
      AM, was that the appellant has near and  distant  relatives  and  clan
      members in Somalia. She had continued to live  in  Somalia  after  her
      husband and son died until at least 2007, a period of  great  upheaval
      and violence. She had given no evidence of having had difficulties  or
      problems during that time. Her brother who was possibly at  some  time
      living in Saudi Arabia, had returned to live  in  Somalia  because  of
      health problems, it is unclear when because AM initially denied  there
      were relatives in Somalia. Evidence of his health problems or  why  he
      preferred to be treated in Somalia was not given. It was claimed  that
      he was over 80 years old, but  it  had  also  been  claimed  that  the
      appellant was 72 whereas the  "finding'  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Lodge that she was  younger  was  sustainable  on  the  evidence
      before him. AM's evidence was that he had lost contact with  MS  after
      2007 until she came to the UK in 2012. Someone had  paid  for  her  to
      travel to the UK in 2012. The findings by Judge Lodge are not perverse
      on the evidence before him. The grounds relied upon to challenge these
      findings are simply a disagreement with findings that were open to the
      judge.

  11. In any event the significant issue before the First-tier Tribunal, and
      thus before me, is whether, on the facts as found in  the  context  of
      the background material and case law, return of MS to Mogadishu  would
      be unduly harsh.

  12. The findings of Judge Lodge are that MS is aged between 62 and 72. She
      has late onset Alzheimer's resulting in moderate problems  with  short
      term memory and motivation.  Her  brother  is  in  Somalia,  where  he
      returned from Saudi Arabia following health problems. She remained  in
      Somalia until at least 2007 after her husband  died  (probably  around
      1995) without significant problems. She has near and distant relatives
      in Somalia. Her son, AM, who is in the UK and a British  Citizen,  has
      confirmed he will be able to financially support her with  remittances
      from the UK. Someone financed her trip to the UK in 2012 - not her son
      according to his evidence. She is Ashraf, although her  membership  or
      otherwise of that clan is  of  little  impact  in  the  light  of  the
      presence of relatives.

  13. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge  considered  MOJ  and  considered  the
      question of the appellant's return as a lone female. He  rejected  the
      submissions that she would be vulnerable, taking account of the  above
      matters.


  14. Before me it was submitted that MOJ does not consider the position  of
      lone females with no support in Mogadishu and that the  relevant  case
      law of NM and AMM should have been considered. It is correct  that  NM
      and AMM were not considered by Judge  Lodge  and  that  MOJ  does  not
      consider the position of lone females without support.

  15. NM found that the general  conditions  of  life  or  circumstances  in
      Somalia do not engage the obligations of the  Refugee  Convention  for
      female returnees (ï¿½125). ï¿½128 holds that internal relocation is not  a
      viable option for members of minority clans except where they  may  be
      able to obtain majority clan protection in  a  secure  area.   But  of
      course, MOJ has now made clear that clan membership is not a  defining
      characteristic either for recognition as a refugee or  in  determining
      the issue of internal relocation.

  16. The guidance in AMM includes that it is for the appellant to make good
      an assertion that,  notwithstanding  the  general  conditions  in  the
      proposed place of relocation, it would not be reasonable  to  relocate
      there. She referred to the finding that women travelling without  male
      friends or relatives are in general likely to  face  a  real  risk  of
      sexual violence. Although Ms Alban referred to AMM and NM, she was not
      able to identify to me any issues dealt with in those cases that had a
      bearing on MS given the  facts  found  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Lodge. Although Judge Lodge did not specifically consider these cases,
      based on the facts as found by  him,  which  are  not  disturbed,  his
      conclusion that the removal of the appellant to  Mogadishu  should  be
      considered in terms of MOJ is sustainable.

  17. My attention was drawn to the  August  2016  Country  Information  and
      Guidance Somalia: Women fearing gender based harm and violence report.
      :

                  "2.4.2   In general, a  woman  fearing  sexual  or  gender
                  based violence is unlikely to be able to access  effective
                  protection from the state. Traditional  laws,  often  used
                  instead of a weak state  judiciary,  discriminate  against
                  women and girls...
                  ....
                  2.5.1    The  relevance  and  reasonableness  of  internal
                  relocation must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking
                  full  account  of  the  individual  circumstances  of  the
                  particular person.
                  2.5.2    For single  women  and  female  single  heads  of
                  households  with  no  male  protection,  especially  those
                  originating from minority groups, internal relocation will
                  not be available in  the  absence  of  meaningful  support
                  networks or a  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
                  livelihood.
                  ....
                  3.1.2    ...women without family or clan support  and  IDP
                  women are in general likely to be at real risk  of  gender
                  based violence or serious harm on return.
                  ....
                  3.1.5    Internal relocation to Mogadishu  to  avoid  risk
                  from gender-based violence may be viable in some cases, in
                  particular where the person has a  support  network,  etc.
                  Single women are unlikely to be able to relocate.



  18. This policy guidance reflects the guidance given in  MOJ  but  in  the
      context of lone women. This appellant would not be going to  Mogadishu
      as a lone single woman. By her own evidence, she has near and  distant
      relatives there; her brother, given it was not her son, is  likely  to
      have paid for her to come to the UK. He left Saudi Arabia to return to
      Somalia, apparently voluntarily, something he is unlikely to have done
      if he considered that he would be in danger. MS' son has confirmed  he
      will be able to  financially  support  her.  MS  will  not  only  have
      familial support but will also have financial support.


  19. Although the grounds relied upon disagree with findings reached by the
      First-tier Tribunal judge, those findings are sustainable and there is
      no material error of law. Based  on  those  findings,  the  conclusion
      reached by the First-tier Tribunal that it would not be  unduly  harsh
      for MS to be removed to Mogadishu is not infected by material error of
      law.


  20. Permission was also granted in connection with the appellant's Article
      8 rights. It was asserted the appellant was dependent upon her son and
      no evidence to dispute that had been provided. It is correct  that  no
      evidence to dispute that was provided but it is not the  role  of  the
      respondent to produce evidence to rebut assertions made by appellant's
      in this context. The medical evidence was considered  by  Judge  Lodge
      who found that it did not support the contention by the  son  that  he
      had to wake her for her medication and provide her  with  a  level  of
      care that meant she was dependent upon him. The conclusion reached  by
      Judge Lodge was plainly open to him on the evidence before him.  there
      is no error of law in his findings that Article 8 is not engaged.

  21. I do not set aside the decision.






          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

     I do not set aside the decision.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing MS'  appeal  against
    the respondent's decision stands.


    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
