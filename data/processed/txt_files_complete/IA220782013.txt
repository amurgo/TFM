               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and his  date  of  birth  is  31
    December 1990.  He made an application on 27 February 2013 for leave to
    remain in the UK and the Secretary of State refused the application  in
    a decision of 23 May 2013.

2.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and his appeal was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Brenells in a determination that was promulgated on 26  November  2013.
    The matter was determined on the papers.  The appellant  had  requested
    an oral hearing but did not attend and the matter was determined in his
    absence.

3.   The appellant appealed and the grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal
    raised various issues.  Permission was granted by Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Levin in a decision of 14 April 2014 and thus the  matter
    came before me.

4.   It is clear that the appellant changed address  at  some  stage  during
    the  proceedings  and  that  he  notified  the  Tribunal  of  this   in
    correspondence. It is asserted by the appellant that he did not receive
    the notice of  the  hearing  and  I  note  that  it  was  sent  to  the
    appellant's original address.   In the circumstances I find that  there
    was a material procedural irregularity in that the  appellant  was  not
    notified of the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

5.   I remit the matter to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard  afresh
    pursuant to paragraph 7.2(a) of the Practice Statement  of  the  Senior
    President of Tribunals  on  25  September  2012.  The  matter  will  be
    determined de novo at a hearing at Taylor House on 6 October 2014.

6.   I make no directions. The appellant submitted  a  bundle  of  documents
    including a witness statement at the hearing before me on 12 June 2014.
    I observe that the section 47 decision was made after 8 May 2013 and it
    appears therefore to be a lawful decision
