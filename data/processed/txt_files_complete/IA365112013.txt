                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   At an error of law hearing on 10 July 2014  I  found  that  a  decision
    dismissing the appellant's  appeal  against  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant decision of 19 August 2013 had to be set aside.  The  error  of
    law decision and directions, sent to the parties  after  this  hearing,
    were as follows.

              i. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, has been  in  the  UK
                 since 2006, first as a student,  and  then  for  post-study
                 work.  On 29 September 2012 he applied for further leave to
                 remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His application
                 was refused on 19 August 2013, and his appeal was dismissed
                 by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Eldridge,  in   a
                 determination promulgated on 10 February 2014.


             ii. Permission to appeal was sought.  The grounds  concentrated
                 in particular on unfairness  in  the  judge's  approach  to
                 deposits and withdrawals in the appellant's  business  bank
                 statements.  The  judge  suggested  that  payments  to  the
                 business might have been refunded to the  client  in  cash,
                 but this point was not mentioned at the  hearing,  and  the
                 appellant therefore had no opportunity to  respond  to  it.
                 Permission to appeal was refused by Judge of the First-tier
                 Tribunal  Nicholson,  on  9  April  2014.  On   a   renewed
                 application to the Upper Tribunal, however,  permission  to
                 appeal was granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Jordan,  who
                 observed that  the  receipts  followed  by  withdrawals  in
                 similar amounts were suspicious, but the judge arguably had
                 to raise the point with the appellant.  The observation was
                 then made that the appellant was now on notice as  to  what
                 he needed to do.


            iii. At the start of the hearing Mr Aslam,  for  the  appellant,
                 picking up on the  final  point  in  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
                 Jordan's grant, referred to a further witness statement  by
                 the appellant, with attachments.  This was  to  the  effect
                 that none  of  the  payments  from  any  clients  had  been
                 returned to them, and was supported by  a  letter  to  that
                 effect from  the  client  who  had  made  the  payments  in
                 question,  a  further  letter  from  the  accountants,  and
                 receipts showing that the appellant had  purchased  various
                 stationery and computer equipment for his business with the
                 sums withdrawn, as well as paying for accountancy  services
                 for the business.


             iv. Mr Aslam's submissions at the hearing can be summarised  as
                 follows.   The  adverse  findings   were   based   on   two
                 speculative assumptions.  The first was that there were  no
                 other credits in the business account  that  were  payments
                 from clients.  The judge had assumed that the only business
                 credits were  those  for  the  named  company.   The  third
                 sentence of paragraph 37 of  the  determination  made  this
                 assumption clear.  If  the  appellant  had  been  given  an
                 opportunity to do so he could have given evidence  to  show
                 that other deposits in the account were fees from  clients.
                 The second assumption was that the pattern  of  withdrawals
                 from the account suggested funds being repaid to the client
                 in cash.   This  did  not  comply  with  the  principle  of
                 fairness, in that the appellant would  have  been  able  to
                 deal with this point if it had been raised, and in addition
                 it was not based on  sufficient  evidence.   There  was  an
                 error that was material because  this  formed  the  central
                 part of the adverse credibility findings that the appellant
                 had not set up a genuine business.  The Immigration  Rules,
                 including the new genuineness test,  included  no  specific
                 requirement for a market research  exercise  to  have  been
                 conducted.  The matters at paragraphs 38, 39, and  40  were
                 peripheral issues and could not sustain an adverse  finding
                 on their own.  The core of the adverse findings  rested  on
                 the point about the business  bank  statements,  and  these
                 findings were flawed  because  they  were  speculative  and
                 unfair.


              v. Mr Bramble, for the respondent, accepted that there was  an
                 error of law at paragraph 42, in that the  judge  had  been
                 required, as a matter of fairness, to put the  point  about
                 possible cash repayments to the appellant, since it was not
                 raised by the respondent, neither in the letter nor at  the
                 hearing.  However Mr Bramble submitted that the  error  was
                 not material.   His  submission  was  based  on  the  words
                 "strengthened me" in paragraph  42  of  the  determination.
                 This suggested that the judge had reached adverse  findings
                 for other reasons.  The other reasons were to be  found  at
                 paragraphs 37, 38, and 39, and  related  to  the  need  for
                 evidence  of  payments  from  other  clients,  the  judge's
                 assessment of the appellant's own oral evidence, and  other
                 matters.  The judge was therefore  entitled  to  reach  the
                 view that he did of the facts, and the error  at  paragraph
                 42 was not material because of the other findings.


             vi. As I indicated at the hearing I have decided that there was
                 an error of law  in  the  approach  to  the  business  bank
                 statements, and that that was material to the outcome.


            vii. Having considered the submissions  by  both  sides  I  have
                 decided that the other adverse findings cannot be separated
                 from the agreed error  at  paragraph  42.   It  was  agreed
                 between the parties at the hearing before me that this  did
                 amount to an error because the appellant, as  a  matter  of
                 fairness, should have been given an opportunity to  respond
                 to the allegations.  As is clear from the further  evidence
                 provided he would have been in a position  to  do  so,  and
                 could have established that  the  judge's  suspicions  were
                 unfounded.  In addition, it appears to me that the  judge's
                 finding was speculative.  It is  well  established  that  a
                 finding cannot rest on suspicion alone.   It  may  well  be
                 that the pattern of payments gave rise  to  suspicion,  but
                 for a finding that went considerably further than  anything
                 in the refusal letter, in that it amounted to an allegation
                 of dishonesty against both the appellant  and  one  of  his
                 clients, cogent evidence would have been required.  I  note
                 the judge's observation that  he  was  not  making  such  a
                 factual finding, but as a matter of consistency if  such  a
                 finding was not being made, then it should not, as a matter
                 of law, have been held against the appellant as an  adverse
                 point.  If the respondent had made this sort of  allegation
                 it would have been clear  that  the  burden  lay  with  the
                 respondent to provide evidence.  If such evidence  had  not
                 been provided then there could not have been a finding, and
                 adverse weight could not have been  placed  on  the  point.
                 The principle remains much the same if the judge is raising
                 the matter of the Tribunal's own motion, and  there  is  no
                 escaping the fairness point,  which  was  that  where  such
                 suspicions arose in the judge's mind it was necessary as  a
                 matter  of  fairness  to  give  the   appellant   and   his
                 representatives a chance to respond.


           viii. I have considered the submissions made by Mr Bramble, but I
                 have decided that the matter on which  it  was  agreed  the
                 judge erred in law cannot be safely separated from the rest
                 of the adverse findings.  The third sentence  of  paragraph
                 37  raised  another  fairness  issue  and  I   accept   the
                 submission made on the appellant's behalf that, on  reading
                 the determination as a whole, the  correct  conclusion  was
                 that the core of the adverse findings were based around the
                 bank statements, both in respect of the only payments  from
                 clients being the six that were identified, and in  respect
                 of the suspicion of cash refunds at paragraph 42.


             ix. I have therefore decided that the judge's decision must  be
                 set aside, and that the decision is to be re-made.


              x. Having heard from both parties I decided  that  the  matter
                 could proceed at once to a re-making hearing, with evidence
                 from the appellant.  This was the course suggested  by  UTJ
                 Jordan in granting permission. As it turned  out,  however,
                 an Urdu interpreter should have  been  requested,  and  was
                 not.  After various enquiries the appeal was adjourned  for
                 a re-making hearing.


             xi. Having found the above error of law, which was material  to
                 the outcome, the judge's findings as to the genuineness  of
                 the business, which was the sole  point  at  issue  in  the
                 appeal, are set aside.

2.   As is clear from the above it was  agreed  that  I  was  engaged  in  a
    remaking of the decision in the appeal, with no preserved findings.  In
    a discussion at the  start  of  the  hearing  it  was  noted  that  the
    application had been made on 29 September 2012, and  that  the  refusal
    was dated 19 August 2013.  The recent decision  of  Ahmed  and  Another
    (PBS:  admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT  365  (IAC)  held  that  the
    prohibition on new evidence  in  section  85A(4)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied to  non-points-scoring  aspects
    of a rule where those aspects were inextricably linked to  the  scoring
    of points.  For the purposes of this appeal it was agreed  between  the
    parties that this applied, and that no evidence that was not  submitted
    with the application was admissible in the appeal.

3.   It was further agreed between the parties that the genuineness  of  the
    business and the investment was the  sole  point  at  issue  (paragraph
    245DD(h)(i) and (k)).  This agreement flowed from  the  fact  that  the
    refusal letter referred back to the genuineness issue when refusing  to
    award points under each of the various  headings,  and  there  were  no
    other matters raised in the refusal.  It was accepted  at  the  hearing
    that the refusal letter contained a typographical error in relation  to
    Appendix C.  The 10 points claimed had in fact been  awarded,  and  the
    box under the heading "Points Awarded" should have read ten rather than
    zero.

4.   Mr Aslam, for the appellant, confirmed that the sole ground  of  appeal
    being pursued was that the decision was  not  in  accordance  with  the
    rules,  with  reference  to  paragraph  245DD,  and  the  subparagraphs
    referred to above.  There was no argument in relation  to  whether  the
    decision was in accordance with the law,  and  no  challenge  on  human
    rights grounds.

5.   The documentary evidence referred to was contained in the  respondent's
    bundle, and the appellant's bundle prepared for the First-tier  hearing
    (84 pages).  A further  bundle  had  been  prepared  for  the  remaking
    hearing, which contained up-to-date business bank  statements,  various
    client  contracts,  invoices,  and  copies  of  cheques  received  from
    clients.  In view of the agreement as to admissibility neither side, in
    the event, referred me to any of this evidence.

6.   The appellant gave evidence at  the  hearing  and  was  cross-examined.
    The cross-examination was concerned with his business  experience,  the
    nature of his market research, the nature  of  his  business,  and  his
    family background.

7.   Following the appellant's evidence Mr Melvin, for the respondent,  made
    submissions which can be summarised  as  follows.   He  relied  on  the
    refusal letter.  This had concluded that the documentary  evidence  did
    not establish that the business was actively trading; that there was no
    evidence as to the origin of the funds in the  various  accounts;  that
    the quality of the market research appeared  poor;  that  the  business
    plan was vague and unspecific; that no reference could be  found  on  a
    search for one of the client companies; and that it was  unlikely  that
    the appellant had gained much experience in marketing with  his  family
    business in Pakistan.  Mr Melvin added the following points.  This  was
    not a genuine viable business.  The marketing suggested no attempts  at
    proper research.  Many other companies were offering  similar  services
    in the area.  There were no signs that  the  appellant  had  particular
    expertise.  The family  business  in  Pakistan  was  not  evidenced  by
    documents.  It was not credible that businesses would go  to  a  person
    with such limited experience.  The business was  nothing  more  than  a
    leafleting service.  An MBA was not enough in itself  if  somebody  was
    inexperienced.

8.   Mr Aslam, for the appellant, made submissions which can  be  summarised
    as follows.  Following on from the application made in  September  2012
    this had been a long process.  The appellant had  been  interviewed  in
    2013.  He had been consistent throughout.  He has  business  experience
    through his family in Pakistan,  and  he  also  has  an  MBA.   He  has
    targeted start-ups and small businesses in the Watford area, which were
    mainly run by  people  of  Pakistani  or  Asian  origin.   He  was  not
    specialising in a particular area of business, but was able to  provide
    useful  services  for  small  businesses  who  could  not  afford  more
    established marketing firms.  Leafleting was a part of the service that
    he offered, but it was not limited to that.  The business proposal  was
    credible and genuine.  He had in fact provided evidence of the sale  of
    land, and his share of business profits, as well as  providing  initial
    contracts with the application.

Decision and Reasons

9.   Having considered the evidence and the submissions I have  decided,  on
    remaking the decision, that the appeal falls to be  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

10.  The Secretary of State accepted, following the  application,  that  the
    appellant had provided evidence of funds in excess  of  �50,000.   This
    was in the form of �15,000 in his own UK account, and the remainder  in
    two different accounts in Pakistan.   It  also  appears  to  have  been
    accepted that  he  had  complied  with  all  of  the  various  detailed
    requirements as to specified documents,  both  in  order  to  show  the
    investment funds available, but also in order to show that he had  been
    through all the necessary procedures for setting  up  his  company  and
    registering for corporation tax.  The refusal was  therefore  based  on
    new Immigration Rules that were introduced after  the  application  was
    made, by HC943.  These took effect on 31 January 2013.  Although  these
    were not in force when the appellant made his application they  led  to
    the decision that he should be interviewed, and this in turn led to the
    refusal.  As a matter  of  fairness  it  appears  surprising  that  the
    appellant was not given an opportunity to  submit  further  documentary
    evidence at the time of the interview.  It appears  that  the  decision
    remained based on the documents submitted in September 2012,  and  that
    no opportunity was given for further documents to be submitted to  meet
    the concerns that emerged from the interview under the new  Rules.   As
    it turns out, however, it appears to me that the decision falls in  the
    appellant's favour in any event, and this  issue  is  not  therefore  a
    material one in this particular appeal.

11.  I have considered all of the documentary evidence, and have  considered
    the interview  record.   I  note,  in  relation  to  that  record,  the
    appellant's statement, where he indicates that the recorded answers  in
    the interview record represent a brief summary of what he said, over  a
    period much longer than that suggested by the notes taken.  An  example
    of this was that the refusal letter quoted an  answer  suggesting  that
    the appellant had said that there was one other marketing  business  in
    the area, whereas the appellant has stated  that  his  answer  in  fact
    included an observation that there were  many  such  companies  in  the
    area, but that he gave the name of one as an example.  This aspect  was
    not explored in cross-examination.  The appellant was not challenged on
    this aspect of his statement, and it was not argued on the respondent's
    behalf that the notes of the  interview  provided  represented  a  full
    record of everything that the appellant had said.  Any  adverse  weight
    to be placed on the interview answers, and the reliance placed on them,
    has to be seen in this context.

12.  In relation to the concerns raised about the  origin  of  the  funds  I
    accept the submission made on the appellant's behalf  that  documentary
    evidence was provided with the application, in September 2012, to  show
    that the funds came from the sale of land,  and  from  the  appellant's
    share of the profits of his  family  business.   It  appears  that  his
    grandfather passed on land and a business to his father.  That business
    continues in Pakistan.  The appellant's  studies  were  funded  by  his
    father.  His father is now also supporting him in his plan to establish
    a business in the UK.

13.  I note that the relevant parts of paragraph 245DD  of  the  Immigration
    Rules do not require that a business has  been  established.   What  is
    required is either that the applicant genuinely intends and is able  to
    establish a business, or that  he  has  established  or  taken  over  a
    business.  Having considered all of the evidence it appears to me  that
    the appellant has done enough to show that his intention to establish a
    business was genuine, and that he  genuinely  intended  to  invest  the
    money, which was genuinely available to him from the sources  described
    above.  At the date of application the appellant's business was  small:
    at that stage he only claimed to have two clients, and he did not claim
    to have invested more than a few thousand pounds of the sum  available.
    He repeatedly said that he did not want to commit more funds  until  he
    knew that his application for a further visa had been  successful.   In
    the circumstances this does not appear to  me  to  be  an  unreasonable
    position to have adopted, given that the appellant would have  run  the
    risk of wasting valuable funds if his  application  turned  out  to  be
    unsuccessful.

14.  The level of market research and the business  planning  involved  does
    not  appear  to  be  particularly  sophisticated,  but  what  has  been
    described  is  a  small  business  offering  services  to  other  small
    businesses.  I accept the submission made  on  the  appellant's  behalf
    that the types of business targeted are those that would not be able to
    afford the services of more established marketing firms, and that there
    may also be ways  in  which  the  appellant  would  be  at  a  business
    advantage in dealing with small businesses owned or run by people  with
    connections to the Indian subcontinent.

15.  It was suggested that the appellant should have started the process  of
    setting up his business earlier, but I can see  nothing  in  the  Rules
    that indicates that it would not be  possible  for  a  person  to  work
    during the two year post-study work period, and then put forward  plans
    to establish a business.  As I have said the relevant  parts  of  245DD
    relied on by the respondent do not require that the business is already
    up and running.  In addition I note the  appellant's  comments  in  his
    statement that it was only  when  it  became  known  to  him  that  the
    �200,000 investment level was being dropped to �50,000 for those in the
    UK for post-study work that the possibility of using this route  became
    a serious proposition.

16.  For these reasons  my  decision  is  that  the  appellant  did  provide
    sufficient evidence to  establish  that  he  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245DD(h), taking into account the factors listed at paragraph
    245DD(i).  On close examination it does  not  appear  to  me  that  the
    reasons put forward in the refusal letter are of sufficient  weight  to
    justify the adverse conclusion.  The points made have  been  adequately
    dealt with.  On  balance  of  probabilities  my  finding  is  that  the
    appellant did genuinely intend to establish the business; that  he  did
    genuinely intend to invest the money;  that  the  money  was  genuinely
    available to him, and that the business plans were viable and credible.

17.  In any event I note that the same changes introduced  in  January  2013
    provided Rules that allowed the Secretary of State to curtail leave for
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant in a number of circumstances, including
    where the funds available for investment had  not  been  spent  on  the
    business, and where various requirements to register the  business  had
    not been complied with.  The initial test is for the genuineness of the
    intention to establish the business.   In  essence  the  position  will
    remain that if the business does not work, and the  funds  are  not  in
    fact invested, and the appellant cannot show this in due  course,  then
    it will be open to the Secretary of State to curtail leave, or  not  to
    renew it.

18.  At this initial stage, however, it does not appear  to  me  that  there
    was enough, in a proper consideration of the  evidence  submitted  with
    the application, and the answers  given  at  interview,  to  justify  a
    refusal on the genuineness grounds relied on in the refusal letter.

19.  It was not suggested by  either  side  that  there  was  any  need  for
    anonymity in this appeal and I make no such  direction.   Neither  side
    mentioned the fee award.  As I have said the  evidence  relied  on  was
    entirely that submitted with the application.  In the  circumstances  I
    have decided that it would therefore be appropriate to make a whole fee
    award.

Decision

20.  The decision dismissing the appeal is set aside  for  the  reasons  set
    out above.  The decision is remade as follows.

21.  The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Having allowed the appeal I have decided, for the reasons  given  above,  to
make a whole fee award, in the sum of �140.
