                            DECISION AND REASONS

Both judges have contributed to this decision.

 1. This appeal raises questions concerning the  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom of AA, who had previously been recognised as a refugee and  who
    claims that removal would be a breach of  the  Refugee  Convention  and
    articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights ("ECHR").

 2. AA had been granted  refugee  status,  but  this  was  revoked  by  the
    Secretary of State who also refused a human  rights  claim.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Monson refused AA's appeal against the revocation of his
    protection status, but allowed his appeal against the  refusal  of  the
    human rights claim. The Secretary of State appeals against  the  latter
    decision; AA cross-appeals against the former decision.

The facts

 3. AA is a national of Turkey, born on 10 August 1963.  He  says  that  he
    left Turkey in January 1998. On 23 May 1993  he  was  recognised  as  a
    refugee in France. He entered the UK in September 1990. On 21  December
    1990 he married a Turkish national who had been given leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a dependent of her father.

 4. AA's refugee status was transferred from France to the United  Kingdom.
    He was granted leave to remain until 13 May 1997.

 5. On 22 May 1996 AA was convicted of  conspiracy  to  import  almost  200
    kilograms of heroin with a street value of about ï¿½14M. He was sentenced
    to 20 years imprisonment, reduced on appeal to 15 years.

 6. Following his  release  two  flawed  decisions  were  made  to  make  a
    deportation order. These were each  withdrawn.  It  was  accepted  that
    deporting the Appellant to Turkey would give rise to a real risk  of  a
    breach of his rights under article 3 ECHR.

 7. On 24 October 2007 the Secretary of State informed AA that  deportation
    action would not be pursued. He was granted discretionary leave  for  a
    period of six months. His discretionary leave was subsequently extended
    until 14 April 2011.

 8. On 8 November 2010 AA was interviewed. He said that he feared  that  if
    he was returned to Turkey he would be subject to reprisals from his co-
    defendants and/or those who had been involved  in  the  conspiracy.  He
    also feared imprisonment for being  a  Kurd,  for  leaving  Turkey  for
    political reasons, and for being imprisoned for drug dealing.

 9. On 29 February 2012 AA was granted leave to remain  for  a  year  as  a
    businessman under the Turkish EC Association  Agreement.  A  subsequent
    application to extend his leave to remain as a businessman was  refused
    because of his criminal conviction, but this was overturned  on  appeal
    in 2014. The First-tier Tribunal said:

         "The appellant has been convicted of a  very  serious  offence  for
         which he was sentenced on appeal to  fifteen  years'  imprisonment.
         However, he was  previously  granted  leave  to  remain  under  the
         Turkish  European  Association  Agreement  provisions.  ...  it  is
         untenable to suggest that the  respondent  had  previously  granted
         leave in ignorance of the appellant's serious conviction. There  is
         no evidence that the appellant has been in  any  trouble  with  the
         police since he was released from custody in March 2003,  now  over
         eleven and a half years ago... We have considered  the  appellant's
         conviction and note that it is  relevant  to  the  outcome  of  the
         appeal. However, we are not satisfied that  this  is  a  sufficient
         reason to refuse leave  to  remain.  We  have  had  regard  to  the
         appellant's good character since he was released from custody  and,
         further, find that it would be inconsistent  and  unjust  for  this
         appeal to be dismissed on grounds of character when  the  appellant
         was previously granted leave on this basis by the respondent."

10. Accordingly, AA was granted further leave to remain  as  a  businessman
    until 28 February 2016. On 26 February 2016 AA applied  for  indefinite
    leave to remain as a businessman. This  was  refused  because  of  AA's
    conviction. On 21 September 2017 the Secretary of  State  revoked  AA's
    refugee status because "there have been fundamental and durable changes
    in Turkey since you were granted refugee status." It  was  acknowledged
    that Turkish citizens of Kurdish ethnicity might  face  discrimination,
    but it was said that this did not generally reach the level  to  amount
    to persecution or a breach of article 3 ECHR.

11. Having revoked AA's refugee status, the Secretary of State  decided  to
    make a deportation order against him. AA responded that his deportation
    would be contrary to articles 3  and  8  ECHR.  By  a  letter  dated  1
    December 2017 the Secretary of State rejected AA's contention that  his
    deportation would breach articles 3 or 8. In respect of  article  8  it
    was acknowledged that the decision to deport AA might cause a split  to
    his family (with his wife and children remaining in the UK)  but  that,
    having regard to the seriousness of AA's offence, any interference with
    the right to respect for private and family life could be justified.

12. AA's appeal against these decisions was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, but the Upper Tribunal found that the First-tier Tribunal had
    made an error of law. It overturned the decision and remitted the  case
    to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-hearing.  That  resulted  in  the
    decision that is now under appeal.

The legal framework

The Refugee Convention and the Qualification Directive

13. Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention provides that  a  person  is  a
    refugee if they are outside their country of  nationality  owing  to  a
    well-founded fear of being persecuted for a prescribed  reason  and  if
    they are unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to  avail  themselves
    of the protection of that country.

14. Article 1C(5) provides that the Convention ceases to apply to a  person
    falling under the terms of article 1A if they can no longer continue to
    refuse to avail themselves  of  the  protection  of  their  country  of
    nationality because the circumstances in  connection  with  which  they
    have been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist.

15. Articles 32 and 33 state:

         "Article 32: Expulsion

         1. The Contracting States shall not expel  a  refugee  lawfully  in
         their territory save on grounds  of  national  security  or  public
         order.

         2. The expulsion of such a refugee shall be only in pursuance of  a
         decision reached in accordance with  due  process  of  law.  Except
         where compelling reasons of national  security  otherwise  require,
         the refugee shall be allowed to submit evidence to  clear  himself,
         and to  appeal  to  and  be  represented  for  the  purpose  before
         competent authority or a person or persons specially designated  by
         the competent authority.

         3. The Contracting States shall allow such a refugee  a  reasonable
         period within which to seek legal admission into  another  country.
         The Contracting States reserve  the  right  to  apply  during  that
         period such internal measures as they may deem necessary.




         Article 33: Prohibition of expulsion or return ("refoulement")

         1. No Contracting  State  shall  expel  or  return  ("refouler")  a
         refugee in any manner whatsoever to the  frontiers  of  territories
         where his life or freedom would be threatened  on  account  of  his
         race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social
         group or political opinion.

         2. The benefit of  the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
         claimed  by  a  refugee  whom  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
         regarding as a danger to the security of the country  in  which  he
         is, or who,  having  been  convicted  by  a  final  judgment  of  a
         particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to  the  community
         of that country."

16.  Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification  Directive")  established,
    within the European Community, a uniform status for  refugees  and  for
    the protection  to  be  afforded  to  refugees.  Article  2(c)  defines
    "refugee" in terms that mirror article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention.
    Article 11(1)(e) mirrors article 1(C)(5) of the Refugee  Convention  in
    providing for the circumstances in which a person shall cease to  be  a
    refugee. Article 13 imposes a requirement to grant  refugee  status  to
    those who qualify as a refugee. Article  14  makes  provision  for  the
    revocation of refugee status.

17. Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  makes
    provision in respect of the construction  and  application  of  article
    33(2) of the Refugee Convention. It states:

         "72 Serious criminal

         ...

         (2)  A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by  a  final
         judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger
         to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-

             (a)  convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

             (b)  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least  two
             years.

         ...

         (6)  A presumption under subsection (2), (3) or (4) that  a  person
         constitutes a danger to the community is rebuttable by that person.

         ...."

The European Convention on Human Rights

18. Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits  torture
    and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

19. Article 8 provides a right to respect for private and family  life  and
    prohibits any interference with that right save  as  is  in  accordance
    with the law and is necessary for, and proportionate to,  a  prescribed
    legitimate aim.

20. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  sets  out
    the approach to be taken when  a  Tribunal  is  required  to  determine
    whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts breaches a  person's
    right to respect for private and family life under article 8  ECHR.  By
    section  117A(2),  in  cases  concerning  the  deportation  of  foreign
    criminals, the Tribunal must have regard to the  considerations  listed
    in section 117C. That states:




         "117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  (C)  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of four years or more,  the  public  interest
         requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.

         ...

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with  a  qualifying  child,  and  the  effect  of  C's
         deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2."

The Immigration Rules

21. Paragraph  334  of  the  Immigration  Rules  provides  that  an  asylum
    applicant will be granted refugee status if the Secretary of  State  is
    satisfied that (amongst other matters) they are a  refugee  within  the
    meaning of  regulation  2  of  the  Person  in  Need  of  International
    Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006. That regulation defines  a
    "refugee" as someone who falls within article 1A (but not  article  1D,
    1E or 1F) of the Refugee Convention.

22. Paragraphs 338A, 339A and 339C of the Immigration Rules state:

         "338A Revocation or refusal to renew refugee status

         A person's grant of refugee status under  paragraph  334  shall  be
         revoked or not renewed if any of paragraphs 339A to 339AB apply.  A
         person's grant of refugee status under paragraph 334 may be revoked
         or not renewed if paragraph 339AC applies.




         339A Refugee Convention ceases to apply (cessation)

         This paragraph applies when the Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied
         that one or more of the following applies:

         ...

         (v)  they can no longer, because the  circumstances  in  connection
         with which they have been recognised as a refugee  have  ceased  to
         exist, continue to refuse to avail themselves of the protection  of
         the country of nationality; or

         ...

         In considering (v) ..., the Secretary of State shall have regard to
         whether the change of circumstances is of such  a  significant  and
         non-temporary nature that the refugee's fear of persecution can  no
         longer be regarded as well-founded.

         ...




         339C. Grant of humanitarian protection

         A person will be granted  humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
         Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:

         (i)  they are in the United Kingdom or have arrived at  a  port  of
         entry in the United Kingdom;

         (ii) they do not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2 of
         The  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of   International   Protection
         (Qualification) Regulations 2006;

         (iii)    substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the
         person concerned, if returned to the country of return, would  face
         a real risk of suffering serious harm and is unable, or,  owing  to
         such risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of  that
         country; and

         (iv)  they  are  not  excluded  from  a   grant   of   humanitarian
         protection."

Appeal rights

23. By section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  a
    person may apply to  the  Tribunal  against  a  decision  to  refuse  a
    protection  and/or  human  rights  claim,  and  a  decision  to  revoke
    protection status.

24. By section 84(1) an appeal against a refusal of a protection claim must
    be brought  on  the  ground  that  removal  would  breach  the  Refugee
    Convention or the ECHR or the United Kingdom's obligations in  relation
    to persons eligible for a grant of humanitarian protection.

25. By section 84(2) an appeal against a refusal of a  human  rights  claim
    must be brought on the ground that the decision  is  incompatible  with
    the ECHR.

26. By section 84(3) an appeal against revocation of protection status must
    be brought  on  the  ground  that  the  decision  breaches  the  United
    Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention or  in  relation  to
    persons eligible for a grant of humanitarian protection.

Decision of First-tier Tribunal

27. First-tier Tribunal Judge Monson found that the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to revoke AA's refugee status  was  a  flawed  application  of
    article 1C of the Refugee Convention. That was because the Secretary of
    State's justification was based, to a significant extent, on  a  change
    in AA's personal circumstances rather than because the circumstances in
    connection with which he had been recognised as a refugee in France  in
    the 1990s had ceased to exist.

28. Nevertheless, having regard to the decision in Dang  (Refugee  -  query
    revocation  -  Article  3)  [2013]  UKUT  00043  (IAC),  Judge   Monson
    considered that in order to rely on the Refugee  Convention  to  oppose
    his deportation AA still had to demonstrate that he had a  well-founded
    fear of persecution on return to Turkey for a Convention reason. On the
    evidence, Judge Monson concluded that AA did not  continue  to  have  a
    well-founded fear of persecution on return to Turkey for  a  Convention
    reason. Nor had he shown that he would face  a  real  risk  of  serious
    harm. Accordingly, AA's appeal against the revocation of his protection
    status was dismissed:

         "...the Appellant has not shown that he continues  to  qualify  for
         recognition as a refugee; or that on return to Turkey he would face
         a real risk of serious harm at the  hands  of  State  or  non-State
         agents. The Appellant has also not shown  substantial  grounds  for
         believing that he qualifies in  the  alternative  for  humanitarian
         protection under Paragraph 339C of the  Rules.  So,  the  Appellant
         fails in his  appeal  against  the  revocation  of  his  protection
         status, as he has failed to [show that the  decision  breaches  the
         UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention  or  in  relation  to
         persons eligible for a grant of humanitarian  protection,  pursuant
         to section 82(1)(c).]"

29. In respect of AA's claim under article 8 ECHR, Judge Monson referred to
    the fact that AA had a son who had been born in January  2005  and  who
    had  ADHD,  suffered  from  emotional  and  behavioural  problems,  and
    required extra help at school. AA provided him with  a  high  level  of
    support. Judge Monson found that deporting  AA  would  have  an  unduly
    harsh impact on his son. He therefore  found  that  "exception  2",  as
    prescribed by section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act, applied. He  found  that
    this was not, in itself, enough to tip the balance in AA's favour.

30. Judge Monson referred to AA's work as a businessman, running a chain of
    restaurants. Further, the Secretary of State had accepted in 2007  that
    AA could not be deported without breaching his rights under  article  3
    ECHR. Although that had  changed  with  the  decision  to  revoke  AA's
    refugee status, the factors which had resulted in that  decision  could
    have been relied on in 2007. Moreover, in 2014 the First-tier  Tribunal
    had concluded that AA's conviction  was  not  a  sufficient  basis  for
    refusing leave to remain (see paragraph 9 above)  and  the  refusal  to
    grant indefinite leave to remain because of the conviction was, in  the
    light of this binding conclusion, "manifestly unreasonable and unfair."
    For  these  reasons,  Judge  Monson  concluded  that  there  were  very
    compelling circumstances which outweighed the public interest  in  AA's
    deportation. The appeal was  therefore  allowed  on  the  grounds  that
    deportation would amount to an unjustified interference with AA's right
    to respect for private and family life: "[AA]  has  a  very  compelling
    private and family life claim under article 8(1) such as to render  his
    deportation, more than twenty years after the commission of  the  index
    offence, disproportionate to the legitimate aim of  the  prevention  of
    crime."

Cross-appeal: Finding that removal would not  breach  article  3  ECHR  even
though Secretary of State had not lawfully revoked AA's refugee status

31. We consider the cross-appeal first.

Argument

32. AA contends that once Judge Monson found that the  Secretary  of  State
    had not lawfully revoked AA's refugee status it was not open to him  to
    consider whether removal would amount to a breach of  article  3  ECHR.
    The Judge was wrong to consider that he was bound by  the  decision  in
    Dang. In any event, Dang was wrongly decided: by reason of  article  32
    of the Refugee Convention AA, a recognised refugee, could only be  only
    be removed from the United Kingdom if his conduct could be  categorised
    as a threat to national security or  public  order.  The  Secretary  of
    State seeks to uphold the reasoning of the Immigration Judge.

Discussion

33. In Dang the appellant had been granted refugee status and was  lawfully
    in the United Kingdom as a refugee (see at [18]).  The  Upper  Tribunal
    held that the revocation of refugee status under the Immigration  Rules
    did not have any impact on the application of the  Refugee  Convention.
    The revocation of refugee status only had effect for the purpose of the
    Qualification Directive - see at [20]-[39]. The essential reasoning was
    that under the Refugee Convention a person is a refugee if  he  fulfils
    the criteria prescribed by article 1 of that Convention (here, having a
    well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason).  The  status
    of refugee is achieved  if  and  only  if  the  criteria  are  met.  In
    particular, the status is achieved irrespective of any recognition as a
    refugee by a host state. There is no provision in  the  Convention  for
    the status of refugee to  be  recognised  (or  for  recognition  to  be
    revoked). By contrast, the Qualification Directive  does  require  that
    Member States should grant refugee status to those who qualify. It also
    makes provision for the grant of residence permits to those  recognised
    as refugees. It therefore "made sense" for there to  be  provision  for
    the  grant  of  refugee  status  to  be  revoked.  This  affected   the
    individual's status under  the  Qualification  Directive,  but  has  no
    effect under the Refugee Convention where the individual's status as  a
    refugee does not depend on a grant of recognition.

34. This does not mean that recognition as a refugee has no  effect.  Quite
    apart from the consequences  of  recognition  under  the  Qualification
    Directive, "[a]ny individual who has been recognised as a refugee under
    Article 1A(2), and who is  not  liable  to  refoulement  under  Article
    33(2), can only be deported if the Convention ceases to  apply  to  him
    for one of the reasons set out in article 1C" - see Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department v KN (DRC) [2019] EWCA Civ 1665 per Baker LJ at
    [38] (and cf R (Hoxha) v Special Adjudicator [2005] UKHL 19;  [2005]  1
    WLR 1063  per Lord Brown at [65]).

35. The Tribunal further concluded that the fact that a person had  refugee
    status did not give rise to a  presumption  that  their  removal  would
    breach article 3 ECHR, see at [41]-[42]:

         "41. The  fact  that  an  individual  is  a  refugee  or  has  been
         recognised as a refugee in the past does not mean that there is any
         legal or evidential presumption that removal to his or her  country
         will be in breach of article 3. Where an  individual's  asylum  and
         article 3 claims are decided at the same time and it is found  that
         removal would be in breach of the Refugee Convention, a  real  risk
         of article 3 ill-treatment will usually also be  found.  This  will
         usually be because the factual basis is the same, the risk  factors
         are  the  same  and  the  feared  ill-treatment  amounts  to   both
         persecution and inhuman or degrading treatment, and not because  of
         the existence of any presumption of article 3 risk arising from the
         fact that the asylum claim was successful.

         42.  However, where an individual was recognised a refugee at  some
         point in the past, the past may be relevant in  shedding  light  on
         the current situation and the prospective article  3  risk  but  it
         remains the case that the question whether there is a real risk  of
         article 3 ill-treatment  must  be  answered  at  the  date  of  the
         proceedings before the court and is forward looking."

36. AA's challenge to the reasoning in Dang is based on the  difference  in
    language between articles 32 and 33 of the Convention (see paragraph 15
    above).

37. Article 32 prohibits a state from  expelling  "a  refugee  lawfully  in
    their territory save on grounds of national security or public order."

38. Article 33 prohibits a state from expelling "a refugee  in  any  manner
    whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his  life  or  freedom
    would be threatened on account  of  his  race,  religion,  nationality,
    membership of a particular social group or political opinion."

39. The argument is that the additional words "lawfully in their territory"
    in article 32 indicates that  article  32  has  a  different  field  of
    coverage from article 33. It is said  that  the  latter  applies  to  a
    person who is a  refugee  "simpliciter"  (in  the  language  of  Dang),
    whereas the former applies to someone who  has  been  recognised  as  a
    refugee. In the case of a person who (like AA) has been recognised as a
    refugee (whether or not they continue to satisfy the  definition  of  a
    refugee), article 32 prohibits expulsion save on  grounds  of  national
    security or public order. Accordingly, the Tribunal  Dang  was  (it  is
    argued) wrong to find that someone who had been recognised as a refugee
    could in principle be returned if (adopting a forward looking approach)
    they were not at continuing risk.

40. We accept that there is a difference between the field of  coverage  of
    articles 32 and 33 of the Convention, but we do not accept that  it  is
    quite as suggested on AA's behalf. Article 33 applies to anyone who  is
    a refugee - ie (for these purposes) anyone who has a well-founded  fear
    of persecution for  a  Convention  reason.  Article  32  applies  to  a
    narrower category. It applies to anyone who is a  refugee  but  who  is
    also lawfully in the state's territory. If a  person  ceases  to  be  a
    refugee (because they no longer have a well-founded fear of persecution
    for a Convention reason) then they cease to fall within  the  field  of
    protection afforded by article 32 (and, for that matter,  article  33).
    Nothing in the  travaux  prï¿½paratoires  (to  which  we  were  referred)
    suggests otherwise.

41. We do not therefore accept the argument that Dang was wrongly  decided.
    In any event, we note that the essential reasoning  in  Dang  has  been
    adopted and followed by the Court of Appeal -  see  RY  (Sri  Lanka)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 81 per Simon
    LJ [40]-[43].

42. Nor do we accept that there is any material  distinction  between  Dang
    and the present case. In Dang the appellant's refugee status  had  (for
    the purposes of the Qualification  Directive)  been  lawfully  revoked.
    Here, Judge Monson found that the  revocation  of  refugee  status  was
    unlawful.  However,  in  the  light  of  the  reasoning  in  Dang,  the
    revocation (or otherwise, and lawful or otherwise) of recognition as  a
    refugee is not relevant to the question of whether, for the purposes of
    the Refugee Convention, the person continues to be a refugee. Here, the
    critical issue was whether AA continued to be at risk on return.  Judge
    Monson found that he did not continue to be at  risk  on  return.  That
    meant that AA did not continue to be a refugee within  the  meaning  of
    the Refugee Convention and that AA did not continue to be eligible  for
    a grant of humanitarian protection. It follows that none of the grounds
    for appealing against a removal of protection status (see paragraph  26
    above) were satisfied. It therefore follows that Judge Monson was right
    to dismiss this aspect of AA's appeal.

43. Accordingly,  we  dismiss  AA's  cross-appeal  against  Judge  Monson's
    decision.

Appeal: Finding that deportation would be  a  disproportionate  interference
with family life

Argument

44. The Secretary of State appeals against Judge Monson's  conclusion  that
    there are here very compelling circumstances which outweigh the  public
    interest in deportation.  She  contends  that  having  found  that  the
    consequences of AA's deportation on his son were  not  disproportionate
    and that the "very significant obstacles test is not  met",  the  Judge
    erred in law in finding that AA's compelling private  and  family  life
    rendered his deportation disproportionate. Further, it was argued  that
    Judge Monson failed to give proper weight to  the  public  interest  in
    deportation, notwithstanding  the  period  of  time  that  had  passed.
    Reliance was placed on the observations of  Newey  LJ  in  Olarewaju  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 557:

         "The Court of Appeal addressed the significance  of  rehabilitation
         in Taylor v Home Secretary [2015] EWCA Civ 845. Moore-Bick LJ, with
         whom McCombe and Vos LJJ agreed, said (in paragraph 21):

             "I would certainly not wish  to  diminish  the  importance  of
             rehabilitation in itself, but the cases in which it can make a
             significant  contribution  to  establishing   the   compelling
             reasons  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public   interest   in
             deportation  are  likely   to   be   rare.   The   fact   that
             rehabilitation has begun but is as  yet  incomplete  has  been
             held in general not to be a relevant factor: see SE (Zimbabwe)
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]  EWCA  Civ
             256 and PF  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2015] EWCA Civ 596. Moreover, as was recognised in
             SU (Bangladesh) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
             [2013] EWCA Civ 427, rehabilitation is relevant  primarily  to
             the reduction in the risk of re-offending. It is less relevant
             to the other factors which contribute to the  public  interest
             in deportation."

         With regard to that last sentence, in OH (Serbia) v Home  Secretary
         [2008] EWCA Civ 694, [2009] INLR 109, Wilson LJ (as  he  then  was)
         derived (in paragraph 15) the following propositions  from  earlier
         case-law:

             (a)  The risk of  reoffending  is  one  facet  of  the  public
             interest but, in the case of very serious crimes, not the most
             important facet.

             (b)  Another important facet is  the  need  to  deter  foreign
             nationals from committing serious crimes by  leading  them  to
             understand  that,  whatever  the  other   circumstances,   one
             consequence of them may well be deportation.

             (c)  A further important facet is the role  of  a  deportation
             order as an  expression  of  society's  revulsion  at  serious
             crimes and in building public confidence in the  treatment  of
             foreign citizens who have committed serious crimes.

             (d)  Primary responsibility for  the  public  interest,  whose
             view of it is likely to be wider and better informed than that
             of a tribunal, resides in the  respondent  and  accordingly  a
             tribunal hearing an appeal against a decision to deport should
             not only consider for itself all  the  facets  of  the  public
             interest  but  should  weigh,  as  a  linked  but  independent
             feature, the approach to them adopted by the respondent in the
             context of the facts of the case. Speaking for myself, I would
             not however describe the tribunal's duty  in  this  regard  as
             being higher than 'to weigh' this feature."

         In Ali v Home Secretary, Lord Wilson JSC  said  (at  paragraph  70)
         that he  now  regretted  his  reference  in  sub-paragraph  (c)  to
         society's "revulsion" (that being, he considered,  "too  emotive  a
         concept to figure in this analysis"), but he adhered  to  the  view
         that he  was  "entitled  to  refer  to  the  importance  of  public
         confidence in our determination of these issues".

45. Permission to appeal was granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Coker  who
    observed:

         "It is arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  failed  to  have
         specific regard to the deportation of the appellant in the  context
         of the importance of public confidence in criminal deportation."

46. In response, Mr Bobb argues on AA's  behalf  that  Judge  Monson  fully
    considered the public interest in favour of deportation. He had said:

         "There  is  a  very  strong  public  interest  in  the  Appellant's
         deportation in view of the gravity of the offence reflected in  the
         length of the sentence imposed,  the  Judge's  highly  condemnatory
         sentencing remarks, the Judge's recommendation that  the  appellant
         should be  deported  along  with  the  three  other  convicted  co-
         conspirators, and the public interest  considerations  advanced  by
         the responded in the Human Rights RFRL. Accordingly, in the  normal
         course of  events,  it  would  be  very  hard  to  argue  that  the
         Appellant's deportation was not proportionate."

47. Moreover, there was no  inconsistency  between  the  finding  that  the
    impact on AA's son did not tip the balance  in  AA's  favour,  and  the
    finding that deportation would be a disproportionate interference  with
    AA's private and family life. That is because the latter  finding  took
    account of all the circumstances of the case,  including,  importantly,
    the Tribunal's earlier conclusion that the conviction did not justify a
    refusal of indefinite leave to remain.

Discussion

48. Judge Monson explicitly recognised the strong public interest in favour
    of deportation  (see  paragraph  46  above).  Nothing  in  his  written
    decision suggests that he failed to have regard to that  strong  public
    interest or to give it appropriate weight. To that extent we agree with
    Mr Bobb's submissions.

49. Mr Bobb then contends that  there  was  no  inconsistency  between  the
    finding that the impact on the son was not, in itself, disproportionate
    and  the  finding  that,  assessing  all  the  evidence  as  a   whole,
    deportation would be a disproportionate interference with AA's right to
    respect for family life. Having found that the impact on AA's son  was,
    "in itself", insufficient "to tip the balance" it was entirely open  to
    the Judge to find  that  there  was  an  additional  factor  which  was
    sufficient "to tip the balance". As a matter of logic, and  subject  to
    the legal framework within which the case fell  to  be  considered,  we
    entirely accept those submissions: where a balance falls to  be  struck
    then, everything else being equal, any relevant factor may  be  capable
    of a decisive impact even if that factor is, in itself, of only  modest
    weight.

50. It is, however, important to assess the balance  within  the  statutory
    framework of Part 5A of the 2002 Act. Section 117C(6) provides that the
    public interest required deportation unless there are  very  compelling
    circumstances (beyond any unduly  harsh  impact  on  AA's  partner  and
    child). Accordingly,  it  was  only  if  there  were  "very  compelling
    circumstances" that it would have been open to the Judge to  find  that
    deportation would be disproportionate.

51. The factors which the Judge considered  amounted  to  "very  compelling
    circumstances" were the Secretary of State's decision in  2007  not  to
    pursue deportation, and the finding of the First-tier Tribunal in 2014,
    in the context of AA's rehabilitation and lack of re-offending, and his
    work as a businessman running restaurants.

52. The Court of Appeal and Upper Tribunal have previously  considered  the
    weight  to  be  attached  to  factors  such  as   reformed   character,
    rehabilitation and delay - see Binbuga v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 551 per Hamblen LJ at [84]:

         "...rehabilitation involves no more than returning an individual to
         the place society expects him to be.... It  will  generally  be  of
         little or no material weight in the proportionality balance:

             '...the fact that an  individual  has  not  committed  further
             offences, since release from prison,  is  highly  unlikely  to
             have a material bearing, given that everyone is  expected  not
             to commit crime. Rehabilitation will therefore normally do  no
             more than show that the individual has returned to  the  place
             where society expects him (and everyone else) to be. There is,
             in other words, no material weight which ordinarily  falls  to
             be given to rehabilitation in the  proportionality  balance...
             Nevertheless, as so often in the field of  human  rights,  one
             cannot categorically say that  rehabilitation  will  never  be
             capable  of  playing  a  significant  role...   Any   judicial
             departure from the norm  would,  however,  need  to  be  fully
             reasoned.'"

53. Similarly, in RLP (BAH revisited - expeditious justice) Jamaica  [2017]
    UKUT 330 (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  even  egregious  and
    unjustified delay on  the  part  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
    underlying decision making process is unlikely to tip  the  balance  in
    the immigrant's favour in the proportionality  exercise  under  article
    8(2) ECHR - see at [23]:

         "On the one hand, the delay on the part of the Secretary  of  State
         can only be characterised egregious, is exacerbated by the  absence
         of any explanation and is  presumptively  the  product  of  serious
         incompetence and maladministration.  However, on  the  other  hand,
         the case against the Appellant is  a  formidable  one:  the  public
         interest favours  his  deportation;  the  potency  of  this  public
         interest has been  emphasised  in  a  series  of  Court  of  Appeal
         decisions;  the Appellant's case does not fall within  any  of  the
         statutory or Rules exceptions; the greater part  of  his  life  was
         spent in his country of origin; there is no indication of a  dearth
         of ties or connections with his country of origin; he is culturally
         and socially integrated  there;  his  family  life  in  the  United
         Kingdom is at best flimsy; and most of his sojourn  in  the  United
         Kingdom has been unlawful and precarious.    We take  into  account
         all  of  these  facts  and  factors  in  determining  whether  very
         compelling circumstances have been demonstrated.  This is  a  self-
         evidently elevated threshold which, by its nature, will be overcome
         only by a powerful case. In our judgement the maladministration and
         delay of which the Secretary of State is  undoubtedly  guilty  fall
         measurably short of  the  mark  in  displacing  the  aforementioned
         potent  public  interest  in  the  Article   8(2)   proportionality
         balancing exercise.  We conclude that the Appellant's case fails to
         surpass the threshold by some distance."

54. In UE (Nigeria) and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2010] EWCA Civ 975 the Court of Appeal accepted  that  a  contribution
    made to the community could be relevant to the article 8  balance,  but
    that it was likely to "make a difference to the outcome of  immigration
    cases  only  in  a  relatively  few  instances   where   the   positive
    contribution to this country is very significant" - see per  Sir  David
    Keene at [93].

55. In Thakrar (Cart JR; Art 8: value to community) [2018] UKUT  336  (IAC)
    the appellant's son was "running a substantial business,  employing  40
    people, with a turnover of ï¿½950,000 a year,  and  [was],  as  such,  an
    overwhelming net contributor to the UK economy." After citing  UE  (and
    two earlier cases) Lane J, President, said:

         "114.    Without in any way intending to  be  prescriptive,  it  is
         likely that one touchstone  for  distinguishing  between  instances
         that lie, respectively, exclusively in the policy realm and in  the
         area of Article 8, is whether the removal of the  person  concerned
         will lead to an irreplaceable loss to the community of  the  United
         Kingdom or to a significant element of it.

         115. If judicial restraint is not properly maintained in this area,
         there is a danger that the public's perception of human rights  law
         will be adversely affected.

         116. The following example is, perhaps, useful.  Let  us  assume  a
         judge is  faced  with  two  human  rights  appeals  in  respect  of
         individuals whose situations are entirely the same,  save  for  the
         fact that one is a bus driver and the other a  brain  surgeon.  The
         judge might have his or her own view as to which occupation  is  of
         more value to the United Kingdom. But that view, alone, should  not
         lead the judge to treat them differently under Article 8. Were  the
         judge to do so, he or she would be seriously trespassing  upon  the
         respondent's policy realm.

         117. It must be emphasised that UE is binding authority that, in an
         appropriate case, the weight to  be  given  to  the  importance  of
         maintaining immigration control can be diminished by reason of  the
         effect that the removal of the appellant from  the  United  Kingdom
         would have upon the community. I have tried to  identify  what  are
         the correct criteria for determining if the case is,  in  fact,  an
         appropriate one.

         ...

         120. How does the appellant's submission on this issue  fit  within
         the case law? The blunt answer is that it does  not.  There  is  no
         prospect of the appellant's son abandoning his  business,  and  the
         employees who work in it, if the appellant were to  be  removed  to
         Kenya. What the Tribunal is being asked to do can be distilled into
         the proposition that  someone  whose  family  makes  a  substantial
         contribution to this country's economy ought thereby to be  subject
         to a less stringent set of immigration controls than a person whose
         family does not make such a contribution.

         121. Not only is this, in its own terms, an extremely  unattractive
         proposition. It is one which, if allowed to succeed, would  inflict
         grave damage on human rights law. It would  introduce  an  entirely
         unjustified distinction between the rich,  and  everyone  else.  It
         would also lead to calls for other forms of contribution to  be  so
         recognised..."

56. Here, there was undoubtedly very significant delay before the Secretary
    of State finally decided to make a deportation order.  Moreover,  there
    had been the earlier decision not to seek a deportation order, and  the
    earlier decision of the First-tier Tribunal that the Secretary of State
    had wrongly rejected an application for leave to remain. However, we do
    not consider that these were capable of amounting to  "very  compelling
    circumstances". These factors were not different in nature  from  those
    considered in Binbuga or  RLP.  To  the  extent  that  AA  has  made  a
    contribution to the community, that does not (in the light  of  UE  and
    Thakrar) come within the category of case that is capable of  making  a
    difference.

57. The offence committed by  AA  was  exceptionally  grave.  The  sentence
    exceeded by a factor of more than  3  the  threshold  at  which  it  is
    necessary to demonstrate "very compelling circumstances." The  quantity
    of heroin (200kg) exceeded, by a factor of 40, the indicative  quantity
    set by the Sentencing Council  (5kg)  for  those  offences  which  fall
    within  the  gravest  category  of  harm.  The   public   interest   in
    deportation, applying section 117C(1), (2) and (6) of the 2002 Act, was
    exceptionally strong. As in  RLP  the  factors  which  weighed  against
    deportation failed "to surpass the threshold by some distance."

58. We therefore find that Judge Monson materially erred in law by  finding
    that there were, here, "very compelling circumstances" and  that  these
    were  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in   favour   of
    deportation.

59. The parties agreed that in the  event  that  we  concluded  that  Judge
    Monson erred in law we should re-determine  the  appeal  ourselves.  We
    agree. All necessary findings of fact have been made by  Judge  Monson.
    On those facts, and for the reasons we  have  given,  the  interference
    with AA's right to respect for private and family life (and that of his
    partner and child) that will be occasioned by his deportation is  amply
    justified by the public interest in favour of deportation.

Outcome

60. For these reasons AA's cross-appeal against  the  conclusion  of  Judge
    Monson that removal  would  not  be  contrary  to  article  3  ECHR  is
    dismissed. The Secretary of State's appeal against  the  conclusion  of
    Judge Monson that removal would  be  contrary  to  article  8  ECHR  is
    allowed. We find that AA's removal would not be contrary to  article  8
    ECHR. The Secretary of State's decisions are therefore restored.



Notice of Decision

61. The Secretary of  State's  appeal  is  allowed.  AA's  cross-appeal  is
    dismissed. The Secretary of State's decisions are restored.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

62. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, AA  is  granted
    anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly
    identify him or any member of his family.  This direction applies  both
    to AA and to the Secretary of  State.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
