                                                                 Respondents



For the Appellant:     Ms Hoey, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Young, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the rest  of
    this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal  (where  the
    ECO, not the SSHD, was correctly the respondent).

 2. The first appellant ("the appellant") is a citizen of  Ghana,  born  on
    6th January 1994.  Along with her three younger sisters she applied for
    entry clearance to join their mother, who had been  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK.  The ECO refused all four applications.

 3. By determination promulgated on 10th February 2014 First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Doyle allowed the appeals of the appellant's siblings  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  At �15 (a) to (f)  he  considered  the  appellant's
    claim outwith the Immigration Rules, noting  that  the  effect  of  the
    successful appeals of her co-appellants would be to separate them  from
    her.  She was 19 years of age at the date of decision and 20  years  of
    age at the date of the hearing.  The judge cited case law to the effect
    that whether family life exists among adult siblings for  the  purposes
    of Article 8 is a question to be decided on the facts of each case, and
    that family life is not suddenly cut off at the age of 18.  He found in
    this case a relationship of dependency beyond  normal  emotional  ties,
    the appellants and sponsor having had difficult experiences  throughout
    the years of separation and this appellant being  "not  an  independent
    adult ... still a  schoolgirl  who  needs  her  mother  and  needs  her
    siblings.   The appellants and their sponsor still grieve the  loss  of
    the sponsor's oldest son in September 2012".  The judge found that  the
    decision was a disproportionate interference with article 8 rights.

 4. The ECO appeals to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

         The judge does not consider the guidance in ... Gulshan ...  [2013]
         UKUT 640 ... namely [only] if there are good grounds  for  granting
         leave ... outside the Rules it is necessary for Article 8  purposes
         to go on to consider whether there are compelling circumstances not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules ...

         ...

         The judge omitted to consider whether there are case specific  good
         grounds for granting leave outside the Rules and whether there  are
         compelling circumstances for considering  the  appeal  outside  the
         Rules ... The judge has not considered the correct approach ...

 5. The substance of the grounds  relates  to  the  first  appellant  only,
    although all 4 reference numbers are given.  The  grant  of  permission
    was made in relation to all four original appellants, and all the cases
    were listed for hearing in the Upper Tribunal.  By agreement,  and  for
    avoidance of doubt, Mr  Young  formally  withdrew  the  ECO's  case  in
    relation to the other three appellants.

 6. Mr Young relied particularly on Gulshan at �24 (b) and 27 on  the  need
    to find arguably good grounds before even looking  outside  the  Rules.
    He submitted that the judge had identified no such  grounds.   Ms  Hoey
    submitted that the matters the judge identified at �15 constituted such
    grounds.

 7. I indicated that the ECO's appeal would not succeed.

 8. The judge did not mention Gulshan or other  case  law  along  the  same
    lines, but there is no need for citation,  provided  that  the  correct
    approach is taken  in  practice.   His  specific  reasons  for  looking
    outside the Rules, and for allowing the appeal outside the  Rules,  are
    plainly set out at �15.  The ECO's grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UK  in
    reality are aimed  not  at  the  judge's  legal  approach  but  at  the
    substance of his decision.  The question the judge had  to  answer  was
    not one purely of fact, but it was a highly fact-sensitive  assessment.
     The decision may have been finely balanced, and  a  contrary  decision
    might even have been difficult for the appellant to challenge; but  the
    judge did not take into account any irrelevant  factors,  and  did  not
    fail to take into account any relevant factors.  Judges are well  aware
    of the strength of circumstances necessary to justify going outwith the
    Immigration Rules.

 9. In my view, therefore, the judge  was  entitled  to  look  outside  the
    rules, and to strike the balance in favour of the appellant.   He  gave
    legally adequate reasons, related to the facts of  the  case,  and  the
    SSHD shows no basis on which the Upper Tribunal might interfere.

10. The ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed in respect  of  the
    first appellant and withdrawn in  respect  of  the  other  three.   The
    effective outcome is that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal,
    in relation to all four appellants, shall stand.
