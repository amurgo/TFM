                          DETERMINATION AND REASON


INTRODUCTION

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer has been granted permission to  appeal  the
    determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Devlin  who  allowed  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds by  the  respondent  (referred  to  as  the
    claimant) against the decision refusing her application  dated  13  May
    2013 to settle in the United Kingdom with her husband, Mr Ho  Le.   The
    judge  found  the  claimant  was  unable  to   meet   the   maintenance
    requirements of the Rules but allowed the appeal on Article 8  grounds.



 2. The challenge by the Entry Clearance Officer is on the basis  that  the
    judge had failed to identify the nature of the compelling circumstances
    not sufficiently recognised under the Rules when giving reasons for his
    decision.  There had been no analysis why the claimant could not submit
    a further application and it  could  not  be  considered  unjustifiably
    harsh to require her to do so once Mr Ho  could  demonstrate  that  the
    financial requirements were met.

 3. The relevant facts are these.  The claimant was born  on  12  September
    1982.  Mr Ho was born 1 August  1966.   He  has  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a lengthy period.  Between 1995 and 2010 he lived with Mary
    Chan.  They separated on terms which are set out in an agreement  dated
    2 December 2011.   This  agreement  shows  that  the  couple  have  two
    children, Natasha born 8 June 1997 and Richard born  22  January  2003.
    The deed of  separation  also  provides  the  basis  on  which  certain
    payments were to be made to Mr Ho including a lump sum of  �150,000  of
    which �45,000 had by then already been paid and a  further  payment  of
    �20,000 was to be paid no later than 1 January 2012.  Apart  from  some
    other sums, the remaining  amount  was  to  be  discharged  by  monthly
    payments of �800.

 4. Mr Ho also has another British national daughter called Leah  Bach  who
    was born on 3 September 1991.  Her mother is Tracey Gregory.

 5. Mr Ho first made contact with the claimant by Yahoo  messenger  in  May
    2009.  They met in person on 6 February 2010.  They married on 24  July
    2011, in Vietnam, where they lived for eighteen months.  Their  son  Le
    was born on 25 July  2012.   He  is  a  British  citizen.   Mr  Ho  has
    regularly visited Vietnam since his lengthy stay  there  following  the
    marriage.   Richard  and  Natasha  live  with   their   mother.    They
    accompanied Mr Ho together with Leah Bach to Vietnam for the wedding.

 6. The application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer  because  he
    was not satisfied on the evidence before him that the relationship  was
    genuine and subsisting or that the couple  intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the United Kingdom.  Furthermore, after noting the  deed
    of separation and bank  statements  produced  by  way  of  evidence  of
    payments received, he did not accept that Mr Ho was genuinely receiving
    the "non-employment income" he relied on.  Furthermore, although Mr  Ho
    held cash sums, he did not hold the minimum amount of �62,500  for  the
    period required.  The claimant needed to demonstrate that Mr Ho  had  a
    gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.

 7. The judge heard evidence from Mr Ho and Leah Bach and was provided with
    a volume of documentation regarding  the  claimed  income  of  �23,150.
    After detailed analysis he concluded that the claimant  had  failed  to
    prove Mr Ho had any non-employment income as specified in  s.A1(13)  of
    Appendix FM-SE which in summary required evidence of such income in the
    twelve months prior to the date of  application.   Dr  Mynott  conceded
    that the claimant could not succeed on the basis of cash savings alone.



 8. The judge therefore dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules.
    He did so without making a  finding  on  the  requirements  as  to  the
    genuineness of the relationship.  Under Article 8 however he reached  a
    positive conclusion on that aspect and at [135]  of  his  determination
    referred to the evidence before him, in  particular  that  of  Ms  Bach
    regarding the close relationship between the claimant and  Mr  Ho.   He
    also considered at [136] that the birth of a son strongly indicated the
    relationship's  genuineness.   He  found  therefore  that  family  life
    existed between them and their son.  He also  found  that  family  life
    existed between Natasha, Richard and Mr Ho.  He considered there was no
    evidence of elements of dependency going beyond normal  emotional  ties
    between Leah and Mr Ho.

 9. After directing himself in relation to  further  authorities  including
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT
    640 (IAC), Patel & Others v SSHD [2013]  3WLR  1517,  Sanade  &  Others
    (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) India [2012] UKUT 48  (IAC)  and
    MA & SM (Zambrano - EU children outside EU) Iran  [2013]  UKUT  380  as
    well as  Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013]  UKUT  45  (IAC)
    the judge concluded at [184] that he was bound to find by reason of the
    fact that Mr Ho's son is a British national, family life  between  him,
    the claimant and their son could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  be
    enjoyed in Vietnam with reference to the concession made  by  the  Home
    Office letter of 24 November 2012 (in Sanade).

10. After observing that there was very little evidence as  to  the  nature
    and extent of the relationship between Mr Ho and Richard  and  Natasha,
    the judge concluded at [206] that if Mr Ho were to relocate to  Vietnam
    "...this would inevitably result in  some  degree  of  rupture  in  the
    relationship with them".  This led him to conclude that this would  not
    be in their best interests.

11.  After  referring  to  the  public  interest,  with  reference  to  the
    claimant's failure to produce the documents specified in the Rules  and
    her marriage at a time having been contingent on  an  ability  to  meet
    those Rules, the judge concluded that were it likely the claimant could
    do so, there would be nothing disproportionate in expecting her to make
    a further and properly  substantiated  application.   But  he  was  not
    satisfied this was the case and so reached these conclusions:

         "215.    Looking at everything  in  the  round,  I  have  concluded
              (albeit not without much hesitation) that (i) the  length  of
              the sponsor's lawful residence in  the  United  Kingdom;  and
              (ii) the presence of his three children here, all of whom are
              British citizens, two of whom were minors, and none  of  whom
              can  reasonably  be  expected  to  follow  him  to   Vietnam,
              constitute   compelling   circumstances   not    sufficiently
              recognised under the new rules  that  require  the  grant  of
              leave.

         216. I therefore find that, in the very particular circumstances of
              this case, the respondent's decision prejudices  family  life
              in  a  manner  sufficiently  serious  as   to   violate   the
              fundamental right protected by Article 8.

         217. Indeed, having regard to the rather weaker facts of the second
              appellant's case in MA & SM (Zambrano:  EU  children  outside
              EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 380, I would have felt compelled in  any
              event, to that conclusion."

12. It is argued in the grounds of challenge that  the  judge  should  have
    weighed in the balance the extent of the claimant's failure to meet the
    requirements of the Rules and that the timing of an  application  is  a
    matter for an applicant.  The couple had married  in  Vietnam  with  no
    legitimate expectation that family life could  be  established  in  the
    United Kingdom.  They had lived there following their marriage  and  no
    evidence had been provided why they could not do so.  The child of  the
    marriage lives with the claimant and Article  8  does  not  oblige  the
    United Kingdom to accept the choice of a couple at which  country  they
    prefer to reside in.  The determination amounts to a finding  that  the
    Immigration Rules will never  be  proportionate  in  a  case  involving
    British citizen children and that no  weight  had  been  given  to  the
    public interest.

13. In a Rule 24 response it is argued that the  judge  had  addressed  the
    question of whether the claimant had established arguably good  grounds
    for a grant of  leave  outside  the  Rules.   The  judge  had  properly
    directed himself and made a  structured  assessment  that  the  grounds
    amounted  to  disagreement  rather  than   identifying   any   material
    misdirection in law.

14. With reference to the assertion that no evidence had been provided  why
    family life could not continue in  Vietnam,  the  grounds  ignored  the
    judge's consideration of the line of authorities culminating in MA & SM
    which provided an alternative basis on which  the  appeal  fell  to  be
    allowed.

15. I had careful regard to the submissions by Mr McVeety and Dr Mynott who
    both accepted that I could proceed to re-make the decision in the event
    that error of law was found based on the positive  evidential  findings
    reached by the judge.  Mr McVeety confirmed that there was no challenge
    to the genuineness of the relationship.

DID THE TRIBUNAL MAKE AN ERROR OF LAW?

16. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has set out  his  thought  process  in  a
    particularly lengthy determination which in part is not easy to follow.
     In particular it appears that the judge  may  have  misunderstood  the
    Zambrano principle most recently addressed by the Upper Tribunal in  MA
    & SM.  It is not at all clear from the determination whether the appeal
    was being allowed on Article 8 grounds because  the  decision  offended
    Zambrano principles or because the presence here of British citizenship
    children with whom Mr Ho has family life was sufficient  to  constitute
    compelling circumstances not recognised under the Rules to warrant  the
    appeal being allowed on Article 8 grounds.

17. Although the basis of the Entry Clearance Officer's challenge is headed
    "A material misdirection of law", it is in reality a reasons challenge.
     I am not persuaded by Dr Mynott's argument that the  challenge  is  no
    more than a disagreement.

18. The judge  himself  admits  confusion  over  the  relationship  between
    Article 8 and the Zambrano principle which he expresses in these  terms
    at [179]:

         "I must confess to some difficulty in understanding how a principle
         of EU law, that only applies in exceptional circumstances,  and  is
         not even  engaged  by  the  fact  that  family  life  is  adversely
         affected,  can  be  'extrapolated'  into  a  general  principle  of
         European human rights law, that is engaged whenever family life  is
         adversely affected."

19. The finding that the best interests of Richard and Natasha would not be
    served by Mr Ho relocating to Vietnam is difficult  to  reconcile  with
    the preceding paragraph in the determination at [205] where  the  judge
    referred to there being very little evidence regarding the  nature  and
    extent of the relationship  between  them.   There  appears  to  be  no
    consideration of how those  interests  were  affected  by  the  regular
    absences of Mr Ho in Vietnam  and,  in  particular,  the  lengthy  stay
    following his marriage.  It appears that Richard and  Natasha  went  to
    the wedding.  Beyond that and the evidence of Leah that the three  have
    a  very  close  relationship,  the  determination  despite  its  length
    contains no analysis of how significant a  role  Mr  Ho  plays  in  his
    children's  lives  which  would   be   a   relevant   factor   in   the
    proportionality exercise.

20. My conclusion is that the judge failed to give sufficient  reasons  for
    his conclusion to allow the appeal on Article 8, such reasons which  he
    gave for doing so are inadequate.  I therefore set aside  his  decision
    which I proceed to re-make.

RE-MAKING THE DECISION

21. I drew the attention of the parties to the recent decision of the Court
    of Appeal in MM & Ors, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
    985 which  is  of  particular  relevance  to  this  case  where  it  is
    undisputed that  the  claimant  was  unable  to  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules.

22. At paragraph 128,  Aikens  LJ  observes  "...if  the  applicant  cannot
    satisfy the Rule, then there either is,  or  there  is  not  a  further
    Article 8 claim.  That will have  to  be  determined  by  the  relevant
    decision-maker".

    At [134]:

         "...but if the relevant group of IRs is not such a 'complete  code'
         then the proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided
         by the Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law".

    And at [137]:

         "...There is nothing in the 1971 Act or the common law that  grants
         a 'constitutional right' of British citizens to live in the UK with
         non EEA partners who do not have the right of abode in the  UK  and
         who are currently living outside the UK.  Of course, I accept  that
         the UK partner (whether a UK citizen of a refugee  or  person  with
         HP) is entitled to respect of his or her  right  to  marry  and  to
         found a family. But those are not  absolute  rights;  there  is  no
         absolute right to marry and found a family in the UK if it involves
         marriage to a non-EEA citizen who then wishes to reside in the UK."



    And finally at [162]:
         "First, paragraph GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM states that the  provision
         of the family route 'takes into account the need to  safeguard  and
         promote the welfare of children in the UK',  which  indicates  that
         the Secretary of State  has  had  regard  to  the  statutory  duty.
         Secondly, there is no legal requirement that the IRs should provide
         that the best interests  of  the  child  should  be  determinative.
         section 55 is  not  a  'trump  card'  to  be  played  whenever  the
         interests of a child arise. Thus, thirdly, the new MIR are  only  a
         part of requirements set out in Appendix FM, but an important part.
         If a child in the UK is to be joined by a non-EEA partner under the
         'partner rules' (as compared with those under E-LTRPT.2.3) then  it
         is reasonable to require, for  the  child's  best  interests,  that
         there be adequate financial provision for the  unit  of  which  the
         child will be a part if  the  non-EEA  partner  joins  it.  If  the
         financial requirements are otherwise judged to be lawful, then,  on
         the financial front, that must mean the section 55  duty  has  been
         discharged in framing the relevant IR."

23. Family life was found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge as between Mr Ho
    and Richard and Natasha and as between Mr Ho, the  claimant  and  their
    son.  Richard and Natasha do not live with Mr Ho and  the  evidence  is
    unclear as to the extent of his role in their lives.  They have however
    a close relationship inevitably as the result of his presence in  their
    lives  until  separation  from  Ms  Chan.   I  have  no  difficulty  in
    understanding why the  judge  concluded  that  it  was  in  their  best
    interests that he should continue to be present in the United  Kingdom.
    That is an important part of the proportionality exercise which I shall
    return to in a moment.

24. As to the second family relationship which Mr Ho  has,  this  might  be
    best described as the primary one since he has married the claimant and
    they have a child.  It is open to that child at any stage  to  exercise
    his rights as an EU citizen and make his way to the United Kingdom.  On
    the evidence before me there is no suggestion that he would  be  unable
    to do so without the claimant being present.  Mr Ho has been  a  father
    to three other children here and there is no  suggestion  he  does  not
    have good parenting skills.   Accordingly  the  refusal  to  admit  the
    claimant to the United Kingdom would not deprive her son of the genuine
    enjoyment of the substance of his rights associated with his status  as
    an EU citizen and there would therefore be no breach of Article  20  of
    the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

25. It is necessary to turn to the familiar Razgar test.  There is no doubt
    that Article 8 is in play because of the two elements  of  family  life
    that have been found.  As Mr Ho was unable to demonstrate the funds the
    claimant needs to meet the requirements of the Rules the only basis  on
    which he can continue his family life with her  and  their  son  is  by
    moving to Vietnam.  This is unattractive to him because he has lived in
    the United Kingdom for a lengthy period.  This of itself is not  enough
    in the light of the observations of Aikens LJ to engage Article 8.  The
    impact on the family life he has with Richard and Natasha would however
    be sufficiently serious to engage Article 8.

26. The aim pursued by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  is  both  lawful  and
    legitimate.

27.  Section  117A  of  the  2002  Act  requires  me  in   the   particular
    circumstances of this case to have regard to the considerations  listed
    in s.117B in the context of the "public interest question" meaning  the
    question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to  respect
    for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).

28. Section 117B is in these terms:

         "117B.   Article 8: public interest  considerations  applicable  in
               all cases:

             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
                  the public interest.

             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests of the economic wellbeing of the United  Kingdom
                  that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United
                  Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons who can
                  speak English -

                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                  interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom,
                  that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United
                  Kingdom are financially independent, because such  persons
                  -

                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

             (4)  Little weight should be given to -

                  (a)  private life, or

                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner  that
                      is established by a person at a time when the  person
                      has been in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

             (5)   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
                  established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                  immigration status is precarious.

             (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
                  the public interest does not require the person's  removal
                  where -

                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                      relationship with a qualifying child, and

                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                      leave the United Kingdom."

29. The claimant's son is a qualifying child, however he is not  living  in
    the United Kingdom and accordingly s.117B does not apply.   The  impact
    of this new legislation is limited with  regard  to  applications  from
    abroad.

30. Regard needs to be had to the best interests of Le, the claimant's son.
     Those interests are that he should be brought up by both parents.   He
    has spent the whole of his short life  in  Vietnam  and  therefore  the
    decision does not result in any  severance  of  ties  with  the  United
    Kingdom except that of nationality.  He is able to exercise his  rights
    as an EU citizen or indeed as a  British  national  by  coming  to  the
    United Kingdom.  Although I have concluded that Mr  Ho  is  capable  of
    caring for him, his best interests would be served by having his mother
    present also.

31. As observed by Aikens LJ those best interests cannot operate as a trump
    card in the face of the inability of the claimant to meet the financial
    requirements.  My conclusion therefore is that those interests  can  be
    as well served  by  Mr  Ho  moving  to  Vietnam.   The  proportionality
    exercise requires a resolution of the competing interests  between  the
    best interests of Natasha  and  Richard  and  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control.  In my view, in  the  absence  of  any
    detailed evidence of the extent of Mr Ho's role in their  lives,  I  am
    not satisfied that their interests are sufficiently compelling for  the
    claimant to be granted entry clearance.  As I have observed  above,  Mr
    Ho has been content to spend an extended period in Vietnam and to visit
    there regularly.  There is no evidence that his  extended  absence  has
    adversely impacted on Richard and Natasha.  They will be able to  visit
    him and it will be open to him to  make  return  visits.   In  all  the
    circumstances of this case I  am  not  persuaded  that  there  are  the
    sufficient compelling circumstances which justify allowing this  appeal
    on Article 8 grounds.

32. By way of summary therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  on
    Article 8 grounds is set aside  for  error  of  law.   I  re-make  that
    decision and dismiss  the  appeal.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules stands.
