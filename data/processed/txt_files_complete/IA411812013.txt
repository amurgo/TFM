Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:          In person

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    I shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  22nd  August  1987.  His
      appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  of  26th  September  2013
      refusing to vary leave to remain and the decision to remove him  under
      section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006  was
      allowed by the First-tier Tribunal in so far as the decisions were not
      in accordance with the law. The Secretary of State appealed.

2.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid  on
      3rd June 2014 on the grounds  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Phull
      misdirected herself in  law  in  her  application  of  the  evidential
      flexibility policy in failing to  have  regard  to  SSHD  v  Rodriquez
      [2014] EWCA Civ 2.

3.    Mr Bramble relied on the grounds of  appeal  and  submitted  that  the
      Judge wrongly relied on the Upper Tribunal decision in Rodriguez which
      had been quashed by the  Court  of  Appeal.  Paragraph  245AA  of  the
      Immigration Rules did not apply in this case because the Appellant had
      failed to provide bank statements. The Appellant claimed that  he  had
      failed to do so because there was some confusion as to the  amount  of
      maintenance required. At the date of the  Respondent's  decision,  the
      Appellant had provided no bank statements at all. The bank  statements
      before the First-tier Tribunal did not assist  the  Appellant  because
      the funds were not in the account in Bangladesh on  20th  August  2013
      and the Appellant's closing balance  in  the  UK  was  in  debit.  The
      Appellant did not have the required funds for the 28-day period in any
      event. The Appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules and
      the Judge erred in law in allowing the appeal.

4.    The Appellant explained the confusion over the amount  of  maintenance
      and stated that he did not have time to obtain the evidence  required.
      He was initially advised, by an agent, to show funds of �2000, but  on
      completion of the form, he was advised that he needed to show funds of
      �9,000. He sent his application to the Home Office with a letter  that
      maintenance evidence would follow. He immediately sought  evidence  of
      funds from Bangladesh, but  his  application  was  refused  before  he
      received this evidence.

5.    I find that the Judge erred in law  in  finding  that  the  evidential
      flexibility policy applied in this case. She  wrongly  relied  on  the
      case of Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042.  I set aside
      the decision (and the fee award) of 9th May 2014, allowing the  appeal
      in so as far as the Respondent's decision of 26th September  2013  was
      not in accordance with the law. The Respondent's appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal is allowed.

6.    I remake the decision as follows. At the time of the application,  the
      Appellant failed  to  provide  any  bank  statements  as  evidence  of
      maintenance funds. This was not a case where a document in a  sequence
      was missing or a  document  was  in  the  wrong  format,  or  a  copy.
      Paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules did not apply.

7.    The application was made on 22nd August 2013. The bank statement  from
      Bangladesh showed that on 21st August 2013 the Appellant  had  115,000
      Lac in his account. On 25th August 2013, he had 1,150,000 Lac  in  his
      account. The Appellant's UK bank account showed that the Appellant was
      overdrawn on 20th August 2013. He did however hold over �2000  in  his
      account from 7th to 18th August 2013. I find that  the  Appellant  had
      failed to show on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  held  the
      required funds for the 28-day period prior to the application.

8.    Accordingly, the Appellant has failed to show that  he  satisfied  the
      maintenance requirements of Appendix C and paragraph 245ZX(d)  of  the
      Immigration Rules. There was nothing to  prevent  the  Appellant  from
      making a further application. I find that he has failed to  show  that
      Article 8 is engaged. The Appellant's appeal is  dismissed  under  the
      Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

9.    I find that the Judge erred in law in allowing the appeal and  I  set
      aside the decision, dated 9th May 2014, and remake it as follows:  The
      Appellant's appeal against the refusal to vary leave and the  decision
      to remove him is dismissed.
