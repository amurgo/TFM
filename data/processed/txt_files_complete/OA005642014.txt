Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Sponsor in person

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Grimshaw made following a hearing at Bradford on 23rd June 2014.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on  1st  April  1966.   She
    applied to come to the UK as a spouse but was refused, on 19th November
    2013, on the grounds that the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied
    that the relationship between the couple was genuine and subsisting and
    that the Sponsor could meet the financial requirements of Appendix  FM.



 3. The judge was satisfied that the couple were in a genuine  relationship
    which had continued since their marriage and that they had a commitment
    to a shared future.

 4. With respect to the financial requirements of  the  Rules,  she  saw  a
    letter from the Sponsor's employer and his P60 for the tax year  ending
    April 2014 which showed his gross annual earnings from  his  employment
    with Cranswick Gourmet Bacon Company of ï¿½20,124.43.

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had had no regard to the rules of specified  evidence.  There
    was still no clear evidence regarding the Sponsor's employment earnings
    for the qualifying period.

 6. Mr Diwnycz helpfully went through the documentation with  the  Sponsor,
    and having done so, told me that he was  satisfied  that  the  relevant
    documents established that the Sponsor's earnings were as claimed, even
    though the documentary evidence referred to  in  the  grounds  had  not
    found its way into the Respondent's bundle.

 7. He did not wish to dispute the conclusions of the Immigration Judge and
    withdrew his challenge  to  the  determination,  which  will  therefore
    stand.

Decision

 8. The judge did not err in law and her decision stands.
