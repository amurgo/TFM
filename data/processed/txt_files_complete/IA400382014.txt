                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make an anonymity order to protect the anonymity
      of the appellant's children.   Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  Court
      directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings  shall  directly  or
      indirectly identify the Appellant.  This direction applies to both the
      appellant and to the respondent and a  failure  to  comply  with  this
      direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.


Introduction

   2. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Coaster) allowing MB's appeal against a decision  made
      on 22 September 2014 refusing to grant her an extension of  her  leave
      to remain as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  (HC
      395 as amended).

   3. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as they  appeared  before
      the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

   4. The appellant is a citizen of the Gambia who was born on 16 June 1983.
       She is married to "FS" who is a Tier 4 (Student)  studying  currently
      at the University of the West of England for a BSc  (Hons)  degree  in
      Mental Health Nursing.

   5. On 15 April 2006, the appellant entered  the  UK  with  leave  as  his
      dependant which was extended until 20 August 2014.  On that date,  the
      appellant made an application to remain as his partner under  Appendix
      FM.  At that time FS, had  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK.
      Subsequently, on 4 February 2016, FS became a British Citizen.

   6. The appellant and FS have two children who were born in  the  UK:  "A"
      who was born on 15 October 2012 and "O" who  was  born  on  4  October
      2007.   Both  children  became  British   Citizens   by   registration
      respectively on 5 January 2015 and 6 January 2015.   At  the  date  of
      application on 20 August 2014, however, FS and the two children  were,
      of course, not British Citizens.

   7. On 22 September 2014, the Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's
      application for leave as a partner.  The Secretary of  State  was  not
      satisfied, on the basis of  the  specified  documents  required  under
      Appendix FM-SE, that the  sponsor  earned  the  required  �24,800  and
      further the appellant had not submitted the required English  language
      certificate from an approved test provider although the appellant  did
      provide an English language certificate at the required level  from  a
      non-approved provider.  Further, the Secretary of State concluded that
      the appellant could not succeed under the "parent" route  in  Appendix
      FM,  under  para  276ADE  or  outside  the  Rules  on  the  basis   of
      "exceptional circumstances".

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

   8.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier   Tribunal.    In   her
      determination promulgated on 3 September  2015,  Judge  Coaster  found
      that the appellant could not  succeed  under  the  relevant  rules  in
      Appendix FM as a partner because the  appellant  could  not  establish
      that she met the financial requirements or that she had  provided  the
      required English language certificate.  Further, the  judge  concluded
      that the appellant could not succeed under para 276ADE(1)(vi) as there
      were not very significant obstacles to her integration into the Gambia
      on return.

   9. Having concluded that the appellant could not succeed under the Rules,
      the judge went on to consider  whether  the  appellant  could  succeed
      under Art 8.  At para 33 of her  determination,  she  noted  that  the
      appellant's circumstances had changed since the Secretary  of  State's
      decision namely that her two children were now British Citizens.   The
      judge then went on to consider the appellant's circumstances  and,  in
      particular, the best interests of her two children which she concluded
      were to live with both parents in the UK.  Her reasons are at paras 34-
      41 of her determination as follows:

         "34.     The appellant is  still  not  in  a  position  to  satisfy
             Article 8 within the Immigration Rules in that she  still  has
             not shown she meets the  financial  threshold  of  �18,600  in
             Appendix FM.SE.  I have born in mind that Article 8 is  not  a
             means to  circumvent  the  Immigration  Rules.   I  have  also
             considered that if the appellant were to be in a  position  to
             make a lawful in-country  renewed  application  for  leave  to
             remain she could claim that she would likely  succeed  meeting
             the requirement of EX.1 (a)(i) and  (ii)  in  so  far  as  her
             eldest child in the United Kingdom, [O], has now lived in  the
             United Kingdom for more than seven years, taking into  account
             the best interest of the child.

         35.      There was no question surrounding the genuineness  of  the
             appellant's marriage.  It was not in dispute.   The  appellant
             and her husband have been married for 12 years and have  three
             children together.

         36.      In considering Article 8, I have a duty  to  consider  the
             best interests of the children under S55  Borders  Citizenship
             and Immigration Act 2009 which requires me to have  regard  to
             the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children  who
             are in the United Kingdom, irrespective of  nationality.   The
             best interests of a child are a  primary  consideration  under
             Article 8(2).

         37.      The appellant's children, [O] and  [A]  have  a  right  of
             abode in the United Kingdom, as British citizens.   They  have
             lived in the United Kingdom all of their lives although [A] is
             still not yet three years of age and  her  life  is  still  no
             doubt very much focussed on her parents and brother.  She  and
             [O] have been brought up speaking Mandika, the  native  tongue
             of their  mother,  and  English.   [O]  is  in  school.   Both
             children have the right to be educated here along  with  other
             citizenship rights  that  they  could  not  exercise  if  they
             remained with their mother and returned with  her  to  Gambia.
             It was established in ZH Tanzania that the duty is to  make  a
             child's  interests  a  primary  consideration   although   the
             strength of other factors may  outweigh  ultimately  the  best
             interests of the child.  In essence, a child's nationality  in
             a case such as this is not a "trump card".

         38.      Is it in the children's best interests for their mother to
             be  returned  to  Gambia  without  them?    Apart   from   the
             unattractive and obvious issue of such  a  course  of  conduct
             separating the children at a young age from their mother,  and
             the emotional  damage  that  may  cause,  there  is  also  the
             question of their care in the United Kingdom by their  father,
             who no doubt although a  loving  father  would  find  it  very
             difficult as a single parent of limited means to care for  his
             children without the support of his wife especially as in this
             case it would mean that his studies would be interrupted.   It
             would also be more difficult  to  find  work  to  support  his
             children and his wife.  I do not accept that the sponsor would
             be completely unable to look after his children, only that  it
             would be more difficult.

         39.      The most significant factor in this case  is  prospect  of
             the separation of two young children  from  their  mother  and
             whether that is in  their  best  interests.   It  matters  not
             whether they were conceived and born in the United Kingdom  in
             order to facilitate the enhancement of the immigration  status
             of their mother, as children are not to be attributed with the
             fault of the parents.  In this case that  allegation  was  not
             made and I take into account that the  appellant  and  sponsor
             were already married for four years before the appellant  came
             to the United Kingdom.

         40.      If the children  were  to  return  to  Gambia  with  their
             mother, they would be separated from their father as he has  a
             right to stay in the United Kingdom.   They  would  no  longer
             have the love and support on  a  day  to  day  basis  of  both
             parents as they enjoy now.  The sponsor is free to  return  to
             Gambia with his wife and children but in  so  doing  he  would
             interrupt his studies which when complete  would  improve  the
             position of not only himself but also his family.  It would be
             possible for the sponsor to remain alone in the United Kingdom
             but the effect on him would be to remove him from contact with
             his children for lengthy periods of time to the  detriment  of
             the children.

         41.      In applying the five limb test of Razgar  the  first  four
             limbs are answered in the affirmative.   On  the  question  of
             proportionality I take into account the best interests of  the
             children and of the sponsor as set out above in paragraphs  36
             to 39 above.   I  find  that  although  it  is  legitimate  to
             consider the importance of upholding  consistent,  transparent
             and fair immigration rules, in this family's case,  to  do  so
             would be a breach of their rights under Article 8 ECHR and  in
             all the circumstances of this case, it is  a  disproportionate
             interference."

  10. As a consequence, the judge allowed the appellant's appeal  under  Art
      8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

  11. The Secretary of State sought  permission  to  appeal  on  the  single
      ground that the judge  had  failed  properly,  or  at  all,  to  apply
      s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the
      "NIA Act 2002").  First, the judge had  failed  to  make  any  finding
      under s.117B(6)(b) whether it was "reasonable to expect" the  children
      to leave the United Kingdom.  Secondly,  and  related  to  that  first
      point, the judge had in paras 36-39 of her determination conflated the
      best  interests  of  the  children  with  the  issue  of  whether  any
      interference with the appellant's Art 8 rights was proportionate.

  12. On 12 January 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge P J M Hollingworth)
      granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal.

  13. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Submissions

  14. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Richards  submitted  that  the
      narrow issue was whether or not  the  judge  had  failed  properly  to
      address the requirement in s.117B, and  in  particular  in  s.117B(6),
      whether it was reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK where
      the appellant had no leave to remain.  He submitted that the judge had
      failed to make any  finding  on  that  issue  and  had,  consequently,
      materially erred in law.

  15. Mr Richards invited me to set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision
      on the basis that there was an error of law and to remake the decision
      under Art 8 dismissing the appeal on the basis of the submissions made
      by the Presenting Officer at the First-tier Tribunal set out  in  para
      15 of the judge's determination.

  16. On behalf of the appellant,  Mr  Haq  submitted  that  the  judge  had
      properly considered the best interests of the children in paras  36-40
      of her determination and had, in effect, decided that it would not  be
      reasonable for them to return to the Gambia on the basis  set  out  in
      para 40 that the effect of their removal would  be  to  separate  them
      from their father studying in the  UK.   Mr  Haq  submitted  that  the
      conclusion that it would not be "reasonable" to expect the children to
      leave the UK was conclusive of the public interest issue under Art 8.2
      applying s.117B(6) (see Treebhawon and Others (section 117B(6)) [2015]
      UKUT 674 (IAC)).

  17. Mr Haq submitted that, if there was an error of law and if I  were  to
      remake the decision, I should bear in  mind  that  the  appellant  and
      sponsor had a subsisting relationship and the children were at school.
       Mr Haq drew my attention  to  a  number  of  documents  in  a  bundle
      submitted for the hearing (and to which no  objection  was  raised  to
      their admission) including two letters from the children's school  and
      pre-school (at pages 6 and 7) and from the sponsor's tutor (page 2).

  18. Mr Haq submitted that it was not in the best interests of the children
      to leave the UK or to remove the appellant  leaving  them  alone  with
      their father.  He submitted that, in  the  latter  circumstances,  the
      sponsor might well not be able to make arrangements for  the  care  of
      the children.  He reminded me, based upon the decision in Azimi-Moayed
      [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC), that it was generally in the best interests  of
      children to live with both their parents.

  19. Mr Haq submitted that the appellant could succeed under  the  "parent"
      route in Appendix  FM  if  an  application  were  made  now  when  the
      financial requirements and English language requirement applicable  to
      a "partner" claim would not be relevant.  In support of  that  Mr  Haq
      sought permission (to which I agreed) to  submit  the  relevant  Rules
      subsequent to the hearing.  Later on the date of the hearing,  Mr  Haq
      faxed to the Tribunal the Home  Office's  relevant  IDI  dealing  with
      applications under Appendix FM by a parent in section 7 of IDI  Family
      Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b, Family  Life  (as  a  Partner  or
      Parent) and Private Life: 10-year Routes (August 2015).

  20. In addition, Mr Haq submitted  that  the  appellant  had  no  criminal
      convictions, she had come to the UK lawfully and had always had  leave
      as a Tier 4 dependant.  He invited me, if I remade  the  decision,  to
      allow the appeal under Art 8.

Discussion

  21. The appellant's claim is exclusively based  upon  Art  8  outside  the
      Rules.  It was not suggested by Mr Haq that the appellant should  have
      succeeded before the judge under the Rules.   It  is  not,  therefore,
      suggested that the appellant should have succeeded under  para  276ADE
      or as a partner under Appendix FM because, as  the  judge  found,  the
      appellant  could  not  meet  the   financial   or   English   language
      requirements of the Rules.  Given that  at  the  date  of  application
      neither child was a British Citizen nor had either child lived in  the
      UK for a continuous period of seven years, likewise the  children  had
      no claim based upon their private life under para 276ADE(1)(iv).   For
      that reason also, EX.1(a)(i) could not apply for the same reason so as
      to excuse the  appellant  from  the  financial  and  English  language
      requirements in Appendix FM.  The judge also found that there were  no
      "insurmountable obstacles" to the appellant returning to the Gambia so
      as to satisfy the requirement in EX.1(b).  As I  have  said,  none  of
      those findings were disputed before me.

  22. Given the judge's finding that the appellant could not  succeed  under
      the Rules, as the case law  recognises,  the  judge  was  required  to
      consider the appellant's claim outside the Rules  under  Art  8  (see,
      e.g. R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin); Singh and Khalid v SSHD
      [2015] EWCA Civ 74; and SS (Congo) and Others v SSHD [2015] EWCA 387).
       In order to do so, the jurisprudence is  clear  that  the  individual
      must establish "compelling circumstances" having  regard  to  all  the
      circumstances including those  already  considered  under  the  Rules.
      That approach is applicable in both removal cases  (see,  e.g.  Nagre)
      and entry clearance cases (see, e.g.  SS  (Congo)).   Equally,  it  is
      clear that, so far as relevant to the individual case,  a  judge  must
      "have regard" to the statutory factors set out in s.117B  of  the  NIA
      Act 2002 in substance (see e.g. Bossade (ss.117A-D - interrelationship
      with  Rules)   [2015]   UKUT   415   (IAC)   and   Forman   (ss.117A-C
      considerations) [2-15] UKUT 412 (IAC)) but is not  confined  to  those
      factors in  considering  the  public  interest  (see,  e.g.  Rajendran
      (s.117B - family life) [2016] UKUT 138 (IAC) and Bossade).

  23. Where children are involved, of course, the Secretary of State  has  a
      duty under s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009
      to have regard to the "need to safeguard and promote  the  welfare  of
      children".  This is, in effect, a requirement to  consider  the  "best
      interests" of any child which is a "primary" consideration but not one
      which is determinative (see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC  4).   As
      Lady Hale recognised (at [26]) identifying a  child's  best  interests
      need not inexorably lead  to  a  decision  in  conformity  with  those
      interests because the strength of other  considerations  may  outweigh
      them.

  24. In this appeal, the judge made clear findings that it was not  in  the
      two children's best interests for the appellant to be returned to  the
      Gambia or for them to leave the UK and  go  to  the  Gambia  with  her
      leaving their father here.  Mr Richards' submission,  based  upon  the
      narrow issue raised in the grounds of appeal, was that these  findings
      were not equivalent to a finding under s.117B(6) that it would not  be
      reasonable to expect them to leave the UK.   Consequently,  the  judge
      had failed properly, or at all, to apply s.117B(6).

  25. At para 22 of her determination the judge set out in full both  s.117A
      and s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.  As I have said, the sole focus of the
      Secretary of State's challenge to the judge's decision is  in  respect
      of s.117B(6) which states as follows:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)       the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

  26. It was never doubted  before  the  judge  that  the  appellant  had  a
      "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" with both her children.
       Likewise, at the date of hearing each child was a "qualifying  child"
      within s.117D(1) as each was a British Citizen.  In addition, "O"  had
      also been in the UK for a "continuous period of seven years or more".

  27. The issue of a child's "best interests" is not necessarily coterminous
      with the issue of whether it would be "reasonable" to expect  them  to
      leave the UK.  The Upper Tribunal made this point  in  PD  and  Others
      (Art 8 - conjoined family claims) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT 00108 (IAC) at
      [32] where the President (McCloskey J) said this:

         "32.     At this  juncture,  we  remind  ourselves  that  the  best
             interests of the third Appellant have, by statute, the  status
             of a primary consideration.  We  are  also  mindful  that  our
             assessment of the best interest of the third Appellant is  not
             determinative of the question posed by both paragraph 276  ADE
             (1)(iv) of the Rules and Section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act,
             namely whether it would be reasonable to expect him  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.  This question cannot be answered  without
             considering the parents' appeals, to which we now turn. ..."

      At [39] - [40]  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  PD  explained  the  test  of
      "reasonableness" in s.117B(6) in the following terms:

         "39.     We remind ourselves that the test to be applied is that of
             reasonableness.  Other legal  tests  which  have  gained  much
             currency in this sphere during recent years  -  insurmountable
             obstacles, exceptional circumstances, very compelling  factors
             - have no application in the exercise we are performing.  Self-
             evidently, the test of reasonableness poses  a  less  exacting
             and demanding threshold than that posed  by  the  other  tests
             mentioned.

         40.      Judicial decision making in the sphere of immigration  and
             asylum law is rarely straightforward.  The present appeals are
             no  exception  in  this  respect.   We   consider   that   the
             application of the reasonableness test involves a  balance  of
             all material facts and  considerations.   The  application  of
             this test will invariably be intensely fact sensitive, see  EB
             (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2008]
             UKHL 41, at [7] - [12], per  Lord  Bingham.   Ultimately,  the
             factors to which we give determinative weight are  the  length
             of the third Appellant's residence in the United Kingdom (some
             11 years), which has spanned three quarters of his  life;  his
             deep immersion in all aspects of life  in  this  country;  the
             critical stage of his  personal  and  educational  development
             which has been  reached;  his  minimal  connections  with  his
             country of origin; and the likelihood  that  he  will  make  a
             useful contribution to United Kingdom society."

  28. Whilst the judge did not  make  an  explicit  finding  in  respect  of
      s.117B(6), it is clear that she  had  that  provision  well  in  mind.
      First, at para 22 she set out in full s.117B(6).  Secondly, at para 34
      which I set out above, the judge noted  that  an  application  by  the
      appellant made now "would likely succeed" in meeting the  requirements
      of EX.1(a)(i) and (ii).  That provision as the  Secretary  of  State's
      grounds  acknowledge,  is  not  materially  different  from  s.117B(6)
      applying  to  a  British  Citizen  child  under  the  age  of  18   in
      circumstances where it would not be "reasonable to expect the child to
      leave the UK".  Thus, whilst the judge's focus in paras 36-40  is,  at
      first blush,  upon  the  "best  interests"  of  the  two  children  in
      substance it is, in my judgment,  a  finding  that  it  would  not  be
      "reasonable" for them to leave the UK.  That is particularly  apparent
      from the judge's reasoning in para 40 where she considers, and rejects
      as an option, the children returning to the Gambia with the  appellant
      leaving their father in the UK.

  29. Neither the grounds, nor Mr Richards in his  submissions,  pointed  to
      any factors which the judge had failed to take  into  account  in  her
      reasoning in paras 34-41 of her determination.  At para 37, the  judge
      noted that neither the children's best interests nor their nationality
      (as British Citizens) were "trump cards".  The judge clearly took into
      account the  disruption  to  the  appellant's  family  life  with  her
      children if she returned to the  Gambia  without  them  and  also  the
      disruption to their family life with their father if they returned  to
      the Gambia without him.  As regards the latter, the judge was entitled
      to take into account that their father was studying  in  the  UK  and,
      indeed, at that time had indefinite leave to  remain.   Likewise,  the
      judge clearly took into  account  the  public  interest  in  effective
      immigration control; not only did she specifically set  out  s.117B(1)
      at para 22, but she made specific reference to  it  in  balancing  the
      appellant's rights against the public  interest  in  para  41  of  her
      determination.

  30. For these reasons, I reject the "narrow issue" ground relied  upon  by
      the Secretary of State.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  did  not
      materially err in law in allowing the appellant's appeal under Art 8.

  31. I would add, however, that even if the  judge  erred  in  law  on  the
      narrow issue relied upon by the Secretary of State, I would remake the
      decision allowing the appeal in any event.

  32. First,  the  judge's  findings  in  respect  of  the  children's  best
      interests are not challenged by the Secretary  of  State.   The  judge
      found that it was not in the children's best interests to be separated
      from the appellant if she returned to the Gambia and they remained  in
      the UK.  Likewise, it was not in their best interests to be  separated
      from their father in the UK by returning  to  the  Gambia  with  their
      mother.  Those are findings with which I agree.

  33. Both children are British Citizens and, by the  time  of  the  hearing
      before me, their father is also a British Citizen.  I accept that  the
      children (in particular "O") are now embedded in the UK culturally and
      educationally.  Both children were born in the UK and are aged  now  8
      and 3 years old.  They have never lived in the Gambia.  Their  British
      citizenship is an important feature of this case.  In  ZH,  Lady  Hale
      recognised that a child's nationality was  not  a  "trump  card"  (see
      [30]).  It was, nevertheless, an important feature  in  assessing  the
      "best interests" of the child and, I would add, the reasonableness  of
      whether they should leave the UK.  At [32], Lady Hale said this:

         "Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be played down.
          As citizens these children have rights which they will not be able
         to exercise if they move to another country.  They  will  lose  the
         advantages of growing up and being educated in their  own  country,
         their own culture and their own language.  They will have lost  all
         this when they come back as adults."

  34. Whilst those features may not all be  applicable  to  the  appellant's
      children, they are nationals of this  country  and  have  never  lived
      elsewhere and would be deprived of the many  benefits  of  citizenship
      whilst living in the UK if they return to the Gambia.

  35. Likewise, now their father (the appellant's husband) is also a British
      Citizen.  He too will be deprived of the intrinsic benefits of British
      citizenship if he is required to return to the Gambia, in  effect,  in
      order to maintain his family life with the  appellant  and,  in  those
      circumstances, inevitably with his children.  The evidence to which Mr
      Haq referred me clearly indicates that the sponsor  is  undertaking  a
      degree course with a view to qualifying as a nurse in the  UK.   As  a
      British Citizen, that is his right and  if  required  (in  effect)  to
      leave the UK that benefit would be lost.

  36. I accept that the  appellant  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  I accept, of course,  that  the  appellant  cannot
      meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Nor can she
      meet the language requirement in the Rules although the judge accepted
      that the level of attainment, albeit in a  test  from  a  non-approved
      provider, "surpassed" the  required  level  of  English  speaking  and
      listening.

  37. I do not accept Mr Haq's submission that the appellant could,  if  she
      applied now, succeed as a "parent" under Appendix FM, in particular R-
      LTRPT.  Mr Haq relied upon the IDI, to which I have already  referred,
      but in doing so he overlooks the requirement  in  E-LTRPT2.3  and  2.4
      which the appellant cannot meet, namely that she does not  have  "sole
      parental responsibility" for either child and  the  children  are  not
      living with a British Citizen who is not the partner of the applicant.
       As is made clear in para 7.1 of the IDI:

         "The parent routes are not for couples with a child who  are  in  a
         genuine subsisting partner relationship  together.   Applicants  in
         this position must apply under the  partner  routes  or  under  the
         private life route (if neither parent is British or settled in  the
         UK).  An applicant can only apply under the parent routes  if  they
         are not eligible to apply under the partner routes."

  38. However, like Judge Coaster, it seems to me that the  appellant  could
      well succeed under the "partner" route,  despite  the  fact  that  she
      cannot meet the financial or English language requirements, by  virtue
      of  meeting  the  requirements  in  R-LTRP.1.1,   in   particular   R-
      LTRP.1.1(d)(i), (ii) and (iii) on the basis  that  para  EX.1  applies
      (and hence there is no requirement to meet the financial  and  English
      language  requirements)  because  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship with British Citizen  children  under
      the age of 18 and it would not be reasonable to expect them  to  leave
      the UK.

  39. In any event, that is a hypothetical question as  no  application  has
      been made.  Even if the applicant would meet the requirements  of  the
      "partner" rule, she has not made that application in this case  and  I
      approach Art 8 on that basis.

  40. Mr Richards did not directly address me upon the factors  set  out  in
      s.117B.

  41. I accept that the public interest in effective immigration control (as
      set out in s.117B(1)) is engaged.

  42. Although the appellant did not have an  English  language  certificate
      from an approved provider, it was not suggested before the judge  (nor
      was it suggested before me) that she was not able to speak English and
      so, consequently, the public interest reflected in the lack of ability
      to speak English set out in s.117B(2) is not engaged.

  43. Given that the appellant could not meet the financial requirements  of
      the partner Rules, I accept that the public interest in an  individual
      being financially independent set out in s.117B(3) is engaged.

  44. Looking at the appellant's family life, this is not a case  where  her
      relationship with her partner was established while she was unlawfully
      in the UK.  She has at all times  been  in  the  UK  with  leave  (see
      s.117B(4)).

  45. I accept, however, that to the extent the appellant  relies  upon  her
      "private life" that has  been  "established"  whilst  her  immigration
      status  was  "precarious"  and  is  entitled  to  little  weight  (see
      s.117B(5)).  That, however, does not form the  central  plank  of  her
      claim under Art 8 which is, in reality, about her family life.

  46. As regards s.117B(6), as I have already indicated, I accept that  that
      provision applies on the basis that the appellant has  a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship with two qualifying children and that
      it would not be reasonable to expect them to leave the UK.

  47. Mr Haq, relying upon the  case  of  Treebhawon,  submitted  that  that
      finding under s.117B(6) was conclusive that the public interest  there
      recognised ("not [to] require the person's  removal")  prevailed  over
      the public interests identified in the remainder of s.117B.  It is not
      clear whether  the  approach  in  Treebhawon  will  survive  the  more
      holistic approach to assessing the  public  interest  (albeit  in  the
      context of a deportation and s.117C) in MM (Uganda) and Another v SSHD
      [2016] EWCA Civ 450.  The point was not addressed in  the  submissions
      made to me in this case.  It is, in any event, unnecessary for  me  to
      reach a concluded view.  Of course, if Treebhawon is followed then the
      appellant succeeds under  Art  8  by  virtue  of  the  application  of
      s.117B(6).  However, even if the factor set out in  s.117B(6)  remains
      only a factor, taking into account all the circumstances  I  have  set
      out above, I would in remaking the decision reach a clear finding that
      the public interest in effective immigration control is outweighed  by
      the "compelling" circumstances of the appellant's  claim  based  upon,
      principally, the impact upon her two British Citizen children and  her
      British Citizen husband if she is removed to the Gambia.

  48. Consequently, had I found an error of law and remade  the  decision  I
      would, in any event, have allowed the appellant's appeal under Art  8.



Decision

  49. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow
      the appellant's appeal under Art 8 did not involve  an  error  of  law
      such as to require the  decision  to  be  set  aside.   That  decision
      stands.

  50. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is
      dismissed.






                                                                      Signed






                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Coaster made no fee award on the basis that  the  matters  leading  to
the appeal being allowed arose subsequently  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
decision.  I see no reason or basis  to  reach  a  different  decision  and,
accordingly, no fee award is made.
