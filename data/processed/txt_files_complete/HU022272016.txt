Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Khan


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the  First-tier  Tribunal,  dated  16  March   2017,   allowing   the
       Respondent's appeal against the  refusal  of  his  application  under
       Appendix FM as the partner of his wife, Athia Begum Chowdhury.

    2. The immigration history supplied by the Secretary of State  was  that
       the Respondent entered the United Kingdom as a student on 13 December
       2009 and his leave was extended until 10 April 2015;  he  applied  to
       switch status to that of a spouse, an application which  was  granted
       in August 2013 until 7 February  2016.  The  Respondent  applied  for
       leave to remain as a partner on 18 January 2016 and  the  application
       was  refused  on  the  same  day;  presumably  this  was  a  same-day
       application made in person.

    3.  The  application  was  refused  because  a  TOIEC  English  language
       qualification on which the Respondent had previously relied  had  now
       been questioned by the issuing body, ETS, on the basis that there was
       significant evidence  to  conclude  that  it  had  been  fraudulently
       obtained, a proxy having been thought to have sat  the  test  in  the
       Respondent's stead. Accordingly the Secretary of State was  satisfied
       that deception had been used in the course of the  application.  This
       justified refusal of the application as the  Respondent  was  thought
       unsuitable for the grant of leave in the  partner  route;  and  there
       were no very significant obstacles to his integration in  Bangladesh.
       There was no further consideration of the application in terms of the
       Respondent's family life.

    4. The impugned test result was dated 27 October 2011. The  Home  Office
       conclusions were based on test results of 27 October  2011  taken  at
       the Luton  test  centre,  and  on  15  November  2011  at  Portsmouth
       International College, and on the same date at  Charles  Edward  test
       centre.

    5. The Respondent appealed, and the First-tier Tribunal gave its reasons
       for allowing the appeal. It noted that the Secretary of  State  could
       discharge the evidential burden on her via the generic evidence  that
       she supplied regarding her treatment of  cases  where  ETS  cancelled
       test results, and that ultimately the legal burden of proof lay  upon
       the Home Office too. The First-tier Tribunal was plainly  not  wholly
       satisfied with the oral evidence of the Respondent, noting  that  his
       evidence was at times  "illogical";  nevertheless  it  accepted  that
       given he was describing events that took place some  six  years  ago,
       and in relation to requirements of the Rules that  had  changed  over
       time, it was unsurprising that he might not recall the precise  order
       of events.

    6. However, the First-tier Tribunal was concerned as to the  cogency  of
       the case put  by  the  Secretary  of  State.  There  was  no  logical
       explanation for the same  person  causing  a  proxy  to  sit  English
       language tests on three separate occasions when the correct score was
       acquired on the first occasion, nor was it apparent why an individual
       would seek to have tests  taken  by  two  different  proxies  in  two
       different parts of the country on the same day. Furthermore,  one  of
       the impugned test results had been on the basis that the results were
       "questionable" rather than invalid.

    7. Accordingly, the First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  Secretary  of
       State had failed to discharge the burden of proof that lay upon  her.
       It then stated that this left the  original  application  outstanding
       before the original decision maker.

    8. Judge Osborne granted permission to appeal on 27  September  2017  on
       the basis that findings should have been  made  on  the  private  and
       family life dimension  of  the  appeal.  A  close  reading  of  Judge
       Osborne's decision indicates that permission to appeal was granted on
       this aspect of the case alone, as the grant appears to paraphrase the
       Secretary of State's  challenge  to  the  ETS  limb  of  the  judge's
       reasoning but to find the decision "careful and  focussed"  vis-ï¿½-vis
       that aspect of the case. Nevertheless, as this came to  my  attention
       only after the  hearing,  I  have  determined  both  aspects  of  the
       Secretary of State's challenge in line  with  my  indication  at  the
       hearing itself.

Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

    9. The Upper Tribunal cites  expert  evidence  deployed  by  a  litigant
       seeking to cast doubt upon the validity testing process used  by  ETS
       in Gazi (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC):

           "Dr Harrison  also  examines,  with  accompanying  critique  and
           commentary,   the   discrete   issues   of   factors   affecting
           performance; the typical performance of human verification;  the
           definition of thresholds; the explicit acknowledgement of  human
           errors; the lack of testing of the performance of analysts;  the
           dubious touchstone of "confidence" (see Mr Millington's  witness
           statement); the dearth of information about the actual  analysis
           methodology;  the  lack  of  detail  about  the  experience  and
           knowledge of both the recruited analysts and their  supervisors;
           the indication that any training of the newly recruited analysts
           was  hurried;  the  shortcomings  in  Mr   Millington's   speech
           recognition averments; and the clear acknowledgement on the part
           of ETS that false identifications (viz false  positive  results)
           have occurred. One passage relating to  the  human  verification
           process is especially noteworthy:

                 "... although the analysts only verified matches where they
                 had no doubt about their validity - i.e.  where  they  were
                 certain about their judgments - this should not be taken as
                 a reliable indicator of the accuracy  of  those  judgments.
                 This approach does not remove the risk  of  false  positive
                 results."

           Dr Harrison also highlights that both the automatic  system  and
           the human analysts are capable of  false  positive  errors.  The
           Secretary of State's  evidence  does  not  disclose  either  the
           percentage or the volume of such errors."

   10. No findings were made on  that  evidence  in  Gazi.  However  in  the
       subsequent appeal of Qadir [2016] UKUT 229  (IAC)  the  UT  concluded
       that the  Home  Office  evidence  had  significant  shortcomings,  in
       particular at [63], a lack of  qualifications  or  expertise  of  the
       officials who visited ETS and produced witness  statements  based  on
       their visit to ETS, during which ETS was  the  sole  arbiter  of  the
       information  disclosed  and  assertions  made,  undue   Home   Office
       dependency on the information from ETS when ETS had  put  forward  no
       witness or indeed any other evidence whatsoever  of  their  own,  the
       lack of any expert evidence backing up the opinion of the  staff  who
       visited ETS, and the fact that voice recording files had  never  been
       put forward pertaining to the appellants themselves. Accordingly  the
       Tribunal accepted that the methods used by ETS were  not  necessarily
       guaranteed to avoid the occasional false positive whereby an innocent
       student is wrongly identified as having cheated in their test.

   11. In MA Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal stated that

           "... we acknowledge the suggestion that  the  Appellant  had  no
           reason to engage in the deception which we  have  found  proven.
           However, this has not deflected us in any way from reaching  our
           main findings and conclusions. In the abstract, of course, there
           is a range of reasons why  persons  proficient  in  English  may
           engage in TOEIC fraud. These include,  inexhaustively,  lack  of
           confidence, fear of failure, lack of  time  and  commitment  and
           contempt  for  the  immigration  system.  These  reasons   could
           conceivably overlap in individual cases and there is  scope  for
           other explanations for deceitful conduct in this sphere. We  are
           not required to make the further finding of  why  the  Appellant
           engaged in deception and to this we add that this issue was  not
           explored  during  the  hearing.  We  resist  any  temptation  to
           speculate about this discrete matter."

   12. The President explains in Muhandiramge [2015] UKUT  675  (IAC),  that
       decisions in these cases involve a "moderately complex  exercise"  in
       which "the evidential  pendulum  swings  three  times  and  in  three
       different directions". To quote further from that decision:

           "(a)  First, where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
           applicant  has  practised  dishonesty   or   deception   in   an
           application for leave to remain, there is an  evidential  burden
           on  the  Secretary  of  State.  This  requires  that  sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue:  for  example,  by  producing  the
           completed application which is prima  facie  deceitful  in  some
           material fashion.

           (b)   The spotlight thereby switches to  the  applicant.  If  he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely  an  account  which  satisfies  the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden
           of proof occurs.

           (c)   Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the  Secretary
           of State to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.

           A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"

   13. The First-tier Tribunal's decision  is  wholly  consistent  with  the
       Muhandiramge approach; it clearly appreciated that both  the  initial
       evidential and  the  ultimate  legal  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
       Secretary of State, and that cogent explanations  from  an  appellant
       before it could rebut Home Office allegations  of  malpractice.   The
       Tribunal below was clearly  concerned  about  the  Respondent's  oral
       evidence, but ultimately  found  his  account  plausible:  there  was
       nothing perverse in an assessment of oral  evidence  that  recognised
       that it may be difficult to recall events several years earlier.  The
       acceptance of his evidence as credible necessarily  implies  that  it
       then fell upon the Secretary of State to discharge the ultimate legal
       burden.

   14. It is here that the Home Office case was found  wanting.  The  First-
       tier Tribunal understandably considered it odd that a person  sitting
       English language tests  would  have  sought  to  procure  three  test
       results when their first  result  was  adequate  to  demonstrate  the
       requisite  English   language   proficiency,   and   added   that   a
       "questionable" result was not the same as an "invalid" result.  There
       was clearly something strange about the results that ETS sent to  the
       Home Office: the Respondent could not reasonably have been thought to
       have been in two places at the same time, and  any  scheme  that  was
       predicated on having two proxies standing in for them on the same day
       would seem likely to bring just the kind of attention to the tests in
       question that any fraudster would try to avoid. So  this  was  not  a
       case where  a  single  result  was  questioned  and  where  the  bare
       provision of the  "look-up"  tool  results  would  be  sufficient  to
       require cogent evidence  from  the  migrant  in  response;  the  very
       results  upon  which  the  Secretary  of  State's  case  was  founded
       themselves called out for some further enquiry  before  being  relied
       upon.

   15. One might think that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  somewhat
       generous. But the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  to  assess
       whether it would have come to the  same  conclusion  itself,  but  to
       determine  whether  the  approach  below  is  within  the  range   of
       reasonable responses to the material before the decision maker.  Lord
       Sumption stated in Hayes v Willoughby [2013] UKSC 17 at [14]:

           "A test of rationality ... applies a minimum objective  standard
           to  the  relevant  person's  mental  processes.  It  imports   a
           requirement of good faith, a requirement that  there  should  be
           some logical connection between the evidence and the  ostensible
           reasons for the decision, and (which will usually amount to  the
           same thing) an absence of arbitrariness, of capriciousness or of
           reasoning so outrageous in  its  defiance  of  logic  as  to  be
           perverse."

   16. It seemed to me that there was a clear logical connection between the
       evidence relied upon by the First-tier Tribunal and its  reasons  for
       its decision. I accordingly  found  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
       grounds of appeal were not made out on the English language issue: as
       noted above, it may well be that I was overly generous  in  assessing
       them at all.

   17. The Secretary of State was on a firmer footing when it  came  to  the
       question of the final disposition  of  the  appeal.  The  appeal  was
       brought on human rights grounds alone. The  Secretary  of  State  had
       refused the Respondent's appeal on human rights grounds.  Accordingly
       it was necessary for the First-tier Tribunal to determine the private
       and family life interests involved in  the  appeal  and  whether  any
       interference with them would be disproportionate. It wholly failed to
       do so. Whilst it is true that the Secretary of State had not  made  a
       decision on the Respondent's application under the five-year route to
       settlement under Appendix FM, that was because she had  thought  that
       step unnecessary.

   18. The question for the First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  or  not  the
       Secretary of State's  decision  was  contrary  to  the  Human  Rights
       Convention. As  the  Respondent  holds  an  immigration  status  that
       permits him to switch into the partner route,  and  the  genuine  and
       subsisting nature of his marriage has not been questioned,  the  only
       remaining material questions were his  English  language  proficiency
       and ability to meet the maintenance  requirements,  at  the  date  of
       application, via the complex provisions of Appendix FM-SE.  If  those
       provisions were to be  satisfied,  it  would  be  very  difficult  to
       imagine that the Respondent's removal could be proportionate  to  his
       private and family life: for the Immigration Rules  set  the  measure
       for that question to be assessed.

   19. As there was only limited fact-finding remaining to be done,  it  was
       appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to retain this  matter  for  final
       resolution itself, rather than to remit it  back  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

Continuation hearing

   20. Further evidence was supplied for the continuation hearing before the
       Upper Tribunal. The parties agreed that it showed  that,  in  the  12
       months leading up to the application, the gross annual income  earned
       was ï¿½21,084.80,  via  work  for  Sainsbury's  and  Gravesham  Muslims
       Cultural  and  Educational  Centre.  A  letter  from  Sainsbury's  of
       December 2015 stated earnings of ï¿½7.36 hourly for 20  hours  a  week,
       since 22 April 2015; and a letter from the Muslims  Centre  confirmed
       employment on a full time permanent  basis  as  an  Islamic  Teacher,
       working 117 hours monthly, earning ï¿½9.406.80.

   21. Appendix FM-SE requires that the relevant sums  are  evidenced  in  a
       particular way: a person whose employment regime has altered  in  the
       last 6 months must show that a year's worth of matching payslips  and
       bank statements, and an employer's letter confirming the  nature  and
       length of employment, and the precise remuneration.

   22. Referring to the lawfulness of a limitation on the forms of  evidence
       provided in support of a family life claim, in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]
       UKSC 10 the Supreme Court ruled ï¿½99:

           "Operation of the same restrictive approach outside the rules is
           a different matter, and in our view is much  more  difficult  to
           justify under the HRA. This  is  not  because  "less  intrusive"
           methods might be devised, but because it  is  inconsistent  with
           the character of evaluation which article  8  requires.  As  has
           been seen, avoiding a financial  burden  on  the  state  can  be
           relevant to the fair balance required by the article.  But  that
           judgment cannot properly be constrained by a  rigid  restriction
           in  the  rules.  Certainly,  nothing  that  is   said   in   the
           instructions to case officers can prevent the tribunal on appeal
           from looking at the matter more broadly. These are  not  matters
           of policy on which special weight has  to  be  accorded  to  the
           judgment of the Secretary of State. There is nothing to  prevent
           the tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal, from judging for
           itself the reliability of any alternative sources of finance  in
           the light of the evidence before it."

   23. Mr Jarvis pragmatically accepted that this material was very close to
       satisfying the strict financial requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.  He
       was reluctant to concede that the rather brief letters from employers
       necessarily satisfied every aspect of that Appendix or that the  bank
       statements necessarily  tallied  with  every  pay  slip.  However  he
       acknowledged that, applying the approach enjoined  by  MM  (Lebanon),
       the core policy  objective  of  ensuring  that  a  reliable  form  of
       enduring income at a sufficient level to support the family unit  was
       satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.

   24. I consider that Mr Jarvis's realistic submission was fully justified.
       The Immigration Rules set the benchmark  for  when  removal  will  be
       disproportionate  to  the  public  interest,  and  where  the  policy
       objectives they set out are plainly met by the evidence  relied  upon
       by an applicant, it will be difficult to  conclude  that  a  person's
       expulsion is proportionate. That is the case here. No  challenge  has
       been made to the genuineness of the  relationship,  English  language
       proficiency is established  by  the  test  results  put  forward  and
       accepted by the First-tier Tribunal as  honestly  obtained,  and  the
       financial requirements have been shown to be met, to all intents  and
       purposes.

   25. The financial requirements are met via reliable long-term  employment
       earning more money than Parliament has  identified  as  the  relevant
       benchmark. Having regard to the factors identified in section 117B of
       the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that require specific
       attention on appeal, the Appellant has not been present in  a  manner
       that is precarious, having been  lawfully  present  and  then  having
       applied to switch into spouse leave consistently with the  scheme  of
       the  Rules.  No  considerations  of  finance  or   English   language
       proficiency count against him.

   26. I accordingly find the immigration decision was  disproportionate  to
       the public interest at which it aimed.

Decision:

The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed. The appeal of Mr Ahmed  stands
allowed.
