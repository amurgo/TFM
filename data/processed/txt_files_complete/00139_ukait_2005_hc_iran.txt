                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This decision is reported for what we say at ��  9-18  on  the  question  of
whether the Home Office are obliged to search NASS records for  the  address
of any absent appellant, as well as on the point in the key-word.

1. This is a case where reconsideration was ordered of  a  decision  of  an
   adjudicator (Mr AG O'Malley), sitting at Stoke-on-Trent on  11  November
   2004, dismissing an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of Iran.
   The senior immigration judge (HH Judge Huskinson) who made the order did
   so "... because it is reasonably arguable that the  appellant  may  have
   sustained a procedural injustice by reason of the case being decided  at
   a hearing at which he was not present - the reason for his absence being
   that he was not aware  of  the  hearing  on  11  November  2004."  Judge
   Huskinson must have taken the view -- that  the  adjudicator  might,  as
   required by � 103A (2) of the 2002 Act, inserted by the 2004  Act,  have
   made an error of  law  which  resulted  in  that  procedural  injustice.
   However he does not say so in terms, still less specify what  the  error
   was.

2. The basis on which the adjudicator decided to proceed in the appellant's
   absence appears at ��  6-7  of  his  decision.  The  appellant's  former
   solicitors (Gwilym Hughes & Ptnrs, Wrexham) had written  on  1  November
   withdrawing from representing him because of "funding difficulties"; but
   notice of hearing had been sent the appellant on 1 September at his last
   known address, and there was no explanation for his absence, so r.  44.1
   of the 2003 Procedure Rules meant that the  adjudicator  must  hear  the
   appeal there and then. This was all correct, so far as it went; but,  as
   Mr Toal pointed out, the notice of hearing of 1 September  was  not  the
   one which fixed the hearing on 11 November.

3. The notice of 1 September was, as usual, a  combined  "Notice  of  First
   Hearing and Notice of Full Hearing". The first hearing, on 21 September,
   was  adjourned  because  the  solicitors  had  sent  in  the  reply   to
   directions, saying that they were still waiting  for  funding.  However,
   they also obtained an adjournment of  the  full  hearing  as  originally
   fixed for 19 October. This resulted in a fresh notice of  hearing  being
   sent out on 7 October for 11 November. That notice is addressed  to  the
   solicitors; but there is a note at the bottom showing that it  was  also
   sent to the appellant at the post-code for his address then known to the
   IAA, which appears in full on a covering letter  addressed  to  him,  of
   which there is a copy on the file. That was 5  Chapel  St,  Wrexham,  as
   shown on  his  notice  of  appeal  to  the  adjudicator,  filed  by  the
   solicitors.

4. The events which the appellant says caused that notice not to reach  him
   are set out in his notice  of  appeal,  not  legally  drafted  but  very
   clearly set out in English typescript, we were told  by  the  lady  with
   whom he lives. He says he had been moved, by the National Asylum Support
   Service [NASS], to another address, apparently 9 Victoria  Rd,  Wrexham,
   at some time before 29 September. On that day he had a meeting with  his
   solicitors, with the help of a Persian  interpreter,  Mr  Mohsen  Papen.
   According to the appellant, he mentioned his move to Mr  Papen;  but  Mr
   Papen and the solicitors each blame the other for either failing to pass
   it on, or to record it. The notice of appeal, quite understandably, does
   not identify any error of law on the part of the appellate  authorities,
   but simply complains of the appellant not having been able  to  put  his
   case to them, and refers briefly to the history on which he relied.

5. The leading authority at present on points of this kind is Makke  [2005]
   EWCA Civ 176, where the judgment of the Court of  Appeal  was  given  by
   Pill LJ: we handed down copies at the start of our hearing. Because  the
   adjudicator's decision in that case was given  before  the  coming  into
   effect of the relevant provisions of the 2002 Act, it was not  necessary
   for the appellant to show a  material  error  of  law.  The  appellant's
   appeal was dismissed in his absence by  an  adjudicator:  permission  to
   appeal was refused, as it happens by the writer of this decision, on the
   basis that there was no arguable challenge to the adjudicator's decision
   on the merits. That was quashed on judicial  review  by  Wilson  J,  who
   found (as indeed was not in dispute) that the  appellant  had  been  let
   down by his solicitors; but the Court of Appeal allowed  a  Home  Office
   appeal against that decision. They did so (see � 24)on the  basis  that,
   at least where an extension of time was required (as indeed  it  was  in
   the present case too)

   It is not sufficient to rely on a procedural point, an applicant in  the
   [appellant]'s position must condescend to the merits of his challenge to
   the adjudicator's decision.

6. While there is, as we have said, a brief  reference  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal to the merits of the appellant's own case,  there  is  nothing  to
   show any arguable error  of  law  on  the  merits  of  the  adjudicator's
   decision; nor did Mr Toal seek to argue any such point. In fact the  only
   point he made on the adjudicator's decision (rather  than  the  procedure
   which had led to it) was his having given the wrong date for  the  notice
   of hearing. Mr Toal frankly recognized that this was a  highly  technical
   point; but he urged us to take it in the appellant's  favour  to  prevent
   what he put forward as the obvious  injustice  of  not  having  his  case
   heard.

7. If the 2005 Procedure Rules are valid - and we shall come  to  Mr  Toal's
   challenge to them in due course, then by r. 31.2

   Where the reconsideration is pursuant to an order under section 103A -
      a) the Tribunal carrying out the  reconsideration  must  first  decide
         whether the original Tribunal made a material error of law; and
      b) if it decides that the original Tribunal did not  make  a  material
         error  of  law,  the  Tribunal  must  order   that   the   original
         determination of the appeal shall stand.

   If we are right in thinking that Makke is to be taken as applying to the
   new (2004 Act) procedure, in the light of the change in the  legislation
   since the events with which it dealt (first effected in the 2002 Act, as
   originally enacted) requiring an error of law at first instance to found
   any further appeal (or now reconsideration), then it  follows  that  the
   grounds must show some error of that kind affecting the  merits  of  the
   decision. In this case they did not, so the appeal would fail in limine.

8. However, even if we are wrong about the effect of  Makke,  the  appellant
   needs to show a material error of law by the adjudicator  when  he  comes
   before us. The only error by the adjudicator put forward by Mr  Toal,  as
   we have seen, is the one  about  the  date  of  the  relevant  notice  of
   hearing. In our view, while a mistake about the existence or otherwise of
   an effective notice of hearing might be significant enough to  amount  to
   an error of law within E & R [2003] EWCA Civ 49, the  date  shown  on  it
   cannot do so. Alternatively, if it is an  error  of  law,  it  is  not  a
   material one, because if the adjudicator had referred to  the  7  October
   notice, that was validly served on the solicitors then still  acting  for
   the appellant, as well as being sent to him at his last address known  to
   the appellate authorities. That means  he  had  no  alternative,  on  the
   information before him, but to hear  the  appeal:  see  the  then  (2003)
   Procedure Rules r. 44.1

   An adjudicator must hear an appeal in the  absence  of  a  party  or  his
   representative, if satisfied that the party or his representative -
      a) has been given notice of the date, time and place of  the  hearing;
         and
      b) has given no satisfactory explanation for his absence.

9. This takes us to Mr Toal's next point: this, like the one about the  2005
   Procedure Rules was objected to by  Mr  Ouseley  as  not  raised  in  the
   grounds of appeal or by any other form  of  notice;  but  we  thought  it
   better to hear Mr Toal de bene esse, and deal with the  objection  if  it
   became material. Mr Toal's case is that there was an explanation there to
   be given - that the appellant had been moved by NASS, so did not get  his
   copy of the notice of hearing. Of course neither the  presenting  officer
   before the adjudicator, nor the Presenting Officers' Unit as a body  knew
   anything  about  that  at  all;  but  Mr  Toal  argued  that  they   were
   nevertheless obliged to tell the  adjudicator  what  NASS,  another  Home
   Office body, knew about the appellant's whereabouts. While he  could  not
   refer us to any authority requiring disclosure  of  information  of  that
   kind, Mr Toal relied on Cindo [2002] EWHC 246 (Admin). There Maurice  Kay
   J granted  judicial  review  of  refusal  of  leave  to  appeal  from  an
   adjudicator, who had been allowed to rely on ?enk�y  (16594)  as  "recent
   and authoritative", without being  told  that,  some  months  before  the
   hearing in Cindo, ?enk�y had been granted leave  to  apply  for  judicial
   review of the decision in his case.

10. Maurice Kay J set out the principles involved at � 11:

   1. there is a duty on the part of the Secretary of State not knowingly to
      mislead in the material he places before the [appellate authorities];
   2. "knowingly" embraces that which he ought to have known;
   3. a breach of that duty may found judicial  review  on  the  basis  that
      either
        a. the decision was reached on a "wrong factual basis"; or
        b. the proceedings were tainted with unfairness.

   Judicial review was granted on that ground on the basis (see � 14)  that
   "... there was potentially significant material [filed in ?enk�y]  which
   officials knew or ought to have  known  materially  detracted  from  the
   material which was still being advanced as  "recent  and  authoritative"
   even though (� 15) the judge declared himself "... anxious not to impose
   an unfair burden on the Secretary of State or to express myself in a way
   which might be thought to expose his officials to undue expectations  in
   future cases."

11. Mr Toal argued in effect that, because NASS  knew  where  the  appellant
   was to be found, the Secretary of State, and so the  presenting  officer
   before the adjudicator ought to have known it too; so they  were  guilty
   of "knowingly misleading" him  by  the  presenting  officer  failing  to
   mention something of which it is recognized he must have been completely
   unaware. This point has of course to be dealt with in the context of the
   events and arguments in the present case. Mr Toal  expressly  disclaimed
   any reliance on the misdeeds of the previous solicitors as founding  any
   material error of law on the part of the adjudicator, though  he  wished
   us to know about them as part  of  the  background  evidence.  This  was
   despite the mention in ?enk�y (� 8) of Khan [1987] Imm AR 543, where the
   appeal failed on other grounds, but Bingham LJ said

   If  a  procedural  mishap  occurs  as  a  result  of   misunderstanding,
   confusion, failure of communication, or even perhaps  inefficiency,  and
   the result is to deny justice to an applicant, I would be very sorry  to
   hold that the remedy of judicial review was not available.

12. Probably Judge Huskinson was thinking of dicta  of  this  kind  when  he
   gave permission to appeal in the terms he did in this case.  However  Mr
   Toal  was  faced  with  AG  [2005]  UKIAT   00014,  a  decision  of  the
   Immigration Appeal Tribunal written by Ouseley P, in  which  Mr  Ouseley
   referred us to � 17, where failure to put  allegations  of  professional
   negligence to previous advisers "... without clear and sound reasons for
   not doing so, is likely to lead to adverse inferences being drawn as  to
   the true reason for the failure of such evidence to  be  produced."  The
   only explanation we had from Mr Toal was that  he  had  been  instructed
   very late, as the present solicitors had had funding problems too.

13. While this is clear enough, we do not consider it sound.  We  are  being
   asked to proceed against a background of no more than  an  assertion  by
   the appellant,  who  dealt  with  the  previous  solicitors  through  an
   interpreter, that that gentleman never passed on his instructions  about
   his change of address, not only so that the solicitors could  pass  them
   in turn to the IAA, but so  that  they  could  get  in  touch  with  him
   themselves. This presumably is why it is suggested  that  not  even  the
   copy of the final notice of hearing  sent  to  the  previous  solicitors
   resulted in his being aware of it.

14. The appellant, to do him justice, made his version of  events  clear  in
   his grounds of appeal, filed 1 March 2005. His present solicitors  faxed
   the Tribunal with notice that they were acting,  and  a  copy  of  those
   grounds attached, on 29 June; yet it is said  that  there  was  no  real
   possibility of giving the previous solicitors notice of the  allegations
   against them till the hearing before us on 4 October. We do not consider
   this sound practice, even on a point said to be relied on as a matter of
   background only.

15. Now we must look at the situation as it was before  the  adjudicator  on
   11 November 2004 from the presenting officer's point of view, in  trying
   to decide whether  he  can  be  said  to  have  "knowingly  misled"  the
   adjudicator, even in  the  somewhat  recondite  sense  applied  to  that
   expression in Cindo. The appellant had been represented by his  previous
   solicitors since at least 16 August, when they wrote in with grounds  of
   appeal to the adjudicator, until 1 November, when  they  withdrew.  That
   period included 7 October, when the final notice  of  hearing  was  sent
   both to them and to the appellant himself. Unless there  had  been  some
   serious professional negligence in the solicitors' office, there was  no
   reason to suppose that one or both  of  those  notices  would  not  have
   resulted in the appellant's becoming aware of the  hearing:  neither  of
   them had been returned undelivered.

16. If it is to be said that the failure of the presenting officer  to  make
   further inquiries of NASS, when the appellant quite unexpectedly did not
   appear and was not represented on the day of the  hearing,  resulted  in
   his having "knowingly misled" the adjudicator,  then  to  avoid  such  a
   conclusion against them, presenting officers would  have  to  make  such
   inquiries in each and every case where the appellant did not appear.  In
   our view this would undoubtedly amount to the unfair  burden  and  undue
   expectations which Maurice Kay J sought to avoid in Cindo.  We  are  not
   bound by the decision of a single judge at first instance, and it  might
   have been going quite a long way to make a finding that the  adjudicator
   had been "knowingly misled"  on  the  basis  of  information  not  being
   disclosed which had come from a judicial review  application  which  had
   got no further than leave being given. On the other hand, we can see the
   logic of the judge's approach, when applied to  a  failure  to  disclose
   information which affected the strength of  a  case  (?enk�y)  the  Home
   Office were themselves putting forward to the adjudicator.

17. That is not the position in this case: the address to which  the  notice
   of hearing had been sent had come from the appellant's solicitors in the
   first place, and there was nothing in the circumstances by the  date  of
   the hearing to suggest either  to  the  presenting  officer  or  to  the
   adjudicator that it was no longer right; or  that  for  any  reason  the
   appellant would not know about the date. Whatever may  be  the  position
   where a notice of hearing is returned undelivered, or anything is  known
   against solicitors involved in  the  case;  or,  of  course,  where  the
   appellant is detained by the Home Office or any agency under them, so is
   no longer a free agent, or  where  an  adjudicator  expressly  asks  for
   inquiries to be made, or when the Presenting  Officers'  Unit  have  any
   actual knowledge of a change of address, we do not think the  presenting
   officer before an adjudicator (now an immigration judge) can or ought to
   be under any obligation to make inquiries, which may  be  time-consuming
   in a process intended by Parliament to be rapid, as to  the  whereabouts
   of an appellant. That  must  especially  be  so  where,  as  here,  that
   appellant was represented by solicitors at the time  notice  of  hearing
   was sent out.

18. The result is that, even if the criteria for whether, in terms of r.  31
   (see 7) the original Tribunal made a material error of law are the  same
   as those for granting judicial review (which we are not  deciding),  and
   even if the appellant is entitled to rely on an error of law  which  did
   not go to the merits of the decision (which we do not think he was:  see
   7 again), we do not consider that the presenting officer not making  any
   inquiries of NASS when the appellant failed to appear  resulted  in  the
   adjudicator's decision being quashable. It follows that, unless Mr  Toal
   could persuade us that the 2005 Procedure Rules are ultra vires, so that
   our approach to reconsideration must be entirely different from what had
   been supposed by everyone since the Rules came into force on 4 April, it
   must be upheld.

19. Mr Toal's argument on the validity of r.  31.2  of  the  2005  Procedure
   Rules was that it is contrary to the principal legislation  under  which
   they are made, the 2004 Act. That provides at � 103A

      1) for a party to apply for reconsideration "on the grounds  that  the
         Tribunal made an error of law"; but
      2) The ...court may make an order ...
          a. only if it thinks that the Tribunal may  [our  emphasis]  have
             made an error of law ...

   What follows such an order is provided for, as we have seen (at 7) by r.
   31.2; but Mr Toal argued that this was not the intention  of  Parliament
   in enacting � 103A at all. His argument is in effect that  the  possible
   error of law in � 103A (2) was to be the sole foundation for a  complete
   reconsideration  in  terms  of  ��  84-86  of  the  2002  Act,  applying
   originally to first instance appeals before an adjudicator, and left  in
   force by its successor in relation to those before an immigration judge.

20. We cannot think this is right. There is a gap in the  scheme  under  the
   2002 Act, as amended in 2004, on what is to happen  on  reconsideration,
   once ordered; but the rule-making power at � 106, in its  current  form,
   expressly provides at � 106.1 (v) that rules

   may make provision about reconsideration of a decision  pursuant  to  an
   order  under  section  103A  (1)  (which  may,  in  particular,  include
   provision about the action that may  be  taken  on  reconsideration  and
   about the matters and evidence to which the Tribunal may have regard).

   We cannot imagine any clearer statutory power  than  that  to  make  the
   provisions set out in r. 31.2. While in the absence  of  any  ambiguity,
   there would have been no discretion to refer to Hansard, Mr Toal made it
   clear, when we asked him, that he had no  such  material  to  show  that
   Parliament meant  otherwise.  It  would  certainly  have  represented  a
   complete departure from the approach set out in CA [2004] EWCA Civ 1165.
   While Mr Toal did not shrink from  that  suggestion,  and  it  would  of
   course have been open to Parliament in enacting  a  new  (if  piecemeal)
   statutory scheme, there is nothing whatever to show that was intended.

21.  The  result  is  that,  seeing  no  material  error  of  law   in   the
   adjudicator's decision, we uphold it.  There  are  however  a  few  more
   things to be said. First, Mr Toal invited  us,  in  connexion  with  the
   point at 6 and 8 (on which we did not need to hear Mr Ouseley)  to  take
   it in his favour despite its obvious inadequacies, on the basis that  it
   represented the only way of ensuring justice for this  appellant.  There
   are two answers to that: first, the judicial oath (not that we have  had
   to take it in our present capacities) requires doing  justice  according
   to law. We do not regard the  end  as  separable  from  the  means,  and
   decline to bend our view of the law to what  are  urged  on  us  as  the
   requirements of an individual case.

22. The other thing worth saying on this subject is that our  decision  need
   not mean an end to consideration of the appellant's case on its  merits.
   Mr Ouseley undertook, in view of the new factual material  produced,  to
   endorse his file with his view that it deserved consideration afresh  by
   the Home Office. Mr Toal's objection to that was that a renewed  refusal
   would not result in any right of appeal. However we have  no  reason  to
   suppose that this would tempt the Home Office to make any decision  they
   did not see as right on the merits of the case.

23. Last we  come  to  Mr  Ouseley's  objections  to  the  last  two  points
   ("knowingly misled" and ultra vires) being taken without notice. So  far
   as the first of them goes, it does relate to the  individual  case,  the
   appellant's circumstances, and  the  Home  Office's  knowledge  of  them
   through NASS. While there was nothing about it in  the  the  appellant's
   grounds of appeal, or from his  present  representatives  till  Mr  Toal
   handed up his "skeleton argument" on the afternoon of the hearing, there
   was a letter from the appellant to the IAA dated 15 February 2005, shown
   as copied to "Home Office, IND", which explained that he had been  moved
   on 17 September by NASS. On that basis, we should, if  we  thought  this
   point capable of succeeding  in  principle,  have  allowed  (so  far  as
   necessary) an amendment of the grounds of appeal to raise it (not  being
   limited by r. 62.7 of the 2005  Procedure  Rules  on  a  reconsideration
   ordered after 4 April), and offered Mr Ouseley an  adjournment  to  deal
   with it, if he wished.

24. So far as the ultra vires point is concerned,  it  is  a  point  of  law
   quite unrelated to the individual case,  but  to  our  general  mode  of
   proceeding. On that basis, we do not think it needed to be raised in the
   grounds of appeal, though good  professional  practice  would  certainly
   have suggested that notice of it should be given  a  good  deal  earlier
   than the afternoon of the hearing. On the other hand, if it had appeared
   capable of succeeding, it would have set at odds the entire business  of
   this part of the Tribunal, as conducted since 4 April. If we had thought
   there were anything  in  this  point,  then  we  should  not  only  have
   adjourned for Mr Ouseley to consider it, but adjourned the hearing to  a
   Presidential panel, in view of the importance of the question.
