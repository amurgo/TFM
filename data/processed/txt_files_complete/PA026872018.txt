	DECISION AND REASONS

This is the appellant’s appeal against the decision of Judge Lawrence made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 27th March 2018.  

Judge Lawrence dismissed the appellant’s appeal against the respondent’s decision to refuse him asylum in the UK.

The appellant sought permission to appeal,  was granted by Judge Saffer on 1st May 2018.  

On 20th June 2018 the respondent wrote to the Tribunal stating that he does not oppose the appellant’s application for permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to determine the appeal with a fresh hearing to consider whether the appellant is, as he claims, an undocumented Bidoon.

Accordingly the decision of Judge Lawrence is set aside.  It will be reheard by a judge other than Judge Lawrence at Hatton Cross at a date to be notified.  An Arabic interpreter (Middle Eastern) will be required.



No anonymity direction is made.
