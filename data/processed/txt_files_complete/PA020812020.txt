Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to  /  not  objected
to by the parties.  The form of remote hearing was  V  (video).  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred to were  primarily  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal, the grounds of appeal, and the bundles relied  upon  by
the parties before the First-tier Tribunal, the contents  of  which  I  have
recorded.
The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said  this  about  the  process:  they  were  content  that  the
proceedings had been conducted fairly in their remote form.

 1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fisher promulgated on 11 August  2020  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant, a Kurdish citizen of Iraq born in 2002, against  a  decision
    of the respondent dated 18 February 2020 to refuse his claim for asylum
    made on 23 September 2019.

Factual background

 2. The appellant arrived in this country as an  unaccompanied  minor.   He
    claimed asylum on the basis that he would be the victim of a blood feud
    in Iraq and that he feared ISIS. He also contended that upon his return
    he would without the  documents  that  are  essential  to  avoid  being
    subject to treatment that  would  be  contrary  to  Article  3  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights ("the ECHR").  The  judge  rejected
    the appellant's claim to be at risk on account of the  blood  feud  and
    from ISIS, and there has been no challenge to those findings.

 3. At [23] of his decision, the judge  addressed  the  appellant's  likely
    circumstances in Iraq  upon  his  return.  The  judge  reached  various
    findings of fact relating to the appellant's ongoing contact  with  his
    family.  He rejected the appellant's claim to  have  travelled  with  a
    mobile phone but without a SIM card, on the basis that it would not  be
    possible to use such a device without one. He found that the  appellant
    held a telephone number for his uncle in Iraq, who had paid $15,000  to
    an agent to facilitate his journey to the United  Kingdom.  As  to  the
    appellant's ability to obtain the documentation that  is  necessary  to
    engage with life in Iraq and make  the  journey  from  Baghdad  to  the
    Kurdish region following an enforced return, the judge  said  this,  at
    [23]:

         "The [Upper Tribunal in SMO, KSP  &  IM  (Article  15(c);  identity
         documents)  Iraq  CG   [2019]   UKUT   400   (IAC)]   found   that,
         notwithstanding the phased transition  to  the  INID  within  Iraq,
         replacement  CSIDs  remain   available   through   Iraqi   consular
         facilities. It concluded that there would only be a small number of
         cases in which an individual could plausibly claim to have no means
         of contacting family members from whom the relevant volume and page
         number [of the Family Book; an Iraqi register of persons  essential
         for acquiring identity documents]  could  be  obtained  and  traced
         back. The appellant was not particularly young  when  he  left  the
         country. Relevant details  would  have  been  shown  on  his  birth
         certificate or the passport which had recently  been  acquired  for
         him. If he is not already in  possession  of  the  documents  which
         would enable him to return to the [Kurdish region], I am  satisfied
         that he could obtain them from his family or they could provide him
         with the details which would enable him to obtain replacements from
         the Iraqi consulate in the UK." (Emphasis added)

    An "INID" as referred to by the judge means an "Iraqi National Identity
    Card" which, as described by this tribunal in SMO, is a document  which
    replaces a CSID.  I refer to the judge's  finding  that  the  appellant
    could obtain a CSID from within the UK as "the impugned CSID findings".

 4. The judge dismissed the appeal on asylum, humanitarian  protection  and
    human rights grounds.

Permission to appeal

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  McWilliam  on
    the basis it was arguable that the judge erred by not having regard  to
    the respondent's country policy and  information  note  Iraq:  Internal
    relocation, civil documentation and returns, version  11.0,  June  2020
    ("the CPIN"), which  appears  at  paragraph  2.6.16  to  suggest  that,
    contrary to the judge's conclusion, the Secretary of State now  accepts
    that it is not possible to  obtain  CSID  documents  from  within  this
    country.

Submissions

 6. In her oral submissions and in her undated skeleton argument, Ms Brakaj
    relies upon SMO (Iraq) to demonstrate  that  the  appellant's  enforced
    return would be to Baghdad, thereby necessitating  a  lengthy  internal
    journey by road.  It is common ground that under  the  current  country
    guidance if the journey is made without a CSID or INID, the  individual
    concerned faces a real risk of substantial harm contrary to  Article  3
    of the ECHR.  Thus the judge's finding that the appellant would be able
    to obtain a CSID from within this country was  pivotal  to  the  appeal
    being dismissed, submits Ms Brakaj.  Against that background, Ms Brakaj
    submits that it was an error for the judge not to consider the  passage
    of the CPIN set out below, even though it had not been relied  upon  by
    her firm, Iris Law Firm, at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.
     The CPIN was before the judge, as part of a  bundle  of  approximately
    1,000 pages,  but  his  attention  was  not  drawn  to  the  paragraphs
    concerning this issue.

 7. Paragraphs 2.6.15 and 2.6.16 of the CPIN address post-SMO  developments
    of which the Secretary  of  State  is  aware  concerning  the  apparent
    reduced ability to obtain  a  CSID  from  within  the  United  Kingdom.
    Referring to information provided by the 'Returns Logistics Department'
    within the Home Office located at Annex I to the CPIN, those paragraphs
    read as follows, with emphasis added:

         "2.6.15  Since  SMO  was  promulgated  in  December  2019   further
         information regarding the issuance of CSIDs  in  the  UK  has  been
         obtained by the Home Office in April 2020 [see Annex I]. When asked
         to describe the process of obtaining a CSID from the Iraqi  Embassy
         in London the Returns Logistics department stated:

             'CSID cards are being phased out and replaced  by  INID  (Iraq
             National Identification) cards. It is not  currently  possible
             to apply for an INID card outside of Iraq. As  a  result,  the
             Iraqi embassy in London are advising their nationals in the UK
             to apply instead for a  'Registration  Document  (1957)  which
             they can use to apply for other documents such as passports or
             an INID card once they have returned to Iraq.

             'The registration document (1957) must be applied for  on  the
             applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in  Iraq.  In
             order to  start  the  application,  the  individual  requiring
             documentation would normally provide at least one  copy  of  a
             national identity document... and complete a power of attorney
             (to nominate a representative in Iraq) at  the  Iraqi  embassy
             along with the embassy issued application forms. If they  have
             no copies of  identity  documents  they  also  would  need  to
             complete a British power of attorney validated by the [Foreign
             and Commonwealth Office] and provide parents names, place  and
             date of birth to their nominated representative in Iraq.

             'Once  issued  the  nominated  representative  will  send  the
             registration document (1957) to the applicant in the  UK.  The
             process takes 1-2 months.

             'The [Home Office] cannot apply for documentation  other  than
             Laissez Passers on someone's behalf but the embassy is willing
             to check to see if the individual already holds documents  and
             provide copies if necessary.'

         2.6.16 Based on the above information, it is highly  unlikely  that
         an individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy
         while in the UK. Instead  a  person  would  need  to  apply  for  a
         registration document (1957) and would then apply for an INID  upon
         return to their local CSA office in Iraq."

 8. The judge's conclusion that the appellant  could  obtain  a  CSID  from
    within the UK is at odds with  the  respondent's  accepted  and  public
    position that obtaining a CSID is not  possible  from  within  the  UK,
    submits Ms Brakaj.

 9. Although not part of the  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal,  Ms  Brakaj
    additionally criticises the judge's findings that  the  appellant  must
    have had a SIM card in his smartphone, for without one,  he  would  not
    have been able to  access  the  internet.   That  finding,  submits  Ms
    Brakaj, was instrumental in the judge's  broader  reasoning  concerning
    the appellant's ability to contact  his  family  in  Iraq.   Ms  Brakaj
    applied under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 to admit evidence demonstrating that smartphones can be used
    to access the internet through a wifi connection, and do not need a SIM
    card to do so.

10. In a  rule  24  notice,  and  in  submissions  advanced  orally  by  Ms
    Isherwood, the respondent submits that was for the appellant to rely on
    the passages of the CPIN in question.  It is not for the  Secretary  of
    State to make an appellant's case for him.  In any event,  the  judge's
    findings concerning the appellant's  ability  to  obtain  a  CSID  from
    within the UK were alternative to his primary findings, also  at  [23],
    that the appellant remains in contact with  his  family.  The  evidence
    concerning the SIM card was not before the judge, and he  was  entitled
    to reach the conclusions set out at [23] for the reasons he gave. I was
    invited to dismiss the appeal.

Discussion

11. I accept that the impugned CSID findings were not open to the judge, in
    light of the June 2020 CPIN.  The parties failed to draw the  Secretary
    of State's new policy concerning her view of the likelihood of an Iraqi
    obtaining a CSID from within this country to the judge, and  the  judge
    did not identify it for himself from the  materials  that  were  before
    him.  It was primarily for the Secretary  of  State  to  highlight  the
    policy  encapsulated  in  passage  to  the  judge,   pursuant   to   BH
    (policies/information:  SoS's  duties)  Iraq  [2020]  UKUT  189  (IAC),
    headnote (a).  By not doing so and by arguing that the appellant  could
    obtain a CSID from within the UK, the Secretary  of  State  adopted  an
    approach that was inconsistent with her own published policy.

12. It is necessary to determine whether, had the judge been alerted to the
    relevant paragraph, it would have changed the operative findings of the
    tribunal.  In other words, I must address  whether  the  impugned  CSID
    findings infected and thereby undermined the judge's overall decision.

13. Ms Isherwood highlights how the CSID findings judge were  ancillary  to
    his primary finding that the appellant  remains  in  contact  with  his
    family in Iraq, who have the documents, and could  send  them  to  him.
    There is support for that submission in the materials that were  before
    the judge, for example the appellant's asylum interview,  at  questions
    26 to 28:

         "26. What ID documents did you have in Iraq?

         Civil status ID card and National Certificate.

         27.  Where are these documents now?

         I left the [sic] in Kurdistan, at home.

         28.  So there [sic] are with your maternal uncle?

         Yes."

14. Although the appellant maintained in his written evidence  and  at  the
    hearing that he was no longer in contact with  his  family,  the  judge
    found that the appellant does remain in contact  with  them,  that  the
    CSID remains with his family in Iraq, and that they could  send  it  to
    him here if need be.  While  the  judge  was  not  entitled  reach  the
    impugned CSID findings, those findings were secondary  to  his  primary
    findings that the appellant remains in contact with his family, that he
    left his CSID with them, and that they will be able to return it to him
    here, for him to use upon his return.  The judge was  "satisfied"  that
    the appellant could obtain the documents from his family.  The impugned
    CSID findings were non-operative, fallback findings.

15. Ms Brakaj seeks to challenge the judge's  finding  that  the  appellant
    remains in contact with his family, on the basis that it was  not  open
    to him to the judge to find that  his  smartphone  would  have  no  use
    without a SIM card.  Although this was not a ground of appeal,  I  will
    address that submission for completeness.

16. Smartphones work without SIM cards,  Ms  Brakaj  submits,  and  it  was
    irrational for the judge  to  conclude  otherwise.   She  relies  on  a
    website printout demonstrating that smartphones may  be  used  in  that
    way, and seeks permission to rely  on  it  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I do not need to admit
    the new evidence as I accept that smartphone can  access  the  internet
    without a SIM card, via wifi.  The question then arises as  to  whether
    it was irrational for the judge to find the appellant to be in  contact
    with his family, given his approach to the SIM card issue.

17. The jurisdiction of this appellate tribunal to interfere with  findings
    of fact reached by trial judges is limited.  Appeals lie on  the  basis
    of errors of law, not disagreements of fact.   The  constraints  on  an
    appellate tribunal interfering with findings of fact reached  by  trial
    judges are summarised in a series of now  well-known  cases;  see,  for
    example, the oft-quoted summary in Fage UK Ltd v Chobani UK Ltd  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 5 at [114], per Kitchin LJ, as  he  then  was.    In  Perry  v
    Raleys Solicitors [2019] UKSC 5, the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  the
    principles  concerning  the  jurisdiction  of  appellate   courts   and
    tribunals to interfere with findings of fact reached by courts below:

         "may be summarised as requiring a conclusion either that there  was
         no evidence to support a challenged finding of fact,  or  that  the
         trial judge's finding was one that no reasonable judge  could  have
         reached." (Emphasis added)

18. Wifi is, of course, not available everywhere.  The appellant's case was
    that he travelled under the control of  an  agent  or  a  guide,  which
    included time walking and sleeping in forests and on  the  street  (see
    the summary of the appellant's evidence at [9] and [11] of the  judge's
    decision).  In such locations, not having a SIM card would be a barrier
    to using a smartphone.  The appellant's case was that his  journey  was
    managed by an agent at all  times,  which  would  have  restricted  his
    ability to access wifi points.  The appellant's evidence was  not  that
    he had regular access  to,  say,  internet  caf�s  or  wireless  access
    points.

19. The judge also found at [23] that there would be little point in having
    a mobile telephone without a SIM card, and that  it  was  not  credible
    that the appellant would not have  asked  the  agent  for  his  uncle's
    telephone number, which is what the appellant's evidence had been.  The
    judge's findings included a rejection of the appellant's evidence  that
    he would have been sent on such a long and  expensive  journey  by  his
    uncle without being provided with his uncle's mobile  telephone  number
    or other means of contact, and his inconsistent  answers  under  cross-
    examination concerning why he did not ask the  agent  for  his  uncle's
    telephone number if, as he had claimed, it was only the agent  who  had
    those details.  Those were findings that were open to the judge, on the
    evidence, and the appellant's disagreement with them amounts simply  to
    an objection concerning weight.

20. In my judgment, it cannot be said that the judge reached  a  conclusion
    no reasonable judge could have  reached  concerning  this  issue.   The
    judge's findings must be viewed in the context  of  the  whole  sea  of
    evidence of which he had the benefit of surveying (in contrast to  this
    tribunal's ability merely to 'island hop': see Fage UK Ltd v Chobani at
    [114.iv]).

21. I find that the judge reached operative findings that were open to  him
    on the evidence, which were not tainted by the respondent's failure  to
    highlight her then-new policy concerning the ability to  obtain  a  new
    CSID from within this country.

22. The appellant's CSID remains in Iraq, and may be sent to  him  here  to
    ensure he will not be subject to Article 3 mistreatment when making the
    journey from Bagdad to the Kurdish region.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Fisher did not involve the making of an error  of  law
such that it must be set aside.

This appeal is dismissed.

I maintain the anonymity order already in force.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
