                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:    Mr N Bramble (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:  Ms N Wilkins (counsel instructed under the public
access scheme)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  appeal  Yvonne  Agentina  Wanjuzi,  a
   citizen of Uganda born 6 December 1982, against the immigration decision
   of 16 January 2015 made by the Secretary of  State  having  refused  her
   asylum claim


2. She entered the country as a visitor  on  28  September  2012,  claiming
   asylum on 20 August 2013. Her asylum claim had two elements. Firstly she
   had been an activist with Action  for  Change,  for  whom  she  attended
   demonstrations, handed out leaflets, visited villages and towns speaking
   with locals informing them about their rights. On 18 June 2012  she  was
   arrested and detained following a demonstration at  which  Besigye,  the
   former leader of Forum of Democratic Change regarding the  campaign  for
   freedom  for  work.  On  22  August  2012  she  protested  against   the
   Homosexuality and Transgender Bill, when the demonstration was broken up
   by tear gas; she was rounded up by the police, handcuffed and taken to a
   large room in Kitante, where she was detained for three days, the second
   day of which she was interrogated.  Her parents and siblings remained in
   Mbale, Uganda.


3. The Secretary of State rejected her asylum claim, because she  was  only
   thought to know limited information about  the  organisation  which  was
   actually called Activists for Change and was vague as to its  objectives
   and activities, and its blog did not mention using leaflets as a form of
   communication; her release from  detention  was  inconsistent  with  the
   country evidence that the police treated the organisation as an  illegal
   one; and her claim about her involvement  in  the  August  2012  protect
   contained discrepancies. In any event, she would be able to find work on
   a return to Uganda where she had previously worked as a civil servant.


4. She had had a child, [R], born [ ] 2013, with a  British  citizen  [DO],
   for whom she was the sole carer; her relationship with [DO] was over but
   he regularly saw the child.


5. She gave  further  information  about  her  background  in  her  witness
   statement. She had long known herself to be a Lesbian, but had  kept  it
   secret in Uganda save from a very close friend, particularly because her
   mother was a born-again Christian who considered homosexuality to be  an
   abomination; her father was  a  politician  who  had  signed  the  anti-
   homosexuality legislation. She had been suspended from school  following
   a relationship  with  a  girl  called  Mary.   Her  mother  subsequently
   arranged a place for her at  Bible  School  in  Bristol  in  the  United
   Kingdom to help her change her ways; she attended  that  from  2004-2006
   before returning to Uganda.


6. Mathias Mpuuga had been the founder of A4C which she described  as  more
   of a movement than a party, and had intended to give examples  of  their
   activities at interview;  the  blog  was  not  practical  as  a  way  of
   communicating with people in  villages  which  might  lack  electricity.
   Besigye was a supporter rather than  leader  of  A4C  who  had  involved
   himself with the Walk to Work protests; she had  been  ushering  on  the
   door when arrested, and was warned that if she did not vote for the  NRM
   at the elections she would suffer the consequences.  During  her  August
   2012 detention she was warned that if she demonstrated publicly  against
   the government they would retaliate against their  families;  complaints
   would be ineffective as the police would deny having detained  her.  Her
   politics were closely related to her sexuality. She did not claim asylum
   on arrival as she feared arrest for using a false passport. She had  not
   involved herself in political activities  in  this  country  and  lacked
   access to the internet.


7. Her current partner [K] was a British citizen and openly  lesbian.  They
   had first met in  2004.  She  had  met  [DO]  over  this  period,  their
   relationship had been one of friendship originally but subsequently  she
   had a child by him, after which he told her that he  was  married;  this
   was before she claimed asylum. He had  stopped  communicating  with  her
   after she told him about her sexuality and [K]. They had not  agreed  on
   his access arrangements to see [R] though he wrote  requesting  contact,
   had supported his application  for  a  passport,  and  visited  them  in
   Norwich occasionally. Her relationship with [K] had been suspended  over
   the period of her pregnancy though  they  were  once  again  seeing  one
   another, and hoped to move in with [K] if allowed to  remain  here.  She
   had not wanted to  introduce  the  asylum  dimension  of  her  claim  at
   interview.


8. In its decision of May 2015, the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  her
   evidence as to her difficulties in Uganda could not be accepted  because
   of her delay in  claiming  asylum,  a  step  she  had  taken  only  once
   pregnant; she was intelligent, articulate and educated and her claim  to
   have feared arrest for travelling on a false passport was not  plausible
   given that she had arranged and paid for such a document  to  facilitate
   her travel to this country. This went to  the  heart  of  her  case.  It
   accepted that she was a supporter of A4c given that her account  of  its
   work, organisation and objectives were consistent. Her arrests were  not
   accepted given they were not mentioned at the  screening  interview  and
   her English fluency undermined her explanation that she had thought  she
   was being asked about events in England. Additionally she  had  made  no
   effort to promote the  objectives  of  A4C  in  this  country.  She  had
   revealed her asserted sexual identity too late for its genuineness to be
   accepted, only after her asylum interview  and  further  representations
   made by her Solicitors in January 2015. She would only  be  at  risk  of
   serious harm if she publicly  spoke  out  or  gathered  with  others  to
   discuss politics, which was unlikely given her  lack  of  activities  in
   this country.


9. [R] was at an age where his  mother  represented  his  whole  life.  His
   father saw him only infrequently though the Judge accepted that he would
   look after him if he remained in this country. Whilst he would lose  the
   benefits of his British citizenship in Uganda this was not a trump card,
   particularly given the option was available of remaining here  with  his
   father which meant that the Zambrano principle was not in  play;  whilst
   it was in his best interests to stay with  his  mother  here,  this  was
   finely balanced. Under Appendix FM the boy's departure for Uganda  would
   not be unreasonable as he  would  have  the  benefit  of  any  financial
   support from his father and the large  family  unit  of  his  mother  to
   support him in Uganda. The decision was not disproportionate outside the
   Rules as Ms Wanjuzi was in receipt of asylum support and could not  show
   financial independence, she had established private life in this country
   on  a  precarious  basis,  and  the  child's  departure  would  not   be
   unreasonable.


10. This decision was set aside on  9  November  2015  and  the  matter  was
   reheard; the appeal was allowed  on  21  January  2016.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal (Judge Andrew) now found that the asylum  claim  was  not  made
   out. It did not accept that she was a lesbian or bisexual because of the
   lack of evidence of enduring contact between her and [K], and because of
   a discrepancy as to whether she had stayed in touch with Mary in Uganda,
   and as it seemed unlikely that her mother would think the United Kingdom
   a safer environment for a  young  woman  needing  strict  guidance  than
   Uganda; furthermore [K] had previously sponsored  a  spouse  application
   albeit in a relationship that she said had ended some years earlier, she
   herself having had a child. It accepted she was  a  member  of  A4C  but
   given the  lack  of  problems  she  faced  following  her  release  from
   detention and subsequently, it was not accepted that  she  would  be  in
   danger on a return; additionally her late asylum  claim  undermined  her
   credibility.


11. As to her claim on Article 8 grounds, she had  sole  responsibility  for
   [R]'s upbringing and the Home Office guidance was that it  will  usually
   be appropriate to grant leave to  the  primary  carer  where  there  was
   evidence of a genuine and subsisting  relationship  between  parent  and
   child, which was clearly established here. She did not fall  within  the
   categories which would defeat that application, as she did  not  have  a
   very poor immigration history or any criminal history;  accordingly  her
   application succeeded applying the principles set out in cases  such  as
   Sanade, given that "on the evidence that is before me I must accept that
   Ms Wanjuzi is the primary carer for the  child":  she  acknowledged  the
   possibility that the father had some degree of contact with the boy.


12. The Secretary of State appealed on the grounds that


   a) The Respondent's immigration history was very poor;
   b) The analysis of her circumstances here was superficial and inadequate,
      having concentrated only on the child's nationality.


13. Permission to appeal was granted on 11 February 2016 by  the  First-tier
   Tribunal  on  the  basis  that  no  attention  had  been  given  to  the
   Respondent's poor immigration history which  featured  use  of  a  false
   passport to gain admission and maintaining a false asylum  claim,  which
   arguably meant that she would not have met the suitability  requirements
   of the Immigration Rules.


14. A Rule 24 response provided  argued  that  material  considerations  had
   been overlooked regarding the asylum claim (though this was not  pressed
   before me at the hearing, Ms Wilkins indicating that she recognised  the
   procedural obstacle to raising a  cross-appeal  without  having  made  a
   prior application to the Upper Tribunal, and so I need say no more about
   it).


15. Mr Bramble submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  not  adequately
   grappled with the suitability requirements under the Rules, and that the
   same considerations potentially adverse to Ms Wanjuzi were  in  play  in
   relation to the public interest  contra-indicating  the  recognition  of
   Zambrano rights.


16. Ms Wilkins  submitted  that  the  only  reasonable  inference  from  the
   evidence was that there was no possibility that [R] could live with  his
   father, who had formed an independent family unit that was not aware  of
   his existence. The case law essentially holds that  British  citizenship
   is a trump card; in any event the First-tier Tribunal was clearly  aware
   of the poor immigration history in so far as Ms Wanjuzi had entered on a
   false document and pursued an unfounded asylum claim, and balanced these
   factors as public interest considerations. The Secretary  of  State  had
   not seen any evidence that [R] was British at the date of the  decision,
   and had not taken the point now sought to be raised  before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.

Findings and reasons

17. There are two grounds of appeal before me, one going to the adequacy  of
   reasoning vis-�-vis the disposal of the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds
   outside the Immigration Rules, the  other  to  the  application  of  the
   Zambrano principle vis-�-vis a person with an immigration  history  such
   as that of the Respondent. No challenge has been  made  to  the  primary
   findings of fact below.


18. Zambrano v Office National de l'Emploi (ONEm) [2011] All E  R  (EC)  491
   establishes that Article 20 of the Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the
   European Union "is to be interpreted as  meaning  that  it  precludes  a
   member state from refusing a third country national upon which his minor
   children, who are European Union citizens, are  dependent,  a  right  of
   residence in the member state of  residence  and  nationality  of  those
   children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that third country
   national, in so far as such decisions  deprive  those  children  of  the
   genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status
   of European Union citizen".


19. That  principle  has  been  now  given  expression  in  The  Immigration
   (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006


         "15A. Derivative right of residence
         (1) A person ("P")  who  is  not  [an  exempt  person]  2  and  who
         satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4) [, (4A)] 3 or (5)
         of this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to  reside  in
         the United  Kingdom  for  as  long  as  P  satisfies  the  relevant
         criteria. ...
         (4A) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
         (a) P is the primary carer of  a  British  citizen  ("the  relevant
         British citizen");
         (b) the relevant British citizen is residing in the United Kingdom;
         and
         (c) the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside  in  the
         UK or in another EEA State if P were required to leave.
         (7) P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if
         (a) P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person; and
         (b) P-
         (i) is the person who has primary responsibility for that  person's
         care;"


20. Hickinbottom J summarised the relevant principles for establishing  when
   it might properly be said that "the relevant British  citizen  would  be
   unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA  State"  in  Sanneh  [2013]
   EWHC 793 (Admin), emphasising the need for compulsion:


         "iv) Nothing less than such compulsion will engage articles 20  and
         21 of the TFEU. In particular, EU law will not be engaged where the
         EU citizen is not compelled to leave the EU, even if the quality or
         standard of life of the EU citizen is diminished as a result of the
         non-EU national upon whom he is dependent is (for example)  removed
         or prevented from working; although (a) diminution in  the  quality
         of life might engage EU law if (and only if) it  is  sufficient  in
         practice to compel the a relevant ascendant relative, and hence the
         EU dependent citizen, to leave, and (b) such actions as removal  or
         prevention of work may result in an interference  with  some  other
         right, such as the right to respect for family life under article 8
         of the European Convention on Human Rights."


21. Of critical importance, then, is the position  of  the  British  Citizen
   child. The First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  if  his  mother  left  the
   country, on balance of probabilities it would be likely that  [R]  would
   be required to relocate abroad too. The father's undisputed evidence  is
   that he is not in a current relationship with her and is in fact married
   to another woman with whom he has his own family; he has stated that  he
   would have to divorce her in order to take care of [R], and in the  face
   of the inherent unlikelihood of that chain of events coming to pass, the
   First-tier Tribunal's conclusions as to the potential application of the
   Zambrano principle are wholly understandable. [R] would indeed be unable
   to reside in the UK (no other potential EEA state of residence has  been
   identified  in  this  case)  if  the  immigration  decision  was  to  be
   implemented, and would thus be compelled to forgo the  benefits  of  his
   nationality, which would be inconsistent with the Zambrano principle  as
   expounded in Sanneh.


22. That leads onto the further question, which was the real  focus  of  the
   argument before me, as to whether Ms Wanjuzi's immigration  history  was
   sufficiently poor to prevent the  Zambrano  principle  availing  her.  I
   understand that the  prevailing  policy  is  found  in  The  Immigration
   Directorate Instruction  Family  Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.0b
   Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private  Life:  10-Year  Routes
   (August 2015):


      "11.2.3. Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to
      leave the UK?
      Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must not  take
      a decision in relation to the parent or primary  carer  of  a  British
      Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to force that
      British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age  of  that  child.
      This reflects the European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano ...
      Where a decision to refuse the application would require a  parent  or
      primary carer to return to a country outside the  EU,  the  case  must
      always be assessed on the basis  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to
      expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU  with  that  parent  or
      primary carer.
      In such cases it will usually be appropriate to  grant  leave  to  the
      parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK  with  the
      child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship.
      It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to  grant  leave  where  the
      conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations of
      such weight as to justify separation, if  the  child  could  otherwise
      stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in the UK or  in
      the EU.
      The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:
           . criminality falling below the thresholds set out in  paragraph
             398 of the Immigration Rules;
           . a very poor immigration history, such as where the person  has
             repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules."


23. The relationship between the public interest and the Zambrano  principle
   does not so far appear to have been the subject of  a  decision  of  the
   Court of Justice of the European Union, though Advocate-General  Szpunar
   delivered his opinion on the issue on 4 February 2016 in Alfredo  Rend�n
   Mar�n v Administraci�n del Estado (Case C-165/14), concluding that

      "It is, in principle, contrary to Article 20 TFEU for a  Member  State
      to expel from its territory to  a  non-member  State  a  third-country
      national who is the parent of a child who is a national of that Member
      State and of whom the parent has sole care and custody, when to do  so
      would deprive the child who is a  citizen  of  the  Union  of  genuine
      enjoyment of the substance of his or her rights as a  citizen  of  the
      Union. Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances, a Member State  may
      adopt such a measure, provided that it:
    - observes the principle of proportionality and is based on the personal
      conduct of the foreign national,  which  must  constitute  a  genuine,
      present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one   of   the
      fundamental interests of society, and
    - is based on an imperative reason relating to public security."

24. The Opinion in Mar�n is of course not binding upon  me  as  the  Court's
   judgment is still awaited, but it is of interest in indicating that only
   a very significant threat to the public interest will suffice to trump a
   Zambrano right. That sets the bar very much higher than  does  the  Home
   Office guidance, which countenances  interference  with  EU  citizenship
   rights based on a much lower  threshold.  It  would  be  very  difficult
   indeed to hold that Ms Wanjuzi poses a present threat to  a  fundamental
   societal interest given that her only immigration  misdemeanours  relate
   to her quest to enter and remain in this  country,  a  difficulty  which
   would be resolved by the grant of residence.


25. I shall determine the appeal  on  the  basis  agreed  by  the  advocates
   before me, ie with reference to the published Home Office guidance.  The
   First-tier Tribunal found that any misdemeanours in  her  past  did  not
   reach the threshold posited therein. I consider that  finding  to  be  a
   tenable one. Ms Wanjuzi's behaviour never fell foul of the criminal law,
   and so the only question was whether her use of  a  false  passport  and
   pursuit  of  an  unfounded  asylum  claim  amounted  to  "a  very   poor
   immigration history,  such  as  where  the  person  has  repeatedly  and
   deliberately breached the Immigration Rules".


26. I note that she did not rely on the false passport beyond  her  original
   entry to the United Kingdom (so her situation is  to  be  contrasted  to
   that stigmatised by the mandatory refusal  reasons  in  the  Rules  that
   indicate the weight to be attributed to putting forward  an  application
   based  on  a  false  identity  document),  and,  aside  from  making  an
   exaggerated asylum claim which has failed on appeal, there has  been  no
   other incident such as to amount to a repeated breach of the Rules.  Her
   asylum claim was not rejected as wholly fabricated: past detentions were
   described by the First-tier Tribunal as arising from her  being  in  the
   wrong place at the wrong time. It might be said that the  finding  below
   was a generous one, but I cannot see that any relevant consideration was
   overlooked or that the conclusion was irrational.


27. I also note that this line of refusal  does  not  appear  to  have  been
   pressed by the Secretary of State at the two hearings in the  First-tier
   Tribunal (it does not appear in  any  refusal  letter,  and  Mr  Bramble
   indicated that there was no sign on the Home  Office  file  of  distinct
   questioning or submissions on the issue below), meaning that  there  has
   been no detailed investigation as to the history  of  the  Ms  Wanjuzi's
   time in the United Kingdom  in  so  far  as  she  might  be  accused  of
   repeatedly and deliberately breaching the Rules such as to pose a threat
   to the public interest. In these circumstances it seems to me  that  the
   relatively concise treatment of the issue below was understandable.


28. Accordingly, I do not consider that any error of law has been made  out.
   The First-tier Tribunal was  entitled  to  find  that  the  Respondent's
   appeal fell to be allowed because otherwise  the  rights  of  a  British
   citizen child would be unduly compromised.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed
