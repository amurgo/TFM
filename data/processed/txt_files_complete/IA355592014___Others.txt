Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms A Cooke, of Counsel instructed by Messrs
Farani.Javid Taylor


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Quinn,  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 11 June 2015 allowed the appeals of the  respondents  on
    human rights grounds.

2.   For  ease  of  reference,  although  the  Secretary  of  State  is  the
    appellant before me I will refer to her as the respondent  as  she  was
    the respondent in the First-tier.  Similarly  I  will  refer  to  Adnan
    Shaikh, Qurat-Ul-Ain Adnan and Mohammad Abdullah as the  appellants  as
    they were the appellants in the First-tier.

3.   The first two appellants are the parents of the third  appellant.   The
    first appellant entered Britain in November  2005  as  a  student  with
    leave which expired in March 2008.  Thereafter he has remained  without
    authority.  His wife, the second appellant, joined him as  a  dependant
    on 26 April 2007.  She too has overstayed since March 2008.  The  third
    appellant was born on 11 January 2008 in Britain  and  has  never  left
    Britain.

4.   They applied for leave to remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    were refused on 23 August 2014.  Their appeal was heard by Judge  Quinn
    on 28 May 2015.  He stated that he  was  aware  of  the  Supreme  Court
    decision in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 and Section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  He also referred to the
    decision of the House of Lords in Razgar and said  that  he  had  taken
    into account public interest considerations set out in Section  117  of
    the Immigration Act 2014.

5.   He noted the first appellant's evidence that the third appellant  could
    not read or write Urdu at all and understood very little Urdu and  that
    the second appellant had said that her son could not speak Urdu.

6.   He noted the determinations in Azimi-Moayed  [2013]  UKUT  00197  (IAC)
    and Osawemwenze [2014] EWHC 1564 both of which indicated that  a  child
    who was a Pakistani national could  integrate  into  cultural  life  in
    Pakistan and that it was reasonable to expect a family to relocate.  He
    also noted the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal  in  EV  (Philippines)
    [2014] EWCA Civ  874  stating  that  that  was  a  determination  which
    "reminded the Tribunal that it was not the job of the UK to educate the
    world".  He noticed that medical treatment was available in Pakistan.

7.   At paragraph 33 onwards he set out  his  findings  on  credibility  and
    fact, stating that he considered that the parents  had  overstated  the
    difficulties their child had with his asthma but stating that the third
    appellant had been born in London and had always lived  here.   He  was
    doing well at school.  He stated that the  third  appellant  "would  be
    completely unable to cope with the education system in Pakistan at  the
    age of 7", stating that this was because he did not have the ability to
    write or speak Urdu and that he might  not  even  be  admitted  to  his
    school.  He noted a report from a social worker but stated that he only
    placed some weight on that as the social worker was not  aware  of  the
    Immigration Rules and the reasons why the  appellants  might  not  meet
    those Rules.  The social worker had said that it would cause  emotional
    and lasting damage to the third appellant should the family be  removed
    from Britain and that that could not be in the third  appellant's  best
    interests "as it would place him in an alien environment which he  does
    not appear to have any concept of, or desire to live  in".   The  judge
    accepted the appellants' representative's submissions that Pakistan was
    a country in which the third appellant could not settle easily as aside
    from the problem of learning Urdu he had  been  in  Britain  for  seven
    years and knew no other country.

8.   The judge said that he had taken Section 117 into  account  "and  noted
    that both parents could speak English.  They had made some use  of  the
    NHS but they were not reliant on public funds".

9.   He accepted that the appellants could  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Immigration Rule 276ADE but went on to state:-

         "45. Given the above findings and conclusions I find that appellant
             3 has discharged the burden of proof to show that his  removal
             would be disproportionate to the legitimate public end  sought
             to be achieved and I find that the  appellant  has  discharged
             the burden of proof that such removal would cause the UK to be
             in breach of its obligations  under  the  1950  Convention  as
             regards  to  Article  8  thereof  and  therefore  the   appeal
             succeeds.  I find that there are insurmountable  obstacles  in
             the way of returning Mohammad to Pakistan and that the correct
             weight to his best interests was not given by the respondent."

10.  The Secretary of State appealed, stating that given the conclusions  of
    the judge regarding the appellant's asthma the  only  factor  that  was
    relevant was the potential disruption to the appellant's education.

11.  The first ground of appeal referred to the determination  in  MK  (best
    interests of child) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC) where it  was  stated
    at paragraph 51:-

         "... Whilst there would be disruption in the  children's  education
         caused by removal to India, it would be temporary.   We  appreciate
         that H herself thinks it would take a  long  time  to  settle  back
         there - that  is  a  very  understandable  reaction  -  but  viewed
         objectively all the  evidence  indicates  that  she  is  a  bright,
         enthusiastic girl who would find it relatively easy  to  adapt  and
         adjust, and to make new friends, as she has done during her  school
         life here...".

    It was asserted that that had been a case where the UK-born  child  and
    her older sister, who were arguably more enmeshed in the  UK  education
    system than the third appellant in this case,  were  being  removed  to
    India.

12.  The first ground  of  appeal  referred  to  the  determination  in  E-A
    (Article 8 - best interests of child) Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  315  (IAC)
    where it had been  stated  that  analysis  of  the  best  interests  of
    children entirely through the prism of the right to education  was  too
    narrow an approach.  That ground also  referred to the Court of  Appeal
    judgment in EV (Philippines) & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 in  which
    it had said, at paragraph 60:-

         "That is a long way from the facts of our case.  In our  case  none
         of the family is a British citizen.  None has the right  to  remain
         in this country.  If the mother  is  removed,  the  father  has  no
         independent right to remain.  If the parents are removed,  then  it
         is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them.   As
         the Immigration Judge found it is obviously in their best interests
         to remain with their parents.  Although it is, of course a question
         of fact for the Tribunal, I cannot see  that  the  desirability  of
         being educated at public expense in the UK can outweigh the benefit
         to the children of remaining with their parents.  Just as we cannot
         provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot  educate  the
         world."

13.  The second ground of appeal stated that the  analysis  of  the  factors
    set out in paragraph 117A - D  of  the  2002  Nationality,  Asylum  and
    Immigration Act had  only  been  given  a  perfunctory  and  inadequate
    consideration by the judge.

14.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Avery relied on  the  grounds
    of appeal.  He emphasised that the parents were long-term  overstayers.
    He stated that it was evident that the determination was not only badly
    structured but unclear - it appears that the  judge  was  finding  that
    there was a freestanding Article 8 right which would  be  infringed  by
    removal.  The judge had simply not  engaged  with  the  Rules  or  with
    statute.

15.  He referred to the grounds of appeal and stated that  the  position  of
    the third appellant had not been considered in the context of the wider
    family which was the relevant context in which to consider such rights.
     The judge had solely focused on the impact on the child's education.

16.  In reply Miss Cooke relied on the skeleton argument in  which  she  has
    claimed that the judge had  properly  relied  on  the  judgment  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4  and  his  duties  under  Section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  and  had  taken  into
    account relevant case law.  She stated  that  it  was  clear  that  the
    assessment of the best interests of the child were  fact-sensitive  and
    highly personal and that this case could be distinguished from that  of
    the children in MK, who had only been in Britain for six  years  -  the
    older child in that case had spent her first five years in India.

17.  She referred to the reference in the grounds to the determination in E-
    A but stated that that had not been mentioned at the hearing.   In  any
    event  she  argued  that  the  principles  in  that   case   could   be
    distinguished because the children in that case had been in Britain for
    less than seven years, were younger and the eldest  was  in  the  first
    year of  primary  school.   She  referred  to  the  independent  social
    worker's report which referred to  the  third  appellant's  substantial
    residence which meant that he has put  down  roots  and  developed  his
    personal identity and formed friendships and made links here.

18.  She also attempted to distinguish the facts in this case from those  in
    the case of EV but in any event pointed out that in that  case  it  was
    stated that the longer a child had been here,  the  more  advanced  (or
    critical) his stage of education, the looser his ties would be with the
    country of nationality and the more  deleterious  the  consequences  of
    return.  She asserted that the judge had properly  taken  into  account
    all relevant factors and was entitled to reach the conclusions which he
    had.

19.  She further submitted that the  judge's  analysis  of  the  factors  in
    Section 117A - D were adequate given that the focus of the  appeal  was
    on the position of the third appellant and in any event the  judge  was
    only obliged to have regard to those factors.

20.  She argued that the conclusions of the  judge  were  open  to  him  and
    indeed that there were exceptional circumstances in  this  case  -  she
    quoted from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192.  She argued that the Rules themselves did not make up  a
    complete code  and  that  the  judge  was  correct  to  deal  with  the
    consideration of the Article 8 of the  appellants  outside  the  Rules,
    applying the relevant Razgar test and that his conclusions thereon were
    fully open to him.

Discussion

21.  I consider that there are material errors of law in  the  determination
    of the judge.  The reality is that it is unstructured.  It was for  the
    judge to have considered the applicant's circumstances within the Rules
    and when applying statute law.  His perfunctory  reference  to  Section
    117A - D of the 2002 Act is simply insufficient when dealing  with  the
    proportionality of removal.  He appears to have completely ignored  the
    fact that the first two appellants had overstayed  since  2008  and  in
    particular the provisions of paragraph 117B(4) which state that  little
    weight should be given to a private life formed  at  a  time  when  the
    person is in Britain unlawfully.  That is exactly the case here  -  the
    first two appellants have remained without authority since  2008.   The
    public interest in maintaining  proper  immigration  control  has  been
    completely ignored by the judge.

22.  The reality is that the judge did not identify any exceptional  factors
    in this case.  Indeed it is unclear  how  he  reached  his  conclusions
    relating to the harm that would be done to the third appellant when the
    family is removed.  Miss Cooke  appeared  to  suggest  that  the  third
    appellant could only speak very little Urdu but I pointed  out  to  her
    that initially an Urdu interpreter had been required for  the  evidence
    of the first appellant, although it appears that he  did  not  actually
    use the interpreter.  It is very difficult to believe that  two  people
    who had been brought up and lived  in  Pakistan  and  are  living  here
    without, as it appears, working in  the  wider  environment  would  not
    speak Urdu at home - the judge  should  have  questioned  the  position
    regarding the third appellant's ability to speak Urdu.   In  any  event
    there is nothing to suggest that as an intelligent child he  would  not
    be able to pick up Urdu fairly rapidly let alone the fact  that  having
    benefited from education here he would not  be  able  to  continue  his
    education in Pakistan.  It was claimed by the appellants that �750  per
    month was sent to them from  relatives  in  Pakistan.   The  family  in
    Pakistan clearly has sufficient funds to enable them to  settle  in  in
    Pakistan or indeed to pay for  a  tutor  for  the  third  appellant  if
    required.  I note of course that there is a large  extended  family  in
    Pakistan to which the appellants would be returning.  Most importantly,
    however, the judge has not taken into account the fact that this family
    would be returning to Pakistan together.

23.  He simply ignored relevant case law and in particular the decisions  in
    EV (Philippines) and E-A (Nigeria).  This determination is unstructured
    and I consider that the errors of law  identified  above  are  material
    errors of law.

24.  I therefore set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    direct that the appeal proceed to a hearing afresh in the First-tier as
    I consider that  the  requirements  of  the  Senior  President  of  the
    Tribunal's Practice Directions are met.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The  appeal  will
proceed to a hearing afresh on all issues.

Direction

The appeal will be heard at Hatton Cross on 17 February 2016, time  estimate
two and a half hours, no interpreter required.
