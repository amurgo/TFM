                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Bellara, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The applicant had leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
      Migrant until  8  June  2012.   On  24  September  2012  she  made  an
      application to vary that leave to  remain  to  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrant.  That application was refused on 20 March 2013 and a decision
      was also made to remove her by way of directions under Section  47  of
      the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


   2.  Unfortunately it was  not  noticed  until  today  that  the  decision
      refusing to vary leave to  remain  is  a  non-appealable  decision  as
      defined by Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
      2002.  There is therefore no appeal  against  the  decision  dated  20
      March 2013 to refuse to vary her leave to remain.

   3.   There was an appeal against the decision to remove  her  by  way  of
      directions under Section 47.  That appeal was  successful  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal in a decision dated 16  September  2013  and  that
      decision therefore stands, namely that the decision to remove  her  in
      accordance with Section 47 was not in accordance with the law.

   4. There is no error of law. The appeal before me is dismissed.


Signed                                  Date 4th February 2014
