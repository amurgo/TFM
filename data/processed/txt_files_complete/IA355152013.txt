Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, Counsel, instructed by A2 Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Nepal who was born on 13 February  1983.
     She is married to a Mr Mohan Poudel who has been in this  country  now
    for a long period of time, as will be apparent from what is said below.



 2. The appellant arrived in this country on 16 September 2007 on a student
    visa which was valid until 31 October 2010 and prior to the  expiration
    of her student visa she applied for an extension  of  leave  which  was
    granted until 16 April 2012.  The appellant met her  husband  in  March
    2008 and they were marred in this country  on  2  April  2009.   It  is
    common ground that this is a valid and subsisting marriage and that the
    parties intend to live together permanently in the UK  as  husband  and
    wife.  She is now very heavily pregnant and her child is due to be born
    sometime this month.

 3. It is not in dispute that following their marriage the appellant  could
    not immediately apply for leave to remain as a dependant of her husband
    as at that time he had only limited  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a student, but on 24 January 2012 he applied for  indefinite
    leave to remain based on ten  years'  lawful  residence.   It  was  the
    intention of the appellant and her husband, and certainly  their  hope,
    that leave to  remain  would  be  granted  before  the  expiry  of  the
    appellant's existing student leave on 16 April 2012 which would  enable
    her then to apply as her  husband's  dependant  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. What then seems to have occurred is as follows. On 26  March  2012  the
    respondent  made  a  decision  to  allow  the   appellant's   husband's
    application. Included within the appellant's bundle at page 98  is  the
    residence permit in respect of the appellant's husband on which  it  is
    stated that he was granted indefinite leave to remain on 26 March 2012.
     As a fact, therefore, it would appear that as that date the  appellant
    had indefinite leave to remain. There is an issue  as  to  the  precise
    date on which the appellant's  husband  was  "settled"  which  will  be
    discussed below, but this is a relevant date.

 5. No doubt because of a lack of sufficient administrative  resources  the
    decision which the respondent had already made was not communicated  to
    the appellant's  husband  until  21  April  2012,  by  which  time  the
    appellant's existing leave had expired.  Because she had  to  make  her
    application for further leave to remain before her leave  expired,  she
    made this application on 13 April 2013,  which  was  just  before  that
    leave expired (and was 8 days before the respondent's decision to grant
    her husband indefinite  leave  to  remain  was  communicated  to  him).
    Otherwise she would technically  have  been  present  in  this  country
    without leave, which would have  prevented  her  making  an  in-country
    application as her husband's dependant because she would  have  had  no
    immigration status.  She made her application for leave  to  remain  on
    Article 8 grounds.

 6.  Thereafter  it  seems  that  the  respondent  did  nothing  with  this
    application until 23 July 2013, a period of some fifteen  months,  when
    the application was refused.  By that time there can be no question but
    that the appellant's husband was "settled" within the  meaning  of  any
    definition contained within the Rules.

 7. The appellant appealed against this decision and her appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Sommerville sitting at  Birmingham  on
    31 January 2014,  but in a determination  promulgated  on  19  February
    2014 Judge Sommerville dismissed the appeal both under the  Immigration
    Rules and also on human rights grounds; this was no doubt  intended  to
    be a reference to Article 8 outside the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules or at any rate under the residual  powers  within  the  Rules  to
    grant an application under Article  8  if  a  refusal  would  otherwise
    result in "unjustifiably harsh consequences" for an applicant.

 8. The appellant now appeals to this Tribunal, permission to appeal having
    been granted by Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McClure  on  14
    March 2014.

The Hearing

 9. I heard submissions on behalf of both parties  which  I  have  recorded
    contemporaneously. As these submissions are contained within the Record
    of Proceedings I shall not refer below to everything which was said  to
    me during the course of the hearing.  I have, however,  had  regard  to
    everything which was said as well as to all  the  documents  which  are
    contained within the file before reaching my decision.

10. On behalf of the respondent Mr Saunders very fairly  accepted  that  no
    point had been taken in the refusal letter and none was taken now  with
    regard to the financial requirements  under  the  Rules,  the  relevant
    Rules in this  case  being  contained  within  paragraph  E-LTRP1.3  of
    Appendix FM onwards. It was accordingly  accepted  that  the  financial
    requirements were satisfied.  I deal below with what the relevant issue
    is.

11. On behalf of the appellant Mr Balroop submitted (and  this  was  common
    ground) that the relevant section of the  Rules  was  contained  within
    Appendix  FM  at  E-LTRP1.1  onwards.   I  now  set  out  the  relevant
    provisions which are as follows:

         "Section E-LTRP: Eligibility for  limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner

         E-LTRP1.1. To qualify for limited leave to remain as a partner  all
         of the requirements of paragraph E-LTRP.1.2.2 must be met.

         Relationship requirements

         E-LTRP1.2. The applicant's partner must be -

         (a)  a British citizen in the UK;

         (b)  present and settled in the UK; or

         (c)  in the UK with refugee leave or as a person with  humanitarian
         protection"

12. I pause at this stage to state  that  it  is  common  ground  that  the
    requirement  is  that  the  applicant's  partner  (in  this  case   the
    appellant's husband) must be either a British  citizen  in  the  UK  or
    present and settled in the UK.  It is not suggested (as in the  grounds
    it seems to have been assumed the judge had found)  that  there  was  a
    requirement that the partner must be both a British citizen in  the  UK
    and a person present and settled in  the  UK.   Judge  Sommerville  had
    reached his findings on the basis  that  the  appellant's  husband  was
    neither a British citizen nor a person present and settled in  the  UK.
    For the  purposes  of  this  determination  the  issue  which  must  be
    determined is whether or not  at  the  relevant  time  (which  will  be
    discussed below) the appellant's  husband  was  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK.

13. The requirements under Section E-LTRP continue as follows:

         "E-LTRP.1.3.  The applicant must be aged 18 or over at the date  of
         application.

         E-LTRP.1.4 The partner must be aged 18  or  over  at  the  date  of
         application. ...

         E-LTRP.1.6.  The applicant  and  her  partner  must  have   met  in
         person.

         E-LTRP.1.7.  The relationship between the applicant and her partner
         must be genuine and subsisting.

         E-LTRP.1.8.  If the applicant and partner are married or in a civil
         partnership it must be a valid marriage or  civil  partnership,  as
         specified. ...

         E-LTRP.1.10.  The applicant and her partner  must  intend  to  live
         together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  limited
         leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
         UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
         for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
         provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
         granted under paragraph D-ECP.1.1. or since  the  last  [grant  of]
         limited leave to remain as a partner the applicant and the  partner
         lived together in the UK or there is good reason,  consistent  with
         the continuing intention to live together permanently  in  the  UK,
         for any period that they have not done so ...

         E-LTRP.1.12.  The applicant's partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
         fianc�(e) or  proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  is
         granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner.

         Immigration Status Requirements

         E-LTRP.2.1.  The applicant must not be in the UK -

         (a)   as a visitor;

         (b)  with valid leave granted for a period of six months  or  less,
             unless that leave is as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner,
             or was granted pending the outcome of Family Court or  divorce
             proceedings ..

         E-LTRP.2.2.  The applicant must not be in the UK in breach  of  the
         immigration laws (disregarded  any  period  of  overstaying  for  a
         period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1 applies.







         Financial requirements ..."

14. As already noted above, the respondent  does  not  challenge  that  the
    financial requirements are satisfied and indeed it is apparent from the
    covering letter sent by the appellant's solicitors on her  behalf  that
    documents evidencing this have been  sent to the respondent.

15. There is an English language requirement, but it is not suggested  that
    this requirement was not satisfied, and indeed given that the appellant
    had been present in this country as a student for many years, there  is
    no basis upon which the application could have  been  refused  on  this
    ground.

16. The error of law which is asserted with regard to  Judge  Sommerville's
    determination is first that he was wrong to find as he did at paragraph
    10 of his determination that the appellant's husband was  not  "present
    and settled in the UK".  It is  worth  recording  in  full  what  Judge
    Sommerville in fact found at paragraph 10 of  his  determination  under
    the heading "Analysis of the evidence and findings of fact":

         "10.  I have considered the application in the context of  Appendix
             FM  to the Immigration Rules,  ELTRP  1.1  to  1.12.  For  the
             reasons explained above, as  at  the  date  of  decision,  the
             appellant could not satisfy paragraph E-LTRP 1.2(a) or (b)  as
             her partner was neither a  'British  citizen  in  the  UK'  or
             'present and settled in the UK'. It is accepted that they meet
             all the requirements of E-LTRP 1.3 to 1.12 and  in  particular
             that the appellant and  her  partner  are  in  a  genuine  and
             subsisting [marriage]."

17. The first thing that must be said about this finding is that it  is  in
    itself clearly wrong, because as at the date  of  decision,  which  was
    July 2013,  the appellant's husband clearly was present and settled  in
    the UK.  This is not challenged, and it could not  be  because  over  a
    year earlier he had been  granted indefinite leave to  remain  on  this
    basis.  However, what does need to  be  discussed  today  is  what  the
    relevant dates are for the purposes of this appeal.

18. The decision under Article 8 is  also  challenged,  because  the  judge
    found  at  paragraphs  14  that  the  refusal   did   not   result   in
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" for the appellant and  her  husband,
    in line with the decision of  this  Tribunal  in  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
    00640.  The judge apparently  made  this  finding  on  the  basis  that
    because "the appellant and her husband both knew when they entered into
    their  relationship  that  their  respective  immigration  status   was
    precarious" and they are both from Nepal, he did "not accept that  just
    because they said that they now have no close  relatives  in  Nepal  it
    will  be  unduly  harsh  for  them  to  return  there   and   this   is
    notwithstanding that the employment opportunities are not  as  good  as
    they are in this country".

19.  As  will  be  discussed  below,  when  reaching  a  finding  that  the
    consequences of this decision would not be  "unjustifiably  harsh"  the
    judge does not appear to have given any (or any  proper)  consideration
    to  the  competing  factors  which  might  be  said  to  exist  in  the
    circumstances of this case, and in particular that the appellant was by
    this time heavily pregnant and due to give birth shortly.  All that  is
    said in this regard is  what  is  contained  at  paragraph  11  of  the
    determination, as follows:

         "I consider  whether  paragraph  EX(a)  applies.  At  the  date  of
         decision and at the date of hearing the  appellant  had  no  child.
         However, I accept on the evidence that  she  is  pregnant  and  the
         child is due to be  born  in  April.  That  does  not  assist   the
         appellant as she had no child at the date of  entry  clearance  and
         therefore EX(a) is not satisfied."

Discussion

20. The first question I have to determine is whether or not there  was  an
    error of law within the determination sufficiently  material  that  the
    decision must be set aside and remade.  In my judgement there was,  for
    a number of reasons which I shall now set out. In the first  place,  as
    already noted, Judge Sommerville was clearly wrong when he  found  that
    the appellant's partner was not "at the date of decision" "present  and
    settled in the UK".  He was.  He had been granted indefinite  leave  on
    26 March 2012 and that decision had been  communicated  to  him  on  21
    April 2012.

21. Although it might have been argued that as at the date  of  application
    (being 13 April 2012) the  appellant's  husband  was  not  present  and
    settled in the UK (because the decision to grant him  indefinite  leave
    had not been communicated to him  by  that  date)  this  was  not  even
    considered within the determination.

22. I also consider that, given the circumstances of this case, which  were
    that if a variation of  leave  was  refused  this  appellant  would  be
    obliged to return to Nepal, give birth in that country to a child whose
    father was present and settled in this  country,  and  then  apply  for
    permission to return on the basis that she was entitled so to do  under
    the Rules, the judge should have given further consideration  to  these
    circumstances before just stating baldly  that  the  refusal  does  not
    result in "an unjustifiably harsh consequence" for  the  appellant  and
    her husband.

23. Accordingly, this Tribunal must remake the decision, which I shall  now
    do.  The first issue which is before me is as to whether or  not,  when
    considering whether the appellant's  husband  could   be  described  as
    present and settled in this country, (for the  purpose  of  considering
    whether the appeal should succeed under the rules), I need to  consider
    the position as at the date of the application or whether the  relevant
    date is the date of decision.  Even  if I were  to  consider  that  the
    relevant date was the date of the application, I  would  then  need  to
    consider whether or not as at that date the appellant's husband  should
    be treated as settled  (he was clearly present at all  relevant  times)
    or whether, because he had not been told by then that  his  application
    had succeeded, he could not then be treated as settled.

24. The next question I  would  have  to  consider  (which  would  only  be
    material were the application not to succeed under the  provisions  set
    out at E-LTRP within Appendix FM) would be whether in any case  further
    leave should be granted under the Rules but outside these provisions on
    the  basis  that  the  refusal  of  the  application  would  result  in
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" for the appellant and her husband.

25. I turn first to consider whether or not the appropriate date  on  which
    the application needed to be considered was the date of application  or
    date of decision.  In my  judgement,  it  was  the  date  of  decision.
    Neither party could point me to any relevant authority, other  than  by
    analogy, but I bear in mind that this was an in-country application and
    that at all times until the date of the decision both the appellant and
    her husband were in this country lawfully.

26. In the case of in-country applications, there seems to be no reason why
    the application should not be considered as at the time the decision is
    made. At that time, as  already  noted,  the  appellant's  husband  was
    indeed settled in this country and there is no challenge to that fact.

27. As Mr Balroop submitted, if the respondent wished applications such  as
    these to be considered as at the date of application (as for example is
    the case with points-based applications) it would have been open to her
    so to provide within the Rules, as indeed is provided in  the  case  of
    points-based applications.  The fact is that she has not done so.   The
    appellant's appeal accordingly must succeed on that ground alone.

28. Even if I am wrong about that, in  my  judgement  as  at  the  date  of
    application the appellant's husband anyway  was  for  the  purposes  of
    these Rules "settled". It is common ground that he was in fact  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of long residence on 26 March
    2012.  There is no requirement within the Rules that this decision  has
    to be communicated before it takes effect.  Even if when  the  decision
    was sent for some reason it went missing in the post,  this  would  not
    have invalidated the decision.  Accordingly, by the time the  appellant
    made the application, even though she was not aware of  the  fact,  her
    husband was in fact settled. Accordingly, on  any  basis,  this  appeal
    should succeed under the Rules.

29. I would add that in any event,  there  would  seem  to  be  a  residual
    unfairness in a situation where even though a decision had been made to
    grant indefinite leave to the appellant's husband, there being no basis
    upon which his application could  properly have been  refused,  because
    this was not a matter of discretion within the Rules, that decision was
    not communicated in sufficient time to allow his wife,  the  appellant,
    to make her application.

30. Obviously, in light of my decision to allow the appeal on the  basis  I
    have stated above, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider  the
    Article 8 position, but I do so anyway for the sake of completeness, in
    the alternative.   In my judgement when considering all the factors  in
    this case, the decision not to grant this application was  contrary  to
    the appellant's Article 8 rights when  the decision  was  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal and would be even more so today, when the appellant
    is about to give birth (she was about seven months' pregnant when Judge
    Sommerville made his decision).

31. It is an important factor that were this appellant now to  be  required
    to return to Nepal, on the evidence before this Tribunal, there  is  no
    reason to doubt but that if she applied from there as the dependant  of
    her husband, who is now present and settled in the UK, that application
    should succeed. So she would be required to return shortly  after  (she
    clearly could not be expected to fly to Nepal before) the birth of  her
    child, who would be the child of a person present and  settled  in  the
    UK, (and thus entitled to British citizenship), merely in order to make
    an application from abroad which there is  no  reason  to  doubt  would
    succeed. The effect of this would be that there would  be  an  enforced
    separation between the appellant and her husband and also  between  the
    child when born and that child's father (or between the mother and  her
    child if the child did not leave with her).  As was made clear  by  the
    House of Lords in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and also subsequently by the
    Court of Appeal in Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054, there would have to be a
    good reason why such a separation would be  considered  not  to  be  in
    breach of an applicant's Article 8 rights in such circumstances.

32. In my judgement, the phrase "unjustifiably harsh consequences"  has  to
    be considered in light of all the factors in this case, and I  consider
    given the background to this case, that there is no proper  reason  for
    requiring this appellant in present circumstances to  return  to  Nepal
    merely in order to make a fresh application from abroad.

33. It follows that this appeal must be allowed and I shall so order.



Decision

I set aside the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sommerville,  as
containing a material error of law and remake the decision as follows:

The appellant's appeal is allowed, on all grounds.



Signed:                                 Date:  27 May 2014
