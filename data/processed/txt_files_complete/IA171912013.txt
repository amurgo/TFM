                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup in which he allowed the appeal of Ms
    Osman, a citizen of Somalia,  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse to grant leave to enter as the spouse of the sponsor
    Faisal Ali who is a British citizen. I shall refer to Ms Osman  as  the
    Applicant, although she was the Appellant in the proceedings below.
 2. The application under appeal was made on 22 July 2013 and  was  refused
    by reference to paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (HC395) on 1 August 2013.  The Applicant exercised her  right  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.   This  is  the  appeal  which  came
    before Judge Troup on 11 June 2014 and was dismissed by virtue  of  the
    Immigration Rules but allowed by reference to Article 8  of  the  Human
    Rights Convention. The Secretary of State  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The application was  granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Chambers on 3 July 2014 in the following terms

       The grounds seeking permission submit that an Article  8  assessment
       should only be carried  out  when  there  are  arguably  exceptional
       circumstances not recognised by the Immigration Rules.
       The necessary requirements set out in the grounds were not addressed
       in the decision. A failure to give sufficient reasons amounts to  an
       error of law.




 3. At the hearing before me the Applicant was represented by Mr Masood who
    submitted an appeal bundle.  Mr  Whitwell  appeared  to  represent  the
    Secretary of State.

 4. At the outset of the hearing I asked the representatives whether it was
    accepted that the minimum income requirement referred to in  paragraphs
    19 and 22 of the determination as �22,400 was in fact  �18,600  as  the
    Applicant's child is British. Both agreed that this was  the  case.  Mr
    Masood conceded that the Sponsor's income at the date of decision could
    only be shown to be �17,400 as he was unable to  provide  the  required
    evidence to demonstrate the higher figure  put  forward  in  the  entry
    clearance application. Mr Masood also accepted that the  Applicant  did
    not meet the English language requirements of the immigration rules.

Background

 5. The Applicant was born in  Somalia  on  10  March  1990  and  presently
    resides in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Sponsor, also  from  Somalia,  is
    the Applicant's cousin. He arrived in the United Kingdom in 1992 and is
    a British Citizen. The Applicant and the Sponsor began  a  relationship
    in 2009, they met for the first time in 2010 and they married in  Yemen
    on 25 August 2010. The Applicant first made an  application  for  entry
    clearance to join the Sponsor in the United  Kingdom  the  month  after
    their marriage but this did not progress  as  the  British  Embassy  in
    Yemen closed. On 19 May 2011 the Applicant gave birth to  the  couple's
    son, Mohamed Faisal Ali, in Yemen. The  application  under  appeal  was
    made to the Entry Clearance Officer in Addis Ababa on 22 July 2013.  It
    was refused because the Entry Clearance Officer did not accept that the
    couple had met, that they were validly married, that their relationship
    was genuine and subsisting  or  that  the  Applicant  met  the  English
    language requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  No  assessment  of
    whether the Applicant  met  the  minimum  income  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules was made.

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  evidence  was  presented
    pertaining to the marriage and its subsistence including  DNA  evidence
    confirming that the child was related as claimed to both  parents.  The
    First-tier  Tribunal's  finding  that  that  this  is  a  genuine   and
    subsisting marriage is not challenged  before  me.  Similarly,  and  as
    confirmed above, the finding that  the  Applicant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  concerning  maintenance  and
    English language is not challenged.



Submissions

 7. On behalf the Secretary of State Mr Whitwell relied on the  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal. He said that there were  two  issues.  In
    the first  place  the  determination  makes  no  finding  of  arguable,
    exceptional or compelling circumstances justifying the consideration of
    the appeal outside the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  in  accordance
    with Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640
    (IAC). Nothing in paragraphs 20 to 22 of  the  determination  could  be
    said to be an implicit reference to such a finding. Secondly and in any
    event the proportionality finding in paragraph 22 of the  determination
    is inadequately reasoned. I was referred to paragraphs 134 and  135  of
    MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 and to AAO v ECO [2011] EWCA Civ 840.

 8. For the Appellant Mr Masood said that the Judge  must  have  considered
    Gulshan. The case was referred to in submissions  and  a  copy  of  the
    case, handed to the Judge, was on the Court file. Paragraph 22  of  the
    determination clearly details exceptional circumstances. I was reminded
    that the First-tier Tribunal is a  specialist  Tribunal,  as  such  the
    Judge should be presumed to have directed himself to the relevant  case
    law even if he did not specify this. I was referred  to  AH  (Sudan)  v
    SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 297 and R (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA  Civ  982.  So
    far as proportionality is concerned the Judge has considered all of the
    circumstances. In particular the Appellant's British citizen  child  is
    only two years old and the Sponsor's income of  �17,400  is  sufficient
    for him to maintain his wife. Ms Masood accepted that the  Sponsor  may
    be able to increase his income if there was  a  subsequent  application
    but, as he explained in his witness statement the  Applicant  has  been
    living in Ethiopia illegally with her two year old child  and  as  such
    would be unable to study for the English language test.


Error of law

 9. In my judgement the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  discloses  a
    clear and material error of law. Having found that  the  Applicant  did
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  the  determination
    moves on to a consideration of Article 8 ECHR without  any  explanation
    of why it was necessary to do so. The determination does not  make  any
    reference to Gulshan or indeed Nagre v SSHD [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),
    upon which Gulshan was founded, and whilst it is not  necessary  for  a
    Judge to make specific reference to the source of the case law that  he
    follows it is necessary to show that he is following the principles  of
    that case law.  The  determination  patently  does  not  do  that.  The
    necessity to do so it  readily  apparent  where  the  rules  provide  a
    complete and achievable code. In the circumstances of this appeal  they
    do. The Applicant failed to meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules for two very specific reasons. The first was  that  she  did  not
    meet the English language requirements of the Rules and the second  was
    that she  did  not,  through  her  sponsor,  meet  the  minimum  income
    requirements.

10. It is not in my judgment necessary to go on to consider  the  issue  of
    proportionality at this stage because the error of law  in  failing  to
    follow the established case law is material to the  decision  to  allow
    the appeal. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Remaking the decision

11. In remaking the decision the first aspect to consider is whether  there
    are sufficient reasons to conduct an Article 8 exercise. The  Court  of
    Appeal in MM (Lebanon) rejected at paragraph  128  the  "arguably  good
    grounds" test from Nagre which is repeated  in  Gulshan.  MM  (Lebanon)
    adopted a simple approach - if the rule or rules constituted a complete
    code then there is no need for an Article 8 proportionality test.

        133.   . ... a particular IR does not, in each case, have to result
             in a person's Convention rights being "guaranteed". In a
             particular case, an IR may result in a person's Convention
             rights being interfered with in a manner which is not
             proportionate or justifiable on the facts of that case. That
             will not make the IR unlawful. But if the particular IR is one
             which, being an interference with the relevant Convention
             right, is also incapable of being applied in a manner which is
             proportionate or justifiable or is disproportionate in all (or
             nearly all cases), then it is unlawful.


        134.  Where  the  relevant  group  of  IRs,   upon   their   proper
             construction, provide a "complete code"  for  dealing  with  a
             person's Convention rights in the context of a  particular  IR
             or statutory provision,  such  as  in  the  case  of  "foreign
             criminals", then  the  balancing  exercise  and  the  way  the
             various factors are to be taken into account in an  individual
             case must be done  in  accordance  with  that  code,  although
             references to "exceptional circumstances"  in  the  code  will
             nonetheless entail a  proportionality  exercise.  But  if  the
             relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete code"  then  the
             proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by
             the Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.


12. The question therefore will not normally  be  whether  the  Immigration
    Rules are compliant with the requirements of Article 8 ECHR but  rather
    whether the application of those rules in a particular case results  in
    a breach of Article 8. Where a judge finds that the requirements of the
    rules are not met then before going on to conduct what was described in
    Gulshan as a freewheeling Article 8 exercise the question  of  why  the
    application of the rules is insufficient must at least be considered.

13. So far as the particular circumstances of this matter are concerned  it
    is apparent that the rules do constitute a complete code. The code  has
    a number of parts and the Applicant falls short on two of them. If  the
    Applicant can meet the English language  and  maintenance  requirements
    then her entry clearance application will be successful. The fact  that
    these are specific and potentially remediable  requirements  emphasises
    not merely the completeness of the code but also  the  illogicality  of
    looking outside that code. It may still be arguable that  where  it  is
    impossible for an applicant to meet the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules then it is right to look at why it  is  impossible  to  meet  the
    rules and balance the public interest in meeting  the  requirements  of
    the rules  against  the  particular  circumstances  of  the  applicant.
    However where it is within the reasonable capability of  the  applicant
    to meet the requirements of the rules it is difficult to see how  there
    can be any justification in departing from them. In this case Mr Masood
    accepts that it is possible for the Sponsor to earn more money to  meet
    the minimum income threshold. Indeed this is borne out by the fact that
    it was his case, in terms of the application  and  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, that with full and part time work  the  amount  he
    earned was in  excess  of  the  now  accepted  minimum  requirement  of
    �18,600. The problem was that he was not able to provide the  specified
    evidence. In respect of the  English  language  requirement  Mr  Masood
    submitted, without any apparent evidential basis, that it was difficult
    for a single mother living in Addis Ababa without a right of  residence
    to undertake and pass the required English language course.  I  do  not
    accept that this assertion, made I  emphasise  without  any  evidential
    basis, is correct. Indeed it is to be hoped that in the  year  or  more
    that has now passed since the making  of  this  application  for  entry
    clearance the Applicant will have  been  undertaking  English  language
    studies with a view to submitting a new application which will meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

14. If it were necessary to consider the Applicant's situation outside  the
    terms of the Immigration Rules then, as identified  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, the first four elements of the five stage test set  out
    by Lord Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 can be quickly dealt with. The
    Applicant shares a family life with the Sponsor and  their  child.  The
    refusal of entry clearance prevents the immediate continuation of  that
    family life so the consequences  of  the  decision  are  of  sufficient
    gravity to engage the Convention. The decision being in accordance with
    the Immigration Rules in made in pursuance of a legitimate aim. So  far
    as proportionality is concerned the  public  interest  in  meeting  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  must  be  balanced  against  the
    elements set out in paragraph 22 of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision. There are however two elements omitted from that balance. The
    first is the remediable nature of the failure to meet the  requirements
    of the rules. The effect of this is that there is  no  reason  why  the
    separation  caused  by  the  decision  needs  to  be  long  term.  This
    diminishes the weight to be given  to  the  positive  elements  in  the
    balance. The second is that with  my  decision  being  made  after  the
    implementation of section 117 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 the nature of the public interest as decided by parliament has
    to be given specific regard. In this respect positive weight  is  given
    by the fact that the Sponsor, although not earning sufficient  to  meet
    the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  does  appear  to   earn
    sufficient to support his family. The fact that the Appellant does  not
    speak English means that no  positive  weight  can  be  given  in  this
    regard.

15. The fact that the Appellant lives in Ethiopia with her British  citizen
    child does not in my judgement have  any  significant  bearing  on  the
    proportionality balance. There was no evidence before either the First-
    tier or the Upper Tribunal that the child is adversely affected in  any
    particular way. In general terms  it  is  usually  in  a  child's  best
    interest to reside with both parents but this is a very young child who
    has been in the day to day care  of  his  mother  the  Applicant  since
    birth. Children often live with only one parent for extended periods of
    time without adverse consequences. In this case the unification of  the
    family is delayed only by the failure of  the  Applicant  to  meet  two
    specific and remediable elements of the  Immigration  Rules.  Paragraph
    162 of MM (Lebanon) is a reminder that

        ... there is no legal requirement that the IRs should provide  that
        the best interests of the child should be determinative. Section 55
        is not a "trump card" to be played  whenever  the  interests  of  a
        child arise.

16. In my judgement taking all of these matters into account  the  decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer is not a  disproportionate  interference
    in the family life of the Applicant.  The prime reason for this is that
    the  Applicant  whilst  failing  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules has failed to demonstrate either that she will not be
    able to meet those requirements in a subsequent application or that her
    separation from her Sponsor until she meets those requirements has  any
    specific adverse consequences.

  Summary

17. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I set aside that decision.

18. I remake the decision by dismissing  the  Applicant's  appeal  both  by
    virtue of the Immigration Rules and  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention.
