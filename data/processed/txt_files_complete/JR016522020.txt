BEFORE Upper Tribunal Judge Keith

HAVING  considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  Ms  J  Sane,
instructed by Wilsons Solicitors LLP, for the applicants and Mr  J  Fraczyk,
instructed by GLD, for the respondent at a hearing on 10th August 2021

IT IS ORDERED THAT:

      1) The application for judicial review is granted, to the extent  that
         the respondent's decisions of 25th March 2020 and 11th  March  2021
         were a breach of Regulation 604/2013 (the Dublin  III  regulation),
         for the reasons set out in the attached judgment.   The  challenges
         to those decisions on grounds other than the Dublin III  regulation
         are refused, for the same reasons.



      2) There is a declaration that  the  respondent's  decisions  of  25th
         March  2020  and  11th  March  2021,  which  have  previously  been
         withdrawn,  were  unlawful.   Based  on  their  withdrawal,  it  is
         unnecessary to quash them.




      3) The application for judicial review of  the  respondent's  decision
         dated 11th June 2021 is refused, for the reasons  in  the  attached
         judgment.

Costs


      4) The respondent is ordered to pay the applicants'  reasonable  legal
         costs of their applications, up to 11th June 2021, the date of  the
         respondent's final Dublin III regulation decision, to be  assessed,
         if not agreed.  Costs incurred after that date are reserved.


Reasons

      5) I considered the authority of M v London Borough of Croydon  [2012]
         EWCA Civ 595, and the  general  principle  that  costs  follow  the
         event.  However, I also considered and note Ms  Sane's  submissions
         that:


        a.  The respondent agreed to reconsider her decision of 25th  March
           2020 and, after the applicants filed and served Amended  Grounds
           of Claim on 16th March 2021, ultimately withdrew  her  decisions
           of 25th March 2020 and 11th March 2021;


        b. The applicants have succeeded in  establishing,  after  a  fully
           contested hearing, that the respondent's decisions of 25th March
           2020 and 11th March 2021, were  in  breach  of  the  Dublin  III
           regulation.  Those challenges were not academic;


        c. The respondent's conduct  of  the  litigation  incurred  further
           costs.  This included non-compliance with the  Upper  Tribunal's
           directions, as set out in the judgment;  and  electing  only  to
           withdraw the first two decisions on the morning of  the  resumed
           substantive hearing on 21st May 2021.


      6) The applicants  have  succeeded  in  part  of  their  applications.
         Bearing this  and  the  factors  set  out  above  in  mind,  it  is
         appropriate to award the applicants their reasonable  legal  costs,
         up to 11th June 2021, to be assessed if  not  agreed.  Costs  after
         that date are reserved, pending final resolution of the applicants'
         applications for damages.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal


      7) The applicants' application dated 1st September 2021 for permission
         to appeal is refused.

Reasons

      8) The application for permission to appeal is based on five  grounds,
         which, in turn, are sub-divided.


      9) In relation to ground (1), the issue of contact  via  social  media
         was explored and adequately reasoned at ��85 to 87; and 96 to 98 of
         the judgment. The nature of the  evidence  (WhatsApp  contact)  was
         unarguably considered  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
         consider that the respondent's  decision  of  11th  June  2021  had
         referred to the absence  of  communication,  not  solely  telephone
         records.  The Upper Tribunal was further entitled to consider  that
         the same issue had been raised in the  previous  decision  of  11th
         March 2021; and was  in  the  context  of  AA  and  DA  having  re-
         established contact through social media (Facebook). The  existence
         of social media evidence (including WhatApp) was explored with  the
         representatives at the hearing, and was  in  the  context  of  both
         parties' duty of  candour.   The  Upper  Tribunal  also  unarguably
         analysed and explained at �97 why the applicants' explanations  for
         the lack of full disclosure were not adequate.

     10) Contrary to ground (2), the Upper Tribunal did not refer at �79  to
         the respondent having complied with her  investigative  duty.  This
         passage of the judgment supported the conclusion at  �83  that  the
         respondent's decision of 11th March 2021 was unlawful.


     11) In relation to ground (3),  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
         analyse  at  �103  the  presumption  of  AMA's  best  interests  in
         reunification with AA, based on the  theoretical  framework  as  it
         applied to the  facts  known  to  the  respondent.   There  was  no
         arguable inconsistency between that analysis and  the  analysis  of
         the March 2021 decision, which, at  �80,  the  Upper  Tribunal  had
         criticised for reversing the presumption of AMA's  best  interests.
         The Upper Tribunal was similarly entitled to consider, at �98,  the
         respondent's concerns about the report of Mr Horrocks and his views
         were unarguably and adequately considered. It was also  permissible
         to analyse, at �100, the history of past  separation  as  having  a
         bearing on the reliability of  AA's  assertions  about  his  future
         intention to play a more active role in AMA's life.


     12) In relation to ground (4), the criticism that  the  Upper  Tribunal
         failed to afford to weight to Mr  Horrocks's  report  is  a  simple
         disagreement with the Upper Tribunal's analysis and  findings.  The
         Upper  Tribunal's  analysis  of  the  "status  quo"  (the  physical
         separation of AA  and  AMA,  albeit  supplemented  by  visits)  was
         clearly explored at �104 and  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  unarguably
         entitled to consider factors such as financial support and DA's new
         partner as relevant.


     13) Contrary to ground (5), the Upper Tribunal was entitled to consider
         that the respondent had highlighted the issue  about  the  lack  of
         evidence of communications in her decisions of 11th March and  11th
         June 2021. In that context, the  Upper  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
         consider  that  upon  withdrawal  of  that  earlier  decision,  the
         applicants had had the opportunity to adduce any further  and  full
         disclosure about communications.   The  Upper  Tribunal  unarguably
         considered the procedure and process by which the  applicants  were
         aware of the respondent's  concerns;  whether  the  respondent  had
         investigated these concerns (at �109); and whether  the  applicants
         had had the opportunity to address those concerns.

Further directions


     14) The  applicants  shall  confirm  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
         respondent, by 4pm on 16th September 2021, whether they  intend  to
         continue to pursue the remedy of damages.  If they do, at the  same
         time, the applicants must apply to amend  the  grounds  to  provide
         full particulars of the  damages  sought  and  the  basis  of  such
         damages.


     15) Following the applicants' compliance  with  the  further  direction
         above, the Upper Tribunal shall consider  what  further  directions
         are necessary for  disposal  of  this  application,  including  any
         orders as to costs.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

Judge Keith:

Introduction

 1. Both representatives attended the hearing via Teams, while  I  attended
    the hearing, which was open to the public, at Field House.  The parties
    did not object to attending via Teams and  I  was  satisfied  that  the
    representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

The application

 2. The first applicant, AA, is a Somali national with  recognised  refugee
    status in South Africa.  He is the non-resident father  of  the  second
    applicant, AMA, a British national child born on 11th March 2012 in the
    UK to a naturalised British citizen mother of Somali ethnic origin, DA.
      AMA and DA live in the UK.  They have never cohabited with AA,  other
    than for very brief periods of a few weeks, twice  in  AMA's  life,  as
    discussed later in these reasons.   AA  was  originally  married  under
    Islamic law to DA in 2011, but their  marriage  ended  in  2019.   They
    remain on friendly terms and DA supports the application of AA and AMA.

 3. AA's most recent asylum claim was registered with  the  authorities  of
    Greece, where he currently resides, on 13th October  2017.   The  Greek
    authorities made the first "Take Charge Request" or "TCR" under Article
    17(2) of EU regulation 604/2013 (the Dublin  III  regulation)  on  22nd
    October 2018.  The respondent refused that request in a decision  dated
    25th January 2019.  That decision has not been  challenged  by  way  of
    judicial review.  On 14th February 2019, the  Greek  authorities  asked
    the respondent to re-examine her decision, which the respondent refused
    on 27th June 2019.  That decision has also not been challenged  by  way
    of judicial review.  The Greek authorities then made a further  request
    for reconsideration on 17th July 2019, which the respondent refused  on
    an unspecified date, although a copy of the decision was  forwarded  to
    the applicant's representatives by the Greek authorities on  4th  March
    2020.

 4. In the meantime, on 21st February 2020, the Greek  authorities  made  a
    second TCR, on the same basis as the first, but with further  evidence,
    which the respondent refused in her initial decision dated  25th  March
    2020.  The applicants applied on 25th June 2020 for judicial review  of
    that decision.

 5. Following an initial refusal of that application on the  papers  (Upper
    Tribunal Judge Keki?) on 28th July 2020, at an  oral  hearing  on  10th
    September 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Allen granted permission  for  the
    application to proceed on all grounds.  Following  that  decision,  the
    parties asked this Tribunal to  issue  a  consent  order,  whereby  the
    application for judicial review was stayed pending the outcome  of  the
    respondent's review of new evidence provided following the decision  of
    25th March 2020.  The consent order was dated 22nd  February  2021  and
    there were further directions which are referred to elsewhere in  these
    reasons.  Suffice it to say at this  stage,  the  respondent  issued  a
    further decision of 11th March 2021, which maintained  her  refusal  to
    accept responsibility for  AA's  asylum  claim.   The  second  decision
    considered further evidence, including that of  an  independent  social
    worker ("ISW") report of Peter Horrocks.  The applicants  continued  to
    challenge the original decision and the new decision in the same set of
    judicial review proceedings.

 6. At the beginning of  a  substantive  hearing  of  the  judicial  review
    application on 21st May 2021, Mr  Fraczyk  orally  confirmed  that  the
    respondent was withdrawing her decisions of 25th March  2020  and  11th
    March 2021.  The respondent then issued a final decision on  11th  June
    2021, maintaining her earlier refusal of the second TCR.

 7. The background to the second TCR is that AA has been granted asylum  in
    South Africa.  AA and DA started their relationship via Facebook, as DA
    lives in the UK.  She travelled to South Africa in or around June 2011;
    married AA on 25th June 2011; stayed with him in South  Africa,  during
    which time she fell pregnant; and returned to the UK on 23rd July 2011.
    DA explored the possibility of applying for entry clearance for AA, but
    the couple did not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    She visited him on two further occasions in  South  Africa,  again  for
    brief periods: a few months after AMA's birth in March 2012;  and  from
    late December 2014 to mid-February 2015, bringing AMA with her; and  on
    each occasion returning to the UK with AMA.  AA then left South  Africa
    in 2015, because of what he claims is racism and xenophobia towards the
     Somali minority community from those within the South African majority
    society.  He travelled to Somalia where he lived for a  further  period
    and then  made  his  way  to  Greece  in  2017,  from  where  he  seeks
    reunification, initially based on both marriage  and  parental  status,
    but now solely based on being AMA's  father,  in  the  context  of  his
    asylum claim.  The second TCR by  the  Greek  authorities  inaccurately
    states that AA has not previously applied for asylum  elsewhere,  which
    is plainly incorrect, as on his own account, he was granted  asylum  in
    South Africa.

 8. The gist of the respondent's refusals is  that  whilst  the  respondent
    does not dispute AAs' biological parentage of AMA, and she now accepts,
    in the third decision, that family relations exist between AA and  AMA,
    she does not accept the existence of family life between  the  two;  or
    that refusal of the TCR is disproportionate.  They have only physically
    met on two brief occasions, the last of which was more than five  years
    ago, and the initial separation of AA and DA was a  voluntary  one  and
    not in circumstances of any claimed fear of persecution.   Put  simply,
    AA and DA had entered into  a  long-distance  relationship,  which  has
    since ended.  The respondent also did not accept  the  analysis  of  Mr
    Horrocks and took issue with his assessment  of  the  claimed  familial
    relationships between AA and AMA, suggesting that  his  comments  about
    the  regularity  of  contact  was,  and  remains,  unsupported  by  the
    evidence, which the respondent assessed as sparse.

Previous orders

 9. When granting permission, Judge Allen had issued standard directions on
    10th September  2020,  including  the  service  by  the  respondent  of
    detailed grounds within 35 days of the order  and  full  disclosure  by
    both parties in relation  to  any  written  evidence  within  the  same
    timeframe.

10. The respondent failed to file detailed grounds of  defence  within  the
    relevant timeframe.  In  the  meantime,  on  16th  November  2020,  the
    applicants applied for an extension of time to file the ISW  report  of
    Mr Horrocks. That application  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Hanson on 4th January 2021.

11. On 22nd February  2021,  Upper  Tribunal  Lawyer  Hussain  issued  case
    management directions whereby if the respondent wished to  contest  the
    claim on additional grounds, she must  serve  the  applicants  and  the
    Upper Tribunal detailed grounds within 21 days.

12. The parties agreed the consent order dated 23rd  February  2021,  which
    stayed the proceedings, pending a review of the March 2020 decision, on
    receipt of further evidence.  The March 2020 decision was not, at  this
    stage, withdrawn.  The applicants were directed  to  inform  the  Upper
    Tribunal within two days of the outcome of a  review  decision  whether
    they intended to continue with their challenge and if they did, to file
    amended grounds of claim.  The respondent had seven days  from  receipt
    of those grounds to file amended summary grounds  in  response,  if  so
    instructed.

13. On 13th  May  2021,  following  applications  by  both  parties,  Upper
    Tribunal Lawyer Hussain indicated that the applicants'  application  to
    rely upon additional evidence in the form of witness statements  of  AA
    and DA; objective evidence regarding the risk to  Somali  nationals  in
    South Africa; and a supplementary ISW report of Peter Horrocks would be
    considered as a preliminary issue at the beginning of  the  substantive
    hearing on 21st May 2021.  Upper Tribunal Lawyer Hussain noted that the
    respondent objected to  the  application  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    disproportionate and might  risk  a  postponement  of  the  substantive
    hearing listed for  21st  May  2021.   Upper  Tribunal  Lawyer  Hussain
    indicated that the parties should prepare for the hearing on the  basis
    that the application to admit the additional evidence would be granted,
    although this was not to be treated as an expression of the  likelihood
    that it would.

14. The same directions confirmed  that  the  respondent  was  granted  her
    application for an extension of time to file and serve detailed grounds
    of defence by 11th May 2021, while the applicant was directed  to  file
    and serve a reply to the detailed grounds of defence by 17th May  2021.
    Finally, the respondent was directed  to  file  and  serve  a  skeleton
    argument on 19th May 2021.  She did so several hours late, albeit  with
    production on that day.

15. I adjourned the hearing on 21st May 2021 in light of  the  respondent's
    withdrawal of both her decisions and I issued  further  directions.   I
    noted Ms Sane's position (clearly stated) that the applicants  did  not
    regard their challenges to these withdrawn decisions as  academic,  not
    least because the applicants  were  seeking  damages,  both  under  the
    Dublin III regulation and in respect of  the   alleged  breach  of  the
    right to respect for their family and private life under Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR").  The respondent  then
    issued her June 2021 decision, following  which  the  applicants  filed
    amended grounds of application on 18th June  2021  and  the  respondent
    served amended detailed grounds of defence on 24th June 2021.   Further
    standard directions were then issued on 26th May 2021.

16. The applicants served their written skeleton argument in advance,  and,
    it appears, in accordance with directions that they be  filed  no  less
    than 14 days before the relisted hearing, i.e.,  not  later  than  27th
    July 2021.  In breach of  those  directions,  the  respondent  applied,
    after hours on 4th August  2021,  to  file  the  respondent's  skeleton
    argument.  That application was opposed and was one of two  preliminary
    applications that I dealt with at the start of the resumed hearing.

The hearing on 10th August 2021

17. I began  the  hearing  by  identifying  with  the  representatives  the
    documents that I was being asked to consider and the issues  that  they
    asked to be resolved today.

18. In terms of the documentation, there are two  bundles,  a  main  bundle
    containing the substantive documents, which I  will  refer  to  as  the
    applicants' bundle or "AB"; and  a  separate  authorities  bundle.   In
    addition to the  authorities  bundle,  Ms  Sane  sent  through  several
    authorities via email and there were also cost submissions sent through
    on the morning of the hearing.   In  terms  of  the  structure  of  the
    applicants' main bundle, regrettably it was not in date order  and  the
    numbering included a number of divider references, so for example there
    was a section AI followed by a number sequence and then a  separate  A2
    section followed by its own number sequence together with sections B to
    D.  The documents themselves were not in  chronological  order,  so  to
    some extent it was necessary to jump around between different parts  of
    the bundle.  I mention this to discourage the structure of such bundles
    in the future, which did not help in respect of ease of reference.

19. I also agreed with the representatives, following identification of the
    relevant  documents  and  having  to  deal  with  the  two  preliminary
    applications on the morning of the hearing,  which  took  at  least  an
    hour, that I would deal with only questions of liability at this stage,
    and any question of remedies and costs would need to be dealt with at a
    later hearing or in submissions.  Both  representatives  had  indicated
    that that is what they had anticipated following the earlier hearing on
    21st May 2021.  I turn now to the two preliminary applications.

The application to serve the respondent's skeleton argument

20. In  very  simple  terms,  the  application  had  been  made  late,  the
    application notice explaining that because of professional commitments,
    the respondent's Counsel  had  been  unable  to  prepare  the  skeleton
    argument on time.  Mr Fraczyk urged me to consider that where, as here,
    he had had substantial involvement in the defence  of  the  application
    for an extended period it would not have been appropriate  to  instruct
    alternative Counsel.   Whilst  the  respondent  did  not  belittle  the
    importance of compliance with  Tribunal  directions,  nevertheless  the
    applicants had not been prejudiced as a result.

21. In response, Ms Sane referred to the well-known authority of  Denton  &
    Ors v TH White Ltd & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 906 and the three  factors  in
    that decision.  In particular, the delay  was  not  insignificant;  the
    explanation  for  the  delay  was  wholly  unsatisfactory  and  in   an
    evaluation of all the circumstances of the case, the application should
    be refused.  Instead,  the  respondent's  oral  submissions  should  be
    limited to those set out in the amended detailed grounds of defence.

22. I concluded  that  it  was  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  the
    overriding objective to allow the application to admit the respondent's
    skeleton argument.  On the one hand, I was conscious that the delay was
    significant, and I concluded  that  the  explanation  for  it  was  not
    satisfactory.   On  the  third  limb,  however,  considering  all   the
    circumstances of the case, Ms Sane accepted that while her  preparation
    had been condensed into a shorter window than she would otherwise  have
    had, she had been able to prepare  adequately  for  the  hearing.   The
    prejudice to the applicant was therefore limited.  Also,  the  skeleton
    argument would assist me in what was a complex case.   Without  in  any
    way minimising the importance of compliance with  Tribunal  directions,
    as per R (Spahiu) v SSHD EWCA Civ 2604, I granted  the  application  to
    extend time to admit the respondent's skeleton argument.

The applicants' application to adduce the additional evidence

23. As referred to earlier in these reasons, the applicants sought to  rely
    upon several additional documents which had post-dated the  11th  March
    2021 decision.  In view of a third decision having been  made  on  11th
    June 2021, which had considered much (but not all) of  this  additional
    documentation, Mr Fraczyk accepted that  it  was  appropriate  for  the
    additional documents to be admitted, with one exception.  The exception
    related to the media reports, copies of which were at pages  AI[10]  to
    AI[23] AB, which were said to relate to  the  applicant's  flight  from
    South Africa because of his  claimed  fear  of  persecution,  following
    xenophobic attacks on the Somali community  within  South  Africa.   Ms
    Sane urged me to consider the documents in  light  of  the  factor,  on
    which the respondent had placed weight, that the separation between  AA
    and DA had not been voluntary.

24. For his part, Mr Fraczyk, in the context of an hour already having been
    spent on preliminary issues, indicated that he would leave  it  in  the
    Tribunal's hands, suffice it to say that it  was  not  appropriate  for
    this Tribunal to make any finding as to why the applicant had  in  fact
    fled South Africa.

25. In the context where the media articles had been adduced  and  referred
    to as exhibits to an updated witness statement which had been admitted,
    and where, as here, the respondent had taken issue with  the  voluntary
    nature of separation between AA and DA, I regarded it as appropriate to
    admit the evidence, but in doing so, made it  clear  that  it  was  not
    necessary for me to make any finding as to the reason why the applicant
    had left South Africa, bearing in mind this was not a statutory  appeal
    of a protection claim.

The substantive issues

The applicants' application for judicial review

26. I turn next to the amended grounds, a copy of which is at pages  A2[10]
    to A 2 [61] AB.  Given the length of the grounds, I  do  no  more  than
    summarise them, but I have considered them in full.  The  grounds  have
    multiple sub-grounds, which substantially overlap.

27. The applicants continue to challenge all  three  respondent  decisions,
    including the two earlier (now withdrawn) decisions of 25th March  2020
    and 11th March 2021 and the final decision  of  11th  June  2021.   The
    respondent's initial refusal to accept the  second  TCR  under  Article
    17(2) of the Dublin III regulation is said to be unlawful  because  the
    only permissible exercise of discretion in accordance with  AMA's  best
    interests as a child and that of the family as a whole  was  to  accept
    the TCR, in accordance with R (HA & Ors) v SSHD (Dublin III; Articles 9
    and 17.2) [2018] UKUT 00297 at �32.

28. The decision was also said to breach the respondent's obligations under
    Article 8 ECHR, Articles 7 and 24 of  the  EU  Charter  of  Fundamental
    Rights ("CFR"); and the reasons given for refusal  failed  to  consider
    properly the evidence of  clear  and  compelling  humanitarian  grounds
    based on prolonged and involuntary separation of a father and his young
    vulnerable child with whom he shares a family life and close bond.  The
    second decision of 11th March 2021 was similarly flawed.

29. Moreover, the Dublin III regulation does not permit the withdrawal of a
    TCR decision and as far as the applicants are aware, the respondent has
    not notified the Greek authorities of her withdrawal of the  first  two
    decisions.  Instead, the TCR decisions could be  reversed  through  the
    exercise of a remedy or an  inter-state  conciliation  mechanism  under
    Dublin III.  The appropriate way forward  was  for  the  respondent  to
    reverse her decision and notify the Greek authorities.  The  applicants
    have a right to an effective remedy regardless of the withdrawal of the
    earlier decisions - see MS v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1340.  An  individual
    asylum seeker has a right to enforce correct application of the  Dublin
    III regulation, not being dependent upon a member state's discretion to
    withdraw or reconsider a previous refusal.

30. Without prejudice to that contention, the final decision of  11th  June
    2021 fails to consider the humanitarian grounds, that the  only  lawful
    decision based on the further ISW report was for the second TCR  to  be
    accepted.  In particular, the respondent  had  misdirected  herself  by
    requiring evidence of "dependency"  which  was  not  required  for  the
    purposes of establishing family life between parents and their natural-
    born children born out of a lawful marital union (see Sen v Netherlands
    [2003] 36 EHRR 7) and she failed to have regard for the  potential  for
    full-blown family life (see Ahmadi v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ  1721).   The
    respondent failed to carry  out  a  lawful  assessment  of  AMA's  best
    interests, including  failing  to  comply  with  the  respondent's  own
    guidance on conducting best interest assessments.  In  particular,  the
    guidance suggested that reunification would be in AMA's best  interests
    unless  there  were  contra-indicating  factors  relating   to   safety
    concerns.  The guidance had not been considered or applied.

31. In terms of the  factual  context,  and  without  rehearsing  the  full
    factual circumstances, which I set out in more detail in the  findings,
    the applicants referred to an NHS medical assessment of  2018  relating
    to AMA, which confirmed his autism, and a social worker report from the
    Danish  Refugee  Council.    Whilst   the   first   TCR   refusal   and
    reconsideration decision had never been challenged, the respondent  had
    had documents said to support a consistent theme of AMA's vulnerability
    at an early stage.  The DRC social worker report had  recommended  that
    it was in the best interests of AMA to be reunited with AA.

32. In the second TCR of  21st  February  2020,  the  Greek  "Dublin"  unit
    referred to AMA's autism and the strong emotional connection between AA
    and AMA.  The Greek authorities also referred to the witness statements
    of AA and DA setting out  the  history  of  their  relationship;  their
    decision to divorce but the continuing relationship between father  and
    son.  They urged the respondent to consider this  evidence.   This  was
    supplemented by written representations by the  applicants'  solicitors
    on 6th March 2020.  The applicants' grounds  reiterated the  detail  of
    the strength of the relationship between AA and AMA based on the ISW of
    Peter Horrocks, who concluded that it was very strongly in  AMA's  best
    interests be reunited with AA (see �49 at page  A2  [26]  AB).   Having
    recited at length the immigration history, which I have only touched on
    briefly, the applicants' grounds recite the law  and  the  respondent's
    guidance to caseworkers, version 2.0,  published  on  18th  April  2019
    (pages C [73] to [118] AB).  The guidance recognised, at internal pages
    [39] to [40], that the re-establishment of family links would  normally
    be regarded in the best interests of  a  child,  save  where  a  family
    member posed a serious risk to that child.  Having  recited  at  length
    various case law, finally at page A2  [42]  AB,  the  first  ground  is
    identified and broken down into five  numbered  parts  with  additional
    parts that follow.

33. The first overarching ground is that the respondent's processing of the
    second TCR and refusal to accept responsibility was unlawful, being  in
    breach of EU law, common law and Article 8 ECHR.  First, the second TCR
    fell to be accepted and not rejected in view of the  applicants'  right
    to respect for family life and AMA's best interests.

34. Second, the respondent had failed to give any proper  consideration  to
    family life or the proportionality of maintaining their separation.  It
    was clear that there was no question on  the  facts  that  AA  and  AMA
    shared family life.  The refusal plainly interfered with their right to
    respect for family life and the respondent had offered no justification
    for that interference.

35. Third, in rejecting the second TCR,  the  respondent  had  demonstrably
    failed to consider clear and compelling humanitarian grounds  based  on
    family  and  cultural   considerations   including   AMA's   particular
    vulnerability; the strength of the ties between AA and  AMA;  the  fact
    that ongoing separation was causing distress;  AA's  unsuitable  living
    conditions in Greece; and the refugee protection  claim,  with  related
    reasons for the family's involuntary  separation  and  the  absence  of
    alternative and appropriate options for  family  reunification  outside
    the UK, as explained by the DRC social worker.

36. Fourth, the respondent had failed to comply  with  the  requirement  to
    assess and treat the best interests of AMA as a primary  consideration.
    The respondent's conclusion that it was not in AMA's best  interest  to
    be reunited was unreasonable  and  irrational.   The  claimed  lack  of
    evidence that AA was emotionally involved  in  AMA's  upbringing  since
    2012 or financially supported him was flawed because the starting point
    was that it was in the best interests of  AMA  to  be  raised  by  both
    parents regardless of whether DA was his primary caregiver up till now.
      The  applicants  reiterated  the  respondent's  own  policy  on   re-
    establishment of family links.  The respondent failed  to  give  proper
    reasons  why  AMA's  best  interests  in  family   reunification   were
    outweighed  by  the  facts  in  this  case  in  the  absence   of   any
    countervailing risk factors to his safety or welfare.

37. Fifth, the respondent had investigatory obligations  under  the  Dublin
    III regulation  and  to  act  fairly  in  accordance  with  common  law
    obligations by investigating claimed family  relationships  and  giving
    the applicants the opportunity to address any credibility concerns.  If
    the respondent  had  been  minded  to  reject  the  Greek  authorities'
    assessment, then fairness required that they be told  of  the  concerns
    with sufficient time to respond.  It was unclear why no such steps  had
    been taken by the respondent and any further reasons set  out  in  pre-
    action protocol correspondence did not satisfy  the  requirement  under
    the Dublin III regulation.

38. In relation to the second ground, the applicants asserted that  the  UK
    is  the  responsible  member  for  AA's  asylum  claim  and  that   the
    applicants' fundamental rights have been breached.  The basis for  that
    submission overlaps substantially with the  first  ground,  reiterating
    that the only decision consistent with Article 17(2) of the Dublin  III
    regulation is to  exercise  discretion,  particularly  where  the  ECHR
    guidance is that family life is generally  found  to  exist  between  a
    father and his child born within a lawful marital union.  The fact that
    the applicants had provided limited documentation did not meet the high
    threshold of "exceptional circumstances", so as to justify  refusal  of
    the second TCR.  In any event, the respondent had failed to engage with
    evidence substantiating the exceptionally strong ties  between  AA  and
    AMA.

39. The respondent had failed to demonstrate  that  interference  with  the
    applicants'  rights  was  necessary  or  proportionate  and  that   was
    something which the Upper  Tribunal  itself  must  assess,  considering
    evidence, even that which was not before the decision-maker.  In  terms
    of relevant factors for a proportionality exercise, there was the  fact
    that reunification in the UK was  the  only  realistic  and  reasonable
    prospect for family reunification as the family could not be reasonably
    expected to reunify in Greece where AA had no stable home or  means  of
    survival and DA could not be expected to leave the  UK  where  she  had
    citizenship and another adult child with whom she cohabited.  The  long
    separation of AA and AMA was also relevant.

40. The third ground was that the decision of 11th March 2021 was  unlawful
    based on five subcategories.  The  first  was  that  the  decision  was
    silent on the criteria in relation to Article 17(2) of Dublin  III  and
    conflated  the  requirement  of  parental  relationship   with   family
    relations, with only the latter being  required  under  Article  17(2).
    The decision had ignored the evidence before the respondent.

41. Second, the respondent had advanced new  arguments  for  rejecting  the
    claim under Article 8 ECHR, saying that  no  family  life  had  existed
    because there was no parental relationship.   This  ignored  the  legal
    presumption of family life and regard for  a  potential  future  family
    life to be developed.

42. Third, the respondent had provided inadequate reasons on  the  evidence
    for  concluding  that  the  applicants  did  not  share  family   life,
    impermissibly attaching only limited weight  to  the  report  of  Peter
    Horrocks, an acknowledged expert whose reports have been relied upon in
    several Tribunal cases.  Moreover, any concerns that the respondent had
    had about untranslated documents were ones which the respondent  should
    have raised to be able to  allow  the  applicants  the  opportunity  to
    respond.  Reliance on the  lack  of  visits  between  AMA  and  AA  was
    unreasonable, bearing in mind the evidence of why travel to Greece  was
    not possible.  An assertion that there  was  no  evidence  ignored  the
    ample evidence  that  had  been  provided  since  the  first  TCR.  Any
    consideration that AA and DA were now separated and that AMA would  not
    live with  AA  was  an  irrelevant  consideration.   The  grounds  then
    reiterated  the  respondent's  failure  to  conduct  a  best  interests
    assessment and the contra-indications as to what might otherwise be  in
    the best interests of AMA to be reunited with his father.

43. Fifth, it was unreasonable or irrational for the respondent to conclude
    that reunification was not in AMA's best interests, on the  basis  that
    there were no facts suggesting continuing contact would  be  impossible
    or extremely difficult.  The decision ignored  the  evidence  including
    the witness statements and the ISW reports that ongoing separation  and
    a lack of  physical  contact  constituted  significant  limitations  to
    developing a normal relationship.  This was  evidence  with  which  the
    respondent had simply failed to engage.

44. The fourth ground related to the decision of 11th June 2021, which  the
    applicants assert was also  unlawful.   The  respondent  had  erred  in
    importing a requirement of a relationship of dependency and had  failed
    to identify any exceptional circumstances  capable  of  displacing  the
    presumption that the bond between AA and AMA amounted to a family life.
     In addition, the respondent had failed to consider  the  existence  of
    humanitarian grounds, based  on  family  and  cultural  considerations,
    assessed through the prism  of  best  interests.   The  respondent  had
    further erred in requiring too high a standard of burden of  proof  and
    misunderstanding  the  evidence  in  relation  to  AMA's  autism.   The
    respondent had repeated the same errors as in the previous decision.

The respondent's amended detailed grounds of defence

45. The respondent  asserted  that  many  of  the  grounds  of  application
    duplicated one another.

46. Next, any challenge to the withdrawn decisions was academic.  There was
    no authority to support the assertion that refusal of a TCR  under  the
    Dublin III regulation could not be withdrawn.  To the extent  that  the
    challenge remained in relation to an alleged historic breach of Article
    8 ECHR, the provision was not engaged or  infringed.   Moreover,  AMA's
    best interests were accommodated by the fact that he had lived with and
    been cared for by his mother, DA, since his birth in the  UK  in  2012.
    To the extent that any unlawfulness arose, it was  incidental  and  did
    not give rise to an Article 8 ECHR right being engaged or infringed.

47. In respect of Article 17(2) of the Dublin III regulation, the withdrawn
    decisions  had  not  been  silent  as  to  whether  Article  17(2)  was
    satisfied.  The respondent was mindful that she had a broad  discretion
    to accept a TCR, and even though that discretion was not  untrammelled,
    it was a wide one.

48. In relation to the Article 8 ECHR claim, it was unsurprising  that  the
    respondent had included an Article 8 analysis in the  11th  March  2021
    decision.  This was in the context of an analysis  of  family  life  as
    distinct from the broader concept of family relations.

49. Article 17(2) is a subsidiary category of protection at the  bottom  of
    the hierarchy of protection under the Dublin III  regulation.   It  was
    possible for the respondent  to  consider  an  application  made  under
    Article 17(2) through the lens of Article 8 ECHR (see R (HA  &  Ors)  v
    SSHD [2018] UKUT 297.  To the extent that there was an allegation  that
    the respondent had failed to consider family relations, that was in any
    event incorrect as the respondent had expressly accepted that there may
    be some  degree  of  emotional  ties  but  there  were  no  compelling,
    compassionate or exceptional circumstances.

50. In respect of the assertion that the respondent had failed  to  provide
    adequate reasons, the respondent relied upon six reasons:

    50.1.    The applicants had failed to provide the respondent with  full
         disclosure of readily available documents from the outset,  without
         an explanation and in circumstances  where  they  could  have  been
         provided.  This included not only  translations  of  communications
         but also an ISW report which was only later  provided.   There  had
         not been a full disclosure of the applicants' social media accounts
         and instead limited reliance upon a small selection of  photographs
         and messages.

    50.2.    The ISW report of Mr Horrocks did not outline  in  any  detail
         the overall  length  or  pattern  of  any  purported  frequency  of
         contact.

    50.3.    The respondent's duty of investigation could not  be  used  to
         cover clear and obvious shortcomings in the applicants'  disclosure
         and it was not for the respondent to assume general  responsibility
         for the translation of documents (noting �164 of  R  (BAA)  v  SSHD
         [2020]).

    50.4.    The factor about the failure by DA and  AMA  to  visit  AA  in
         Greece was not determinative of the respondent's decision  and  was
         merely one of several factors which the respondent had considered.

    50.5.    The applicants' reference to the respondent  stating,  in  her
         11th March 2021 decision, that "no evidence had been  submitted  of
         contact over the last eight years" was not accurate.  Instead,  the
         respondent had referred at �18 (page AI  136  AB)  to  no  evidence
         having been submitted that AA had taken reasonable steps and made a
         visa application for reunification during  the  eight-year  period.
         That was plainly a factor  that  the  respondent  was  entitled  to
         consider.

    50.6.    The reason for, and fact of, the separation of AA and DA was a
         permissible factor to consider, material  to  the  existence  of  a
         parental relationship and the overall humanitarian circumstances.

51. Next, the respondent  denied  that  any  illegality  had  arisen.   The
    respondent had not misdirected herself in law in respect of dependency.
     The June 2021 decision had acknowledged that a TCR  could  be  granted
    even where Article 8 ECHR was not engaged.  The argument regarding  the
    presumption of a parental relationship ignored the fact  that  the  TCR
    was pursuant to Article 17(2), rather than under  other  provisions  of
    the  Dublin  III  regulation.   The  respondent  had  not  ignored  the
    potential of development of family life but had reached the conclusion,
    considering the voluntary nature of separation  that  had  endured  for
    many years.

52. In addition, the respondent's conclusion on  humanitarian  grounds  was
    not flawed.  She had not tethered herself to the concept of a  parental
    relationship or  a  particular  level  of  financial  support  and  her
    findings in respect of contact were appropriate based on  the  material
    before her.  The respondent's conclusion on  voluntary  separation  was
    similarly open to her to reach and the respondent had not relied upon a
    misconceived analysis in relation to autism.  She  had  assessed  AMA's
    best interests as including factors ranging beyond AMA's autism.

53. The respondent's assessment of AMA's best  interests  was  not  flawed.
    The applicants had invoked Article 8 ECHR in  circumstances  where  the
    starting point was in fact an Article 17(2) application  and  in  which
    there is no parental relationship.  The respondent  had  considered  Mr
    Horrocks' reports and assertions in  respect  of  the  effect  on  AMA,
    noting the likelihood of financial support and  an  analysis  of  AMA's
    care needs.

54. In addition to the  amended  grounds  supporting  the  application  for
    judicial review and the detailed grounds of defence, I also  considered
    both parties'  written skeleton  arguments,  together  with  additional
    oral submissions.  Rather than recite those submissions in full,  which
    are lengthy and significantly overlap with one another, I instead refer
    to the submissions and my resolution of them as I deal with the  issues
    in turn.  In dealing with the issues in turn, because there are so many
    grounds and  sub-grounds  within  each  of  the  headings,  instead  of
    adopting the ground numbers identified in the pleadings, I set out  the
    broad category of issues; my discussion of the relevant law; and  their
    application to each of the three impugned decisions.

Whether challenges to the first two decisions are now academic

55. On the one hand, Ms Sane rejected the assertion that the challenges  to
    the first two decisions were now academic, because they were withdrawn,
    on two bases.  The first was that this  would  deny  the  applicants  a
    remedy under Article 27 of the Dublin III regulation, which states:

         "Article 27

         Remedies

         1.   The applicant ... shall have a right to an  effective  remedy,
             in the form of an appeal or a review,  in  fact  and  in  law,
             against a transfer decision, before a court or Tribunal.

         2.   Member states shall provide for a reasonable  period  of  time
             within which the person concerned  may  exercise  his  or  her
             right to an effective remedy pursuant to paragraph 1."

56. Ms Sane argued that even if at common law, on  public  law  principles,
    the respondent might seek to withdraw decisions, this could not operate
    at the level of EU law and there was  no  mechanism  for  depriving  an
    applicant of their rights to  such  remedy.   However,  as  Mr  Fraczyk
    pointed  out,  by  virtue  of  regulation  9(5)  of  the   Immigration,
    Nationality and Asylum (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, where the request by
    the applicants was made to the UK before the "commencement  day"  under
    those regulations, (30th December 2020) but a final  decision  was  not
    taken before commencement day, the saving provisions  were  limited  to
    certain Articles of the Dublin III regulation, namely Articles 2; 6; 22
    and 25, but not the remedy provisions under  Article  27.   Mr  Fraczyk
    argued that while Article 27 continued to apply to the  first  decision
    of 25th March 2020, it did not apply to the March 2021 decision.

57. However, the effect of the Exit Regulations is not an issue that I need
    to resolve in determining liability, particularly where I have not  had
    detailed  submissions  on  the  effect  of  the  Exit  Regulations   in
    circumstances where the party who  is  alleged  to  have  breached  the
    Dublin III regulation, has withdrawn her impugned decisions  and  would
    thereby benefit from the revocation of Article 27.  It  is  unnecessary
    for me to resolve it at this stage because, as already  made  clear  in
    the grounds, the challenge is not only in the context of the Dublin III
    regulation, but also Article 8  ECHR.   Ms  Sane  had  made  clear  the
    reservation of the applicants' position at  the  hearing  on  21st  May
    2021, when the respondent sought to withdraw the first  two  decisions,
    that nevertheless she would be seeking damages in respect  of  breaches
    for each of these three decisions.  For the reason that the  applicants
    seek damages for breach of their article  8  ECHR  rights,  that  alone
    rebuts the argument that the challenge to the decisions is academic.  I
    am fortified in that conclusion by the fact that whilst withdrawing the
    impugned two earlier decisions, the respondent has never accepted  that
    they were unlawful, in breach of the  Dublin  III  regulation,  or  the
    applicants' rights under Article 8 ECHR.  Indeed, in her defence of the
    applications, the respondent continues to maintain  the  lawfulness  of
    those decisions.

Lawfulness of the decision of 25th March 2020

58. I refer to an excerpt of the request of 21st February 2020 at  page  AI
    [254] AB, which states:

         "The applicant had previously  applied  to  be  reunited  with  the
         mother of his son, [DA].  A Take Charge  Request  was  sent  on  22
         October 2018, which was rejected by your authorities.  However,  as
         you will  notice  in  the  attached  statements,  the  relationship
         between the applicant and his former wife  has  changed  whilst  he
         maintains  a  strong  emotional  connection  as  well  as  a  daily
         communication with his son.  Moreover the son of the  applicant  is
         suffering from autism.

         According to Article 17.2 of the Dublin III regulation, the  member
         state in which an application for international protection is  made
         ... may at any time request another member state to take charge."

59. The request refers to having  sent  the  respondent  all  the  relevant
    documents, the explanatory statements of AA, his  attorney  in  Greece;
    and DA; proof of the constant communications of the  AA  with  AMA,  as
    well as the written consent of both parties.  Ms  Sane  confirmed  that
    amongst the documents which had been enclosed with the second TCR  were
    the following:

    59.1.    Written consent forms;

    59.2.    copies of AA and DA's marriage  certificate  and  AMA's  birth
         certificate;

    59.3.    photographs of AMA and DA visiting AA in South Africa in  2012
         and 2014;

    59.4.    a best interests  assessment  report  by  the  Danish  Refugee
         Council dated 9th October 2018, a copy of which was at page B [125]
         to [126] AB, describing the family  life  between  the  applicants,
         their ongoing contact and the fact that AA seemed to be  a  capable
         and caring father; the difficulties encountered by  DA  in  raising
         AMA  as  a  single  parent  and  concluding  that  it  was  "highly
         recommended that it is in the best interests of [AMA] in the UK  to
         be with his father and reunited as a family";

    59.5.    an excerpt of  an  NHS  medical  assessment  confirming  AMA's
         diagnosis of autism, dated 9th April 2018 at pages B [127] to [129]
         AB;

    59.6.     screenshots  of  WhatsApp  and  video  calls,   showing   the
         applicants had been in regular contact since AA's arrival in Greece
         in 2017 (pages B [59] to [75] and B [107] to [112] AB);

    59.7.    a legal note  from  the  Danish  Refugee  Council  dated  12th
         February 2019 at page  B  [93]  AB  addressing  AA's  situation  in
         Greece; and

    59.8.    finally, a witness statement from AA dated 15th July 2019 at B
         [82] AB.

60. Moreover,  the  applicants  assert  that  the  Greek  authorities  also
    enclosed with the second TCR a second witness statement of AA dated 4th
    November 2019 addressing his family life  with  AMA;  and  their  daily
    communication and his strong wish to  be  reunited  with  AA;  and  the
    involuntary nature of their separation; as well as a witness  statement
    from DA dated  11th  December  2019  describing  a  close  relationship
    between  AA  and  AMA  and  the  ongoing  separation  between  the  two
    negatively impacting on AMA and causing him distress.

61. In response, the TCR decision of 25th March 2020, at pages  B  [51]  to
    [52] AB stated as follows:

         "In  responding  to  your  request,  the  UK  has  considered   the
         following:"

62. It  referred  briefly  to  a  list  of  bullet  points  which  included
    documentation and evidence referred to and then stated:

         "(   We have noted that AA and DA have now separated and  AA  wants
             to be reunited with his son AMA.

         (    DA is now in a new relationship.

         (    AMA has been under the sole care of his mother  DA  since  she
             gave birth to him in the UK, apart from one trip or  visit  to
             AMA  in  South  Africa  in  December  2015  to  February  2015
             [presumably the first reference to 2015 should be 2014].

         (    Taking into account the  best  interests  of  AMA,  he  has  a
             parent/guardian in the UK, who has been supporting and meeting
             the child's needs since birth, there are [sic] no  information
             or  evidence  to  show  that  the   applicant   was   involved
             emotionally or financially in  the  upbringing  of  the  child
             since 2012.  We do not find that  there  is  justification  to
             apply discretion in the applicant's favour."

63. The above citation is not an extract, but comprises the entirety of the
    respondent's analysis and reasoning in refusing the second TCR, in  the
    March  2020  decision.   Mr  Fraczyk  did  not  make  any   substantive
    additional submissions other than to assert  that  the  respondent  had
    been entitled to reach the decision she had.

The Law

64. Article 17(2) of the Dublin III regulation states:

    "2.     The Member State in  which  an  application  for  international
    protection is made and which is carrying out the process of determining
    the Member State responsible, or the Member State responsible, may,  at
    any time before a first decision  regarding  the  substance  is  taken,
    request another Member State to take charge of an applicant in order to
    bring together any family relations, on humanitarian grounds  based  in
    particular on family or cultural considerations, even where that  other
    Member State is  not  responsible  under  the  criteria  laid  down  in
    Articles 8 to 11 and 16.  The  persons  concerned  must  express  their
    consent in writing."

65. I also bear in mind the reported Upper Tribunal decision of  R  (BAA  &
    Or) v SSHD (Dublin III: judicial  review;  SoS's  duties)  [2020]  UKUT
    00227 (IAC),  and  the  headnotes  in  that  case,  which  include  the
    following:

    "(1) Article 17(2) of Regulation 604/2013 of  the  European  Parliament
    and of the Council ("Dublin III") confers  a  discretion  on  a  Member
    State to examine an application for international protection "in  order
    to bring together any family relations, on humanitarian grounds,  based
    on family or cultural considerations". Although the discretion is wide,
    it is not untrammelled: R (HA & others) (Dublin  III;  Articles  9  and
    17.2) [2018] UKUT 297 (IAC). As in the case of any other  discretionary
    power of the Secretary of State in the immigration field, Article 17(2)
    must be exercised in an individual's  favour,  where  to  do  otherwise
    would breach the individual's human rights  (or  those  of  some  other
    person), contrary to section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

    (2) The Secretary of State's Article 17(2) decisions are susceptible to
    "ordinary" or "conventional" judicial review principles,  of  the  kind
    described by Beatson LJ in ZT (Syria) v  SSHD  [2016]  1  WLR  4894  as
    "propriety of purpose, relevancy of  considerations  and  the  longstop
    Wednesbury unreasonableness category" (para 85).

    (3) Where  a  judicial  review  challenge  involves  an  allegation  of
    violation of an ECHR right, such as Article 8, it is now an established
    principle of domestic United Kingdom law that  the  court  or  tribunal
    must make its own assessment of the  lawfulness  of  the  decision,  in
    human rights terms. If, in order to make that assessment, the court  or
    tribunal needs to make findings of fact, it must do so.

    (4) Nothing in paragraphs (1) to (3) above is dependent upon Article 27
    (remedies)  of  Dublin  III  applying  to  the  facts  of   the   case.
    Nevertheless, what the Upper Tribunal held in R (MS) (Dublin III;  duty
    to investigate) [2019] UKUT 9 (IAC) regarding the scope of  Article  27
    is correct and nothing in the Court of Appeal judgments  in  MS  [2019]
    EWCA  Civ  1340  suggests  otherwise.  The  reference  to  a  "transfer
    decision" in Article 27 encompasses a  refusal  to  take  charge  of  a
    Dublin III applicant. That includes a  refusal  to  take  charge  under
    Article 17(2).

    (5) It would be remarkable if the Secretary  of  State's  investigatory
    responsibilities were materially narrower  in  an  Article  17(2)  case
    which concerns an unaccompanied minor and his or  her  best  interests,
    than they would be in respect of any other  take-charge  request  under
    Dublin III. Where the request under Article 17(2)  raises  issues  that
    involve an asserted family life within Article 8 ECHR/Article 7 of  the
    Charter of Fundamental Rights, then, in the normal  course  of  events,
    the Secretary of State's degree of engagement with the relevant  United
    Kingdom local authority should be no less than in the case of any other
    unaccompanied minor,  where  the  take-charge  request  is  made  under
    Article 8 of Dublin III on the basis that the relation  in  the  United
    Kingdom is a sibling or a "family member" or "relative" as defined."

Discussion and conclusion on 25th March 2020 decision

66. I conclude that the March 2020 decision did not engage first  with  the
    applicants' primary assertion that family life, a subset within  family
    relations,  existed  between  AA  and  AMA,  despite  their   lack   of
    cohabitation and any financial support by AA.  Similarly, the  decision
    was not correct when it said that there was no information or  evidence
    to show that AA was involved in AMA's upbringing since  2012.   At  the
    very least, there was evidence  before  the  respondent  which  it  was
    incumbent upon her to assess as to the nature  of  the  claimed  family
    relationship between the two.  It is not uncommon for there to be  such
    family relations, notwithstanding substantial distances between a child
    and their parent, for many years, and indeed, by way of  example,  that
    is not a situation unfamiliar to Judges of the Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber in the context of  applications  under  Paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

67. The reference to "no evidence" in the decision was illustrative, in  my
    view, of the respondent's failure, first to consider  the  question  of
    whether there were family relations for the purposes of  Article  17(2)
    of the Dublin III regulation; and second, to assess properly the  claim
    of family life and the extent to  which  the  refusal  would  otherwise
    engage Article 8 ECHR and would be a  disproportionate  breach  of  any
    right to respect to family life.  It is unnecessary for me to refer  to
    the extensive case law, including the presumption of family  life  said
    to exist between a parent and child in the context of a marriage where,
    as here, the respondent plainly failed to engage with the evidence that
    was before her.

68. I therefore declare that the respondent's decision of 25th  March  2020
    was not in compliance  with  the  respondent's  obligations  under  the
    Dublin III regulation.  In that respect, the decision was not lawful.

69. I come on to the question of whether the decision was in breach of  the
    applicants' rights to respect for their family  life  under  Article  8
    ECHR in my discussion and conclusions in respect of the final  decision
    of 11th June 2021.

The decision of 11th March 2021

70. By the stage of her decision on 11th March  2021,  the  respondent  had
    Peter Horrocks' first ISW report.  In his report, as referred to in  Ms
    Sane's skeleton argument, Mr Horrocks referred to the applicants having
    developed as close and meaningful a relationship as could  be  expected
    by phone and video link, and were in almost daily contact  (see  ��4.12
    and 4.24 of the report). Mr Horrocks said that AA had developed a  very
    high level of commitment to the best interests of his son (�4.22).  AMA
    had formally been diagnosed with autism and was a vulnerable child, who
    would face challenges in all aspects of his functioning and was at risk
    of experiencing harm in his education, social and emotional development
    because of his disability.  His vulnerability  was  compounded  by  the
    absence of AA, who was committed to supporting him (see ��4.13 and 4.16
    of the report).

71. Peter Horrocks's view was that AMA's emotional  needs  and  development
    were adversely affected by the ongoing separation from AA; and that  DA
    was struggling to support AMA's needs in the UK and that AA's  presence
    in the UK would enable him to play a more active role  in  AMA's  life.
    Mr Horrocks concluded with a very strong recommendation, at section  4,
    that it would be in the best interests of AMA to be  reunited  with  AA
    and that there was a significant risk that continued  separation  would
    inhibit further development of their relationship.

72. In contrast to the March 2020 decision, the March  2021  decision  both
    acknowledges Mr Horrocks's report and focusses on Article 8  ECHR,  and
    in particular, the question of whether family life existed  between  AA
    and AMA.  On the one hand,  Ms  Sane  argued  that  in  doing  so,  the
    decision impermissibly narrowed the focus on the  existence  of  family
    life, rather than the  wider  question  of  family  relations  for  the
    purposes of Article 17(2) of the Dublin III regulation.   In  response,
    Mr Fraczyk says that the respondent can hardly be criticised for  doing
    so in circumstances where the central thrust of the claim is based on a
    claimed parental relationship and that the authority of BAA informs  us
    that it is permissible to consider responsibility under the Dublin  III
    regulation through the lens of Article 8.  The  decision  analysed  the
    existence of family life between ��9 to 23, and referred,  at  �24,  to
    the proposition in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31, that there is no
    presumption that a person has a family life, even  with  members  of  a
    person's immediate family and that a court must scrutinise all relevant
    factors.  Having referred to Kugathas, the analysis  then  goes  on  to
    consider and criticise Mr Horrocks's report, including  the  fact  that
    the interviews via Zoom were not  in  an  ideal  manner;  the  lack  of
    translation of the social media communications; the voluntary nature of
    AA and DA's separation.

73. The central criticism of Ms Sane is the starting point of the  decision
    that there is no presumption that a person has a family life even  with
    immediate family members.  Kugathas was in the context of adult  family
    members and ignores the presumption precisely to the opposite in Sen  v
    Netherlands [2003] 36 EHRR and Boughanemi v France [1996] 22  EHRR  228
    of a bond amounting to family life between parent  and  a  minor  child
    born through a marriage, that would only be broken save in  exceptional
    circumstances.  Even in the extreme case of Boughanemi where the father
    concerned had not even acknowledged the  child  as  his  own  until  10
    months afterwards and had not provided any  financial  support  to  the
    child in question, there was nevertheless  a  finding  of  family  life
    between the two.  In essence, the analysis had started off at the wrong
    presumption and had then imported considerations  that  would  be  more
    relevant, for example, to  adult  children  such  as  the  question  of
    dependency, whether financial or emotional.

Discussion and conclusion on the 11th March 2021 decision

74. I once again regard Ms Sane's criticisms of this decision as sustained.
     On the one hand, I do  not  regard  the  respondent  as  being  fairly
    criticised for focussing on Article 8 ECHR, in circumstances  where  it
    is family life that is relied on for the purposes of Article  17(2)  of
    the Dublin III regulation.  On the other hand, I accept  the  criticism
    that the respondent  failed  to  start  from  the  presumption  of  the
    existence of family life between a father and minor child.   It  is  in
    that context that the concerns identified by the  respondent  may  well
    otherwise  have  had  a  different  weight.   For  example,   voluntary
    separation between the two  adult  parents  would  not  necessarily  be
    sufficient to displace the presumption of family life  between  one  of
    the  adults  and  their  child.   Nor  does  the   analysis   regarding
    infrequency of contact, even if justified because of a failure  by  the
    applicants to provide full disclosure of their communications,  explain
    why this is capable of displacing the presumption of family life where,
    as the respondent accepts, there is  some  degree  of  emotional  ties,
    natural concern and affection between AA and AMA.

75.  Moreover,  as  Mr  Fraczyk  accepted,  the  respondent's  guidance  to
    caseworkers: "Dublin III regulation - version 2.0 - Transferring asylum
    claimants into and out of the UK where responsibility for examining  an
    asylum claim lies with the UK  or  with  another  EU  member  state  or
    associated state" (at pages C [73] to C [117] AB), stated, at  pages  C
    [111] to C [112] AB:

         "The re-establishment of family links would normally be regarded as
         being in accordance with the Section 55  duty,  but  this  may  not
         always  be  the  case.   Whilst  a  non-exhaustive  list,  the  re-
         establishment of family links  would  not  be  in  accordance  with
         Section 55, for example where it is identified that:

         .    the safety of the child or their family will be jeopardised

         .    the child has a well-founded fear of relevant family members

         .     the  relevant  family  members  are  the  alleged  actors  of
             persecution within the claim for asylum which has not yet been
             finally determined

         .    the child is a recognised or potential victim  of  trafficking
             in which the family were knowingly complicit

         .    the child has shown  to  have  been  previously  exploited  or
             abused or neglected by their family, or claims  to  have  been
             previously exploited or abused or neglected  by  their  family
             and this has not been conclusively discounted.

         It is important that  you  demonstrate  and  record  how  you  have
         considered a child's best interests in line  with  the  Section  55
         duty.  All aspects of this consideration  must  always  be  clearly
         recorded both on the case file and on CID."

76. The respondent referred to AMA's best interests at ��24 to  29  of  the
    11th March 2021 decision (pages AI [137] to AI [138]  AB).   She  noted
    that DA and AMA are settled in the UK and that AMA has had a  safe  and
    stable upbringing; that in respect of AMA's autism, there is a lack  of
    clarity in terms of AMA's formal diagnosis but taking the case  at  its
    highest, AMA is a highly functioning child, and his development has not
    been adversely affected to any appreciable extent by the absence of AA.
     The respondent concluded that any direct contact between  AA  and  AMA
    was limited, as DA and AA were no longer in a relationship. AMA's focus
    would be on his sole carer, DA.  The  respondent   did  not  accept  Mr
    Horrocks's conclusion that AMA would be likely to blame himself  if  AA
    were unable to join him in the UK.  She regarded  that  as  speculative
    and concluded that no evidence was submitted to show that AMA would  be
    in danger or that his development would be adversely affected.  He  was
    making positive academic progress.

77. The respondent concluded that AMA's best interests are served by living
    with DA in a family unit and there  are  no  factors  that  would  make
    contact between AA  and  AMA  impossible  or  extremely  difficult  and
    further, even if the best interests of AMA are for AA to be admitted to
    the UK, the refusal to agree to the  second  TCR  was  a  proportionate
    means of achieving the legitimate objective  of  effective  immigration
    control.

78. Ms Sane suggests that  the  respondent  ignored  her  own  guidance  to
    caseworkers and reversed the presumption so that the decision  suggests
    that the applicants have not shown there was a danger or adverse effect
    to AMA in refusing to accept the  TCR.   The  guidance  refers  to  the
    presumption that it would be  in  the  best  interests  of  AMA  to  be
    reunited with AA, absent a risk to AMA because of reunification.

79. Also, whilst the  respondent's  decision  focusses  upon  the  positive
    relationship between AMA and DA and the fact that  AMA  is  progressing
    satisfactorily without the need for AA's care, this ignores  the  point
    that even if the current arrangements are sufficient to cater for AMA's
    needs (which is not accepted) that is not inconsistent with it being in
    AA's  best  interests  to  be  reunited  with  AMA.   In  essence,  the
    respondent has failed to analyse any  contra-indications  to  the  best
    interests of AMA being reunited with AA.

80. I agree with Ms  Sane's  criticism  in  relation  to  the  respondent's
    analysis of AMA's best interests in the March 2021 decision.  There  is
    no reference to the guidance and whilst  there  does  not  need  to  be
    express reference to  it,  it  is  clear  here  that  the  respondent's
    analysis has reversed the burden onto the applicants  of  showing  that
    AMA would be in danger, if there is continuing separation,  as  opposed
    to  the  case  worker  guidance  suggesting  that  reunification  would
    ordinarily be in the best interests of AMA, unless it were  shown  that
    there was a danger to AMA of reunification.  The  second  flaw  is  the
    respondent's  focus  on  the  sustainability  and  sufficiency  of  the
    relationship of AMA and DA as the status quo, which ignores  that  this
    may all be true, but it would still be in the best interests of AA  and
    AMA to be reunited, a proposition which Mr  Fraczyk  himself  accepted,
    albeit he said that that was not an end to the overall  analysis  under
    Article 17(2),  which  also  required  an  assessment  of  humanitarian
    reasons and also, in the context of Article 8 ECHR, of proportionality.

81. On that final point, Mr  Fraczyk  urged  me  to  consider  �28  of  the
    decision  letter,  (page  AI  [138]  AB),  in  which   the   respondent
    considered, in the alternative scenario of the existence of family life
    and it being in the  best  interests  of  the  child  to  require  AA's
    admission to the UK, that refusal to agree to  the  second  TCR  was  a
    proportionate means of immigration control.  However, whilst on the one
    hand, I accept Mr Fraczyk's submission that there does not need  to  be
    as detailed an explanation for a decision under Article 17(2) as  there
    would be in a fully-fledged human rights decision, nevertheless �28  of
    the decision is little more than a bare assertion  that  refusal  under
    Article 17 is proportionate.  Put simply, there is no  explanation  for
    why the best interests are outweighed, as applied to  the  analysis  of
    the facts set out by the respondent.  There is similarly an absence  of
    adequate explanation as to the proportionality of any refusal, for  the
    purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

82. In summary, I conclude that to the  extent  that  the  second  decision
    focusses on Article 8 ECHR, the analysis of family life starts  off  at
    the wrong footing and is flawed in that regard.  The analysis  of  best
    interests ignores the respondent's own guidance and  fails  to  explain
    and instead reverses the burden in relation to countervailing  factors,
    said to displace the presumption  of  AMA's  best  interests  being  in
    reunification.   The  final  stage  of  the  analysis  in  respect   of
    humanitarian considerations for the purposes of Article  17(2)  of  the
    Dublin III regulation and proportionality for the purposes of Article 8
    ECHR is no more than a bare assertion, without adequate explanation  or
    analysis.

83. In the circumstances, I conclude that the March 2021  decision  was  in
    breach of the respondent's  obligations  under  Article  17(2)  of  the
    Dublin III regulation.  In that respect, the decision was not lawful.

84. As with the first decision, I  will  come  on  to  explain  whether  it
    breached the applicants' rights under Article 8 ECHR in the final  part
    of this decision in respect of the third decision of 11th June 2021.

The decision of 11th June 2021

85. By this stage, the respondent had the opportunity to consider not  only
    the initial  ISW  report  of  Mr  Horrocks,  but  also  the  subsequent
    evidence, including his addendum  report  and  the  additional  witness
    statements.  In his addendum  report,  Mr  Horrocks  responded  to  the
    respondent's  criticism  of  him  in  her  second  decision,  including
    pointing out his expertise in carrying out assessment via remote means,
    which notably has been accepted by the Upper  Tribunal  in  BAA.   Also
    provided were the translations of the previously submitted  screenshots
    of communications via  WhatsApp  and  video  calls.   AA  and  DA  also
    provided additional statements of 3rd and 5th  May  2021  respectively.
    They reiterated in  detail  the  nature  of  the  relationship  claimed
    between AA and AMA and the circumstances of  the  family's  separation.
    In that context, the decision of 11th June 2021, at pages  A2  [62]  to
    [68] AB accepted, at �6, that there  is  a  link  of  family  relations
    between AA and AMA.  There is current contact and a degree  of  concern
    and affection between the two.

86. Nevertheless, the respondent continued to dispute that family life  for
    the purposes of Article 8 ECHR is engaged,  noting  that  this  was  an
    application under  Article  17(2)  and  there  is  no  relationship  of
    dependency between AA and AMA.  Whilst the respondent accepted that her
    discretion under Article 17(2) is  not  untrammelled  and  that  family
    relations may exist even where Article  8  ECHR  is  not  engaged,  the
    respondent concluded that the  exercise  of  discretion  under  Article
    17(2) would not be appropriate.  In doing so, the respondent considered
    whether family life or family relations existed prior to  AA  and  DA's
    separation, the strength of ties and the reasons  for  separation.  The
    respondent noted that AA and AMA had only met twice in  person,  for  a
    matter  of  weeks,  and  that   the   relationship   had   "significant
    limitations". Moreover, whilst AA has provided some  financial  support
    to AMA before 2015, he has not done so since then.  AMA has always been
    in the care of DA.

87. The decision also outlined the respondent's concerns about the  claimed
    contact between AA and AMA and in particular,  the  lack  of  evidence,
    beyond bare assertion, that AA had been in contact on a virtually daily
    basis, over a nine-year period.  The respondent would expect to  see  a
    much greater level of evidence, such as records of calls, or  posts  or
    message logs on social media. The claimed loss of  AA's  telephone  did
    not justify failing to provide such material, particularly where source
    records could still nevertheless be provided as they were stored on the
    social  media  provider's  records,  not  just  a  mobile  phone.   The
    respondent reiterated this was not forced separation where, even on the
    applicants' case, AA and DA voluntarily met in South Africa,  where  AA
    had recognised status as a refugee; they were married in 2011, but they
    almost immediately separated, through no reason relating to a  fear  of
    persecution, but rather because DA could not meet the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules to obtain entry clearance for AA to the  UK.   DA
    left AA after a very brief period and returned to  the  UK,  where  she
    gave birth to AMA.  AA did not leave South Africa until years later, in
    the meantime living separately from DA.  AA did not have  an  automatic
    right to live in the UK based  on  his  relationship  at  the  time  he
    married DA.

88. The respondent expressly considered the assessment of AMA's autism  and
    noted that the NHS is providing an appropriate care management plan for
    him.  There was no evidence suggesting  that  AA's  continuing  absence
    would result in AMA's autism being better managed.

89. The decision  referred  to  Peter  Horrocks's  reports,  including  the
    assertion of DA/AMA and AA speaking every day. However, in the  absence
    of that material, Mr Horrocks' assessment was not  justified  upon  the
    evidence  before  him  and  was  speculative.   The   respondent   also
    criticised what she regarded as his speculative assessment  that  there
    would be a significant risk to AMA if he believed that his  father  did
    not wish to see him.  Mr Horrocks' comments  on  the  benefit  of  AA's
    presence to  a  child  with  autism  were  not  based  on  any  medical
    expertise.    Whilst  Mr  Horrocks  has  criticised  the   respondent's
    previous references relating to DA's new partner (such a partner cannot
    be a replacement father), in her own witness statement, DA has referred
    to her partner acting like a second father to AMA.

90. The respondent referred, at ��22 to 29 of her decision, (pages A2  [66]
    to [67] AB) to AMA's best  interests.   She  considered  not  only  the
    stability of the current arrangements but also the  support  that  DA's
    new partner provides to AMA.  Any contact between AA and AMA  would  be
    limited if AA is admitted to the  UK  and  dispersed,  not  necessarily
    anywhere near AMA in London.  He would not be able work and is unlikely
    to  be  able  to  provide  financial  support.   DA  is  AMA's  primary
    caregiver, who has met all his needs for all his  life.   Moreover,  in
    terms of any difficulties she may face, (referred to by  Mr  Horrocks),
    DA has not provided any details of  any  difficulties  in  her  witness
    statements. In her recent statement of 5th May 2021, she refers to  the
    importance of AMA seeing AA anytime he wants and having AA's  guidance,
    which would be  better  for  his  welfare  and  development,  but  also
    acknowledges that she was able to bring up her other child  as  a  lone
    parent.

91. Whilst the respondent acknowledged in the June 2021 decision  that  AMA
    is fond of AA, the evidence did not indicate that AMA is distressed  by
    AA's absence and the evidence was also  unclear  about  how  frequently
    they speak to one  another.   They  had  also  virtually  no  in-person
    contact for the entirety  of  AMA's  life  and  even  the  evidence  in
    relation to their meeting in South Africa  is  limited.   Overall,  the
    respondent concluded that it would be in AMA's best interests  to  live
    with DA and that an exercise of discretion would not be justified where
    AA provided only limited  emotional  support.   Even  if  the  physical
    separation caused a degree of  emotional  impact,  that  was  only  one
    factor in the consideration of AMA's  best  interests,  and  the  wider
    assessment of discretion on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  At
    �31 (page A2 [68]  AB)  the  respondent  concluded  that  she  was  not
    persuaded  that  any  impact  upon  AMA's   emotional   wellbeing   and
    development would be as significant as Mr Horrocks contends, given  her
    assessment of  the  facts,  including  the  reality  of  AMA's  current
    circumstances.  Any impact would be manageable and the circumstances in
    respect of AMA did not outweigh the legitimate interests  in  effective
    immigration  control  and  the  Greek  authorities'  responsibility  to
    process AA's asylum  claim.   Even  on  the  principle  of  AMA's  best
    interests, there was  not  sufficient  weight  to  require  the  UK  to
    voluntarily exercise its discretion and accept the TCR.  Greece was the
    responsible member state to determine AA's asylum claim.

92. Ms Sane criticises the respondent's focus on dependency, albeit, as  Mr
    Fraczyk points out, this is only  one  of  several  factors  which  the
    respondent considered.  She also asserts that there is  no  requirement
    under the Dublin III  regulation  for  the  applicants  to  demonstrate
    constant or frequent contact over a nine-year period.

93. In relation to the medical evidence, Ms Sane submits  that  the  proper
    question should not have been whether or how AA would assist with AMA's
    autism but whether, in the context of his autism, it would be in  AMA's
    best interest to be reunited with AA, having regard to  his  particular
    vulnerabilities.  She argued that the respondent  had  erroneously  and
    impermissibly considered a  whole  list  of  irrelevant  considerations
    including the separation of DA and AA; their lack of cohabitation;  the
    fact that AA  is  an  asylum  seeker  and  currently  in  a  precarious
    financial position; and the fact that DA has a  new  partner.  None  of
    these are risk factors capable of weighing against the  presumption  of
    reunification being in AMA's best interests.

94. Mr Fraczyk essentially points out that the respondent has engaged  with
    all the evidence, not narrowing her assessment to Article 8  ECHR  (the
    criticism of the March 2021 decision), but taking it and wider  factors
    into account, which were plainly permissible, but  none  of  which  was
    determinative.   In  reality,  the   applicants   disagree   with   the
    respondent's decision, rather than there being  any  error  of  law  on
    public  law  grounds.   Even  if  I  were  to  adopt  the  approach  of
    considering for myself whether family life is established (see BAA) the
    evidence  is  not  sufficient  to  support  such  a  finding.   In  the
    alternative, if there is such a  family  life  within  the  meaning  of
    Article 8 ECHR (as distinct from family relations for the  purposes  of
    Article 17(2)) the refusal of the second TCR does not engage Article  8
    and any interference is proportionate.



Discussion and conclusion on the June 2021 decision

95. I am conscious of the presumption of family life between a minor child,
    born within a marriage, and their parent (see Sen and  Boughanemi).   I
    am also conscious that pre-existing blood ties, coupled with a declared
    intention of care and future intention  may  be  sufficient  to  engage
    Article 8 ECHR (Ahmadi).   I am also conscious of the CFR and the right
    of a child to maintain a personal relationship and direct contact  with
    their parent. The presumption (albeit rebuttable) is that  family  life
    exists  between  AA  and   AMA,   absent   exceptional   circumstances.
    Moreover, family life for  the  purposes  of  Article  8  ECHR  between
    parents and their children can take a variety of  different  forms,  in
    particular, it may exist despite the lack of cohabitation or  financial
    support, but with regular and loving contact.  I am also conscious that
    the applicants have adduced several witness  statements  on  behalf  of
    both parents as well as the ISW reports of Peter Horrocks and a limited
    number of social media contacts.  There  is  also  the  NHS  assessment
    document.

96. I also acknowledge the validity of the respondent's concerns about  the
    lack of full disclosure, by the applicants,  of  evidence  which  would
    otherwise be readily available, as part  of  the  applicants'  duty  of
    candour. The lack of full disclosure is unexplained or at least not, in
    my view, satisfactorily explained, and the missing evidence is relevant
    to this case.  Most of the evidence that has been  disclosed  comprises
    on the one hand, the witness statements of AA and DA,  or  ISW  reports
    written by Mr Horrocks and Danish Refugee Council notes.  There  are  a
    few pages of social media printouts said to relate to  ongoing  contact
    and the single NHS letter. The respondent was  entitled  to  doubt  the
    reliability of witness statements  of  AA  and  DA  as  possibly  self-
    serving,  namely that they were not necessarily telling  the  truth  in
    circumstances where something like disclosure of the  call  records  or
    Facebook material would disclose the regularity of such contact and the
    nature and quality of the various relationships.

97. It is that evidence, relating to the contact (frequency,  duration  and
    nature) over the years between AA  and  AMA,  which  is  relevant,  but
    missing. I canvassed with Ms Sane and Mr Fraczyk  anyone's  ability  to
    access, download and disclose, swiftly and with ease, the whole pattern
    of contact, for example through Facebook, (by which AA and DA met),  as
    well as WhatsApp.  As I discussed  with  the  representatives,  I  take
    judicial notice of the fact that Facebook  includes  a  "Download  your
    information" function, which produces  a  log  of  the  entirety  of  a
    member's activities, in a matter of moments.  AA's failure to  disclose
    the  full  picture  of  the  communications  with  AMA,   where   those
    communications are at the very heart of his  application  for  judicial
    review, is not explained by his assertion that he has lost,  at  times,
    his mobile telephone, even if he lost some locally stored  photographs.
    As Mr Fraczyk pointed out, such phone loss would not affect in any  way
    first, DA's access to her social media account; and  second,  the  fact
    that social media accounts themselves are not dependent on access  from
    a particular device. AA's  choice  of  disclosing  a  small  number  of
    photographs and WhatsApp messages is  analogous  to  disclosing  a  few
    pages of a book or narrative, when the full record (including when  and
    where he accessed his  social  media  account)  could  run  to  several
    hundred pages; or where the half-dozen pages may comprise the  entirety
    of the contact between the two.

98. The lack of a cogent explanation for the  full  disclosure  is  in  the
    context of the respondent repeatedly raising concerns about the lack of
    evidence.  I do not accept that these concerns amount to the respondent
    imposing too high a standard of proof.  It was equally permissible,  in
    my view, for the respondent to be concerned about Mr Horrocks'  report,
    on two bases. The first was the concern that Mr  Horrocks  had  strayed
    into speculation in his view of the pattern of contact between  AA  and
    AMA, based on what appears to be little  more  than  AA  and  DA's  own
    assertions.  The second was the concern  about  Mr  Horrocks'  view  on
    AMA's best interests.  While reunification may in theory  be  in  AMA's
    best interests, in practice, that is only  properly  answered  with  an
    informed view of the historic pattern of contact.

99. I also do not accept Ms Sane's criticism that the respondent considered
    other factors that she ought  not  to  have,  namely  AA's  status  and
    ability to financially support AMA; and DA having a new partner.   Both
    are, in my view,  properly  relevant  to  the  proportionality  of  the
    respondent's  decision.  AA  referred,  in  his  expression  of  future
    intentions, to wanting to support AMA financially and see him in person
    regularly.  The absence of the ability  to  do  so  (in  the  event  of
    dispersal to a different part of the UK and the inability to work) is a
    permissible consideration. So too, in my view, is the fact of DA having
    a new partner.  While Mr Horrocks argues  that  a  new  partner  cannot
    replace AA as AMA's father, the fact that  DA  has  a  new  partner  is
    relevant to Mr Horrocks' assessment of DA as a lone parent  (where  she
    may in fact have significant support from that  partner)  and,  in  the
    context of personal finances,  her  ability  to  travel  to  Greece  to
    accompany AMA to visit AA.  While DA refers, in her witness  statement,
    to it not being appropriate as she is no longer married to AA, this  is
    not explained further.  Indeed, virtually nothing is known  about  DA's
    new partner and the support and extent of the role he  plays  in  AMA's
    life.

100. I also do not accept Ms Sane's criticism that it was impermissible  for
    the respondent to consider that between AMA's birth in 2012, and  2015,
    DA and AA chose to live in separate countries, for reasons  unconnected
    with any protection claim.  While Ms Sane points out that this  imports
    criticisms of the parents' choices (if there is any criticism) into  an
    evaluation of family life between parent and child, the answer is  that
    the pattern of contact over time, through choice, not  persecution,  is
    relevant to AA's stated future intention, if admitted  to  the  UK,  to
    play a more active role in AMA's life.  AA and DA had chosen  to  begin
    their relationship in South Africa, where AA had legal  status  and  no
    fear of persecution.  The pattern that followed, prior to 2015, was  of
    almost complete separation, with sporadic  visits.   That  pattern  was
    plainly open to the respondent to consider in her assessment of whether
    AA's stated future intentions were reflected in  the  past  pattern  of
    contact, for several years, prior to any claim of persecution.

101. The respondent has accepted the existence of family  relations  between
    AA and AM, for the purposes of  the  Dublin  III  regulation.  That  is
    hardly  surprising  in  circumstances  where  there  is  a   biological
    relationship and it may well be, taking the documentary evidence at its
    highest, that there has been recent contact between AA and AMA.

102. While I have concerns about, and understand the reservations  that  the
    respondent has, about the existence of family life between AA  and  AMA
    for Article 8 ECHR purposes, I am just about prepared to  accept  (with
    reservation) that family life exists.   This is on the basis that  even
    with the small part of the picture revealed, it is possible  to  accept
    the recent (even if very recent) resumption of contact between  AA  and
    AMA as amounting to family life, even if it is via social media only.

103. Where the absence of full disclosure has a further  impact  is  in  the
    evaluation of the weight of AMA's best interests to be  reunified  with
    AA; and the proportionality of refusing the second  TCR.    AMA's  best
    interests must be a primary consideration, but they are not  paramount.
    As Ms Sane rightly points out, there are no contra-indications, as  set
    out in the case worker guidance (relating to potential harm to AMA)  as
    to why  reunification  would  not  be  in  AMA's  best  interests.   In
    assessing those best interests, AMA himself,  albeit  as  a  relatively
    young child, told Mr Horrocks that he wants to  be  reunited  with  his
    father.  However, the respondent was also entitled  to  consider  those
    best interests not just within that theoretical  framework  (i.e.,  the
    presumption of the best interests of reunification of parent and child)
    but on the facts known to her, which go wider that just  AMA's  wishes,
    and include a permissible concern that not all the  relevant  facts  or
    evidence have been disclosed.   The  best  interests  of  reunification
    might  be  materially  different  in  cases  of  full  and  transparent
    disclosure of the circumstances, as  opposed  to  inexplicably  limited
    disclosure.

104. Turning to  the  humanitarian  grounds  based  on  family  or  cultural
    considerations (Article 17(2) of the Dublin III regulation) and whether
    the effect the refusal of the TCR was of sufficient gravity  to  breach
    the applicants' Article 8 ECHR rights, and if it was,  whether  it  was
    proportionate,  the  respondent  was  entitled  to  consider  that  her
    decision maintains a status quo which has endured for the  entirety  of
    AMA's life.  That status quo is of AMA living in the UK, with DA as his
    primary care giver and, based  on  the  limited  disclosure,  a  recent
    renewal of contact with AA.  AMA's educational and welfare needs  as  a
    child with autism are met and Mr Horrocks' views of AA's role  (current
    and potential) in supporting AMA, as a child  with  autism,  were  ones
    that the respondent was entitled to regard as speculative, without full
    disclosure of all the evidence.  The respondent is entitled  to  regard
    the possibility of future visits by DA and AMA to AA in Greece, as part
    of the status quo, as realistic.   On  AA's  own  account,  he  is  not
    destitute or homeless, but lives in a friend's 5-bedroom home,  and  is
    in receipt of Greek state benefits.  While I do not  suggest  that  AMA
    would be able  to  stay  with  AA  in  what  is  described  as  crowded
    accommodation, AA's assertion in his witness statement that DA would be
    unable to afford to travel to visit, does not go  into  further  detail
    about her financial circumstances, whether individually or pooled  with
    her partner, bearing in mind that whilst married to AA,  she  travelled
    to South Africa with AMA to visit him on  two  occasions  in  alternate
    years before 2015.       DA's  claimed  responsibility  for  her  other
    daughter in the UK ignores the fact that her daughter is an  adult,  at
    university.  DA  asserts  that  it  is  not  culturally  respectful  or
    appropriate to visit AA with AMA, as they are divorced.  She  does  not
    explain further why it would  be  culturally  inappropriate,  as  AMA's
    mother, to accompany her minor child to visit his father, albeit  where
    neither would share accommodation with AA.

105. I conclude that the respondent's refusal of the second TCR,  interferes
    with the applicants' Article 8 ECHR  rights  and  the  effects  are  of
    sufficient gravity (again, just) to engage with those  rights,  bearing
    in mind AMA's best interests; his wishes; and the  effect  of  refusal,
    which is to  maintain  separation  of  AA  and  AMA,  pending  Greece's
    decision on AA's asylum claim, with visits by  DA  and  AMA  to  AA  in
    Greece in the meantime.

106. The respondent is entitled to conclude that, on  humanitarian  grounds,
    her  refusal  to  accept  responsibility  for   the   second   TCR   is
    proportionate, in AMA's particular circumstances, and crucially, in the
    context of inexplicably limited disclosure by AA.   There  is  a  clear
    public interest in immigration control.  The Greek authorities will  be
    able to determine AA's asylum claim, and  while  they  do  so,  AA  has
    accommodation and financial support. AA and AMA can continue to develop
    their contact via social media, supplemented by in-person  visits  from
    DA and AMA.  The status  quo,  while  inhibiting  further  face-to-face
    contact between AA and AMA, is in the context of  evidence  which  does
    not support their relationship being more than at the  earliest  stages
    of renewed contact.   In  the  meantime,  AMA  has  the  full  support,
    resources and care of DA and her partner.  It is relevant that  AMA  is
    not financially or practically dependent, for his day-to-day needs,  on
    AA.  AMA's best interests  in  reunification  are,  on  these  specific
    facts, and in the context of the lack of full disclosure  of  evidence,
    outweighed by the public interest in immigration control.

107. In summary, the respondent's refusal to allow AA entry to the UK,  was,
    and is, proportionate and not in breach of the  applicants'  Article  8
    ECHR rights.  This means that the withdrawn decisions of March 2020 and
    March 2021 did not breach the applicants' Article 8 ECHR rights.

108. In relation to the June 2021  decision,  the  respondent's  refusal  to
    accept the second TCR does not have the consequence (because of refusal
    to admit AA) of breaching the applicants' Article 8  ECHR  rights.  The
    respondent carried out a  proportionality  assessment  consistent  with
    Article 8 ECHR.

109. While the Dublin III regulation has wider considerations  (and  is  not
    dependent on Article 8 ECHR), I am satisfied that the  respondent  took
    into account all relevant factors, and did not  rely  on  impermissible
    factors, in considering whether to exercise discretion on  humanitarian
    grounds.  The respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the  second  TCR  was
    unarguably open to her to reach, on public law grounds.  The respondent
    had raised concerns about the gaps in the evidence, and did not fail in
    her duty to investigate the gaps in evidence.

110. For the above reasons, the respondent did not  breach  her  obligations
    under Article 17(2) of  the  Dublin  III  regulation  in  reaching  her
    decision of 11th June 2021.    The  decision  of  11th  June  2011  was
    lawful.

111. Any decision in respect of  remedy  and  costs  will  need  to  be  the
    subject of further submissions and I invite the parties to draw up  the
    appropriate orders on liability.
