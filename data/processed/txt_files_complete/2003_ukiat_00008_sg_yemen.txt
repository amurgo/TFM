                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr J Morris for the entry clearance officer
The sponsor (Mr Razaz Mohd. Motaher) for the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Mr  AL  McGeachy),
   allowing, after a hearing, an appeal from  refusal  of  a  family  visit
   visa. Leave was given on the  basis  of  grounds  complaining  that  the
   adjudicator had directed further investigations which suggested that  he
   had not been so satisfied  as  he  said  he  was  with  the  surrounding
   circumstances; and that he had not given enough weight to the six  years
   during which the sponsor and the claimant had not met.

2. There was however a more fundamental point taken in the grant of  leave.
   As the chairman noted, the adjudicator had found against the claimant on
   the family basis of the application. The  sponsor  regards  her  as  his
   wife, having apparently gone through a ceremony of marriage with her  in
   the Yemen during his last visit there in 1996. This may well  have  been
   effective by the law of its place of celebration;  and  the  adjudicator
   found the sponsor believed it was so. However, by well-known  principles
   the essential, as opposed to formal validity of the marriage depends  on
   its being recognized by the law of both parties' domicile.
3. The claimant is clearly domiciled in  the  Yemen,  whose  law  no  doubt
   follows the Shari'a in permitting polygamous marriages. The  adjudicator
   however found that the sponsor is domiciled in this  country.  That  was
   clearly the only possible finding: he has lived here  for  the  last  30
   years and took British citizenship in 1993; before us he  expressed  his
   intention of living here indefinitely, as he has every right to do.

4. The difficulty with that is that in 1985 the sponsor married  a  British
   citizen, and their marriage had not been dissolved by the  decree  of  a
   competent court by the time  he  went  through  the  ceremony  with  the
   claimant. That may now have happened: he produced to us a  statement  of
   the arrangements for the children of his marriage. So far as the law  of
   his domicile is concerned, however, whatever ceremony  he  went  through
   with the claimant was bigamous, and is void.

5. The adjudicator was however clearly right in describing this point as "a
   fundamental  defect  in  this  appeal".  That  is  because  the  "family
   visitors" given a right of appeal by � 60.5 of the 1999 Act are defined,
   under the powers given in � 60.10, in the  Immigration  Appeals  (Family
   Visitor) (No.  2)  Regulations  2000  regulation  2.2a  as  including  a
   "spouse", which can only mean a lawful wife or husband. It is not  clear
   to us why the adjudicator nevertheless considered and allowed the appeal
   on its merits.

6.  There  is  a  further  provision  at  regulation  2.2e,  extending  the
   definition of family visitors  to  people  who  have  lived  with  their
   sponsor as man and wife for two of the last three years before applying;
   but, as the adjudicator also noted, this sponsor agrees he had not  seen
   the claimant for the last six. (The adjudicator accepted his explanation
   that he had been awaiting  the  result  of  a  libel  action  against  a
   newspaper in this country).

7. There was another possible  basis  on  which  the  claimant  might  have
   qualified as a family visitor to the sponsor: he  says  they  are  first
   cousins (see regulation 2.2a again), through his  father  Mohd.  Motaher
   Abdullah, own brother to her mother Sa'ada Motaher Abdullah. When  those
   names and double patronymics are set out in full, the  relationship,  if
   those facts are correct, becomes obvious; but no-one ever pointed it out
   to the entry clearance officer. The claimant did give her mother's  name
   in her application form as "Sada Motaher"; but  she  named  the  sponsor
   only as "Razaz Mohamed", so there was nothing at all to  put  the  entry
   clearance officer on inquiry that there might be a relationship of  that
   kind, which he might have wished to investigate to see if  it  formed  a
   basis for a family visit application within � 60.5.

8. There is also a possibility that the claimant's  father  was  a  British
   citizen, so that she might be able to come here under a  certificate  of
   entitlement, rather than relying on the present proceedings at  all.  As
   the adjudicator pointed out, that needed a quite  separate  application.
   We do not see that there  was  any  basis  in  this  claimant's  present
   application for her to be considered as a family  visitor,  or  for  any
   appeal to be entertained by an adjudicator against refusal of that.


9. In case we should be wrong about that, we shall briefly give  our  views
   on the points taken  in  the  grounds.  We  think  the  adjudicator  was
   entitled by a short head, bizarre as the history  may  seem,  to  accept
   that the only reason  why  the  sponsor  had  remained  apart  from  the
   claimant for the last six years was the litigation he had been  pursuing
   against the newspaper.

10. On the other hand, the directions the adjudicator gave at � 11 (for  the
   entry clearance officer to assess the sponsor's claims to  own  property
   in the Yemen, and his domestic circumstances, before  issuing  the  visa
   for which the claimant had applied) cannot  in  our  view  be  justified
   under paragraph 21.5a of schedule 4 to the 1999 Act as being for  giving
   effect to his decision. They are rather for making sure that it  is  not
   to have any practical  effect  until  the  entry  clearance  officer  is
   satisfied on points which, so far as they may be relevant at  all,  must
   have been equally relevant to the question of whether the appeal  should
   be allowed or  dismissed.  This  point  on  its  own  would  lead  to  a
   conclusion that the adjudicator was not satisfied as  he  said  (and  no
   doubt thought he was) of the genuineness of the application, and to  the
   appeal being allowed on that basis.

11.  Since  the  sponsor  was  not  represented  before  us,  we  made  some
   suggestions as to how he might try to deal with  the  situation,  if  we
   were to allow the appeal, which we now repeat. He could do any or all of
   the following:

   a) establish that his British wife has got a decree absolute  of  divorce
      in this country, and either go  through  a  fresh  ceremony  with  the
      claimant, who could then re-apply on the basis of marriage;  or  apply
      to visit or settle with him here as his fianc�e; or

   b) provide the claimant with suitable evidence of  their  cousinhood  for
      her to apply on that basis; or

   c) suggest she applies for a certificate of entitlement.

   The sponsor told us the British  mission  in  the  Yemen  had  now  been
   closed, which might present some practical problems; but at our  request
   Mr Morris supplied him with  details  of  alternative  arrangements  for
   getting entry clearance from there.
