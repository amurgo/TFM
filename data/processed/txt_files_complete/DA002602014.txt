                                 METIN POLAT
                                                                    Claimant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam promulgated on 17 June 2015  in  which
    she allowed the appeal of Mr Metin  Polat  (to  whom  I  refer  as  the
    claimant) against the decision of the Secretary of  State  made  on  28
    January 2014 to make a deportation order against him.

 2. This appeal was considered by the First-tier Tribunal on 12 August 2014
    and was allowed on the basis that the Secretary of State had failed  to
    consider the application properly  in  line  with  Section  19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014.  Upon appeal by the Secretary of State the appeal
    then came before the President  of  the  Tribunal  sitting  with  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Reeds. That panel found that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law and the matter was
    then remitted to the First-tier for it to re-determine  the  appeal  on
    all issues.

 3. It is important to note that, unusually in such an appeal, the claimant
    is a citizen of Turkey who has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    considerable period of time.  He entered the United Kingdom in 1976  at
    the age of 3ï¿½ and was granted indefinite leave to remain  in  1979,  He
    has therefore been at the very least lawfully resident  in  the  United
    Kingdom for approximately 40 years.  He  is  married  and  he  has  two
    children who are both British citizens. It is his case that his removal
    would not be in accordance with the Immigration Rules given the  effect
    on his wife and children.

 4. In determining the appeal, the judge considered the  Immigration  Rules
    and also Section 117C of the 2002 Act as amended.  This is set  out  in
    some  significant  detail  between  paragraphs  [31]  to  [47]  of  her
    decision.  The judge concluded that paragraph 399A of  the  Immigration
    Rules was not met but did, however find at paragraph [76] that  it  had
    been accepted by the Secretary of State that it would be  unduly  harsh
    to return the children to Turkey with their father.

 5. The Judge concluded that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
    claimant's children to return to live in Turkey [84] and also  at  [88]
    that it would be unduly harsh for the wife to go  to  live  in  Turkey.
    The judge  was  therefore  satisfied  that  the  claimant  fell  within
    Exceptions 1 and 2 set out within Section 117C of the  2002  Act.   The
    appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules on that basis.

 6. The Secretary of State appealed on two principal grounds:

      i. That the judge materially misdirected herself in law  in  that  she
         had failed properly to apply paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules
         as currently constituted; and,

     ii. that the judge had failed to give reasons or adequate  reasons  for
         findings on a material matter, that is she had  failed  to  explain
         why it was that the children could  not  cope  with  the  education
         system in Turkey, why the effect of  deportation  on  the  children
         would be unduly harsh and why it would be unduly harsh on the  wife
         for her to have to live in Turkey.

 7. Permission on all grounds was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Simpson.

 8. When the matter  came  before  me  the  claimant,  Mr  Polat,  was  not
    represented.  It  is  clear  from  the  file  that  he  was  previously
    represented by Kilic & Kilic Solicitors but  on  5  January  2016  they
    wrote to the Tribunal indicating that they wished to withdraw from  the
    proceedings as they had no further instructions from  their  client  in
    respect of the hearing.

 9. It is evident from the court file and from that letter that  notice  of
    the hearing was served on the claimant's solicitors as they  then  were
    and it is also clear that notice was served  on  the  claimant  at  the
    address given by him and which has remained constant throughout.  There
    is no indication of any change of address.

10. In the circumstances I am satisfied that there has been proper  service
    of the due time, date and venue of the hearing and  that  the  claimant
    has failed to attend the hearing without giving any reason  whatsoever.
    I am satisfied that it would be in all  the  circumstances  appropriate
    bearing in mind the overriding objective to proceed to hear the appeal.

11. I heard submissions from Mr Duffy, who submitted that it was clear from
    the judge's decision, in particular at paragraphs [67] and  [76],  that
    she had misdirected herself in law and that the findings she  had  made
    that it would be unduly harsh are not properly reasoned, that is to say
    there is no basis for her coming to that conclusion  it  being  unclear
    what hardships she concluded that the children would face.  Whilst  the
    evidence was set  out  no  reasoning  has  been  put  forward  for  the
    conclusions.

12. I consider that it is clear that the judge has not properly applied the
    correct version of the Immigration Rules.  Paragraphs  399(a)  and  399
    (b) of the Immigration  Rules  as  now  constituted  are  significantly
    different from the predecessor provisions of  the  Rules.  While  those
    were in force at the time the decision letter was written, it is  clear
    from YM (Uganda) that it is the newer rules which must be considered.

13. It is unnecessary to set out the new rules in detail. It is  sufficient
    to note that where there is, as here, a child who is a British  citizen
    and a subsisting relationship with a partner in the UK the threshold to
    be overcome in order to come within the Immigration Rules is whether it
    would be "unduly harsh" for a child to live in the country it is to  be
    deported or for a child to remain without  the  person  who  is  to  be
    deported.  Similarly, the threshold in respect  of  a  relationship  is
    whether it would be unduly harsh for the partner to live in the country
    to which the  person  is  to  be  deported.   Further,  there  must  be
    compelling circumstances over and above those  described  in  paragraph
    EX.2. Appendix FM as to why it would be unduly harsh for the partner to
    live in this case in Turkey.

14. It is sufficiently clear from the decision that the judge did not  have
    regard to the current version of the Immigration Rules although  it  is
    clear that she had consideration of Section 117A to D of the  2002  Act
    which was  brought  into  effect  at  the  same  time  as  the  revised
    immigration Rules.  The decision is somewhat muddled in this respect in
    that the judge appears to flit between  the  two  without  sufficiently
    identifying what was under consideration.

15. A second limb of the first ground of  appeal  is  that  the  judge  had
    incorrectly stated that there had been a concession on the part of  the
    Secretary of State that it would be unduly harsh for the child  or  the
    wife to go to live in  Turkey.   This  appears  to  be  because  it  is
    conceded in  the  initial  refusal  letter  that,  under  the  previous
    incarnation of the Immigration Rules and in particular  paragraph  399A
    it would be unreasonable to expect either child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

16. It appears from the determination and in particular at paragraphs  [67]
    and [76] that the judge had read that over those  concessions  to  mean
    that there was a concession that the requirement for  the  children  to
    leave the United Kingdom would be unduly harsh.   There  is  no  proper
    basis for reading the one over to the other.  It is clear that the test
    as to what is unduly harsh is significantly different and  higher  than
    unreasonable.

17. Accordingly, for these reasons I am satisfied that the determination of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam did involve the making of an error  of
    law in that she clearly misdirected herself  as  to  which  Immigration
    Rules were to be applied.  She also appears to have misdirected herself
    in assuming that her  concession  that  what  would  be  reasonable  is
    equivalent to a concession of undue harshness.   I  consider  that  the
    latter in particular has coloured her assessment of Section 117C of the
    2002 Act rendering it unsafe.

18. Whilst the errors identified might  not  have  been  material  and  the
    reasoning on whether requiring the claimant to return to Turkey without
    his children or for his children and wife to return with him there  had
    been found unduly harsh there  is,  as  Mr  Duffy  submits,  no  proper
    analysis of what unduly harsh means.  Further, it is not entirely clear
    what it is that the judge finds would be unduly harsh  in  that  it  is
    difficult to discern from what the judge says, in  particular  at  [83]
    and[ 87] to [90], what it is that would be harsh about  the  separation
    involved.

19. Bearing in mind the misdirection that the judge had made  first  as  to
    the content of the relevant Immigration Rules and as to what  had  been
    conceded by the Secretary  of  State,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  her
    reasoning  with  regard  to  undue  harshness  is  sustainable.   I  am
    satisfied that it could easily be the case that had the judge  properly
    directed herself as to  the  law  and  addressed  the  issue  of  undue
    harshness, which is a significantly higher threshold than unreasonable,
    she could easily have come to a different decision, and accordingly for
    these reasons I am satisfied that the error of law  in  this  case  was
    material.  Accordingly I set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

20. In considering how best to proceed in this matter,  having  found  that
    the decision involved an error  of  law,  I  note  that  there  is  the
    potential for a number of new findings to be made and  that  additional
    findings of fact would in this case be necessary.  I  am  mindful  also
    that this is an unusual case in that the appellant, having succeeded in
    the First-tier Tribunal and having  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    excess of 40 years, has not presented himself here today.

21. I therefore adjourned the matter for a further  hearing  at  which  the
    decision was to be remade in the Upper Tribunal in accordance with  the
    following directions:-

      a) The appeal will be listed for hearing with a  time  estimate  of  3
         hours.

      b) The claimant, Mr Polat, must within seven days of  promulgation  of
         this decision give written notice to the Tribunal that he wishes to
         continue with this matter.   If  he  does  not  do  so,  the  Upper
         Tribunal will assume that he no longer seeks to pursue this  appeal
         and accordingly it will be deemed to  have  been  withdrawn  by  Mr
         Polat and his appeal will be dismissed.

22. The Claimant has not contacted the Upper Tribunal either to explain his
    absence at the earlier hearing to confirm that he  wishes  to  continue
    his appeals. Accordingly, I consider that I  am  entitled  to  conclude
    that he has nothing more to say and no longer contests the appeal.

23. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that Mr Polat was the successful party before the  First-
    tier Tribunal, but that that decision has been set aside, I  give  such
    consent for the case to be withdrawn.  I also formally record that  the
    appeal has been dismissed, as the claimant no longer maintains that the
    Secretary of State's decision to deport him was incorrect on the  basis
    of any of the available grounds of appeal.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law, and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.
