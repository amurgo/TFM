Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms. M. C. Benitez, of Counsel, instructed by  Stanley
                        & Co. Solicitors.
For the Respondent:          Mr. P. Deller, Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                        Officer.

1.    The Appellant is a national of Burundi, born on 1 September 1973.  She
      entered the United Kingdom on 8 April 2003 and claimed asylum  on  the
      same day. She has appealed, with permission, against the determination
      of Mr. M. Hemingway, an Adjudicator, who (following  a  hearing  on  9
      January 2004 at Birmingham) dismissed her appeal on asylum  and  human
      rights grounds against the Respondent's decision of 7 October 2003  to
      give directions for her removal from the United Kingdom as an  illegal
      entrant. The Appellant's appeal to the Adjudicator was  brought  under
      Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the
      2002 Act).

2.    The grounds of application for permission to appeal assert:

      (a)   (Ground 1) that the Adjudicator  had  erroneously  required  the
         Appellant to show that she was at risk of ill-treatment  over  and
         above the risk in a civil war situation. It  is  asserted  in  the
         grounds of application that the test in Secretary of State for the
         Home Department v. Adan [1999] 1AC 293 is only applicable during a
         civil war and that, once the civil war  is  over,  a  claimant  no
         longer needs to show that s/he is at  risk  over  and  above  that
         emanating from the civil war.

      (b)   (Ground 2) In the event that the test in the Adan case  applies,
         that the Adjudicator  erred  in  his  application  of  it.  It  is
         asserted that the Adjudicator's finding (at paragraphs 53 and  55)
         that the Appellant is not at specific risk is perverse in that the
         Appellant  did  show  a  "differential  impact"  as  compared   to
         civilians exposed to the ordinary incidents of civil  war.  It  is
         asserted that, given  the  particular  circumstances  in  Burundi,
         membership of the Hutu ethnic group is in itself sufficient ground
         to fear persecution.

      (c)   (Ground 3) Having  accepted  the  Appellant's  account  of  past
         persecution on grounds of  ethnicity,  the  Adjudicator  erred  in
         concluding that she was not at real risk of future persecution. It
         is asserted that the Adjudicator had failed to take  into  account
         the past persecution and that past persecution is relevant to  the
         "differential impact" test.  Relying  on  the  Court  of  Appeal's
         judgement in Demirkaya v. The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department  [1999]  Imm  AR  498,  it  is   asserted   that   past
         maltreatment is an excellent indicator of the future and that  the
         background evidence discloses no major change of circumstances  in
         Burundi.

3.    The real issue: We consider the three grounds in paragraphs  14.1  and
      14.2 below. At the hearing before us, it became evident that the  real
      issue before us is whether the Appellant is  at  real  risk  of  being
      raped in Burundi on account of her race and/or  gender.   We  did  not
      understand Ms. Benitez to assert that the Appellant  was  at  risk  of
      persecution on account only of her Hutu ethnicity.

4.1   Basis of claim (summary): The Appellant is a Hutu.  She is  a  Swahili
      speaker. She gives an account of the following:

      (a)   In 1993, some of her  family  members,  including  her  husband,
         were killed or went missing in action. In November 1993,  she  was
         attacked and kicked whilst pregnant. In March 1994,  she  and  her
         family were attacked by  Tutsi  militiamen.  Her  sister  and  her
         father were captured but she and her mother managed to escape.

      (b)   The Appellant and her mother then went to  the  DRC  (Democratic
         Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire), where  they  stayed  in  a
         camp in Uvira. Whilst there, the Appellant was attacked and  gang-
         raped by three military men who were employed to look  after  camp
         security.

      (c)   In  April  1994,  the  Appellant  and  her  mother  returned  to
         Burundi.  They  were  detained  because  they  did  not  have  any
         identification documentation. They were kept in a jail, where they
         were beaten. They were able to escape  from  the  jail  when  Hutu
         rebels attacked the jail. The Appellant and her mother were  again
         attacked by Tutsi militia and her mother shot  and  injured.  They
         decided to cross the border into Tanzania.

      (d)   In Tanzania, villagers told the Appellant and her  mother  about
         a refugee camp, where they arrived in December 1994.  In September
         or October 1997, the camp was attacked by  rebels.  The  Appellant
         received injuries, sustained by an axe. Her mother was stabbed and
         killed. The Appellant remained in the camp. On 19 March 2004,  she
         was raped again. She fled the camp with the  help  of  a  Catholic
         missionary. She stayed in the missionary house until  April  2003,
         when a person by the name of Father  John  helped  her  to  escape
         Tanzania with the services of an agent.

4.2    Since  arriving  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Appellant  has  been
      diagnosed as being HIV positive.

5.    The Respondent was not represented  before  the  Adjudicator.  In  the
      refusal letter, the Respondent disputed the  Appellant's  nationality.
      This was the sole challenge to the Appellant's credibility.

6.1   The Adjudicator's Determination (summary):  The  Adjudicator  accepted
      that the Appellant is a Burundian national. He found the Appellant  to
      be an honest and credible witness. He accepted that she had  given  an
      account of past events which was factually accurate. He also  accepted
      that, since arriving in the United Kingdom, she has been diagnosed  as
      HIV positive and was also pregnant.

6.2   The Adjudicator then considered whether  there  was  a  real  risk  of
      persecution in Burundi on account of the Appellant's race (as a Hutu).
      He noted, inter alia, that the CIPU report for Burundi of October 2003
      states that the civil war in Burundi continues (paragraph  51  of  the
      Determination). He also considered whether the Appellant would  be  at
      real risk of persecution or Article 3  ill-treatment,  on  account  of
      being returned as a single woman. He noted that the CIPU Report states
      that members of the security forces and armed rebels  were  repeatedly
      accused of sexual violence against women and young girls.

6.3   The Adjudicator's conclusions as  to  the  risk  of  ill-treatment  on
      account of the Appellant's race and gender are set out  at  paragraphs
      53, 54 and 55, which we now quote:

      53.   I consider, in fact, that any risk to  the  Appellant  would  be
         stemming from the effects of the ongoing civil war in  Burundi.  I
         do not feel there  is  any  particular  risk  of  persecution  for
         reasons of race which is faced specifically by the  Appellant  who
         is a member of the ethnic majority in Burundi.  On  this  basis  I
         find myself unable to allow her asylum appeal.

      54.   As to matters relating to Article 3, I remind myself  that  ill-
         treatment must attain a minimum level of severity in order to fall
         within Article 3 (Ireland v. UK). The mere fact that there will be
         a return to hardship resulting from  the  ravages  of   Civil  War
         cannot produce a breach of human rights (SK [2002] UKIAT 05613). I
         remind myself that the standards of the ECHR cannot be imposed  on
         all states. Regard must be  had  to  circumstances  in  individual
         states and to standards accepted  and  expected  in  those  states
         (Fazilat [2002[ UKIAT 00973).

      55.    Adopting  this  approach  I  consider  that  there  is  nothing
         specific in relation to the Appellant's  individual  circumstances
         which would suggest she would face  any  risk  of  persecution  or
         treatment contrary to Article 3 over and above  what  is  felt  by
         the normal population in Burundi.

      (our emphasis to paragraph 53).

6.4   The Adjudicator then  considered  the  Appellant's  Article  3  and  8
      claims, to the extent that they are based solely on the fact that  she
      has been diagnosed as HIV positive and the availability  of  otherwise
      of adequate treatment in Burundi. He concluded that her removal  would
      not be in breach of Article 3 and/or  8  on  account  of  her  medical
      condition. His conclusions on this aspect  of  the  Appellant's  human
      rights claim are not before us.

            Documents:

7.    We have before us the following documents:

      (Served on behalf of the Appellant):
      (a)   U.S. State Department (USSD) Report  on  Burundi  for  the  year
         2003, dated 25 February 2004 (Annex B of the Appellant's bundle);
       (b)    Human  Rights  Watch  (HRW),   "Overview   of   human   rights
         developments 2003: Burundi", dated 1 January 2004 (Annex C of  the

         Burundi", dated 26 May 2004 (Annex E of the Appellant's bundle);
      (e)   Amnesty International, extract from the  "Amnesty  International
         Report 2003: Burundi", dated 28 May 2005 (pages I.1 to I.4 of  the
         Appellant's bundle);
      (f)   USSD Report on Burundi for the year 2002, dated  31  March  2003
         (pages I.4 to I.21 of the Appellant's bundle);
      (g)   Letter dated 13 February 2004  from  UNHCR's  office  in  London
         addressed to Ms. Benitez, entitled: "Return of Hutus to  Burundi",

      (h)   Amnesty International Report, "Burundi: Rape - the hidden  human
         rights abuse". This report is dated 24 February 2004, according to
         Item 5(n) of Annex D on page 70 of the  CIPU  report  dated  April
         2003. It is based, in  part,  on  research  conducted  by  Amnesty
         International during a visit to Burundi in September 2003 (see the

         Integrated Regional Information Network), entitled: "Our bodies  -
         their battle ground: Gender-based violence in conflict zones".  It
         is not clear when this document was issued by IRIN.

      (Served on behalf of the Respondent):
      (j)   CIPU report on Burundi dated April 2004.

      Submissions:

8.    Ms. Benitez confirmed that the medical report on the  Appellant  dated
      27 May 2004 at pages A1  to  A2  of  the  Appellant's  behalf  is  not
      relevant because the Adjudicator's conclusion on the Appellant's human
      rights claim based on her medical condition has not  been  challenged.
      Ms. Benitez informed us that a child has been born to the Appellant.

9.1   In opening her submissions, Ms. Benitez informed us  that  she  relied
      on the grounds of application. In her submission, the Adjudicator  had
      applied the Adan test and was wrong to have done so because the  civil
      war had  ended.  In  Fred  Alex  Kitosi  (01/TH/02608),  the  Tribunal
      accepted that, although there continued to  be  serious  human  rights
      abuses and civilian  deaths,  the  civil  war  had  ended.  The  first
      paragraph of the HRW Report dated 1 January 2993 on  page  C1  of  the
      Appellant's bundle states that civil war ended in most of  Burundi  in
      late 2003 after the government concluded several agreements  with  the
      major rebel group, the FDD (the Forces for the Defence of  Democracy).
      The second paragraph of the Amnesty International report dated 26  May
      2004 on page E1 states that a new inclusive government came  to  power
      in late November 2003. The first paragraph of the USSD report for 2003
      at page B1 of the Appellant's  bundle  states  that  the  transitional
      government was established in 2001, and  refers  to  a  "low-intensity
      civil conflict"  in  Burundi  for  most  of  2003.  In  Ms.  Benitez's
      submission, the evidence shows that, as at the date of hearing  before
      the Adjudicator, the civil war had ended,  although  there  was  still
      fighting. Mr. Deller agreed that, as at the date of hearing before the
      Adjudicator, the civil war had ended in Burundi.

9.2   The UNHCR's position as at 13 February 2004  was  that  the  situation
      remained dangerous in Burundi and that its  position  paper  of  April
      2002 should still be applied by caseworkers. On the day of the hearing
      before us, Ms. Benitez had telephoned the  UNHCR  and  confirmed  with
      UNHCR's Policy Officer, Ms. Nicole Masri, that  legal  representatives
      and decision-makers should continue to be guided by the UNHCR's formal
      position of April 2002 - in other words, that UNHCR still held to  its
      advice as contained in the letter dated 13 February 2004.  We  pointed
      out to Ms. Benitez that the UNHCR do not  appear  to  be  saying  that
      Hutus are at risk of persecution but that the entire population is. We
      were also of the view that the reference to "July this  year"  in  the
      second full paragraph on the second page of the UNHCR letter  appeared
      to be incorrect - it could not  be  a  reference  to  July  2004,  and
      therefore had to be a reference to July 2003  or  July  2002  or  July
      2001. Ms. Benitez agreed that the UNHCR could not have been  referring
      to July 2004, and that she had assumed that the writer  had  meant  to
      refer to July 2002. Ms. Benitez agreed that the writer could not  have
      been referring to any period after July 2002.

9.3   Ms. Benitez submitted that the Appellant would be at real  risk  under
      the Refugee Convention of sexual violence and rape, due to her  gender
      and ethnicity. In Ms. Benitez's submission,  the  Appellant  does  not
      need to show that  she  is  at  particular  risk  on  account  of  her
      ethnicity, nor does it matter that she is at the  same  risk  as  many
      other women, although Ms. Benitez accepted that, in the event that the
      risk of rape is a general one faced by  women  in  Burundi,  then  the
      Appellant would have to meet the real risk test  as  set  out  in  the
      Court of Appeal's judgement in Hariri v. The Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 807. Ethnic minorities  are  still
      being targeted. Women are vulnerable. Ms. Benitez referred us to pages
      B1, B2, B7, E1, E2 and the IRIN article. In Ms. Benitez's  submission,
      this shows that the incidence of rape in Burundi is  conflict-related.
      It is used as a weapon of war. It  is  perpetrated  in  a  climate  of
      impunity. Rape is now an entrenched feature in Burundian  society.  It
      was systematically perpetrated by soldiers and rebels during 2003,  as
      the USSD report states at page B8 of the Appellant's bundle.  This  is
      also reflected in the IRIN article. There is under-reporting of sexual
      violence; no one knows what the true numbers are.  However,  even  the
      reported cases are high in number. Ms. Benitez  relied  on  paragraphs
      6.95 to 6.97 of the CIPU report.

10.1  Mr. Deller accepted that the Adjudicator appeared to  apply  the  Adan
      test, especially at paragraph 53 of the Determination. Furthermore, he
      erred in suggesting (as he appeared to) that the Appellant has to show
      that she is at particular risk when compared to other Hutus. In  other
      words, Mr. Deller's submission was that, if all Hutus  are  persecuted
      by Tutsis in Burundi because of their  race,  then  the  Appellant  is
      entitled to succeed under the Refugee Convention even if her situation
      is no different to other Hutus. Accordingly, Mr. Deller submitted that
      the Adjudicator had misdirected himself in this regard, even if he had
      not in fact applied the Adan test. In civil war  situations  to  which
      the Adan test applied, one needs to consider the issue  of  causation.
      If an ethnic group is not targeted but simply caught up in the middle,
      then they cannot be said to be persecuted on account of  their  ethnic
      origin. It would be otherwise if they are targeted on account of their
      race.

10.2  In Mr. Deller's submission, Ground 3 is  misconceived.  Not  only  has
      there been a major  change  of  circumstances  in  Burundi  since  the
      Appellant last experienced problems in Burundi, her experiences in the
      DRC and Tanzania were irrelevant to considering whether she is now  at
      real risk of persecution in Burundi. In Mr. Deller's  submission,  the
      ethnic conflict has ceased in Burundi. Mr. Deller relied on paragraphs
      6.76 to 6.80 of the CIPU report. Violence by soldiers and rebels  must
      have diminished now, with the end of the  conflict.  In  Mr.  Deller's
      submission, the objective evidence does not show that the Appellant is
      at real risk of rape. Any information as to the prevalence of rape  in
      Burundi must be  inflated  why  the  fact  that  the  information  was
      gathered at a  time when the conflict was still on-going. If rape  was
      used, even in part, as a  weapon  of  war,  then  the  fact  that  the
      conflict has diminished must mean that the likelihood of the Appellant
      being at risk of conflict-related rape  amounts  to  no  more  than  a
      theoretical possibility. It cannot be said that there is a  real  risk
      of rape for any woman in Burundi.

10.3  Even if there was such a real risk (which Mr. Deller did not  accept),
      it would still have to be shown  that  the  Appellant's  ethnicity  is
      reasonably likely to be a factor in the mind  of  the  persecutor  and
      that  there  is  insufficient  protection.  The  mere  fact  that  the
      Appellant is a Hutu does not establish the causal link.

11.   In response, Ms. Benitez submitted that the risk of  rape  was  not  a
      mere theoretical  possibility  but  reached  the  low  standard  of  a
      reasonable likelihood. This is  because  all  the  reports  before  us
      indicate that sexual  violence  is  an  endemic  problem.   It  is  an
      entrenched problem. It is systematically perpetrated. In Ms. Benitez's
      submission, it was not the case that the information relating  to  the
      prevalence of rape was gathered whilst the conflict was on-going. This
      is because the Amnesty International  Report  mentioned  at  paragraph
      6.95 of the CIPU report is dated February 2004; the report of  the  UN
      Special Rapporteur to Burundi mentioned at paragraph 6.96 of the  CIPU
      report is dated 20 October 2003. The USSD Report for 2003 (at page  B8
      of the Appellant's bundle) states that there was  systematic  rape  by
      solders and rebels during 2003 and that the number of rapes  increased
      when compared with the previous year. An NGO attributed  the  increase
      in rape to  the  conflict.  The  Amnesty  International  Report  dated
      February 2004 referred to at paragraph 6.95 of the CIPU report  refers
      to rape being exacerbated by widespread discrimination - that  is,  it
      mentions rape in a context  other  than  conflict-related.  It  states
      that, in 2003, there was an alarming increase in the  number  of  rape
      cases  in  the  context  of  Burundi's  armed   conflict,   that   the
      perpetrators are largely members of the  Burundian  armed  forces  and
      armed political groups as well as  armed  criminal  gangs,  that  rape
      generally appears to be on the increase in Burundi, and that  rape  is
      not confined to the areas most affected by the conflict.  The  present
      tense in which the Amnesty International Report is  written  indicates
      that the situation is on-going as at the date of the report.

12.   We reserved our determination.


      DETERMINATION

13.   We have decided to dismiss this  appeal,  for  reasons  which  we  now
      give.

14.1  We can deal with the grounds of application for permission  to  appeal
      fairly briefly. It was agreed between the parties before us  that,  at
      least by the date of the hearing before the Adjudicator, the civil war
      in Burundi had ended (see paragraph 9.1 above).  Mr.  Deller  accepted
      that the Adjudicator appeared (at paragraph 53 of  the  Determination)
      to apply the test in Adan and that, in doing so, he had erred in  law.
      We agree. Mr. Deller acknowledged that, in any event, the  Adjudicator
      misapplied  the  Adan  test.  We  agree.  At  paragraph  53   of   the
      Determination,  the  Adjudicator  appears  to   have   conflated   the
      differential impact test with the question whether  there  is  a  real
      risk of persecution on account of the Appellant's race - see the words
      in paragraph 53 of the Determination which we have emboldened  in  our
      paragraph 6.3 above. The real question before him  -  namely,  whether
      the Appellant was at real risk of persecution on account of her ethnic
      origin - was not the one he considered. Instead, he considered whether
      the Appellant was at particular risk of persecution on account of  her
      race which was not faced by other Hutus in Burundi. Even if  the  Adan
      test had been applicable (and we stress that it was not,  because  the
      civil war has  ended),  the  Adjudicator  misapplied  the  test.  When
      applying the Adan test, one needs to focus on the issue of  causation.
      If ethnic origin is a reason for any persecutory  ill-treatment,  then
      it does not matter if all persons of that ethnic origin are also being
      persecuted. However, if ethnic  origin  plays  no  part  in  the  ill-
      treatment and one is simply caught up in the crossfire  between  other
      groups in a civil war situation, the differential impact test  has  to
      be satisfied.

14.2  However, Ground 3 is  misconceived  for  two  reasons.  In  the  first
      place, the Appellant's experiences in the DRC  and  in  Tanzania  (see
      paragraph 3.1(b) and (d) above) do not have any relevance to the  risk
      of ill-treatment in Burundi now. We  recognise  that  she  did  suffer
      problems in Burundi. However, these problems occurred some time ago  -
      in 1993 and in 1994. The assertion in the grounds that there has  been
      no major change in the objective situation in Burundi now  has  to  be
      seen in the light of Ms. Benitez's contention at the hearing before us
      (with which we agree) that the civil war has ended.  That is  a  major
      change of circumstances in Burundi. Accordingly, we reject Ground 3.

15.   Although it is asserted in the grounds that the Appellant is  at  risk
      of persecution on account of her ethnicity alone, Ms. Benitez did  not
      put the Appellant's claim to us on that basis - that is  to  say,  she
      did not assert that the Appellant is at  real  risk  of  general  ill-
      treatment amounting to persecution on account of her ethnicity  alone.
      The USSD Report for 2003 makes  clear  that  Hutus  are  discriminated
      against in Burundi. State  discrimination  against  Hutus  remained  a
      serious problem. Societal discrimination between the Hutus and  Tutsis
      continued. We are satisfied, on  the  objective  evidence  before  us,
      that, whilst Hutus  face  discrimination  in  Burundi,  they  are  not
      reasonably likely to  be  subjected  to  treatment  which  amounts  to
      persecution  by  state  or  non-state  agents  on  account  of   their
      ethnicity.

16.   The Appellant's case, as put before us, is that she is  at  real  risk
      of rape or sexual violence in Burundi  on  account  of  her  race  and
      gender.  It is not  disputed  that  rape  amounts  to  persecution  or
      Article 3 ill-treatment. If there is a real risk of rape for a Refugee
      Convention reason, her appeal succeeds  on  asylum  and  human  rights
      grounds. If there is a real risk of rape but  it  is  not  shown  that
      there is a Refugee  Convention  reason,  then  her  appeal  on  asylum
      grounds fails but her appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  (Article  3)
      succeeds.

17.1  In order to appreciate the  significance  of  the  objective  material
      relating to the occurrence of rape and sexual violence in Burundi,  it
      is necessary in our view to  have  an  understanding  of  the  current
      situation  in  the  peace  process.  This,  in   turn,   requires   an
      understanding of the history of Burundi and the  roles  which  various
      parties / associations  /  groupings  referred  to  in  the  objective
      material have had in events in Burundi.

17.2  Accordingly, we approach our consideration of the issue before  us  in
      the following way:

      (a)   (paragraphs 18.1 and 18.2) we briefly summarise the main  events
           in Burundi's history since independence from Belgium on  1  July
           1962.

      (b)   (paragraphs 19.1  to  19.4)  we  briefly  describe  the  various
           associations, groupings, parties and rebel movements  which  one
           encounters on any perusal of the objective evidence;

      (c)    (paragraphs  20.1  and  20.2)  we  briefly  describe  the  main
           features of the transitional period in Burundi;

      (d)   (paragraphs 21.1 to 21.4) we describe the current state  of  the
           peace process;

      (e)   (paragraphs 22.1 to 22.8) we  assess  the  evidence  as  to  the
           incidence of sexual violence and rape in Burundi, over the  year
           2003; and

      (f)   (paragraphs 23.1 to 23.4) we assess the UNHCR's letter dated  13
           February 2004 in the light of the objective evidence.


      Snapshot of Burundi's history since independence:

18.1  As most people are aware, the underlying cause for the civil  war  and
      the conflict in Burundi is the ethnic  tension  between  the  majority
      Hutu population and the dominant but minority Tutsis. Tension  between
      these two groups have characterised much of  Burundi's  history  since
      independence.  Violence, inter-ethnic massacres and an attempted  coup
      by Hutus preceded the presidential and legislative elections  in  June
      1993. These  elections  were  won  by  the  predominantly  Hutu-party,
      FRODEBU (see below), whilst the Tutsi-based UPRONA (see below) won  16
      of the 81 seats in the national assembly (paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 of the
      CIPU  Report).   Melchior   Ndadaye   (FRODEBU)   became   the   first
      democratically elected President.

18.2  Civil war broke out on 23 October  1993  when  President  Ndadaye  was
      killed.  This  was  followed  by  coups,  inter-ethnic  violence   and
      massacres. There was a bloodless military coup in July 1996, which saw
      former President Buyoya reinstated as the Interim President of  a  new
      transitional republic (paragraph 4.8 of the CIPU report and Section  3
      of the USSD Report for 2003). In 1998, multi-party talks  to  end  the
      civil conflict  began.  On  28  August  2000,  the  Arusha  Peace  and
      Reconciliation Agreement (Arusha Peace Accord) was signed  (paragraphs
      4.14  to 4.15  of  the  CIPU  Report).  This  provides  for  a  3-year
      transitional period of government, which commenced on 1 November  2001
      and which is supposed to be followed by elections.

      The various associations, movements etc.

19.1  We now describe briefly the various associations,  groupings,  parties
      and rebel movements. There is a plethora of associations formed  along
      ethnic groupings in Burundi, as  well  as  a  number  of  rebel  armed
      movements. Splinter groups have also emerged from some of them  (Annex
      B of the CPU report). These  groups  have  taken  part  in  the  peace
      process to varying degrees; at least one (the Rwasa-led Palipehutu-FNL
      - see below) has not participated (paragraphs 4.14 to 4.53 of the CIPU
      Report).

19.2  The two mainstream governing parties are:

      (a)   FRODEBU (Front pour la d�mocratie au Burundi). This is  a  Hutu-
         dominated grouping of organisations.

      (b)   UPRONA (Union pour  le  progr�s  national).  This  is  a  Tutsi-
         dominated grouping of parties.

19.3  Other political parties and organisations include:

      (a)   G10 (formerly known as G8) -  a grouping of  10  Tutsi-dominated
           parties;

      (b)   G7 - a grouping of 7 Hutu-dominated organisations.

            Both G10 and G7 have participated in the peace process.

            The CNDD (Conseil national pour la  defense  de  la  d�mocratie)
           was originally the military-wing  of  FRODEBU,  led  by  Leonard
           Nyangoma.  In  early  1998,  a   faction   led   by   Jean-Bosco
           Ndayikengurukiye broke away from the CNDD and  became  an  armed
           rebel  group.  Ndayikengurukiye's  faction  itself  subsequently
           split into two (see below). What is now  left  of  the  original
           group formed by Leonard Nyagoma is not a rebel armed group,  and
           should not be confused with the  rebel  groups.  The  (original)
           CNDD is Hutu-dominated and was one of the G7  group  of  parties
           during the peace process.

19.4  The armed rebel groups: We list below the  main  armed  rebels  groups
      active in Burundi. Our source for this information is mainly  Annex  B
      of the CIPU Report. The armed wing of the (original) CNDD was the  FDD
      (Forces pour la d�fense de la d�mocratie), whose commander  was  Jean-
      Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. As stated above, Ndayikengurukiye  broke  away
      from the original group in early 1998. However, in October  2001,  the
      Ndayikengurukiye group itself split into  two  factions,  one  led  by
      Ndayikengurukiye and the other led by Pierre  Nkurunziza,  and  so  we
      have:

      (a)   the CNDD-FDD (Ndayikengurukiye), the rebel armed  group  led  by
         Ndayikengurukiye,  estimated  in  2003   to   have   about   3,000
         combatants.

      (b)   the  CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza),  the  rebel  armed  group,  led  by
         Nkurunziza. This is by far the largest  armed  group  in  Burundi,
         estimated in 2003 to have about 25,000 combatants.

            The Palipehutu-FNL (commonly referred to simply as the  FNL)  is
         a rebel armed group. In 2001, Agathon Rwasa replaced Kossan Kabura
         as leader. In August  2002,  the  Palipehutu-FNL  split  into  the
         following two factions:

      (c)   the FNL (Rwasa), under the leadership of Agathon  Rwasa.  It  is
         the larger and the more  powerful  of  the  two  FNL  rebel  armed
         factions, estimated in 2003 to have about 3,000 combatants.

            (d)   FNL (Mugabarabona), led by Alain Mugabarabona.

            There is one more armed rebel movement, called  the  "Front  for
         Democracy and the Nation in Burundi-FRODEBU-Mparaniragihugu".   It
         is referred to at the end of Annex B of the CIPU report  and  does
         not appear to have much, if any, impact on the peace  process,  or
         its prospects.


      The transitional period:

20.1  Burundi's 3-year transitional period began on  1  November  2001.  The
      transitional period itself has two phases, as follows:

      (a)   In the first phase of 18 months, President Buyoya (a Tutsi)  and
         Vice President Domitien Ndayizeye  (a  Hutu,  the  then  secretary
         general of the main opposition pro-Hutu FRODEBU party) were  sworn
         in (paragraphs 4.17 to 4.21  and  4.25  of  the  CIPU  report  and
         section 3 of the USSD Report for 2003).

      (b)   In the second phase of 18 months (which commenced  on  30  April
         2003), Domitien Ndayizeye succeeded Buyoya as President,  and  the
         Burundian Parliament confirmed Alphonse Kadege of the  Tutsi-based
         UPRONA  political  party  as  the  second  Vice  President  (first
         [paragraph of the USSD report for 2003 and paragraph 4.41 and 4.42
         of the CIPU report).

20.2  The second transitional phase  will  end  on  31  October  2004.  This
      should be followed by elections (on 1 November 2004) to  the  National
      assembly which will, in turn, lead to the election of a new President.
      However, as at 16 March 2004, a  legal  framework  for  the  elections
      (which would include an electoral code, a  law  on  political  parties
      etc.) had not yet been adopted (paragraph 4.58 of the CIPU report).


      The current state of the peace process

21.1  Three of the four rebel armed movements have  signed  agreements  with
      the Transitional Government. They are:

      (a)   The CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) faction - that is, the largest of  the
         two CNDD-FDD  factions  -  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement  on  3
         December 2002 (which was due to take effect on  30  December  2002
         but which was in fact delayed - see  below)  and  a  power-sharing
         agreement (the Pretoria Protocol) on 8 October 2003.  In  November
         2003,  it  entered  the  Transitional  Government,  assuming  four
         cabinet posts and other posts (the first  paragraph  of  the  USSD
         Report for 2003, paragraph 4.45  and Annex B (page 64) of the CIPU
         report). The agreement also provides for the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza)
         to have an agreed share of Burundi's armed  forces,  police  force
         etc.  There  is  provision  for   combatants   of   the   CNDD-FDD
         (Nkurunziza) to move to sites designated by the  Joint  Cease-fire
         Commission (a process known as 'cantonment'),  while  elements  of
         the Burundi  Armed  Forces  would  be  confined  to  agreed  zones
         (paragraph 4.45 of the CIPU report). Most combatants are  expected
         to be integrated into the Burundian Armed Forces; those unsuitable
         will be demobilised (Annex B of the CIPU report).

            The cease-fire agreements had also called for the deployment  of
         an international peace force and  the  establishment  of  a  Joint
         Cease-fire Commission to assist the parties  in  implementing  the
         agreements. By February 2004, there were 2,523 troops of the peace-
         keeping force (known as the Africa Mission in Burundi  (AMIB))  in
         place in Burundi as well as 43  international  military  observers
         (paragraph 4.47 of the CIPU report). Cantonment and demobilisation
         of former rebel fighters began at the end of June 2003  (paragraph
         4.48 of the CIPU Report).

            Clearly, there are problems with the cantonment  process  -  for
         example, who falls within  the  definition  of  a  "fighter"  (and
         therefore who can benefit from the  cantonment  process)  and  the
         hygiene conditions in the camps (see paragraphs 4.49 and  4.50  of
         the CIPU report). The cantonment process has been referred  to  as
         being currently "stalled" (see paragraphs 4.51  and  4.58  of  the
         CIPU  report).  Nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that  the   CNDD-FDD
         (Nkurunziza) is very much part of the peace process now.

      (b)   The CNDD-FDD  (Ndayikengurukiye)  faction  signed  a  cease-fire
         agreement with the Transitional Government in October 2002 and now
         has one member  in  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  announced  on  23
         November 2003 (see Annex B of the CIPU report, page 64).

      (c)   The FNL (Mugabarabona) faction entered into  peace  negotiations
         with the Transitional Government in August 2002 and signed a cease-
         fire agreement in October 2002 (Annex B of the CIPU Report on page
         64). It has taken part in the cantonment process (58 fighters were
         cantoned in June 2003: paragraph 4.48 of the CIPU report).  On  20
         December 2003, it announced that it had transformed itself into  a
         political party known as Front national de liberation Icanzo  (FNL
         Icanzo) and would apply to the Interior Ministry for  registration
         (Annex B on page 65 and paragraph 4.54 of the CIPU Report).

21.2  The FNL (Rwasa) faction is the  only  one  of  the  main  armed  rebel
      movements groups to have remained outside of the peace  process.  This
      was the position as at  the  end  of  the  year  2003,  as  the  first
      paragraph of  the  USSD  report  for  2003  states  (page  B1  of  the
      Appellant's bundle) and as at March 2004 (first sentence of  paragraph
      4.53 of the CIPU report). The second paragraph of the HRW report dated
      1 January 2004 (on page C1 of the Appellant's bundle) states that "the
      FNL"  agreed to talks with the President in early 2004. We assume that
      this is a  reference  to  the  FNL  (Rwasa)  faction,  since  the  FNL
      (Mugabarabona) faction had already been involved in the peace  process
      well before January 2004 and the FNL (Rwasa) faction is the  only  FNL
      faction to whom this sentence in the HRW report can refer.

21.3  We know from our own experience  in  dealing  with  asylum  and  human
      rights appeals that, whilst it is important to have regard to  whether
      cease-fire agreements have  been  signed,  it  is  also  important  to
      consider whether hostilities have actually ceased on  the  ground  and
      whether any cease-fire is holding. We can summarise our review in this
      regard of the objective material as follows:

       (a)    Although  the   cease-fire   agreed   between   the   CNDD-FDD
           (Nkurunziza) and the Transitional Government (due to take effect
           on 30 December 2002) was delayed, hostilities between the  CNDD-
           FDD (Nkurunziza) and  government  forces  ceased  following  the
           signing of the Pretoria Agreement on 8 October  2003  (paragraph
           6.1 of the CIPU Report,  attributed  to  an  IRIN  report  of  7
           January 2004);

      (b)   There is no indication in the objective evidence  before  us  of
           any   fighting   by   the   other    CNDD-FDD    faction    (the
           Ndayikengurukiye)  against  government  forces  or  by  the  FNL
           (Mugabarabona) against government forces, at least not  after  8
           October 2003. Accordingly,  the  evidence  is  that  hostilities
           between  the  CNDD-FDD  faction   (the   Ndayikengurukiye)   and
           government  forces  and  between  the  FNL  (Mugabarabona)   and
           government forces have ceased, at  least  from  8  October  2003
           onwards.

      (c)   Up until 8 October 2003, the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) was not  only
         engaged n fighting against government forces, the conflict between
         them escalated (see the  Amnesty  International  Report  dated  26
         January 2004, second sentence of the penultimate paragraph on page
         E1 of the Appellant's bundle).

      (d)   In the run-up  to  the  signing  of  the  Pretoria  Protocol  in
         October 2003, the FNL (Rwasa)  faction  attempted  to  derail  the
         negotiations between the  CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza)  rebels  and  the
         government by increasing its attacks in  early  September  2003  -
         see, for example, the fifth paragraph on the second page of the US
         Committee for Refugee, "World Refugee Survey 2004: Burundi"  (page
         D2 of the Appellant's bundle), which states:

                 Attempting  to  derail  renewed  negotiations  between  FDD
             rebels and the government, FNL  rebels  increased  attacks  in
             early September [2003].

      (e)   Following the cessation  of  hostilities  between  the  CNDD-FDD
         (Nkurunziza) and government forces, any fighting by  the  CNDD-FDD
         (Nkurunziza) forces has been  directed  against  the  FNL  (Rwasa)
         faction  with  (it  seems)  the  active  co-operation   or   tacit
         acceptance of government forces. See, for example:

            -    the USSD Report  for  2003  (page  B1  of  the  Appellant's
             bundle), which states:

            ............ the country remained  engaged  in  a  low-intensity
                 civil conflict and for  most  of  the  year,  the  conflict
                 involved  two  armed  oppositions  groups,  the   [CNDD-FDD
                 (Nkurunziza)]  faction  and  the  [Palipehutu-FNL   (Rwasa)
                 faction]. The  FNL  [Rwasa  faction]  ...........  launched
                 attacks on Bujumbura and its environs throughout the  year.
                 Although the  security  situation  in  most  parts  of  the
                 country  improved,  in  Bujumbura  Rural  Province,   which
                 surrounds the capital, fighting  continued  throughout  the
                 year.............. fighting reached  the  capital  city  of
                 Bujumbura in April, July and November 2003.

            Following the signing of the  November  power-sharing  protocol,
                 the Transitional Government allowed the CNDD-FDD to conduct
                 military operations against the  FNL  [Rwasa  faction].  In
                 December, outside of Bujumbura, the Transitional Government
                 reportedly allowed CNDD-FDD [Nkurunziza] forces to  operate
                 an armed police force parallel to that of the  Transitional
                 Government.

                 (our emphasis)

            -    the first and the third paragraphs of the HRW Report  dated
             1 January 2004 (page C1 of  the  Appellant's  bundle),   which
             state:

            "By the end of 2003, government forces, aided by their  new  FDD
                 allies, continued the war against the FNL, particularly  in
                 and around Bujumbura, the national capital";

                 and

            "The arrangements between government  soldiers  and  former  FDD
                 combatants fighting the FNL at the end of 2003  were  often
                 informal, making it difficult to  attribute  responsibility
                 for the conduct of their forces."


21.4  Drawing these strands together, the picture which emerges of the  year
      2003 is that there was, indeed,  an  escalation  of  the  conflict  in
      Burundi  over  the  year.  The  CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza)  escalated  its
      conflict with government forces,  perhaps  in  order  to  improve  its
      bargaining position at the negotiating table. The FNL (Rwasa)  faction
      escalated its conflict with government forces in an attempt to  derail
      the negotiations between the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) and the  government
      - perhaps to avoid being the only faction (and not even the largest at
      that) being left out of the peace process. After 8 October 2003, three
      of the four main rebel armed movements  (including  the  largest)  had
      ceased hostilities  against  the  government  forces.  The  government
      forces (now being "assisted" by the  CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza)  faction))
      continued to be engaged in conflict  with  the  FNL  (Rwasa)  faction.
      This explains why the HRW states (its report dated 1 January  2004  on
      page C1 of the Appellant's bundle):

                 "civil war ended in most of Burundi in  late  2003  as  the
             government concluded several agreements with the  major  rebel
             group, ......... the FDD".

            (Clearly, the reference to the FDD can only be to  the  CNDD-FDD
             (Nkurunziza) faction).

      Rape and sexual violence in Burundi

22.1  Ms. Benitez submitted that the objective  evidence  shows  that  there
      was a significant increase in the incidence  of  sexual  violence  and
      rape over the year 2003, that rape and sexual violence occurred within
      the context of the conflict and is used as a weapon of war and that it
      was systematically perpetrated by soldiers and rebels during 2003. She
      asked us to bear in mind that there was under-reporting of  rape.  Ms.
      Benitez submitted that the Appellant was  at  real  risk  of  rape  or
      sexual violence on account of her ethnic origin and gender. Mr. Deller
      submitted that, if rape was used, even in part, as a  weapon  of  war,
      then the fact that the conflict has  diminished  must  mean  that  the
      likelihood of the Appellant being at risk of conflict-related rape  is
      no more than a  theoretical  possibility.  In  response,  Ms.  Benitez
      submitted that the objective evidence  shows  that  rape  also  occurs
      outside the conflict and is exacerbated by widespread  discrimination.
      In her submission, the present tense in which the  report  of  Amnesty
      International  of  24  February  2004  is  phrased  shows   that   the
      information was up-to-date at the time the report  was  published.  We
      can dispense with this last point by simply  referring  to  the  fifth
      paragraph of the report which makes it clear that the report is  based
      "in part" on research conducted during a visit to Burundi in September
      2003. We do not know what  else  Amnesty  International's  report  was
      based on, but it is clear that any anecdotal  evidence  on  which  the
      report is based was collected in September 2003 which, as we have seen
      from our analysis above, was at about the time of the  height  of  the
      conflict during the year 2003.

22.2  Before we turn to deal with the parties' submissions as summarised  in
      the preceding paragraph, we set out  various  relevant  parts  of  the
      objective evidence. It is not our intention to set out every  relevant
      piece of the evidence, but we stress that we have had  regard  to  the
      totality of the evidence.  We  have  supplied  some  headings  to  our
      collection of quotes, but  we  stress  that  these  headings  bear  no
      relevance to the analysis  and  merely  provide  a  structure  to  our
      selection of quotes. It is important to have regard to the text  under
      each heading, rather than the headings themselves.  We  have  supplied
      any emphasis to any quotes:

                 Level of sexual violence and rape over 2003:

      (a)   Amnesty International (in its report of 24  February  2004)  and
         the UN Special Rapporteur (in a report  published  on  20  October
         2003) noted a significant increase in the  incidence  of  rape  in
         2003, the victims being women, girls and  boys.  The  perpetrators
         include soldiers of the  regular  army,  members  of  armed  rebel
         groups, armed criminal gangs and  private  individuals  (paragraph
         6.6 of the CIPU Report). In her report of  20  October  2003,  the
         United Nations Special Rapporteur states:

                 Mass rapes, often gang rapes,  perpetrated  by  members  of
             the armed groups and soldiers of the regular army, and also by
             unknown persons or deserters from both types of  forces,  have
             recently increased considerably.  (paragraph 6.24 of the  CIPU
             report)

      (b)   The USSD report for 2003 states:

                  In  November  and  December  [2003],  in  Bujumbura  Rural
             Province, there were reports of a significant increase in  the
             killing and rape of civilians and the destruction of homes  by
             FAB [Burundi Armed Forces] soldiers following their relocation
             to the province (section 1.g).

                 During the year, soldiers and rebels  systematically  raped
             women and girls, and the number of  rapes  increased  compared
             with that of the previous year,  according  to  U.N.  and  NGO
             information. .............................. (section 1.g)

            Whether sexual violence and rape occurs in the "context  of  the
         conflict":

      (c)   The USSD report for 2003 states:

                 The NGO attributed the increase in rape  to  the  conflict.
             ............ (section 1.g)

      (d)   Amnesty International (in its report of 24 February  2004,  page
         1) stated:

                 Like all human rights abuses in Burundi,  rape  has  become
             an entrenched feature of the crisis because the perpetrators -
             whether  government  soldiers,  members  of  armed   political
             groups, or private individuals - have largely not been brought
             to justice. .................... Rape has, however, also  been
             exacerbated  by  widespread   discrimination   against   women
             ...................... (page 1)

                 In 2003, national and international non-governmental  human
             rights and humanitarian organizations, international agencies,
             and government authorities reported an  alarming  increase  in
             the number of cases of rape in the context of Burundi's  armed
             conflict.  ..........................   Accurate   statistical
             comparisons are in fact impossible as it is only recently that
             information on rape began to be recorded, despite its  endemic
             nature. ................ (page 1)

       (e)    On  the  other  hand,  the  IRIN  article  states   that   the
         perpetrators are "sometimes" combatants and that, "in many cases",
         they were not combatants but civilians, including family  members.
         This suggests that most sexual violence is not conflict-related.

            Whether sexual violence and rape are used as weapons of war:

      (f)   Amnesty International  (in  its  report  of  24  February  2004)
         states:

                 The perpetrators  are  largely  members  of  the  Burundian
             armed forces and armed political  groups,  as  well  as  armed
             criminal gangs who not only rob but also rape... Even from the
             limited evidence available, the  scale  of  rape  indicates  a
             deliberate  strategy  in  some  parts  of   the   country   by
             belligerents to use rape and other forms  of  sexual  violence
             against women as a weapon of war to instil  terror  among  the
             civilian population and to degrade and humiliate it. (page 1)

           (g)   However, it should be  noted  that  Amnesty  International
         also stated in the same report:

                 While many cases of rape and sexual violence appear  to  be
             indiscriminate   and   due   to   lack   of   discipline   and
             accountability among troops, in some instances it appears that
             rape is used more systematically to ill-treat,  humiliate  and
             degrade the population as well as to promote the dominance  of
             the perpetrating group, be it government or  opposition.  Both
             national  and  international   organizations   in   particular
             expressed concern that during 2003 and government armed forces
             and the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) committed  scores  of  rapes  in
             Ruyigi province, as well as human rights abuses  and  looting,
             in a pattern of reprisal and counter-reprisal. (page 5)

      (h)   The USSD Report  for  2003  (first  paragraph  of  section  1.g)
         refers to reprisals by the FAB (Burundian  Armed  Forces)  against
         civilians, in  reprisal  for  rebel  attacks,  and  for  suspected
         collaboration with revels. Such reprisals included rape.

            Whether race is a factor:

      (i)   The USSD report for 2003 states (section 1.g):

                 Rebels killed, beat, kidnapped, and stole  from  civilians,
             and raped women (see Section 1.b.). On occasion,  Hutu  rebels
             deliberately targeted Tutsi citizens.

      (j)   In  its  report  of  24  February  2004,  Amnesty  International
         stated:

                 Scores of rape of Tutsi women were for  example,  committed
             by the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) in Ruhwago,  Ruyigo  province  in
             February and March 2003, in reprisal for rape or other  abuses
             committed by government forces in Hutu areas of the  province.
             (page 5)

            Rape outwith the context of the conflict:

      (k)   Amnesty International suggests that rape, more generally, is  on
         the increase in Burundi - see page 1 of its report of 24  February
         2004.

            Evidence which attributes the increase in rape  to  non-conflict
         related reasons (domestic rape):

      (l)   The USSD report for 2003 states (section 1.g):

                 According to AI, domestic rape (outside the context of  the
             conflict) was common, including rape of young girls, committed
             with the belief  that  it  would  prevent  or  cure  HIV/AIDS.
             According to an NGO, this belief may explain why the  majority
             of rapes committed during the year  involved  victims  younger
             than 18 years old, and in  one  case,  involved  a  2-year-old
             girl. However, information on rape has only recently begun  to
             be  recorded.  Few  cases  of  rape  were  reported   to   the
             authorities,....................................

            Whether the increase in rape  is  due  to  non-conflict  related
         reasons (criminality):

      (m)   Amnesty International (in its  report  of  26  May  2004,  first
         paragraph, see page E1 of  the  Appellant's  bundle)  states  that
         armed robbery by criminal gangs also increased  dramatically  over
         2003 and that this was often accompanied by rape.

      (n)   Amnesty International in its report  of  13  January  2004  also
         referred to the increase in violent crime, stating:

                 The proliferation of small arms  contributed  to   dramatic
             rise in violent armed crime  in  2003.  Armed  criminal  gangs
             multiplied. (paragraph 6.122 of the CIPU report)

      (o)   The UN Secretary General,  in  his  report  of  16  March  2004,
         stated:

                  While  hostilities  have  generally   eased,   criminality
             appears to have increased, aided by the thousands  of  weapons
             of [sic] in circulation. Attacks, ambushes and  harassment  of
             individuals and groups along the  main  road  are  commonplace
             .............. Refugees and internally displaced persons  have
             also  reported  cases   of   rape   and   general   insecurity
             ................... (see paragraphs 6.120  and  6.121  of  the
             CIPU report).

                 Since the 2003 report of the Special  Rapporteur  on  human
             rights in Burundi, there has been little  improvement  in  the
             human  rights  situation  in  the   country.............   The
             civilian  population,  especially  the  elderly,   women   and
             children, are the primary targets of  the  acts  of  violence,
             which are committed with impunity.  (paragraph 6.2 of the CIPU
             report).


22.3  There is very little evidence that race  is  a  factor  in  rape.  The
      evidence above (see sub-paragraphs (i) and (j) above) relates to  rape
      of Tutsi women (the Appellant is a Hutu). The fact that there is  very
      little mention in the objective evidence of race  being  a  factor  in
      rape incidents suggests that, even in the case of Tutsi women,  it  is
      not reasonably likely that race is a factor. We are satisfied that, if
      the Appellant is at risk of rape or sexual violence  in  Burundi,  her
      Hutu ethnicity is not reasonably likely to be a factor in the mind  of
      any would-be persecutor. This means that any risk of  rape  or  sexual
      violence she faces is the general one, faced by women  in  general  in
      Burundi.

22.4  We agree that the evidence does suggest that rape and sexual  violence
      increased over 2003 (see sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above).  We  agree
      that, where rape or  sexual  violence  is  committed  by  soldiers  or
      combatants, the impunity they appear to have enjoyed has  been  a  key
      factor in allowing the abuse to continue or reach the  proportions  it
      did  in 2003. We agree that discrimination against  women  exacerbates
      the problem. We note that the USSD Report refers to an NGO attributing
      the increase in rape to the conflict  (sub-paragraph  (c)  above)  and
      that Amnesty International refers to an alarming increase in  rape  in
      the context of the armed conflict (sub-paragraph (d) above).  Although
      Amnesty International refers to a deliberate strategy to use rape as a
      weapon of war (sub-paragraph (e) above), it also states, in  the  same
      report (sub-paragraph (e) above) that "many cases" of rape and  sexual
      violence appear to be "indiscriminate and due to  lack  of  discipline
      and accountability" and that, "in some instances", it  appears  to  be
      used "more systematically" to ill-treat,  humiliate  and  degrade  the
      population. On the other hand, IRIN states that the  perpetrators  are
      "sometimes"  combatants  and  "in  many  cases"  not  combatants   but
      civilians (sub-paragraph (h) above). Furthermore, the USSD Report  for
      2003 (sub-paragraph  (l)  above)  refers  to  the  majority  of  rapes
      committed during 2003 involving victims younger than 18 years old  and
      that an NGO attributes this to the  belief  that  intercourse  with  a
      young girl would prevent  or  cure  HIV/AIDS.  The  evidence  is  that
      criminality (in the form of violent crime and armed robbery,  ambushes
      and attacks  etc)  has  also  increased  and  that  such  increase  in
      criminality has "often" been accompanied by rape  (see  sub-paragraphs
      (m), (n) and (o) above). The evidence is that rape  generally  appears
      to be on the increase in Burundi (sub-paragraph (k) above).    Viewing
      the evidence as a whole, we are not persuaded that  the  incidence  of
      sexual violence and rape in Burundi over 2003 is explained by its  use
      as a weapon of war or by way of reprisal, although we accept that this
      accounts for some incidents. On the whole  of  the  evidence,  we  are
      drawn to the conclusion that the main and overwhelming reason for  the
      incidence of rape and sexual violence in 2003 is  simply  because  the
      fighting created the chaos and the conditions in  which  undisciplined
      soldiers abused their position and power and criminals/civilians  took
      advantage of the general chaos in order to rob, rape etc.

22.5  Our conclusions in paragraphs 22.3 and 22.4 above mean that  there  is
      nothing personal to the Appellant which exposes her to a risk of  rape
      or sexual violence  in  Burundi.  Her  asylum  claim  cannot  succeed,
      although we still need to consider Article 3. It is  clear,  from  the
      Court of Appeal's judgement in Hariri v. The Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 807, that absent anything personal
      to a claimant which puts him /  her  at  real  risk  of  serious  ill-
      treatment, it is not enough to  show  that  the  ill-treatment  feared
      occurs frequently or routinely. In order to satisfy  the  "real  risk"
      standard, it must be shown that there is a consistent pattern of gross
      and systematic violation of fundamental human rights in  Burundi  (see
      paragraphs 4, 8 and 9 of the judgement).  We  bear  this  in  mind  in
      deciding whether the Appellant is at real risk of any ill-treatment by
      way of rape or sexual violence which women in general in  Burundi  may
      face.

22.6  In the first place, the evidence shows that the  conflict  in  Burundi
      has diminished. In this regard, we noted that:

      (a)   In December 2003, the UN Secretary-General reported in  December
         2003  that  FNL  (Rwasa)  has  been  "considerably  weakened   and
         isolated" since its attacks on Bujumbura in July  2003  and  that,
         consequently,  its  ability  to  hinder  the  peace  process   was
         considered to be limited (paragraph 4.53 of the CIPU Report).

      (b)   In its report of 13 January 2004, Amnesty International  stated:
         "Though numerically quite small, [FNL (Rwasa)]  has  shown  it  is
         capable of maintaining low-level action as well as  launching  its
         operations relatively easily (paragraph 4.53 of the CIPU  report).



      (c)   By March 2004, fighting by FNL (Rwasa) was  mainly  concentrated
         in the Bujumbura area (see the final sentence of paragraph 6.1  of
         the CIPU report).

      (d)   The UN Secretary-General,  in  his  report  of  16  March  2004,
           stated:

                  While  the  cease-fire  is  generally  holding  and  major
             military operations have ceased throughout most of the country
             ........... joint  operations  conducted  by  [the  government
             armed forces] and the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) continue.
                       (the final sentence of paragraph  5.35  of  the  CIPU
           report);

                 ............... the  security  situation  has  dramatically
             improved and calm has returned to most provinces.  This  is  a
             major change from the  volatile  situation  experienced  until
             recently, when daily attacks were still the norm. Nevertheless
             ...........   continued   hostilities   between   the    joint
             [government armed forced]/CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) forces and the
             FNL (Rwasa) in Bujumbura continue to seriously affect security
             in  those  areas................    While   hostilities   have
             generally eased,................... (paragraph 6.2 of the CIPU
             Report).

      (e)   On 21 April 2003, FNL (Rwasa) announced that it had  decided  to
         suspend  hostilities  against  the  Transitional  Government.  Its
         spokesman said: "We have decided to stop fighting immediately  but
         if  attacked   we   will   defend   ourselves".   The   Government
         communication minister reacted by saying that there  would  be  no
         military  offensive  by  government  forces  if  the  FNL  stopped
         attacks. However, the next  day  (22  April)  there  was  a  clash
         between government and the FNL (Rwasa) forces in Bujumbura  Rural,
         each side blaming the other  for  an  unprovoked  attack.  It  was
         speculated that the clash may have resulted from news of the truce
         not yet being communicated down the lines on  one  or  both  sides
         (paragraph 4.53 of the CIPU report).

22.7  The objective material before us does  not  extend  to  the  situation
      post the above announcement by the FNL and the clash on 22 April 2004.
      Accordingly, we do not have the benefit of  objective  material  which
      indicates  whether  the  FNL  (Rwasa)   faction   has   honoured   its
      announcement to  suspend  hostilities.   However,  even  before  their
      announcement, the objective evidence shows that their operations  were
      mainly confined to the Bujumbura and the Bujumbura Rural  areas.  Even
      before their announcement, the UN Secretary-General's  stated  in  his
      report of 16 March 2004 that  "the  cease-fire  is  generally  holding
      ........ the security situation has  dramatically  improved  .........
      calm has returned to most provinces". Accordingly,  even  if  the  FNL
      (Rwasa)  faction  does  not  honour  its   announcement   to   suspend
      hostilities, we see no reason to suppose, even on the low standard  of
      a reasonable likelihood, that the situation would be any different (or
      materially different) to that described by the UN Secretary-General in
      his report of 16 March 2004. This refers to a  situation  of  calm  in
      most provinces, although security concerns remained for the  Bujumbura
      area.

22.8  The reduction in the conflict, as clearly show above,  ought  to  lead
      to a reduction in the general conditions  (of  chaos  etc)  which  are
      conducive  to  would-be   perpetrators.   However,   criminality   has
      increased. Whilst we bear in mind the  evidence  that  criminality  is
      accompanied by rape, we are satisfied, having regard to  the  guidance
      in Hariri, that the Appellant is not at real risk of  rape  or  sexual
      violence in Burundi.

      The UNHCR's letter

23.1  We turn now to the UNHCR letter dated 13 February 2004,  the  body  of
      which states (paragraph numbering is ours):

      (a)        You will note from UNHCR's position  on  Burundi  which  is
             set out below, that we do,  .....,  have  protection  concerns
             about returning asylum seekers to Burundi.

      (b)        Our last formal comment on the situation  in  this  country
             was issued in April 2002 and we are yet to receive  a  current
             update. In April 2002, UNHCR noted that  the  ratification  by
             the Burundian National Assembly of the Arusha Peace Accord  in
             August 2000 and the inauguration of a transitional  government
             in November 2001 were important steps towards the  achievement
             of peace and reconciliation in Burundi. Notwithstanding  these
             important developments, the absence of a cease-fire  agreement
             between that the army and the  various  rebel  factions  meant
             that the security situation remained volatile  and  dangerous,
             resulting in the continued flow of refugees from Burundi.

      (c)        UNHCR's view was that  Burundians  of  both  ethnic  groups
             continued to be susceptible and vulnerable to  persecution  or
             violence perpetrated  by  both  State  and  non-state  actors.
             Whilst politically active individuals  were  in  this  respect
             most at risk, other prominent members  of  society  and  those
             related to them were also at risk. Given that the civil war in
             Burundi was based on political and ethnic differences  between
             the warring parties, ordinary civilians repeatedly fell victim
             to ethnically motivated violence. In light of all  the  above,
             UNHCR counselled States to exercise caution before making  any
             decision to remove an individual to Burundi.

      (d)        Pending a formal UNHCR Headquarters update on  Burundi,  we
             are advising that legal  representatives  and  decision-makers
             should continue to be guided by the April 2002 position.  This
             is because it  remains  valid  in  its  material  particulars,
             especially as regards the risks of persecution for reasons  of
             ethnicity or political opinion, real or imputed; the fact that
             the continuing conflict is left open by the absence of a cease-
             fire agreement; and the  fact  that  widespread  violence  and
             abuse warrants caution in  decisions  to  return  unsuccessful
             asylum seekers.

      (e)        The continuing validity  of  our  April  2002  position  is
             further affirmed by credible  publicly  available  information
             about current developments in Burundi. Useful sources  include
             Human  Rights  Watch,  Amnesty  International,  the   European
             Country of Origin Network, The World Health  Organisation  and
             the BBC Online news service.

       (f)         These  and  other  sources  confirm  that  intense  armed
             conflict  continues  to  rage  between  government  and  rebel
             forces. The Forces for the Defence of Democracy,  the  largest
             Hutu rebel group led by Pierre Nkurunziza, signed a cease-fire
             with the government in December 2002 under which the old  army
             was to be dismantled and  a  new  one  created.  This  crucial
             transition is, however, yet to be carried out. The  cease-fire
             fell through and the Forces for the Defence for Democracy  has
             led attacks in major cities this year. In July this year,  300
             rebels and 15 government troops  were  killed,  and  thousands
             fled, during a major assault on the capital Bujumbura  by  the
             smallest but oldest Hutu rebel group, the PALIPEHUTU-FNL, also
             known as the National Liberation Front. This group refuses  to
             hold talks with the government  without  the  presence  of  Mr
             Mandela as negotiator.

      (g)        The precarious security and protection situation  continues
             despite  the  appointment  of  a  Hutu  president,   President
             Domitien Ndayizeye, who succeeded Pierre Buyoya, the Tutsi who
             headed the transitional government mentioned above.  President
             Ndayizeye worked under President Buyoya as vice president  for
             18 months. The rebel groups see the new  President  as  window
             dressing as the army continues to be dominated by Tutsis. They
             demand a sharp reduction in the Tutsi presence  in  the  army,
             and the dismantling of  'regroupment  camps'  which  currently
             have a capacity to hold more than 800,000 Hutus.

      (h)        The political instability in Burundi  is  worsened  by  the
             extreme humanitarian crisis facing the country.  Approximately
             10,000 persons are  displaced  each  month  by  the  violence.
             Health and other basic  services  have  been  fractured  as  a
             result of the  insecurity  and  resultant  inaccessibility  of
             certain areas, including Bujumbura rural provinces. Health and
             sanitary conditions are very severe, the malaria situation  in
             Burundi remains alarming, and the  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  is
             also on the rise. Thus, the political and humanitarian  crisis
             in Burundi combine  to  create  a  very  unstable  and  unsafe
             atmosphere for civilians caught in the middle of the conflict.



23.2  At paragraph (d), UNHCR states that its April  2002  position  remains
      valid in its "material particulars". Paragraph (d) goes on to  mention
      the absence  of  a  cease-fire  agreement  as  one  of  the  "material
      particulars". Paragraph (f) is  misleading.  The  assertion  that  the
      cease-fire  agreement  between  the  government   and   the   CNDD-FDD
      (Nkurunziza) fell through is immediately followed by  a  reference  to
      attacks by the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza). The impression given, which is a
      misleading one, is that the CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) - the largest  rebel
      group - is still engaged in conflict  with  government  forces  as  at
      February 2004. This is simply not so. This  misleading  impression  is
      compounded by paragraph (d) which states that the continuing  conflict
      is left open by the absence of a cease-fire agreement.  Paragraph  (d)
      makes no mention of the fact that a cease-fire between the  government
      and the largest of the rebel groups had been agreed, that  hostilities
      between them had in fact ceased and that only the FNL (Rwasa)  faction
      remained outside the peace process.

23.3  Paragraph (f) goes on to refer to attacks in July "this  year",  which
      cannot be a reference to July 2004, because the letter was written  in
      February 2004. Paragraph (f), when read as a whole, especially in  the
      context of the first sentence which expressly refers to "intense armed
      conflict" continuing to rage between the government and rebel  forces,
      gives the impression that, as at February 2004, the government  forces
      were still engaged in conflict against the CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza)  and
      the FNL (Rwasa) factions. Whilst it is correct that conflict continued
      in February 2004 between the government forces  and  the  FNL  (Rwasa)
      faction, it is incorrect to imply (as we are satisfied  the  paragraph
      does)  that  fighting  continued  as  at  February  2004  between  the
      government forces and the  CNDD-FDD  (Nkurunziza).  Finally,  we  note
      that, according to the Memo of Ms. Benitez  attached  to  the  UNHCR's
      letter, UNHCR's policy officer (Ms. N. Masri)  confirmed by  telephone
      to Ms. Benitez on 21 September 2004  that  legal  representatives  and
      decision-makers should continue to be guided  by  the  UNHCR's  formal
      position of April 2002.  If the Memo from Ms. Benitez is  an  accurate
      reflection of the conversation between Ms. Benitez and UNHCR's  policy
      officer, we take into account the fact that UNHCR continues  to  stand
      by its April 2002 position even as at 21 September 2004.  However,  we
      also take note of the fact that, since the letter from the UNHCR of 13
      February 2004, the report of the UN Secretary-General of 16 March 2004
      has been issued. In that report, the UN Secretary-General stated  that
      the cease-fire is generally holding and that calm has returned to most
      provinces (see paragraph 22.6 above).

23.4  For all of these reasons, we  place  very  little  weight  on  UNHCR's
      letter of 13 February 2004 and the advice of  its  policy  officer  in
      September 2004 that its position of April 2002 still holds. We  stress
      that we have not reached this position lightly and it is precisely for
      this reason that we  have  set  out  our  analysis  of  the  objective
      situation in some considerable detail. It has been our experience that
      UNHCR has, especially in more recent times, cautioned Signatory States
      to the Refugee Convention against returning failed asylum  seekers  to
      countries in circumstances where  it  is  evident  that,  in  reality,
      UNHCR's concerns go beyond any issue of Refugee Convention persecution
      and  extend  to  general  humanitarian  conditions,  general  lack  of
      security and the orderly management  of  returns.  We  can  understand
      UNHCR's desire to have regard to these considerations but there  is  a
      very real concern that these considerations are being  conflated  with
      the criteria for refugee status. They should not be.

24.   For all the reasons we have given above, we  are  satisfied  that  the
      Adjudicator reached the right conclusions on  the  Appellant's  asylum
      and human rights  claims.   It  is  not  reasonably  likely  that  the
      Appellant would be subjected to ill-treatment amounting to persecution
      or in breach of Article 3 in Burundi on account  of  her  race  and/or
      gender. Accordingly, her removal to Burundi would not be in breach  of
      the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention  or  her
      human rights.

      Summary of conclusions

25.   In summary, our conclusions are:

      (a)   The civil war in Burundi has ended.  Accordingly,  the  guidance
         in the Secretary of State for the Home Department v.  Adan  should
         not be applied in determining the risk of  future  persecution  in
         Burundi.

      (b)   Hutus are not, in general, at real risk of  treatment  amounting
         to persecution in Burundi.

      (c)   A Hutu or a Tutsi woman is not, in  general,  at  real  risk  of
         rape or sexual violence in  Burundi  on  account  of  her  race  /
         gender.


      Decision

      The appeal is DISMISSED.
