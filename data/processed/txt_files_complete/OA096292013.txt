For the Appellant:     Mr V Makol, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant is a citizen of India,  born  on  27th  September  1988.
    The Appellant applied for Entry Clearance for the purpose of settlement
    as a spouse.  The  application  was  refused  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 19th March 2013 on the grounds that the  Appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not  satisfied  that  the   Appellant's
    relationship with his sponsor was genuine or subsisting  or  that  they
    intended to live permanently in the United Kingdom, nor was  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer satisfied that the Appellant or sponsor had  provided
    any savings sufficient to meet the financial requirements.

2.    The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before First Tier  Tribunal
    Judge Khan sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  13th  January  2014.   In  a
    determination promulgated on 3rd February 2014 the  Appellant's  appeal
    was allowed.

3.    On 20th February 2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  lodged  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Those grounds noted that the sponsor and
    the Appellant now had a young daughter and that the  Immigration  Judge
    had taken into consideration the best  interests  of  the  child.   The
    Secretary of State submitted that the child was not born at the date of
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision,  and  contended  that   the
    Immigration  Judge  had  erred  materially  in  law  by   taking   into
    consideration the best interests of the child, which had  rendered  the
    proportionality assessment to be flawed.  It  was  submitted  that  the
    Immigration Judge could only take into consideration the  circumstances
    as they were at the date of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision,
    even when considering the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

4.    Further, it  was  contended  that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements and that there were no savings to  make  up  the
    shortfall.  The Secretary of State argued that  the  Immigration  Judge
    had failed to give adequate reasons for finding  that  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 rights would be breached and  had  failed  to  give  adequate
    consideration to the Secretary of State's policies.

5.    On 12th March 2014, First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sommerville  granted
    permission to appeal. Judge Sommerville noted that the  background  was
    not in issue, but that the  sponsor  could  not  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of Appendix FM but that the First Tier Tribunal Judge  had
    allowed the appeal on human rights grounds relying on the authority  of
    MM [2013] EWHC 1900.  He considered the grounds to be arguable.  It  is
    agreed by both parties that the reference at paragraph 6 in  the  grant
    of permission to the effect that the grounds are without  merit  is  in
    fact a typographical error and that what the learned  Judge  meant  was
    that the grounds do have merit.

6.    It is on that basis that the appeal comes before  me.   The  Secretary
    of State appears by her Home Office  Presenting  Officer  Miss  Holmes.
    The Appellant appears by her legal representative Mr Makol.   Mr  Makol
    is familiar with this matter, having appeared  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.  This is of course an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State.
    However, for the purpose of continuity throughout  all  proceedings  in
    this matter, Mr Kumar is referred to as the Appellant and the Secretary
    of State as the Respondent.

The Facts

7.    Whilst I acknowledge that I am considering whether or not there is  an
    error of law in the decision of the First Tier Tribunal, it is in  this
    instant case relevant to set out certain basic facts.   Judge  Khan  in
    granting the appeal found the sponsor to be a credible  and  consistent
    witness and accepted the genuineness of the  relationship  between  her
    and the Appellant.  The Appellant's application for settlement had been
    dated 21st December 2012. The Notice of Refusal was  dated  19th  March
    2013 and the appeal came before the First Tier Tribunal  Judge  against
    the Notice of Refusal on 13th January 2014. Against that background  it
    is relevant to note that the sponsor gave birth to a child  Jessica  on
    25th August 2013.  It is consequently fair to state that  at  the  date
    that the application was made, it is highly probable that  neither  the
    Appellant nor the sponsor were aware that she was  pregnant.   Further,
    there would be  no  additional  evidence  submitted  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer at the time that the Entry Clearance Officer made his
    decision, but when grounds of appeal  are  lodged  to  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal the sponsor's pregnancy was disclosed and it was averred  that
    this would be further proof of the genuine and subsisting relationship,
    something which was accepted by Judge Khan in the First Tier  Tribunal.



Submissions

8.    Miss Holmes reminds me  of  the  provisions  of  Section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2000 setting out the matter  to
    be considered when new evidence is considered by a Tribunal and to  the
    right of appeal generally to be found under Section 82(2)(b) so far  as
    it relates  to  an  immigration  decision  and  the  refusal  of  Entry
    Clearance.  She submits that  as  a  result  of  consideration  of  the
    relevant sections of the 2002 Act, the Judge should not have taken into
    account the interests of a child, as there was  no  child  around,  nor
    consequently should the interests of the  child  have  been  considered
    pursuant to Article 8 because clearly it would have been impossible for
    the Entry Clearance Officer to have done so.  Miss Holmes contends that
    it  was  conceded  that  the  Appellant  cannot  meet   the   financial
    requirements in the new Immigration Rules as the threshold is  �18,600.
    She also does not seek to challenge paragraph  25  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge's determination whereas as a matter of fact he finds the
    sponsor is earning �15,806 and at some stage of 2012/2013 her  earnings
    went up to over �18,600.   That apart Miss Holmes  does  no  more  than
    reiterate the grounds of appeal and asked me to find that  there  is  a
    material error of law.

9.    Mr Makol accepts  that  the  correct  date  for  the  evidence  to  be
    considered is the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision,  but
    that the circumstances for the First Tier Tribunal  actually  appertain
    to the date of decision namely that a child has been conceived but  not
    born, and that the correct approach may well have been  the  matter  to
    have been returned to the Entry Clearance Officer to  consider  afresh,
    but that the Judge was perfectly entitled to take the  stance  that  he
    did.

10.   Mr Makol further points out that  it  was  conceded  that  the  strict
    financial figure set out in the current Immigration Rules could not  be
    met by the Appellant at the date of hearing, and that thereafter it  is
    appropriate   to   look   at   the   genuineness/subsistence   of   the
    marriage/relationship under Article 8 and the fact that a child has now
    been born.  He reminds me that the First Tier Tribunal Judge found  the
    sponsor to be credible and that it is necessary to look at this  matter
    on the balance of probability.  He acknowledges that the best interests
    of the child were therefore not before the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  and
    therefore for the Judge to have dealt with it may  well  have  been  an
    error of law, but it is not material and that the Judge has gone on  to
    consider all aspects properly to make proper conclusions.

The Law

11.   Errors of legislative interpretation,  failure  to  following  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions on  fact  or  evaluation  give  legally
    inadequate  reasons  for  the  decision  and   procedural   unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

12.   It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration  Judge  to  give
    too little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality
    is alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to  fail
    to deal with every factual issue of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story told is untrue.  If a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

13.   This is a category of case that comes  about  very  rarely,  namely  a
    scenario where at date of application there was no child of the family,
    but at date of appeal there was.  The Appellant  cannot  be  criticised
    for her approach. The sponsor is employed by the NHS and it is accepted
    that she cannot meet the requirements of  the  financial  threshold  of
    �18,600 imposed by the new Immigration Rules.  It is important to  look
    at the manner in which the Judge addressed this case.  Firstly, he  has
    looked at the position that the case was refused by  the  Secretary  of
    State, firstly on the ground  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied that the relationship was genuine and subsisting and that the
    parties intended to live permanently  together.  He  has  found  having
    heard her evidence that he, on the balance of probabilities,  disagrees
    with that and that that is bolstered by the birth of  Jessica.   It  is
    important to note at paragraph 23 of the First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    determination has merely said that the genuineness and  subsistence  of
    that relationship  between  the  couple  is  assisted  by  the  further
    evidence of Jessica's birth, but that having heard the evidence in  the
    round, he was  satisfied  that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.  He found the sponsor's testimony to be  credible.   That
    was a decision he was entitled to make and therefore whilst he may have
    erred in giving due consideration to the best interests of the child, I
    do not find that it is material to the outcome. The  alternative  would
    have been to have remitted this matter back to the Secretary  of  State
    and to have prolonged  a  process  which  would  lead  to  the  current
    scenario.

14.   Further,  so  far  as  the  financial  position  of  the  sponsor  was
    concerned, it is accepted that she  lost  income  whilst  on  maternity
    leave.  The Judge has given a full and detailed analysis of the leading
    authority of MM and thereafter gone on to make findings at paragraph 25
    that it would be disproportionate to keep  the  family  unit  separated
    because the sponsor's earnings  were  below  �18,600  at  the  date  of
    application.  That was a finding that the Judge was  entitled  to  make
    and that he heard the  evidence,  reasoned  it  through  and  made  his
    decision.

15.   I acknowledge that between the hearing of this matter and the  handing
    down of this determination the Court of Appeal has handed down Judgment
    in MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  The Court of Appeal was not expounding  new
    law but saying what it always was.  This is not  an  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules but Article 8.

16.   In  such  circumstances  the  decision  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    discloses no material error of law and the appeal of the  Secretary  of
    State is dismissed and the decision  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  is
    upheld.








Decision

17.   The decision of the First Tier Tribunal discloses  no  material  error
    of law and the appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed

18.   The First Tier Tribunal Judge did not make an Order pursuant to Rule
    45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
     No application is made to vary that Order and none is made.
