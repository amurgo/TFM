                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The Appeal

The appellant is a citizen of Hungary and was born on 30 April 1987.

The appeal is brought against the decision dated 7 July 2013  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge C M Phillips and Sir Jeffery James KBE  CMG  which  dismissed
the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 5 February  2013
to make a deportation order against him under the  Immigration  (Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

Background

The appellant came to the  UK  on  10  August  2010.  On  27  June  2012  he
assaulted his partner. The assault was described by the sentencing judge  as
"savage", three of the victim's  teeth  being  knocked  out,  amongst  other
"very serious" injuries suffered.  On 29 June 2012 he was convicted  of  two
counts of assault by beating and one count of assault causing actual  bodily
harm. On 3 August 2012 he  was  sentenced  to  16  months  imprisonment  and
ordered to pay ï¿½500 to  the  victim.  He  was  released  from  detention  on
immigration bail on 25 March 2013.

Grounds of Appeal

The First-tier Tribunal found that the  appellant  represented  "a  genuine,
present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
interests of society" and dismissed his appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations
and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

The grounds of appeal  argue  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  set  out  the
correct law and tests for the deportation of an EEA  national  but  did  not
apply them correctly. The appellant could not be said to  pose  a  "present"
threat as :

 a. this was his first offence
 b. the likelihood of reconviction was stated to be "low" according to  the
    Probation Service and the panel erred in departing from the  assessment
    of this professional body
 c. a letter from the Probation Service dated 14 June 2013 stated  that  "I
    am not aware of any imminent concerns" and the panel were wrong at [45]
    not to place weight on that opinion
 d. the appellant had not reoffended in the two months prior to the hearing
    when he had been on bail

The  grounds  also  argued  that  the  panel  misdirected  themselves   when
referring to Maslov v Austria (Application no. 1638/03), a case relating  to
a minor.

There is no challenge in the grounds to the dismissal of  the  appeal  under
Article 8 and that matter went no further before me.

My Decision

I did not find that  any  of  the  grounds  had  merit  as  the  panel  made
permissible findings on the evidence before them.

The panel were clearly aware that this was  a  first  offence.  They  accept
that in terms at [41].

The grounds are not correct in stating that the Probation Service found  the
appellant to  be  at  low  risk  of  reoffending.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
correctly stated at [6] and [44] that he was assessed as being  a  low  risk
of  reoffending  but  medium  risk  of  serious  harm   to   known   adults,
specifically his former partner whom he had seen since being  released  from
detention and other future partners. The panel was entitled to place  weight
at [44] on the statement in the letter from the Probation Service  dated  14
June 2013 that the level of risk had not altered. They  were  also  entitled
to take into account at [44] that on the appellant's  own  evidence  he  had
resumed his relationship with the victim, something  the  Probation  Service
identified as likely to increase the serious risk of harm.

The First-tier Tribunal  addressed  the  final  sentence  of  the  Probation
Service letter dated 14 June 2013 in terms at  [45].  The  appellant  argues
that the statement that the Probation Service did  not  have  "any  imminent
concerns" meant that he could not be regarded as a "present" threat.  As  in
the previous paragraph, the same letter stated clearly that the  appellant's
risk of reoffending and risk of serious harm to others remained the same  as
in the original report. Where the risk assessment  remained  the  same,  the
Tribunal was not obliged to read this sentence as if  it  meant  that  there
was no risk of reoffending or serious harm. Taking it in the context of  the
remainder of the letter and the earlier risk assessment,  the  Tribunal  was
not obliged to find that this single sentence indicated that  the  appellant
was not  a  "present"  threat  to  the  UK.  The  Probation  Service  letter
indicates that although the risk assessment remained  the  same.  It  states
that although the relationship with the victim  had  been  identified  as  a
factor that might increase the risk of reoffending  and  serious  harm,  the
possible increased risk had not occurred so was not "imminent". It  did  not
have to be read as meaning that there  was  no  longer  a  risk  and  so  no
"present" risk. The panel was entitled to find  that  this  statement  could
not be read as a "trump" card to the deportation order.

In any event, there were other parts of the  evidence  that  the  First-tier
Tribunal found showed  that  the  appellant  was  "a  genuine,  present  and
sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interests  of
society". At [49] and [50] they found that the  appellant  was  unclear  and
inconsistent as to his reasons for attacking his partner and sought to  "lay
at least some responsibility on his victim". It was open  to  them  to  find
that this did not suggest that he had shown a proper  understanding  of  his
actions and that this went to future risk. The panel  was  equally  entitled
to place weight at  [51]  on  the  appellant  becoming  "irritated"  at  the
hearing and not wanting to go into his past actions. His evidence  that  his
relationship with the victim had been "beautiful" prior to  the  attack  was
not credible, a further factor to be weighed  against  the  appellant.  They
did not err in finding at [55] that although the  appellant  claimed  to  be
complying fully with the Probation Service in  addressing  his  issues  with
domestic violence, the letter from the Probation Service showed that he  was
not fully compliant.

The period between the appellant's release from  detention  and  the  First-
tier Tribunal hearing was two months. Little weight  could  attract  to  the
appellant not having offended during that period and I  did  not  find  that
this aspect of the grounds had any materiality. In  any  event,  the  First-
tier Tribunal specifically took this into account at [55], just as they  did
the fact that he had obtained work since leaving detention.

In  short,  the  conclusion  that  the  appellant's  personal  conduct   was
sufficient to show a "a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
affecting one of the fundamental interests of society" was clearly one  open
to the First-tier Tribunal on the evidence before them.

Nothing in the grounds or submissions  before  me  indicates  what  material
error or detriment to the appellant arose from the panel  referring  to  the
guidance of the  ECtHR  in  Maslov  v  Austria  (Application  no.  1638/03).
Without more, this ground is not made out.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
