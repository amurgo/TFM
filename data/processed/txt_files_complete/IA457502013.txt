Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss S Khan, instructed by Morgan Dias Immigration
Consultants
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwncyz, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Maroof Jan, was born on  10  September  1936  and  is  a
    citizen of  Pakistan.   By  a  decision  dated  25  October  2013,  the
    respondent refused the appellant's application  for  further  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom; she had entered as a visitor on  26  June
    2012.  The appellant appealed against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Hindson)  which,  in  a  determination  promulgated  on
    4 March 2014, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Both parties agree that the appellant's application could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules.  She did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM.   In  his  determination  at  [11-15],
    Judge Hindson set out the facts of the appeal briefly.  He  noted  that
    the appellant had been travelling to the United Kingdom  regularly  for
    about seven years and has two daughters living here.   The  appellant's
    husband had lived in the United Kingdom from 1960 until  his  death  in
    2000 but the appellant had remained  living  in  Pakistan.   She  lives
    alone in Pakistan and has no family members to assist her.  Her  health
    is poor.  She has been diagnosed with breast cancer  and  is  receiving
    medication and, having broken her ankle, she has  been  confined  to  a
    wheelchair.  Any form of travel is  now  difficult  and  the  appellant
    claims that her health problems  would  make  travelling  to  and  from
    Pakistan almost impossible.  The appellant  enjoys  a  widow's  pension
    from the United Kingdom (her late husband was  a  British  citizen)  of
    ï¿½587 per quarter and she has received additional financial support from
    her family in the United Kingdom.

 3. The judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  been  paying
    privately for her medical treatment in the United  Kingdom.   He  found
    that the appellant was "reasonably  well-off  financially."   [19].  At
    [21], the judge considered Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).  At [22],  he
    wrote:

    Consideration of the Rules is the starting point.  Only  if  there  are
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules is
    it necessary, for Article 8 purposes, to  go  on  to  consider  whether
    there are compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under
    the Rules.

    It seems to me that there was nothing  especially  unusual  about  this
    case.  The appellant is living alone in Pakistan following the death of
    her husband and relocation to the UK by her daughter.  She  is  elderly
    and her health is deteriorating.  It is understandable the family  here
    want her to remain in the UK so they can look after her.  Treatment for
    her various ailments is available in  Pakistan.   It  is  open  to  the
    appellant to make the appropriate  application  under  the  Rules  from
    Pakistan.

    I do not find the test laid down in Gulshan is satisfied in this  case.
    I do not find any arguably good grounds for granting leave outside  the
    Rules.

    Miss Khan, for the appellant, submits that the judge's  application  of
    Gulshan was flawed.  She submitted that the judge should  have  engaged
    in a detailed consideration of all the relevant evidence  in  order  to
    decide whether he should proceed with an  analysis  of  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds outside the Immigration  Rules  and  that  Judge
    Hindson did not take account of the best interests of  the  appellant's
    British granddaughter with whom she lives at  the  present  time.   The
    appellant had been entitled to receive treatment from the NHS under the
    National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989
    at the time the First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal.   The  judge  had
    also failed to take account of  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  late
    husband had contributed towards the economy of the United Kingdom  (and
    the work of the NHS) by paying income tax and national insurance.   The
    judge  had  concentrated  on  the  "ordinariness"  of  the  appellant's
    circumstances and their possible similarity to those of  appellants  in
    other  appeals  and  had  done  so  to  the  exclusion  of  any  proper
    consideration of the consequences for the appellant and her  family  of
    her removal  to  Pakistan  and  whether  those  consequences  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh.  The appellant has mental health problems to which
    the judge did not refer in  deciding  whether  to  consider  Article  8
    outside the Rules and her breast cancer is a serious condition (a large
    locally advanced breast tumour).  There is  medical  evidence  to  show
    that the appellant would "continue to require long term care  from  her
    family".

 4. The application of Gulshan requires a proper exercise of discretion  by
    a judicial decision maker who must focus on  the  particular  facts  of
    each and every case.  The extent of the analysis required in exercising
    the discretion to consider Article 8 outside the Rules does not, in our
    opinion, require an analysis  as  detailed  or  as  extensive  as,  for
    example, the answering of the familiar questions posed by the House  of
    Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  It does,  however,  require  something
    rather more than Judge Hindson has provided in this determination.   As
    we have set out above, the circumstances of this appellant  are  rather
    less usual than Judge Hindson indicates at [23].  There were  a  number
    of important factors to which the judge did not refer.  Whilst  he  did
    not need to refer to each and every factor in  detail,  the  judge  did
    need to explain why some of the factors particular to this  appellant's
    case, in particular her medical  condition,  had  not  weighed  in  her
    favour.  We find that the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    should be set aside and that  we  should  remake  the  decision.   Both
    parties agreed that we did not need to hear any further evidence should
    we set aside the determination and they were  content  that  we  should
    remake the decision on the basis of the evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the findings of fact of Judge Hindson.

 5. Returning to Gulshan, we refer again to the  various  aspects  of  this
    case which were highlighted by Miss Khan in her submissions.   We  find
    that the circumstances of this appellant are sufficiently  unusual  and
    compelling as to require us to consider  Article  8  ECHR  outside  the
    Rules.  In reaching that decision, we have had regard to the fact  that
    the appellant is in very poor health and that, while  she  may  in  the
    future require NHS treatment, she is herself in receipt  of  a  pension
    from the United Kingdom Government on account of contributions made  by
    her late husband who lived and worked  here.   She  is  not  simply  an
    elderly lady who would prefer to receive assistance  from  her  younger
    family members but  rather  an  invalid  who  requires  the  use  of  a
    wheelchair and who is receiving  treatment  for  a  locally  aggressive
    breast cancer.  These circumstances go beyond the observation of  Judge
    Hindson that "it is understandable the family here want her  to  remain
    in the UK so they can look after her."; the requirement  for  care  has
    become a necessity.  Her circumstances have characteristics  which  are
    particular to the appellant and which,  in  our  view,  have  not  been
    anticipated in the current version of the Immigration  Rules.   We  are
    here concerned less with questions of compassion and sympathy  for  the
    appellant but more with the practical provision of care and  assistance
    by her family and, as  both  parties  agreed,  the  assessment  of  the
    proportionality of the decision to remove her.  We are well aware  that
    health services do exist in Pakistan to which the appellant might  have
    access and that her United Kingdom family would no doubt assist her  in
    paying for  those  services,  if  necessary.   However,  we  have  also
    considered the fact that she is very  elderly,  will  find  any  travel
    difficult and that her health and physical capabilities are  likely  to
    diminish, possibly quite rapidly.

 6. It is, however, vitally important that  we  also  consider  the  public
    interest concerned with her removal to Pakistan.   The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is a very important consideration and  we
    are aware that the public interest concerned with the removal of  those
    who come to this country as, for example, visitors and then, very  soon
    after arrival, seek to remain permanently may be a particularly  strong
    one.

 7. In assessing the proportionality of  the  decision,  however,  we  find
    ultimately and by reference to the particular facts of this case,  that
    the interference which would be caused to the appellant's  private  and
    family life here in the United Kingdom outweighs  the  public  interest
    concerned with her removal.  It is for that reason we have  decided  to
    allow the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

DECISION

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was promulgated on 4
    March 2014 is set aside.  We have remade the decision.  The  appeal  in
    respect of the Immigration Rules is dismissed.  The appeal  is  allowed
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds.
