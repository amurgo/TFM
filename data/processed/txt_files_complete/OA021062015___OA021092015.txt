Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Alexander, Counsel instructed by Genesis Law
                    Associated Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant in this case  is  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  the
    respondents are the [M] family.  However,  for  the  purposes  of  this
    decision, I refer to both parties as they were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, where Mr and Miss [M] were the appellants.

 2. The first appellant is a national of Zimbabwe born on 26 June 1977  and
    the second appellant is his daughter, also a national of Zimbabwe  born
    on 8 February 2001.  The sponsor in  this  case,  Portia  [M],  is  the
    spouse of the first appellant and the mother of  the  second  appellant
    and also a Zimbabwe national, settled in the UK.

 3. The family appealed  against  the  decision,  dated  1  December  2014,
    refusing their applications for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
    as the spouse and child of the sponsor.  In a decision, promulgated  on
    18 April 2016, Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Meyler  allowed  the
    appellants' appeals under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and also
    allowed the appeal of the  second  appellant  under  Rule  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer appealed  and  was  granted  permission  to
    appeal on the following grounds:

         Ground 1 - that the judge erred in stating at paragraph  [18]  that
         paragraph 320(11) of the general grounds for refusal does not apply
         to an application for entry clearance;

         Ground 2 - that the judge erred in failing to give adequate reasons
         for findings on a  material  matter  in  relation  to  the  judge's
         findings at paragraph [22] of the decision and reasons in  relation
         to paragraph 320(7A) of the general grounds for refusal;

         Ground 3 - that the judge erred in her consideration of Appendix FM-
         SE as it was submitted that the pay slips before the  judge  cannot
         meet the evidential requirements and the judge was not entitled  to
         make a finding that the  financial  requirements  are  met  in  the
         absence of the evidence specified by Appendix  FM-SE.   Furthermore
         the judge was not entitled to take into  account  savings  of  less
         than �16,000 and the  judge  had  noted  at  paragraph  33  of  the
         decision that the sponsor had many thousand pounds in savings;

         Ground 4 - it is further argued that the judge materially erred  in
         the consideration  of  paragraph  297  given  the  guidance  in  TD
         (Paragraph  297(i)(a):  sole  responsibility)  Yemen  [2006]  UKAIT
         00049.

Ground 1

 5. It was conceded by Mr Alexander that there was no doubt that the judge,
    in stating that paragraph 320(11) did not apply, had misinterpreted the
    Immigration Rules given paragraph 320A of the Immigration  Rules  which
    is as follows:

         "Paragraph 320 (except sub-paragraph (3), (10) and (11)) and 322 do
         not apply to an application for entry clearance, leave to enter  or
         leave to remain as a Family Member under Appendix  FM  and  Part  9
         (except for paragraph 322(1)) does not apply to an application  for
         leave to remain on the grounds of  private  life  under  paragraphs
         276ADE-276DH."

 6. However Mr Kotas admitted that he was in difficulties  in  relation  to
    the further limb of paragraph 320(11) (although  he  did  not  formally
    concede this point) which requires:

         "aggravating  circumstances,  such  as  absconding,   not   meeting
         temporary  admission/reporting  restrictions  or  bail  conditions,
         using  an  assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,   switching
         nationality, making frivolous applications or  not  complying  with
         the re-documentation process."

    I am satisfied that in the  reasons  the  judge  gave  in  relation  to
    paragraph 327A and the findings she  made  there  (as  discussed  under
    Ground 2 below) that were open to her, in relation to  the  actions  of
    the first appellant, indicate that that the judge  was  satisfied  that
    those actions fell far short of being "aggravating circumstances".

 7. I am not satisfied therefore that there is any material error disclosed
    in the judge's consideration of paragraph 320(11) the  general  grounds
    of refusal.

Ground 2

 8. Mr Kotas, although he did not concede this ground, did  again  properly
    accept that it was not argued that the judge's decision was  irrational
    and that the judge gave reasons for her findings from [18]  through  to
    [27] of her decision and reasons, that the first appellant's use  of  a
    false passport in 2004 and his failure to mention this had occurred ten
    years prior to the application and that the application  form  was  not
    specific enough to elicit this information.

 9. Whilst that conclusion may be considered generous and another judge may
    have reached a  different  conclusion,  the  judge  provided  full  and
    detailed reasons as to why she reached the conclusion she did and I  am
    satisfied that no material error is disclosed.

10. I am therefore satisfied that no material error of law was disclosed in
    the Entry Clearance Officer's second ground.

Ground 3

11. Mr Kotas argued that, notwithstanding that he was struggling  with  the
    first two grounds, there was a material error in the  third  ground  in
    that the judge did not correctly address Appendix FM-SE.  It was agreed
    at the hearing before me that there was evidence that the  sponsor  had
    been with her current employer since May  2013  and  not  May  2014  as
    recorded in paragraph 33.  I am satisfied that this was  a  mistake  of
    fact on the basis of the evidence that  was  before  the  judge.   That
    being the case Mr Kotas, conceded that the judge only had  to  consider
    six months of pay slips and accompanying information (not 12 months).

12. However Mr Kotas submitted that even allowing  for  this,  it  did  not
    detract from  the  fact  that  the  judge  had  erroneously  looked  at
    postdecision evidence.  That must be correct.  The pay  slips  referred
    to in the determination date from 6 July 2014 to 6 March  2016  as  set
    out at [32] of  the  decision.   The  judge  was  satisfied  that  this
    evidence  showed  that  the  appellant  had  satisfied   the   relevant
    requirements of Appendix FM at the date of hearing.

13. I am satisfied that this is an error.  However I am not satisfied  that
    it is material.  The judge went on at [34] to find  that  "taking  into
    account all the oral and documentary evidence, I am satisfied that  the
    appellant is earning above the  �22,400  threshold  she  must  make  to
    sponsor her spouse and daughter."

14. Mr Kotas accepted that Mr Alexander relied on the bundle that had  been
    before the Entry Clearance Officer and which was  before  the  Tribunal
    and showed the sponsor's original pay slips and  corresponding  entries
    in her original bank statements  for  the  period  from  February  2014
    through to July 2014.  These documents contained pay slips starting for
    the week ending 23 February 2014 and finishing on the  week  ending  14
    September  2014.   There  are  corresponding  entries   in   the   bank
    statements.  The only issue raised by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
    relation to the financial requirements was that the pay slips submitted
    were not originals.  However Mr Alexander submitted and  Mr  Kotas  did
    not dispute that the pay slips submitted by the sponsor  were  the  pay
    slips printed out by her from the email which  she  received  from  her
    employer.  In effect these were her original and only pay slips.

15. It was clear that there were original payslips  covering  a  six  month
    period prior to the date  of  application  which  had  been  mailed  in
    September 2014 with corresponding original bank statements.  The  judge
    also had an employer's  letter  confirming  the  sponsor's  employment,
    together with a P60.  The letter confirms that  the  sponsor  has  been
    employed at  A24  Group  since  31  May  2013  as  a  full-time  senior
    healthcare assistant working on average of 78  hours  per  week  and  a
    further letter dated  12  December  2014  confirmed  that  her  average
    earnings were �1,189.90 per  week.   There  was  no  dispute  that  the
    evidence showed that the appellant was  earning  approximately  �31,000
    per year at the time of the application.  I am satisfied therefore that
    the evidence which was before the judge met the terms of  Appendix  FM-
    SE.  There was consequently no material error in her conclusion at [34]
    that "all the oral and documentary evidence" indicated that the sponsor
    was earning above the �22,400 threshold which she must  meet  for  both
    appellants.  No material error of law is disclosed.

Ground 4

16. Mr Alexander indicated that he  was  in  some  difficulties  given  the
    judge's findings that the  sponsor  had  sole  responsibility  for  the
    second appellant.  That cannot be right and I  am  satisfied  that  the
    grounds to the Upper Tribunal are correct in arguing that, at the  very
    least, responsibility has to be shared between the first appellant  and
    the sponsor.   The  judge  fell  into  error  in  allowing  the  second
    appellant's appeal under  paragraph  297(1)(a),  in  finding  that  the
    sponsor had sole responsibility for her child.

17. However given that I am satisfied that  the  first  appellant  succeeds
    there  was  no  material  error  in  the  judge  allowing  the   second
    appellant's appeal under paragraph  297;  the  second  appellant  would
    succeed under 297(1)(c)  as  her  father  would  be  entering  for  the
    purposes of settlement at the same time as the  second  appellant.   In
    addition the judge found that the second appellant also succeeds  under
    Appendix FM.  There is therefore no material error.

Notice of Decision

I am satisfied that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  discloses  no
material error of law and shall stand.

No anonymity direction was sought or made.
