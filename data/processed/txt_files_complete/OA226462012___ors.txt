Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Saeed
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born in 1986.  She is a
    married woman and the mother of the second  and  third  appellants  who
    were born in 2008 and 2010 respectively.  Their nationality is an issue
    in this case.

 2. They appealed against the decisions of the ECO made on 16 October  2012
    to refuse their applications of 11 July 2012  for  entry  clearance  to
    settle in the UK with the sponsor, the husband of the first  appellant,
    and father of the second and third appellants.

 3. The reasons for refusal were that the ECO was not  satisfied  that  the
    appellants' husband/father met the financial  requirement  of  a  gross
    income of �24,800 per annum under paragraph E-ECP.1.1 of Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules.  Further, the ECO was  not  satisfied  with  the
    English language test certificate provided by the first appellant.  The
    certificate was not from an approved provider.    The ECO  refused  the
    applications of the first appellant under paragraph  EC-P1.1  (d),  and
    those of the second and third appellants under paragraph EC-C1.1(d).

 4. In the notices of appeal it was stated that  the  first  appellant  had
    taken an English language test with a provider who was approved at  the
    time of the test, on 6 January 2011.  The  provider  was  only  removed
    from the list after that date and the respondent  did  not  notify  the
    first appellant of its removal.  Further, the respondent had not raised
    the issue of English language ability in its refusal of the application
    previously made by the first appellant.  The first appellant  ought  to
    have been given a fair opportunity to prove her  ability  by  a  second
    test with an approved provider.

 5. Further, the appellants maintained  that  the  ECO  was  wrong  in  his
    assessment of the documents relating to the income of  the  appellants'
    husband/father.  The payslips provided recorded a monthly gross  income
    of �2,166.  Thus, the sponsor's income was �26,000 excluding  overtime.
    Including overtime, the sponsor's income was �29,000.   Payslips,  bank
    statements and a letter from the sponsor's employer were provided.

 6. The appellants also maintained, in the alternative, that  the  refusals
    infringed their rights under article 8 ECHR.

 7. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 12 November 2013  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Steer dismissed the appeals under  the  Immigration
    Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

 8. Her conclusions are at paragraphs [21] to [31]  of  her  determination.
    She dealt, first, with the sponsor's  income.  It  was  not  apparently
    argued  before  her  that  all  of  the  specified  documents  required
    regarding the sponsor's income had not been provided. Rather, that  the
    evidence about his claimed income was  unsatisfactory.  She  noted  the
    requirement for the sponsor of a spouse and  two  children  to  have  a
    gross annual income of at  least  �24,800.   She  noted  the  sponsor's
    evidence that he earned  �26,000  per  annum.   However,  such  was  at
    variance with the evidence of his employer, London Car Rentals Ltd  and
    their accountants who maintained that he was earning �29,000 per annum.
     He could not in his oral evidence explain this difference.

 9. Further, the judge noted gross pay amounts detailed in  a  letter  from
    HMRC dated 10 September 2013 which referred to total gross pay for  the
    tax year 2010/11 of �15,422, for the tax year 2011/2012 of �4,633,  and
    for the tax year 2012/2013 of �19,083.  She concluded  on  this  matter
    that 'Given the discrepancy  in  the  evidence  of  Mr  Hotak  and  his
    employer and their accountant, and the discrepancy with the records  of
    gross pay provided by HMRC' she was not satisfied that Mr Hotak 'has  a
    gross annual income of at least �24,800 as required' [21].

10. Turning to E-ECP.4.1 and the requirement to pass  an  English  language
    test the judge found that the first appellant with the application  did
    provide a test certificate from a provider that  was  approved  at  the
    time of the test.  The respondent did not advise  the  first  appellant
    that the provider had been removed from the list of approved  providers
    prior to making its decision.

11. The judge found that the failure to inform the first appellant breached
    the duty of common law fairness and that as a result, that part of  the
    decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   However,  as  the
    application could not succeed in relation to the financial  requirement
    it failed under the Immigration Rules.

12. Turning to consider article 8 ECHR, having found that there was  family
    life between the sponsor, his wife and children and that  the  decision
    to refuse entry clearance amounted to interference with  the  right  to
    respect for that family life of sufficient gravity  as  to  engage  the
    article,  the  judge  advanced  to   proportionality.    She   attached
    'significant weight' to the public end of  maintenance  of  immigration
    control.  She continued: 'There was no evidence  that  the  Second  and
    Third Appellants had applied to register  as  British  citizens.   They
    gave their nationality as Afghan in  their  application'.   She  stated
    that they have been living  with  their  mother  in  Afghanistan  since
    birth, that their father provides for them  financially  so  that  they
    have a good standard of living, that he is in regular contact with them
    and visits them: 'As a result of the decisions they will remain  living
    with their mother, supported by and  in  contact  with,  their  father'
    [31].  For these reasons the judge concluded that the refusal to  grant
    entry clearance was not disproportionate.

13. The appellants sought permission to appeal which was granted on 5 March
    2014.

14. At the error of law hearing, Mr Saeed adopted his grounds.   First,  it
    was obvious that the children (the second and  third  appellants)  were
    British citizens.  Their father, the  sponsor,  had  become  a  British
    citizen by naturalisation before their births.   The  result  was  that
    they should not have been included as dependents  for  the  purpose  of
    calculating the gross income required to be shown by the  sponsor.   It
    was regrettable that  this  had  been  missed  by  everyone,  from  the
    appellants and the ECO to the representatives and judge at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal hearing.   Whilst  it  was  clear  that  there  had  been
    discrepancies in the evidence about the amount of the sponsor's income,
    the HMRC letter, the genuineness of which there was no reason to doubt,
    showed that the sponsor was earning above the amount for the  admission
    of his wife.

15. Mr Saeed's second point was that in considering  article  8  the  judge
    failed to have regard to the best interests of the children.

16. Mr Avery's position was that it was not an error of law for  the  judge
    not to have found that the children were British  citizens.   They  had
    been  described  as  Afghani  citizens  in  their  application   forms.
    Further, the evidence of income was unsatisfactory including  the  HMRC
    letter particularly in light of its format and colour and the fact that
    the reference number was that of the appellants' solicitors.

17.  Neither party sought to address me  on  the  law  in  respect  of  the
    citizenship point. In considering this matter I note that the  children
    (the second and third appellants) are described  in  their  application
    forms as citizens of Afghanistan, who  were  born  there.   However,  a
    person born outside the UK on or after 1  January  1983  is  a  British
    citizen at birth, if at the time of  the  birth,  either  parent  is  a
    British  citizen  'otherwise  than  by  descent'   (s.2(i)(a)   British
    Nationality Act 1981).  Whether a person is a citizen  'otherwise  than
    by descent' or 'by  descent'  depends  upon  how  they  obtained  their
    citizenship in  the  first  place.   A  person  is  a  British  citizen
    'otherwise than by descent', in general, if they are a British  citizen
    by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK.

18. The facts in this regard are not disputed.  The  children's  father  Mr
    Hotak is a  British  citizen  by  naturalisation  in  July  2007.   His
    children with the first appellant, his wife,  were  born  in  2008  and
    2010.  I conclude that the children  are British citizens.

19. That such was so was, unfortunately, missed by the appellants' advisors
    at the stage of the application,  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  in
    submissions before the First tier Tribunal.

20. It was however a matter that was before the judge having been mentioned
    by the sponsor.  In his statement (22 July 2013) he stated at paragraph
    10 'I wish to remind  the  court  that  my  two  children  are  British
    citizens.  However I did not apply for their British passports'.

21. It seems clear that the judge was aware of that evidence as she  stated
    (at [31]):

         'There was no evidence that the Second  and  Third  Appellants  had
         applied to register as British citizens.'

22. As British citizens at birth automatically, I do not see there to be  a
    requirement for registration.  They do not require entry clearance  but
    simply a British passport.

23. In misdirecting herself on the law the judge  erred.   The  consequence
    was that the income requirement for a sponsor with a  foreign  national
    spouse was �18,600 and not  the  requirement  for  a  sponsor  and  two
    children (�24,800).

24. The judge (at [21]) was not satisfied that the  sponsor  has  a  'gross
    annual income of at least �24,800,  as  required'.   She  reached  that
    conclusion because of the  discrepancy  between  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor who claimed he was earning �26,000 a year and his employer  and
    accountants who said it was �29,000 a year.  Also the discrepancy  with
    HMRC records which showed  gross  pay  of  �19,083  for  the  tax  year
    2012/13.  The judge does not appear to  have  made  a  finding  on  the
    genuineness of the HMRC document or on  what  amount  the  sponsor  was
    earning.

25. The error was material because it is not clear  that  the  judge  would
    have reached the same  adverse  decision  about  the  adequacy  of  the
    sponsor's income had she realised that  it  was  the  lower  amount  of
    �18,600 that needed to be considered.

26. I set aside the determination and proceed to remake it.

27. Mr Avery sought to cast  doubt  on  the  HMRC  letter  because  it  was
    addressed to the solicitor.  Also, he suggested  that  the  format  and
    colour of the letter was not as it should be.  I do not find  merit  in
    that submission.  I accept the claim that the  sponsor  had  authorised
    his solicitors to contact HMRC.  There  is  a  letter,  with  proof  of
    postage, from the solicitors to HMRC in that regard.  Nothing  was  put
    before me to support the claim that the format and colour were dubious.
     I am satisfied that I can rely on the contents of the HMRC letter.

28. That letter shows that  the  sponsor  earned  more  than  the  required
    �18,600 in the tax year 2012/13.  The  refusal  decision  is  dated  16
    October 2012.  I consider that the  tax  letter  throws  light  on  the
    sponsor's financial situation at date of decision and  as  such  it  is
    evidence that relates to the circumstances  existing  at  the  date  of
    decision.

29. I conclude that the appellants satisfy the  income  requirements  under
    Appendix FM.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge's conclusion on the English
    test issue, namely, that the decision was not in  accordance  with  the
    law was unchallenged, and, thus, stands.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error  of  law.
That decision is set side and remade as follows:

The appeal is allowed to the extent that the decision of the Respondent  was
not in accordance with the law.

No anonymity directions made.
