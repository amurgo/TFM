                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. In a decision sent out on 26th February 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Pooler dismissed  the  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse further leave to remain as a partner and on  human
    rights grounds applying the provisions of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  An application made to the First-tier
    Tribunal to appeal against that  decision  was  refused  by  Designated
    Judge Campbell on 18th March 2014 and a subsequent application  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was dismissed by Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein on  23rd
    April 2014.

 2. However, on 30th April 2015, the High Court quashed the decision of the
    Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to appeal. That followed the  grant
    of permission to apply for judicial review by Mr Justice Blake which is
    dated 21st January 2015.

 3. Mr Justice Blake observed that, although the appellant could  not  meet
    the "austere" requirements of the Immigration Rules as she did not have
    leave to remain as a fianc�e for more than  six  months,  there  was  a
    genuine marriage to a British citizen and an  insuperable  obstacle  to
    the parties' cohabitation together in New Zealand.  The couple had been
    living  together  since  April  2012  and  the  appellant   was   given
    discretionary leave to remain after her pregnancy when her status as  a
    spouse was known.  There was nothing else  to  her  discredit  and  the
    public interest was confined to enforcement of immigration  control  by
    requiring her to leave and apply for entry clearance as a  spouse  from
    New Zealand.

 4. Mr Justice Blake also commented  that,  although  there  were  no  live
    children of the marriage,  the  circumstances  suggested  a  particular
    dependency which was financial and otherwise on the appellant's husband
    and that, alone, might have met  the  test  of  some  other  compelling
    reason for the Upper Tribunal to re-examine the merits of the decision.
     Noting that the application for judicial review had been delayed  from
    May 2014 to January 2015 because the papers had  been  mislaid  by  the
    court, he granted permission for the circumstances, as they now are, to
    be re-examined.

 5. Following the quashing of the refusal to  grant  permission,  the  Vice
    President of the Upper Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  21st
    May 2015.  The matter came before me on that basis.

Error on a Point of Law

 6. Mr McVeety agreed that the appellant's application  had  failed  solely
    because of the specific eligibility requirements set out in paragraph E-
    LTRP.2.1 of Appendix FM which provided that an applicant must not be in
    the United Kingdom with valid leave granted for a period of six  months
    or less (save for the exceptions in the provision which could not apply
    to her).  She otherwise met the requirements of the Rules  particularly
    the financial  requirements  and  documentary  provisions  set  out  in
    Appendix FM-SE.

 7. Ms Lee referred me to financial  information  which,  Mr  McVeety  also
    agreed, showed that a gross annual income figure  for  the  appellant's
    sponsor of �19,964.02 had been shown.  Ms Lee also pointed out that the
    appellant was unable to take the benefit of the provisions  of  section
    EX.1 because of the short period of leave granted to her.

 8. Ms Lee submitted that the error in the First-tier decision was that the
    judge appeared to have ignored the  material  before  him  relating  to
    finances which would, otherwise, have brought the appellant within  the
    provisions of Appendix FM and FM-SE. That was relevant when considering
    the decision of the House of Lords in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]  UKHL  40
    as to whether or not  it  would  be  justifiably  harsh  and  therefore
    disproportionate to expect the appellant to return to New  Zealand  and
    apply for entry clearance from there as a spouse.  Mr McVeety  conceded
    that the financial position of the parties was relevant to any decision
    made with reference to Chikwamba.

 9. After considering the matter for a few moments I indicated that  I  was
    satisfied that the decision showed a material error on a point of  law.
    I reached that conclusion on the basis of the brief submissions made to
    me and the concessions made by Mr McVeety.  Although it is  clear  that
    the judge considered the decision of the House of Lords  in  Chikwamba,
    he did so without any reference to the appellant's financial  position.
    In R (On the application of Chen) (Appendix  FM-Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT  00189  (IAC)  the  Upper
    Tribunal made reference to the decision in Chikwamba stating that there
    may be cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life being enjoyed outside the UK but  where  temporary  separation  to
    enable an individual to make an application for entry clearance may  be
    disproportionate.  It  is  for  the  individual  to  place  before  the
    respondent evidence  that  such  temporary  separation  will  interfere
    disproportionality with protected rights.  The House of Lords  decision
    identified certain relevant considerations before reaching  conclusions
    about the proportionality of the  decision  including  the  immigration
    history of the applicant and  the  prospective  length  and  degree  of
    family disruption.  Bearing in mind that the judge did  not  appear  to
    have given  full  consideration  to  relevant  factors,  including  the
    appellant's financial position and, as observed by  Mr  Justice  Blake,
    her dependency financial or otherwise on the sponsor, the  judge  erred
    such that the decision should be re-made.

Re-Making the Decision

10. After hearing further submissions I announced that I  would  allow  the
    appeal on human rights grounds and now give my reasons for doing so.

11. I heard further  submissions  concerning  the  proportionality  of  the
    respondent's removal decision  in  circumstances  where  the  appellant
    could have made a successful application if it were  not  for  the  six
    month provision.

12. Ms Lee argued that it was not reasonable to  expect  the  appellant  to
    return to New Zealand not only  because  of  her  favourable  financial
    situation but because she had suffered the loss of her daughter at  the
    time of the respondent's decision  and  relied  upon  the  sponsor  for
    emotional support.  My attention was also drawn to pages 204 to 209  of
    the  appellant's  bundle  concerning  mental  health  issues  involving
    anxiety and depression relating, in part, to abuse in New Zealand.   It
    was pointed out to me that the appellant had no home in New Zealand and
    no contact with other relatives there.  Page  244  of  the  bundle  was
    evidence to show that the processing time for an application  from  New
    Zealand would be at least 24 weeks.

13. Mr McVeety made no detailed submissions save to indicate  that  it  was
    possible that the decision in Chikwamba could benefit the appellant.

14. The relevant circumstances of  this  appeal  are  not  in  issue.   The
    appellant is the spouse of the sponsor with whom she  evidently  has  a
    subsisting relationship which has suffered the tragedy of the loss of a
    child.  She has a faultless immigration  history  and  only  failed  to
    succeed in her application for further  leave  to  remain  because  the
    balance of the period of discretionary leave granted to her at the time
    of her pregnancy was less than six months.  Otherwise she could  comply
    with all the provisions of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain as
    a partner.

15. In EB (Kosovo)[2008] UKHL 41 the House of  Lords  recognised,  in  line
    with the Chikwamba decision that it would rarely  be  proportionate  to
    uphold an order for the removal of a spouse if there  is  a  close  and
    genuine bond with the other spouse and that spouse cannot reasonably be
    expected to follow the removed spouse to the country of  removal.  With
    that  principle  in  mind  and  taking  account  of   the   exceptional
    circumstances of this case I conclude that it would be disproportionate
    to force the appellant to return  to  New  Zealand  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application from there.  I bear in mind that, in addition  to
    the favourable financial position of the  parties,  the  appellant  has
    lost her contacts in New Zealand, suffers from  mental  difficulty  and
    could not be assisted in New Zealand by the  presence  of  the  sponsor
    because of his legal inability to enter that country.  I  also  believe
    that the provisions of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2014 can  avail  the  appellant.   She  speaks  English  and
    clearly will be financially independent when living here.  Further, her
    relationship was established at a time when she had leave to be in  the
    United Kingdom.

16. Having regard to the factors which I have identified  I  conclude  that
    the appeal can be allowed on human rights grounds.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on a  point  of  law.
I set aside that decision and re-make it by allowing  the  appeal  on  human
rights grounds.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested nor do I consider it appropriate in this case.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Although I have allowed this appeal I do not make a  fees  order.   That  is
because it was evident that the respondent's decision was  reached  in  good
faith based upon an interpretation of Article 8 law which, at  the  time  of
the making of the decision, was open to her.
