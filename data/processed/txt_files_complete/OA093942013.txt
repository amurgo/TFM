Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Berry, Counsel, instructed by Blokh Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J McGirr, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Graham  promulgated  on  30th  September   2013,
    dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision to curtail  his
    leave to enter.  The applicant had been granted leave  to  enter  as  a
    visitor, effective as a multi-entry visit visa between 2 December  2011
    and 2 December 2013, subject inter alia to the provisions of  paragraph
    41(iii) of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), which state  that
    a visitor must not intend  to  take  employment  or  produce  goods  or
    provide services in the United Kingdom.  On 22 March 2013, he was found
    working in breach, and removed to Turkey, his country of origin.

 2. The appellant appealed, claiming  to  have  lost  his  passport,  which
    expired in 2012, and that the person found working  illegally  on  22nd
    March 2013 was somebody posing as him, not the appellant.    The appeal
    was considered on the papers, the appellant having not elected  for  an
    oral hearing.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge was not satisfied  by  the
    very limited material produced on the appellant's behalf.

 3. The grounds of appeal asserted that  the  judge  erred  in  considering
    evidence not seen by the appellant.  Permission to appeal  was  granted
    on the basis that the respondent did not appear to have served  on  the
    appellant the documents she served on the Tribunal.  At the hearing, it
    became clear that there was another, serious flaw in the  reasoning  in
    the First-tier Tribunal determination.  The Judge  misdirected  himself
    in relation to the burden of proof, stating  at  paragraph  11  of  his
    determination that:

         "11. I am satisfied that the burden of proof rests on the appellant
         to show that he was not the person arrested for  working  illegally
         on 22nd March 2013 and returned to Turkey."

 4. That cannot be right.  He who asserts must prove, and  at  the  hearing
    before me, Mr McGirr agreed that the burden of proof as to the identity
    of the person removed is on the respondent. Only when that  burden  has
    been discharged does the burden of proving other matters in relation to
    the appeal shift to the appellant.  That is a material  error  of  law,
    particularly as the papers which are in  the  Tribunal  bundle  at  the
    moment do not appear to be  sufficiently  complete  to  discharge  that
    burden.

 5. Having discussed the matter with the parties, it has been  agreed  that
    the best course is for this appeal to be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for an oral hearing on a date to be fixed.

 6. The following agreed directions are made.

Directions

1) The respondent shall provide to the Tribunal and the appellant copies  of
   relevant documents in her  possession  or  control  in  relation  to  the
   appellant and/or the person found working on 22 March 2013 and removed on
   26 March 2013. Where the original documents are in her  possession,  full
   colour copies must be provided.

2) In particular, the respondent shall provide copies of:

         . fingerprint records and analysis thereof;
         . copy passports, in particular the passport which expired in 2012
           and which the appellant claimed to have lost;
         . her removal decision and associated Home Office papers;
         . Huseyin Boyaci's N�fus and driving licence;  and
         . any other relevant identity documents.

3) The appellant must provide to the Tribunal  and  the  respondent  a  full
   colour copy of all pages of his current passport, his current N�fus,  and
   his current driving licence.

4) The appeal will then be listed to be heard in the  Birmingham  First-tier
   Tribunal with a time estimate of half a day.

5) Any additional directions will be a matter for  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   when it receives the file.
