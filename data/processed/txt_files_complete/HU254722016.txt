Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr A Moran, Immigration & Asylum
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national  of  Syria,  born  on  26  May  1990.  She
      appealed with permission against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge who, in a decision promulgated on 24 March  201,  dismissed  her
      application for entry clearance to the UK as a partner of her  sponsor
      under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.  He  also  dismissed  her
      appeal under the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 8).

   2. On 7 July 2017 the Upper Tribunal found that the decision of the First-
      tier Tribunal  involved the making of an error of  law  on  the  basis
      that the Judge had regard to the decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
      Agyarko, which was not germane to the appellant's case, which  was  an
      appeal against the refusal of an entry clearance. The proper  approach
      was set out in SS (Congo) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10.

   3. Further, no consideration was given to the difficulties posed  to  the
      appellant and her husband's enjoyment of family life in  Syria  having
      regard to the fact that the sponsor  is  the  sole  custodian  of  his
      British child. The finding that there were no compelling circumstances
      was thus also flawed.

   4. Nor did the Judge find it necessary to make any findings on the issues
      raised by the respondent relating to the financial requirements  under
      Appendix FM-SE. It had been  contended  that  the  sponsor  failed  to
      produce evidence that his relevant company tax return had  been  filed
      with HRMC. Nor had he provided a certificate of confirmation from  his
      accountant relating to  his  unaudited  accounts  and  had  failed  to
      provide payslips evidencing his director's salary, covering  the  same
      period as the company tax return, as required.

   5. It was directed that  the  decision  would  be  remade  by  the  Upper
      Tribunal.  Directions were given.

      The re-making of the decision

   6. At the outset Mr Moran produced the evidence relating to the financial
      requirements under Appendix FM- SE. He contended  that  the  documents
      were provided as part of the application. Mr  Moran,  who  represented
      the appellant at that stage, confirmed that the documents  were  sent.
      This includes the payslips at pages 135-140 for the period covered  in
      the period of the tax return, i.e. 1 August 2015 until 31  July  2016.
      There are also payslips produced at  page  135.  He  also  produced  a
      confirmation  statement  dated  28  October  2016  from   the   senior
      accountant acting for Golden Rose Trading Ltd, who computed and  filed
      the company accounts for the year ending 31 July 2016 confirming  that
      they are correct and accurate.

   7. Mr Moran noted that in the ECM review dated  1  February  2017  it  is
      conceded that the appellant has provided a confirmation statement from
      her sponsor's accountant as well as a P60 for the year  5  April  2016
      and payslips. However, she has not provided her sponsor's  CT600.  Nor
      does the P60 show that the appellant met the financial threshold.  Nor
      did the payslips provided cover the tax year required  under  Appendix
      FM-SE.

   8. Mr Moran stated that the CT600 had in fact been sent as  part  of  the
      application. It is  produced at page 21 of bundle A.  With  regard  to
      the P60 during the relevant  qualifying  period,  the  income  is  not
      purely salary but also constitutes dividends which are not set out  in
      the P60. The combined receipts for the period exceeded �24,850.

   9. Mr Moran also referred to the company accounts at  pages  45-55.  They
      were for the year ended 31 July 2016 showing the  amount  of  �16,358.
      The directors' remuneration was �8,500.  The payslips in line with the
      company tax return, i.e. between 1 August 2015 and 31 July  2016  were
      also in fact produced.

  10. Mr Moran submitted that the financial requirements had been met.

The appellant's case

  11. Mr Moran  produced  the  appellant's  recent  IELTS  A1  Speaking  and
      Listening certificate which was administered by the British Council on
      24 June 2017. The appellant again failed the test on 5 August 2017.

  12. Mr Abdalstar Ziab attended the hearing and gave evidence.  He  adopted
      his witness statement dated 1 September 2016 at A7-8 and  his  further
      witness statement at A2 dated 19 June 2017 (page 4-5).

  13. Mr Ziab stated that he is a  naturalised  British  citizen  of  Syrian
      origin. He married a British citizen in Damascus in 2005 and  returned
      to the UK in March 2007 with her. They had  a  child  together,  [MZ],
      born in Oxford on [ ] 2007. He and his  wife  separated  in  2010.  He
      obtained custody of their son who has been living with him ever since.



  14. He met the appellant online through mutual Facebook friends  in  2011.
      The relationship developed and they agreed in 2015 to be  married.  It
      took until April 2017 for the decree nisi divorce proceedings to  come
      through. He recently discovered that he needed a decree absolute which
      delayed matters further.

  15. He had to travel to Lebanon to meet the appellant in  person  for  the
      first time and to get married. In his earlier statement he stated that
      he will help her submit her UK application in Beirut.

  16. It is not possible for him to travel to Syria due to the war so he has
      not been able to spend time with her in person. However, they  get  on
      extremely well and are in love.

  17. Mr Zaib stated that he has adequate accommodation in Oxford.

  18. He asserted that the appellant had been unable  to  study  English  in
      Syria on account of the ongoing conflict and is unable  to  travel  to
      Lebanon to study there as  the  Lebanese  authorities  are  no  longer
      admitting Syrians unless they have an embassy appointment or a  flight
      ticket from Beirut. They fully intend to enrol her in English  classes
      once she arrives in the UK.

  19. Damascus is still a war zone and life is difficult and dangerous.  The
      appellant has been trying to improve her English but is so nervous and
      stressed that she is finding it nearly impossible.

  20. There are no face to face  language  courses  available  in  Damascus.
      Private tutors do not want to visit  people's  homes  because  of  the
      dangers involved in travelling around the city. This  applies  to  the
      appellant. There are checkpoints everywhere and as a young  woman  she
      often gets harassed.

  21. She managed to arrange language tuition through a private tutor  which
      would take place over the telephone. She has also tried to use  online
      learning materials. She studied for over two months but felt that  she
      made little progress because of her nervous state of mind.  She  found
      it impossible to concentrate as she can hear shelling, rocket fire and
      gun battles near her home. There are also shortages  of  food,  water,
      electricity, fuel for cooking and other basic supplies.

  22. Since the Tribunal's decision she has travelled on  two  occasions  to
      Lebanon to meet him, namely, from 9 April to 14 April 2017 and from 25
      May to 2 June 2017. He  cannot  visit  her  in  Syria  as  it  is  too
      dangerous to go, especially with his son.

  23. They were both upset when on his second visit to  Lebanon  she  failed
      the IELTS Life Skills Level A1 test on 27 May 2017.

  24. The appellant is simply not  in  a  state  of  mind  to  learn  a  new
      language, much less over the phone or online.

  25. If she joins him in the UK he  will  enrol  her  in  a  face  to  face
      language course in one of the English language institutes  in  Oxford.
      When she is in a stable environment she will be able to access  proper
      teaching and reach the required level with relative ease.

  26. They are now living apart. He cannot relocate to Syria  to  live  with
      her. He is worried that she will never be able  to  pass  the  English
      test. He claims that his lawyer told him that  nearly  all  his  other
      Syrian clients over the past 4-5 years have been granted an  exemption
      from the English language requirement on the  basis  that  it  is  too
      difficult  to  learn  English  in  Syria  in  the   current   security
      environment[1].

  27. He confirmed that the appellant has sat the test on three occasions in
      Lebanon.  She  produced  evidence  from  the  British  council  before
      entering Lebanon, including the hotel booking. This she had to show to
      the authorities on entering.

  28. She cannot study for the test in Lebanon. This is not possible because
      of the restriction on Syrians residing there. Nor would she be able to
      stay there alone as a single woman.

  29. She is currently staying with her mother and father in Syria.

  30. In cross-examination he said that since the decision  to  refuse,  two
      attempts have been made to take the test. She tried to qualify herself
      over the phone with a private tutor. He said that the English language
      schools in Syria are all closed. Even the British Council has not been
      operating since 2012. He referred to page  9  at  A2  which  sets  out
      English schools in Syria as well as the British Council there. At page
      12 it is noted that the British Council does not currently offer  face
      to face teaching in Syria.

  31. He referred to an email at  page  16  in  which  a  message  from  the
      appellant's solicitor concerning English language courses in  Damascus
      could not be delivered.   There  are  currently  no  language  schools
      offering courses in English nor any websites.

  32. He said that his wife has tried to obtain a private tutor to teach her
      English at home.  The tutor said he did not wish to have to travel  to
      people's houses. You have to pass through checkpoints. They would  not
      want to risk themselves.

  33. The appellant lives in southern Damascus  which  is  under  government
      control. Even if you want to go from place to place, there are over 60
      checkpoints.

  34. He  tried  to  find  someone  local  to  teach.  However,  no-one  was
      available. They will not go to her. The people who had taught her over
      the phone had initially been contacted over the phone. Information was
      given to her by some other people.

  35. Her father paid  for  that  telephone  course.  There  were  technical
      difficulties using the phone  including  crackling.  There  were  also
      difficulties in pronouncing the words properly or being able to  spell
      them.

  36. He said that before the war in 2011, they used to communicate via  the
      internet.  At present she sometimes does not even receive a text  from
      him for over four hours. There is not sufficient electricity available
      for use. She only has a mobile for internet access. She does not  have
      a computer. Nor does her father.

  37. He said that even if she could obtain a computer the  current  service
      there is very poor. To download a page can take up to two hours. There
      are continued outages. There is electricity for one of two  hours  and
      then it can be 'shut off' for up to six hours at a time.

  38. Nor could the appellant enrol in an internet language  provider  using
      her phone. You need a well run service.

  39. There was no re-examination.

      Submissions

  40. Mr Tarlow stated that he relied on the reasons for refusal. He did not
      make any further submissions.

  41. On behalf of the appellant it was submitted  that  evidence  has  been
      produced showing the requirements of Appendix FM-SE have been met.

  42.  This  is  a  human  rights  appeal.  The  issue  is  whether  it   is
      disproportionate to refuse the application even assuming that some  of
      the documents were provided after the date of decision. No  issue  has
      been taken by the respondent that the  appellant  in  fact  meets  the
      relevant Rules and in particular Appendix FM- SE.

  43. Mr Moran referred to the letter at page 46 of the bundle  as  well  as
      the HMRC tax calculations for 2016-2017. For the year  ended  5  April
      2017 the total income received was �32,800. That is well in excess  of
      the threshold.

  44. The relationship is still subsisting. The sponsor has recently been to
      Lebanon where he stayed with the appellant. He was in Beirut when  she
      took the English test recently.

  45. The Rule does not  specify  what  exceptional  circumstances  are.  It
      merely states that they need to be shown. He submitted that  what  had
      to be shown was that this was 'something out  of  the  ordinary'.  The
      vast majority of persons are not living in war torn  areas.  They  can
      enrol and take courses again. Even those who  are  illiterate  can  be
      expected to take courses. However, the appellant lives in  exceptional
      circumstances.

  46. Mr Moran referred to the country information and guidance at pp. 34-39
      of A2. In particular  the  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  office  advises
      against all travel to Syria. British nationals in Syria  should  leave
      by any practical means. The UK  has  suspended  all  services  of  the
      British embassy  in  Damascus  and  all  diplomatic  staff  have  been
      withdrawn from Syria. The situation  remains  extremely  volatile  and
      dangerous. There is widespread  fighting  throughout  Syria  including
      Damascus and its suburbs. Full scale military operations involving the
      use of small arms, tanks, artillery and aircraft are ongoing. The most
      recent estimates suggest that over 470,000 people have been killed  in
      the  Syrian  conflict  including  over  55,000  children.  The  Syrian
      government no longer exercises control  over  large  parts  of  Syria,
      notably in the north, south and east of the country. Areas of  Eastern
      Syria are under the effective  control  of  Daesh  which  is  fiercely
      hostile to the United Kingdom.

  47. He submitted that to insist in those circumstances that the  appellant
      should attempt to obtain a course via the  internet,  is  not  to  the
      point. The level of stress in the country means that  the  appellant's
      nerves are likely to be frayed.

  48. These are all exceptional  circumstances.  He  referred  to  the  Home
      Office guidelines. All the English language schools  are  closed.  The
      appellant has made efforts. She has attempted to obtain a visa for two
      and a half years.

  49. This is a case where there  are  compelling  circumstances  justifying
      consideration  of  her  Article  8  claim  outside  the   Rules.   The
      appropriate response is to grant her leave to enter on  the  basis  of
      her  relationship.  Family  life  cannot  realistically   take   place
      elsewhere.

      Assessment

  50. I have set out the evidence informing this appeal in some detail.  The
      issue is whether or not the appellant has  met  the  English  language
      requirements set out in E-ECP.4.1.  The  applicant  must  provide  the
      specified evidence that  she  is  exempt  from  the  English  language
      requirement under paragraph E-ECP.4.2.

  51. For the purpose of this appeal  the  appellant  is  exempt  from  that
      requirement if, at the date  of  application,  there  are  exceptional
      circumstances  which  prevent  her  from  being  able  to   meet   the
      requirement prior to entry to  the  UK.  There  is  no  definition  of
      exceptional circumstances in this paragraph.

  52. I have had regard to the relevant IDIs on Appendix FM relating  to  an
      application for an exemption from the  English  language  requirement.
      This will be considered on its merits on a case by case basis.

    . The applicant  must  demonstrate  that  as  a  result  of  exceptional
      circumstances they are unable to learn English before coming to the UK
      or it is not practicable or reasonable for them to travel  to  another
      country to take an approved English language test.

    . Evidence of the nature and impact  of  the  exceptional  circumstances
      must be clearly provided, e.g. of previous efforts to access  learning
      materials or to travel overseas to  take  an  approved  test  and  the
      obstacles to doing so. This  must  include  evidence  provided  by  an
      independent source capable of being verified by the decision maker.

    . Examples of situations in which, subject to the  necessary  supporting
      evidence,  the  decision  maker  might  conclude   that   there   were
      exceptional circumstances, might include where the applicant is a long
      term resident of a country in international or internal armed conflict
      or where there has been a humanitarian disaster including in light  of
      the infrastructure affected.

  53. I found the evidence of he sponsor to be essentially credible  and  in
      accordance with the background evidence referred to.

  54. The evidence provided on behalf of the appellant revealed that  as  at
      the date of the resumed hearing the appellant continues to live  in  a
      war zone  in  Syria.  I  have  referred  to  the  background  evidence
      including the FCO advice against all travel to Syria contained in  the
      latest update on 31 May 2017.

  55. The situation remains  extremely  volatile  and  dangerous.  There  is
      widespread fighting throughout Syria including  in  Damascus  and  its
      suburbs. The government no longer exercises control of large parts  of
      Syria, notably in the north, south and east.

  56. There has been no contention that the assertions made by  the  sponsor
      as to the conditions operating in Syria are in  any  way  exaggerated.
      The  sponsor  was  questioned  during  cross  examination  as  to  the
      availability to the appellant of alternative means of learning English
      so as to be able to take the test successfully.

  57. The appellant has attempted on three separate  occasions  to  sit  the
      relevant English language test in Beirut,  including  a   very  recent
      attempt. She has failed on each occasion. During  the  occasions  when
      she attempted such tests in Lebanon, her sponsor has joined her.

  58. I have also had regard to the background material produced relating to
      the current availability of appropriate language schools in  Damascus.
      I am satisfied  that  such  a  facility  is  no  longer  realistically
      available. I have also had regard to attempts made by the appellant to
      receive tuition by telephone in order to enable her to take the  tests
      successfully.  However, the difficulty has  been  that  the  telephone
      crackles  and  that  it  is   also   difficult   to   follow   correct
      pronunciations.

  59. The appellant has no access to any computer and has no access  to  the
      internet.  Even  if  learning  English   online   were   a   realistic
      possibility, the position is that there  are  regular  and  consistent
      outages when electricity is not available, often lasting  for  periods
      of up to five to six hours at a time.

  60. The appellant does not have a computer. She has a mobile phone. It  is
      not realistic to expect her to be  able  to  learn  English  over  the
      telephone.

  61. The dangerous situation in Syria continues. Having regard to  the  FCO
      report there is no reason to believe that this position will change.

  62. The appellant has made efforts to learn  English.  However,  I  accept
      that in the current circumstances which are likely to continue, it  is
      unlikely that she will be able to make sufficient progress to pass the
      test. On the other hand, if she resides in the relative calm of the UK
      she will be able to apply  herself  and  concentrate  on  passing  the
      appropriate English test which she would be  required  to  do  in  any
      event after two and a half years before seeking to renew her visa.

  63. I find that in the light of the continuing dangers and  the  situation
      in Syria in which there is internal armed conflict, that the appellant
      has shown that she is exempt from the  English  language  requirements
      and that there are exceptional circumstances preventing her from being
      able to meet the requirements prior to entry to the UK.

  64. The representatives agreed that there should  be  an  assessment  made
      under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention in accordance with  the
      questions set out by Lord Bingham in Razgar.

  65. I am satisfied that family life exists between the appellant  and  her
      sponsor. I answer questions 2, 3 and 4 in the affirmative.

  66. I accordingly consider whether  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
      refuse  a  grant   of  entry  clearance  application   constitutes   a
      disproportionate interference with her right  to  respect  for  family
      life.

  67. The appellant's sponsor, Mr Ziab, has custody of his son, Mohamed, who
      is a British citizen. He was born in the UK and attends  school  here.
      It is neither reasonable nor realistic to expect him  to  relocate  in
      the current circumstances prevailing in Syria.

  68. Moreover, neither the appellant nor her  sponsor  have  any  right  of
      residence in any third country, including Lebanon.

  69. The appellant will be properly accommodated and maintained in the  UK.
      The public interest in her ability to  speak  English  is  capable  of
      being achieved after she arrives in the UK.

  70. Having regard to the  circumstances  as  a  whole,  I  find  that  the
      proposed interference of the respondent constitutes a disproportionate
      interference with her right to respect for both her and her  husband's
      family life in the UK.

-----------------------
[1]   Mr Moran stated that he is the lawyer referred to and  confirmed  that
this is his first case in which a person in  the  appellant's  position  has
been refused entry clearance simply on the basis  of  the  English  language
requirement.
