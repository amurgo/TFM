                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge L K  Gibbs,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  refusal  of  an
       application made on 20 March 2012 under Article 8 of  the  ECHR,  on
       the basis of his marriage to a UK citizen on 10 January 2012.


    2. Ground 1 of appeal to the UT relies upon EB (Kosovo) v  SSHD  [2008]
       UKHL 4 at �12, Amrohalli v Denmark, Application 56811/00, ECtHR, and
       AB (Jamaica)  v  SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1302  to  argue  that  the
       appellant's spouse could not reasonably be expected to relocate with
       him in Bangladesh.  It further  submits  that  the  judge  erred  by
       finding no arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  outside  the
       rules and by not considering Article 8 "on  a  freestanding  basis",
       and in reason could only have concluded that there  are  exceptional
       circumstances rendering the refusal unduly harsh.

    3. Ground 2 alleges an error of  fact  resulting  in  unfairness.   The
       judge at �14 said that only limited weight could  be  given  to  the
       spouse's family ties in the UK because no  family  members  attended
       court or provided statements, but her bundle contained a  letter  of
       support from her sister.  It is also said  the  Judge  "ignored  the
       undisputed fact that [the appellant's  wife]  is  being  tested  for
       cancer".

    4. On 17 July 2014 permission was granted:

           It is arguable that the judge concluded that  family  ties  were
           limited because of an incorrect understanding of  the  evidence.
           It is debatable whether that made a material difference ...  but
           ... arguable that it did ... I do not refuse permission  on  the
           remaining grounds although they have less merit.

    5. Mr Bradley submitted thus.  He firstly sought to rely upon  a  point
       which is not in the grounds but which  he  said  was  obvious.   The
       application was made on 20  March  2012  and  so  should  have  been
       decided by reference to the Rules as they stood up to  8  July  2012
       ("the old Rules").  Mr Bradley referred to Edgehill  v  SSHD  [2014]
       EWCA Civ 402.    Judge Gibbs had raised that point at  the  hearing.
       The solicitor then acting  for  the  appellant  (who  only  recently
       instructed Mr Bradley's firm) said it was  irrelevant,  because  the
       outcome would not be materially different (�6 of the determination).
        In spite of that, the Judge should have remitted the  case  to  the
       respondent for a fresh decision.  In a determination promulgated  on
       31 May 2011 in an earlier appeal by  the  appellant  (IA/38183/2010)
       Judge Boyd held at �34 that it was likely the appellant had been  in
       the UK since around 2000.  He might thus have qualified for leave on
       the basis of 14 years residence under the former  Rule  276B  [which
       was based on 14 years residence, whereas the amended  Rules  require
       20  years].   The  Upper  Tribunal  should  correct  that  error  by
       remitting the case to the respondent now.  Alternatively, the  Upper
       Tribunal should find that the First-tier Tribunal erred as  asserted
       in  the  grounds.   She  appeared  to  have  looked  for   something
       exceptional to justify going outside the Rules,  but  the  test  was
       only that of a good arguable case.  The appellant's spouse has lived
       in the Inverness and Black Isle area all her life, where she has all
       her family and is fully established.  She has been undergoing  tests
       for cancer.  The cases cited in ground 1 showed that she  could  not
       be expected to relocate with her husband.  The Judge had  overlooked
       the letter of support from her sister.  If the original grounds were
       upheld, the UT  should  substitute  a  decision  in  favour  of  the
       appellant.


    6. Mrs O'Brien responded as follows.  The appellant had not  given  any
       prior notice that he sought to add to his grounds.  Amendment should
       not be permitted at this very late stage.  The point  in  any  event
       was not obvious.  The appellant Edgehill argued against rejection of
       his Article 8 application made before 9 July 2012 due to failure  to
       meet the 20 year requirement in the "new  Rules".    This  appellant
       applied on the basis of his  recent  marriage,  not  his  length  of
       residence  under  Rule  276B.   His  appeal  IA/38180/2010  was   an
       unsuccessful challenge to a refusal under Rule  276B.   He  made  no
       fresh application under that Rule for the  respondent  to  consider.
       The finding at �34 of the previous determination  was  made  loosely
       and in passing.  Those circumstances fell far short  of  an  obvious
       case which should have led the Judge to look behind the  appellant's
       express choice not to seek remittal for further decision  under  the
       "old Rules" but to ask for his case to be considered  under  Article
       8.  Even if the case did require consideration under the "old Rules"
       the appropriate course would be for the appellant to make  his  case
       to the tribunal, not to remit, and the  Presenting  Officer  in  the
       First-tier Tribunal had been  wrong  to  suggest  to  the  contrary.
       Turning to the original grounds, as the First-tier Tribunal  hearing
       was in England it was  not  surprising  that  the  Judge  cited  and
       followed Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  and  Gulshan  v  SSHD
       [2013] UKUT 00540 rather than MS v SSHD [2013] CSIH 52,  from  which
       Mr Bradley took the distinction between exceptionality  and  a  good
       arguable case.   In  any  event,  the  cases  disclose  no  material
       difference as to the correct  approach  to  Article  8  outside  the
       Rules.  The Court in MS considered and did not disagree with  Nagre.
       Gulshan requires consideration of whether there is a  good  arguable
       case  prior  to  consideration  of  whether  there  are   compelling
       circumstances not recognised under the Rules.  Judge  Gibbs  applied
       that first test, not an excessive criterion of exceptionality.   All
       the circumstances, including  the  important  circumstances  of  the
       appellant's wife, were taken into account.   It  was  misleading  to
       draw attention to the fact that she had been tested for cancer, when
       the most recent evidence was a letter to her from NHS Highland dated
       19 February 2014 advising her in capital letters that the results of
       her tests "... do NOT show any cancer."  There was no medical reason
       why she might not relocate.  The Judge did not have to mention every
       item of evidence, but even if she overlooked the sister's letter, it
       was in fairly bland terms.  It does  not  suggest  that  the  sister
       provides any more support than would be  normally  expected  between
       adult siblings.  It was not unusual for adult siblings  to  live  in
       different countries.  There would be nothing to stop them keeping in
       touch.  This fell far short of being an item of evidence which might
       have led to another outcome.  There was no error in any  respect  to
       require the determination to be set aside.


    7. In reply, Mr Bradley said that the Judge, having referred parties to
       Edgehill, erred by accepting mistaken submissions and failing to see
       that the case required decision under the "old Rules".

    8. I reserved my determination.

    9. The Judge  determined  precisely  the  issues  put  to  her  by  the
       appellant in a skeleton argument and in submissions.   The  UT  will
       not be quick to criticise her for that.

   10. The attempt to rely on a further ground of appeal is very late,  and
       in any event the point could not help the appellant.

   11. In relation to his marriage, the appellant has  not  tried  to  show
       that he might meet the Rules before  or  after  amendment.   It  has
       always been common ground that he cannot.

   12. The application leading to these proceedings was specifically  based
       on the marriage, not on 14 years residence.  There  was  no  obvious
       case based on length of residence either before  the  respondent  or
       once the Judge raised the effect of Edgehill.  The finding on  which
       Mr Bradley relied is that it is likely the appellant came to the  UK
       around  2000,  but  the  determination  as  a  whole  is  far   from
       conspicuously favourable to a renewed case under Rule  276B.   Judge
       Boyd held that the appellant had to show residence from 8 July  1994
       to 7 July 2009 (�27) and that his evidence fell well short.  Further
       passage of time  makes  no  difference,  so  the  matter  stands  as
       conclusively determined against the appellant.

   13. Ground 1, although it recites case law, and  alleges  irrationality,
       is essentially only  an  insistence  upon  the  case  based  on  the
       difficulty of relocating for the appellant's wife, and  disagreement
       with Judge Gibbs' ultimate fact-sensitive assessment.  There  is  no
       error of legal approach in the determination.  Reading the treatment
       at �12 - 18 fairly and as a whole, no incorrect or unduly  stringent
       concept of exceptionality was applied.   The  terms  "insurmountable
       obstacles" and "exceptional circumstances" are correctly interpreted
       at �13 and 17.  The    conclusion at �18 that there are no  arguably
       good grounds for a grant of  leave  outside  the  Rules  is  reached
       precisely in the terms  which  Mr  Bradley  said  should  have  been
       applied.

   14. On ground 2, the submissions did not trouble to mention the terms of
       the sister's letter.  It is supportive, but it shows  no  more  than
       would be expected between adult siblings who are  in  regular  touch
       and on good terms, a circumstance not capable of leading to  another
       outcome.  The associated point about cancer tests at  least  borders
       on the disingenuous.  The Presenting Officer in the UT  was  readily
       able  to  show  that  the  outcome  of  those  tests  was  negative.




   15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  err  on  any
       point  of  law  which  requires  it  to  be  set  aside,   so   that
       determination shall stand.
