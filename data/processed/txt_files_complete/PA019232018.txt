Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Tabassum, of Broudie Jackson & Canter Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

UPON hearing from Ms Tabassum for the appellant and Mr. Mills for the
respondent

AND UPON considering the decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Holt dated
28 March 2018 dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's
decision of 14 January 2018; the appellant's grounds of appeal dated 8 May
2018; and the grant of permission to appeal dated 9 June 2018

AND UPON it being agreed between the parties that a number of the findings
made by the judge as to the credibility of the appellant's account were not
open to her on the evidence before her and that the Judge thus materially
erred in law in her assessment of the appellant's credibility

AND UPON this Tribunal finding that it is appropriate to make such an order

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, BY CONSENT, UNDER RULE 39, TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008, THAT:

1     The decision of the judge is set aside

2     The appeal is remitted to the First tier Tribunal for re-hearing.


Signed:                                            Date: 20.9.18
