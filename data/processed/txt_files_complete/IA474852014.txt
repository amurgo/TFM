Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N Hashmi, Counsel; Nasim & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of  comprehension,  the  parties  are  referred  to  by  their
    appellate status and positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shiner  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision to remove him under Article 8
    ECHR.

 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision on 1 July 2015.

 4.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to  appeal  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  on  all
    grounds.  The  grounds  upon  which  permission  was  granted  may   be
    summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred in considering Article  8  ECHR
         without first considering Appendix FM EX.1,

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in  failing  to  apply  section
         117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,

    iii) It is arguable that the judge erred in  failing  to  give  adequate
         reasons for his findings on insurmountable obstacles at �37,

     iv) It is  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  identify
         compelling circumstances to consider matters outwith the Rules,

      v) It is arguable that the judge erred in  relying  upon  Chikwamba  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 in  light
         of Thakral, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the
         Home Department IJR [2015] UKUT 00096 (IAC).

 5. It is of note that a Clerk to the Upper Tribunal issued  Directions  to
    parties and the Appellant  on  2  December  2015  indicating  that  the
    original file is incomplete  and  that  any  material  upon  which  the
    Respondent seeks to rely should not be assumed to be  on  file.  As  it
    came to pass,  the  file  was  incomplete  and  contained  neither  the
    Respondent's Bundle nor the  Appellant's  Bundle  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I indicated this situation to the parties as the start of the
    hearing and neither sought an adjournment owing to this hindrance.

    Error of Law

 6. I find that there was an error of law in  the  decision  such  that  it
    should be set aside. My reasons for so finding follow shortly.

 7. Turning to the Respondent's first ground, I find that the judge  failed
    to consider the Immigration Rules in  relation  to  EX.1.  Pursuant  to
    Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) (Pakistan) [2014] UKUT  63
    (IAC), EX.1 is not freestanding, but given that the Appellant failed to
    meet the financial criteria, this failure would not have precluded  him
    from benefitting from an EX.1 consideration. However, this failure  may
    have been immaterial given that  the  judge  reaches  a  conclusion  on
    insurmountable obstacles at �37 in the Appellant's favour  outwith  the
    Immigration Rules.

 8. Concerning ground two, I find that the judge's  assessment  of  section
    117B confirms that section was taken into account. The  application  of
    that legislation features consideration of positive matters  in  favour
    of the Appellant. Whilst it would have been prudent  of  the  judge  to
    affirm his grasp of the public interest outwith the Rules, it  was  not
    necessarily fatal to the consideration of this issue. What  matters  is
    substance, not form (see Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC)).

 9. However, turning to ground three, I am just satisfied  that  the  judge
    has failed to give adequate reasons for his  findings  in  relation  to
    insurmountable obstacles at �37.  This  is  because  the  consideration
    beforehand touches upon relevant  matters  at  �34  before  turning  to
    section 117B at �25 and section 55 and the child's  interests  at  �36.
    Whilst those points are all valid ones, the conclusion reached  at  �37
    is vague and it is unclear why  the  judge  finds  that  insurmountable
    obstacles exist in this particular scenario and  what  precisely  those
    insurmountable obstacles are.

10. In relation to grounds 4 and 5, I am not required to  deal  with  them,
    however I should say that I do not find them to have merit. The lack of
    compelling circumstances being identified explicitly is not a test that
    Tribunal judges must discharge before going on to  consider  Article  8
    ECHR outwith the Rules. What is required is  that  there  is  a  matter
    which has not been considered within the  Rules  for  whatever  reason,
    which therefore  requires  consideration  so  that  the  assessment  of
    Article 8 ECHR is not incompatible with section 6 of the  Human  Rights
    Act 1998 for permitting an omission in consideration of  that  Article.
    In relation to  the  Chikwamba  point,  Chikwamba  still  features  for
    consideration outwith the Rules, as the Court  of  Appeal  appeared  to
    follow in Agyarko & Ors, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ .

11. Before I conclude, I should remark that I  was  unable  to  go  on  and
    consider the matter for myself because the parties had not provided  me
    with copies of the bundles of  evidence  available  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. As an illustration of this hindrance, I was unable to  assess
    for myself whether the judge's findings at �32  demonstrated  that  the
    financial threshold was met against Chikwamba as I did not  have  sight
    of the 12 months' bank statements and matching payslips that Ms  Hashmi
    stated were before the First-tier Tribunal. Further to discussion  with
    the parties, it also transpired that the judge may have been  wrong  to
    conclude that the Appellant did not meet the Rules given paragraph 1(m)
    of Appendix FM-SE; however as Mr Clarke pointed out, as  there  was  no
    cross-appeal, that matter was not open to me to assess but remained  an
    issue that the Appellant was open to raise before  the  Tribunal  at  a
    future hearing.

12. In the light of the above  findings,  I  set  aside  the  decision  and
    findings of the judge.

    Decision

13. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  to  be  heard  by  a  differently
    constituted bench.
