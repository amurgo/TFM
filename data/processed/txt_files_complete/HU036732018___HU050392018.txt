For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed, Hussain Immigration Law Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are a husband and wife. They are nationals of India  who
    seek leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.




    Anonymity Order

 2. Reference is made herein to medical evidence  relating  to  the  mental
    health of the First Appellant.  Having had regard to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Case History

 3. There has been some delay in this appeal being determined in the  Upper
    Tribunal for which the parties have my apologies, particularly  as   it
    has latterly been caused by (my own) administrative error and illness.

 4. The matter first came before me on the 4th August 2020. The  Appellants
    had permission  to  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Monaghan) to dismiss their linked human rights appeals.
    By my written decision of the 4th August 2020 (appended)  I  found  the
    alleged errors of law to be made out, and I set the decision  of  Judge
    Monaghan aside.  I need not go into  the  substance  of  that  decision
    here, save to note that until that point the focus of  the  appeal  had
    been on the First Appellant, Mr PD. My concluding paragraph read:

         "Time having marched on, there has been a development in the facts.
         As of today it is the Second Appellant, VM,  who  takes  the  lead.
         That is because she  has  now  herself  held  lawful  leave  for  a
         continuous period of  over  ten  years  and  as  such  prima  facie
         qualifies for a grant of indefinite leave  to  remain.  Unlike  her
         husband, VM returned to the United  Kingdom  within  the  180  days
         specified by the Rules, and although her last formal grant of leave
         expired some time ago,  she  has  since  held  leave  conferred  by
         section 3C of the Immigration  Act  1971.   In  light  of  this  Mr
         McVeety very sensibly suggested that before this Tribunal  proceeds
         to  the  remaking  he  will  seek  a  review  of  the   Appellants'
         applications from the relevant casework team.   I agree to  adjourn
         the appeal pending that review,  and  direct  that  the  matter  be
         listed before me as a Case Management Review (to be conducted  over
         'Skype for Business' or other medium to be identified) in the  week
         commencing the 12th October 2020".

 5. I pause to note that this paragraph, and my agreement  to  adjourn  the
    remaking, was based on what I was told by the parties, specifically  in
    respect of Mrs VM's immigration history. The matter came back before me
    for a 'case management review' hearing on the 22nd October 2020 when  I
    was informed by Mr McVeety that the Home Office were still  considering
    their position vis-ï¿½-vis Mrs VM.  I decided that there had already been
    too long a delay and proceeded  to  list  the  matter  for  substantive
    hearing so that the decision in the appeal could be remade.

 6. That hearing took place on the 27th January 2021.  On that date  I  was
    informed by Mr McVeety that the caseowner had determined that it  would
    not be appropriate to grant either appellant leave, and that if Mrs  VM
    wished to make a paid application for indefinite leave under  paragraph
    276B of the Rules it remained open  to  her  to  do  so.  Mr  Ahmad  of
    Counsel,  assisted  by  his  instructing  solicitor  Mr  Hussain,  made
    submissions to the effect that it would be disproportionate  to  expect
    her to do so, and that in this human  rights  appeal  her  prima  facie
    qualification under the  Rules  demonstrated  that  there  was  nothing
    weighing in the Respondent's favour in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise and so the appeal should be allowed.  The  parties  also  made
    submissions, further and in the alternative, on the position of Mr  PD.
     I reserved my decision.

 7. Unfortunately when I came  to  make  my  decision,  I  found  that  the
    information on file did not tally with the information provided  to  me
    by the parties at the hearings on the 4th  August  2020,  22nd  October
    2020 and the 27th January 2021. Specifically, upon  closer  inspection,
    and contrary to my own obiter comments in my decision of the 4th August
    2020, it was not clear to me that Mrs VM had accrued in excess  of  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom.  I  therefore
    issued Directions on the 1st March 2021 in the following terms:

         "Now I have come to make my decision  (with  apologies,  with  some
         delay) I find that there  is  no  evidence  at  all  before  me  to
         indicate that the Second Appellant has in  fact  spent  ten  years'
         continuously living in the United Kingdom.   On  the  contrary  the
         only immigration history that I have been given indicates that this
         is not the case. The Secretary of State's refusal letter of the 2nd
         January 2018 simply notes that she was refused leave to remain as a
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur in 2017, following an application made in 2014.
         The First-tier Tribunal appears to have been under  the  impression
         that the Second Appellant was at all material times in the  company
         of  her  husband  when  he  returned  to  India  between  2011-2013
         [paragraph 62 of Judge Monaghan's decision].   I am asked to make a
         finding  that  the  Second  Appellant  qualifies  for  leave  under
         paragraph 276B of the Rules but  in  light  of  this  contradictory
         evidence, I am at this stage unable to do so.  I  therefore  direct
         that the parties furnish me with a complete immigration history for
         the Second Appellant, within 14  days  of  these  directions  being
         sent".

 8. The Appellants' representatives responded to these  directions  on  the
    17th March 2021 providing a  detailed  chronology  in  respect  of  the
    various grants of leave  etc.  In  the  absence  of  any  contradictory
    information having been supplied by the Home Office, I am  prepared  to
    accept that this is accurate, and it forms the  basis  of  my  decision
    below.




    Background and Matters in Issue

 9. Both Appellants assert that the decision to refuse them leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom would be  a  disproportionate  interference  with
    their private lives, as protected by Article 8  ECHR.    In  particular
    each Appellant claims to qualify for indefinite leave to  remain  under
    paragraph 276B on the basis  of  continuous  lawful  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom for in excess of ten years.

10. The Respondent has refused to grant leave for the following reasons.

11. In respect of the First Appellant Mr PD it is  not  accepted  that  his
    lawful residence in the United  Kingdom  has  been  continuous.  Mr  PD
    arrived in the United Kingdom in October 2006 with entry clearance as a
    student. He remained, with continual leave, until the 10th October 2011
    when he returned to India. He then re-entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    March 2013.   The Respondent calculates that this was an  absence  from
    the United Kingdom of 519 days.  Although the First  Appellant  asserts
    that he was unwell, and  so  had  good  reason  for  his  absence,  the
    Respondent is not prepared to exercise  her  discretion  in  the  First
    Appellant's favour. In respect of the First Appellant  I  am  therefore
    asked to decide:

      i) Whether the 519 days he spent in India between 2011-2013 should  be
         overlooked in accordance with the Respondent's policy in respect of
         continuous residence;

     ii) If not, whether the decision to refuse leave today is  nevertheless
         disproportionate.

12. The Second Appellant Mrs VM has hitherto been treated as her  husband's
    dependent. As I have set out above, however, she now has a claim in her
    own right on the grounds that she has spent ten continuous  years  here
    and qualifies for leave under paragraph  276B.  The  questions  in  her
    appeal are therefore:

      i) Whether she qualifies for indefinite leave  having  regard  to  the
         requirements of paragraph 276B;

     ii) If so whether it would be disproportionate to dismiss her appeal on
         the basis that she should be expected to make a paid application;

    iii) If not whether it is nevertheless  disproportionate  to  refuse  to
         grant her leave.

13. I note that neither party pursues an appeal on 'private  life'  grounds
    with reference to paragraph 276ADE(1) of the  Rules:  this  ground  was
    lost before Judge Monaghan and did not feature in the appeal before the
    UT.



    The Second Appellant

14. Given the extent of the agreement between the parties about the  Second
    Appellant's circumstances, it is appropriate that I begin by addressing
    her claim.  In their written submissions of the  17th  March  2021  her
    representatives provided a chronology as follows  (edited  for  brevity
    and relevance):

         20.1.10  A enters United Kingdom with leave to enter

         23.12.11 In-time application to vary lodged. Further leave  granted
                  (Tier 4)

         15.3.12  In-time application to vary lodged. Further leave  granted
                  (Tier 1)

         23.7.14  In-time application to vary lodged. Further leave  granted
                  (Tier 2)

         26.3.16  In-time application to vary lodged (Tier 1)

         24.7.17  Application to vary (Tier 1) refused

         27.8.17  Application for Administrative Review rejected

         7.9.17   Application  made  for  limited  leave  to  remain  within
                  permitted 14 day 'grace period'

         14.2.18  Leave to remain refused

         16.2.18  Appellant lodges appeal in First-tier Tribunal

         8.10.18  First-tier Tribunal dismisses appeal

         15.11.18 Permission to appeal sought to  Upper  Tribunal.  Granted.
                  This is the appeal currently under consideration

15. I am satisfied  that  this  chronology  demonstrates  that  the  Second
    Appellant certainly had valid leave to remain between the 20th  January
    2010 and the 27th August 2017  when  her  Administrative  Review  of  a
    Points Based Refusal was rejected.  What is less clear is  whether  she
    had any valid leave after that.

16. The Appellant's written submissions point out that her application made
    on the 7th September 2017 was made within  the  14  days  grace  period
    provided for by paragraph 39E  of  the  Rules.  The  material  part  of
    paragraph 39E provides:

         39E. This paragraph applies where:

         (1)  the application was made within 14 days of the applicant's
         leave expiring and the Secretary of State considers that there was
         a good reason beyond the control of the applicant or their
         representative, provided in or with the application, why the
         application could not be made in-time; or

         (2)  the application was made:

             (a)  following the refusal of a previous application for leave
             which was made in-time; and

             (b)  within 14 days of:

                  (i)  the refusal of the previous application for leave; or

                  (ii) the expiry of any leave extended by section 3C of the
                  Immigration Act 1971; or

                  (iii)    the expiry of the time-limit for making an in-
                  time application for administrative review or appeal
                  (where applicable); or

                  (iv) any administrative review or appeal being concluded,
                  withdrawn or abandoned or lapsing.

17. I accept, on the information provided, that Mrs VM made her application
    for leave to remain within the 14-day  period  specified  at  paragraph
    39E(b)(ii). I do not however understand how that  assists  her  in  the
    present appeal.  The  purpose  of  39E  is  to  prevent  migrants  with
    otherwise compliant histories being refused indefinite leave on grounds
    of a short gap, falling between periods of valid leave: ie, where their
    period of overstaying is 'book-ended' by periods of valid leave.   Here
    the application in question,  made  on  the  7th  September  2017,  was
    rejected. The Second Appellant has not held any valid leave  since  the
    27th August 2017. Her overstaying has been open-ended.  Any  suggestion
    that she may somehow, by operation of 39E, have leave conferred by  s3C
    of the Immigration  Act  1971  is  wrong.  As  Lord  Justice  Underhill
    explains at [ï¿½6] of Hoque and Ors v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1357:

         "It is important to appreciate that section 3C only operates where
         the application for further leave is made before the expiry of  the
         current period ("in time"). If it is made after the expiry  of  the
         current period, the application may in due course be  granted,  but
         during the intervening period the applicant will have no leave  and
         will be an overstayer".

18. The material requirements of paragraph 276B are:

         "The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave to
         remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom are
         that:

         (i)  he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in
         the United Kingdom.

         (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why
         it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to
         remain on the ground of long residence, ... and

         (iii)    the applicant does not fall for refusal under the general
         grounds for refusal.

         (iv) the applicant has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the
         English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the United
         Kingdom ....

         (v)  the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration
         laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies, any
         current period of overstaying will be disregarded. Any previous
         period of overstaying between periods of leave will also be
         disregarded where -

             (a)  the previous application was made before 24 November 2016
             and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

             (b)  the further application was made on or after 24 November
             2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."

19. In Hoque the Court of Appeal considered  the  argument  that  paragraph
    276B (i) had to be read in line with sub-paragraph (v) so  as  to  mean
    that as long as the overstayer had made an application  within  the  14
    day  grace  period  -  regardless  of  whether  that  application   was
    successful - his continued, open-ended, overstaying would be overlooked
    for the purpose of calculating the period of continuous residence under
    (i).  Describing the drafting in the rule  as  "seriously  problematic"
    [at ï¿½30] the Court rejected that  contention.  That  is  precisely  the
    situation in which the Second Applicant finds herself.  Since the  27th
    August 2017 her overstaying has been open-ended, and cannot be remedied
    by 39E.

20. If I am wrong in my reading of Hoque, I note that the  further  written
    representations of the 17th March  2021  do  not  address  at  all  the
    question specifically raised in my Directions (set out at my  ï¿½7  above
    and at ï¿½62 of Judge Monaghan's  decision)  about  whether  or  not  the
    Second Appellant remained in India with her husband during his  absence
    in 2011-2013.   I note that  in  her  witness  statement  of  the  12th
    January 2021 she asserts that she has only ever been away  for  "around
    weeks": this vague assertion is unsupported by evidence  and  does  not
    address the finding of Judge Monaghan that actually she was also absent
    for almost 17 months.  I would further note that I have  been  provided
    with no evidence to demonstrate that the  Second  Appellant  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 276B(iv), in particular I have not been shown
    an English language certificate to the appropriate standard.

21. In those circumstances I cannot be satisfied that the Second  Appellant
    meets the requirements of paragraph 276B.  I  therefore  need  give  no
    consideration to the submissions  made  about  whether  she  should  be
    expected to make a paid application.

22. In the alternative I am  asked  to  consider  whether  dismissing  this
    appeal would nevertheless be a disproportionate interference  with  her
    private life.

23. I accept that the Second Appellant probably has a private life  capable
    of engaging Article 8 protection. Although I was given  no  substantive
    evidence of it, on the accepted facts she has lived primarily  in  this
    country since 2010. I accept that in that time  she  will  have  become
    accustomed to life in the United Kingdom and I infer that she will have
    made friends etc.  I further accept that the refusal to grant her leave
    will  prima  facie  interfere  with  that  private  life  in  that  the
    consequence of that refusal is that she will be required to  return  to
    India.  There is no dispute that the decision is one that the Secretary
    of State is lawfully permitted to take.

24. The question is whether the decision is proportionate.   In  making  my
    assessment I must have regard to the public interest factors delineated
    in s117B of Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

25. I have taken into account my finding that the Second Appellant does not
    meet the requirement of the Rules, and that she does not currently have
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is in the public interest.

26. It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
    economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that  persons  who  seek  to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak  English,
    because persons  who  can  speak  English  are  less  of  a  burden  on
    taxpayers, and are better able to integrate into society.  I have  been
    provided with no information about whether  the  Second  Appellant  can
    speak English. I do however note her (unevidenced) assertion  that  she
    has completed a Masters course here, and that  she  has  completed  the
    Life in the UK test. I am prepared to accept, even if  the  absence  of
    any formal certification such as required by the rules, that the Second
    Appellant can therefore speak English well  enough  to  permit  her  to
    integrate into society.

27. It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
    economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that  persons  who  seek  to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  financially  independent,
    because such person are not a burden on taxpayers, and are better  able
    to  integrate  into  society.   I  have  been  shown  no  evidence   to
    demonstrate that the Second Appellant is financially independent.   She
    speaks of financial difficulties in her statement but does not  explain
    how she and her husband are surviving.

28. Section 117B(4) mandates that "little weight"  should  be  given  to  a
    private or family life with a partner  that  is  established  when  the
    person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. For  the  purpose  of  this
    appeal I disregard this provision since I am satisfied that the  Second
    Appellant's private life was "established" when she was here with valid
    leave, and her relationship with her husband  was  formed  long  before
    either arrived here.

29. Sub-section (5) must however be applied. Little weight should be  given
    to a private life established by a person at a time when  the  person's
    immigration status is precarious.  In Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2018] UKSC 58 the  Supreme  Court  held  that  any
    leave other than indefinite leave is "precarious". It follows that  the
    periods of leave held by the Second Appellant under  the  Points  Based
    System constituted precarious leave.

30. Sub-section (6) has no application in this appeal since  there  are  no
    qualifying children involved.  The Appellants' dependent child was  not
    born until 2018.

31. I have taken all of these matters into account. I have also taken  into
    account that the Second Appellant has spent a  considerable  amount  of
    time and money investing in a future in the United Kingdom and that she
    would like to stay here.  Although I have no evidence  of  this  before
    me, I assume by the fact that she pursues this  appeal  that  she  also
    regards her child's future as lying  in  the  United  Kingdom.  In  the
    absence of any evidence I am unable to make any finding on that child's
    best interests other than to accept the presumption that they must  lie
    with remaining with both her parents.   I have however been  unable  to
    identify any factor or factors capable of founding a  claim  to  remain
    under Article 8.  There is nothing particular  about  this  case  which
    would warrant a grant of leave outside of the  rules,  or  which  would
    render a refusal to grant leave unreasonable or disproportionate.

32. The Second Appellant's appeal, insofar as it rests  on  her  own  case,
    must therefore be dismissed.   It is common ground between the  parties
    that should her husband succeed, she would however be granted leave  in
    line with him. I therefore turn to consider his appeal.




    The First Appellant

33. As outlined above, the basis of the Respondent's refusal of  the  First
    Appellant's claim was his prolonged absence  from  the  United  Kingdom
    between October 2011 and March 2013.  The Respondent asserts that  this
    gap  in  residence  prevents  the  Appellant  from  meeting  the  first
    requirement of 276B:

         (i)  he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in
         the United Kingdom.

34. The Respondent permits some gaps in residence. In her published  policy
    'Long Residence[1]' she explains:

         If the applicant has been absent from the UK for more than 6 months
         in one period or more than 18  months  in  total,  the  application
         should normally be refused.  However,  it  may  be  appropriate  to
         exercise  discretion  over  excess  absences   in   compelling   or
         compassionate circumstances, for example where  the  applicant  was
         prevented  from   returning   to   the   UK   through   unavoidable
         circumstances.

         This must be decided at senior executive officer (SEO) level with a
         grant of leave outside the Immigration Rules being the  appropriate
         outcome.

         Things to consider when assessing if the absence was compelling  or
         compassionate are:

         .    for all cases -  you  must  consider  whether  the  individual
         returned to the UK within a reasonable time once they were able  to
         do so

         .    for the single absence of over 180 days: you must consider how
         much of the absence was due to compelling circumstances and whether
         the applicant returned to the UK as soon as they were  able  to  do
         so; you must also consider the reasons for the absence

         .    for overall absences of 540 days in the 10  year  period:  you
         must consider whether the long absence (or  absences)  that  pushed
         the applicant over the limit happened towards the start or  end  of
         the 10 year residence period, and how soon they  will  be  able  to
         meet that requirement; if the absences were towards  the  start  of
         that period, the person may be able to meet the requirements in the
         near future, and so could be expected to apply when they  meet  the
         requirements; however, if the absences were recent, the person will
         not qualify for a long time, and so you must consider whether there
         are particularly compelling circumstances

         All of these factors must be considered together  when  determining
         whether it is reasonable to exercise discretion.

35. Boiling this somewhat repetitive policy down to its core, these are the
    relevant principles to be extracted.   Single absences of 6  months  or
    less will be overlooked, as will cumulative absences of  18  months  or
    less.  Anything  over  that  and  there  is  a  presumption  that   the
    application will be refused.  It may however be appropriate to exercise
    discretion in  the  applicant's  favour  if  there  are  compelling  or
    compassionate  circumstances,  for  example  where  the  applicant  was
    prevented from returning to the UK through  unavoidable  circumstances.
    The decision maker must  consider  the  reasons  for  the  absence  and
    whether the individual returned to the UK within a reasonable time once
    they were able to do so.

36. The parties agree that the question raised by that policy  is,  in  the
    context of this appeal, one for me to decide on the merits:  I  am  not
    restricted to a  judicial  review  of  the  considerations  taken  into
    account by the Respondent.   It is for me to decide whether there  were
    compelling circumstances preventing the Appellant from returning to the
    United Kingdom.

37. The reasons advanced by the First Appellant are set out in the evidence
    given  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  various  medical  documents
    emanating from institutions in India.  In brief summary the evidence is
    that in October 2011 he returned to India for a family holiday where he
    was struck down with severe back pain. His parents took  him  to  Sigma
    Hospital, a private clinic in his home town of Dilsukhnagar, Hyderabad.
    There he was diagnosed with  Lumbar  Disc  Disease,  Radiculopathy  and
    Acute sciatica.  The evidence indicates that he an in-patient at  Sigma
    Hospital between the 4th November 2011  and  the  19th  November  2011.
    Thereafter he was discharged with instructions to  "complete  bed  rest
    for 12 months and to visit the doctor as an  outpatient  until  further
    notice". His last visit to the doctor was on  the  18th  December  2012
    when he was given some more medication. He was advised on that occasion
    that he could "carry on his activities as usual".

38. The decisions before mine have subjected the medical evidence  provided
    to some scrutiny.  The Respondent was concerned that she had  not  been
    able, despite  attempts  to  contact  Sigma  Hospital,  to  verify  the
    documents provided; Judge Monaghan had found the  advice  of  "complete
    bed rest" and the prescription of antibiotics   to  be  implausible  in
    light of current practice in the NHS.   For my part I do  not  consider
    it necessary to take such matters into account. That is because even on
    the Appellant's own evidence, the account is not capable of meeting the
    terms of the policy.

39. The Appellant left the United Kingdom on the 10th October 2011. He  was
    permitted, within the terms of the policy, to remain out of the country
    until the 10th April 2012. By the 10th April 2012 he  was  living  with
    his parents, whilst making fairly  regular  outpatient  visits  to  his
    doctors. Although he remained under advice for "complete bed  rest"  it
    is apparent from his trips to the clinic that he was not  incapable  of
    movement  at  that  point.  It  has  not  been  demonstrated  that  the
    Appellant's back pain was so severe at this point  that  he  could  not
    have  made  the  journey  back  to  the  United  Kingdom.  "Compelling"
    indicates a high test. I am not satisfied that having a sore back meets
    it,  particularly  since  it  appears  that  the  Appellant  was  being
    prescribed a number of painkillers at the time.

40. The policy instructs decision makers to further  consider  whether  the
    applicant returned to the United Kingdom as soon as he was able  to  do
    so. He was  discharged  from  outpatient  care  at  Sigma  Hospital  in
    December 2012 when the doctor noted that he was "able to walk  freely".
    The Appellant did not receive any further medical care  at  that  point
    but did not return to the United Kingdom until  the  13th  March  2013,
    some three months later. I note that at that time he  still  had  valid
    leave as a Tier 1 'highly skilled person' which  was  valid  until  the
    15th September 2013 and could therefore have  re-entered  the  country.
    He did not return to the United Kingdom as soon as he was  able  to  do
    so.

41. Having taken these matters into account I am  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant has shown  that  there  were  "compelling"  reasons  why  his
    absence from the United Kingdom  was  as  long  as  it  was.  In  those
    circumstances I am unable to find that discretion should  be  exercised
    in his favour under 276B(i).

42. I move on to consider whether the decision to refuse to grant the First
    Appellant  leave  to  remain   is   nevertheless   a   disproportionate
    interference with his Article 8 rights.

43. I am prepared to accept - although again there is no evidence  of  this
    before me - that the First Appellant has established a private life  in
    the time that he has  spent  in  the  United  Kingdom.  I  accept  that
    requiring him to return once again to India would interfere  with  that
    private life. There is no  dispute  that  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    lawfully empowered to take the decision that she has. The  question  is
    whether the decision is disproportionate.  In my assessment I am  bound
    to have regard to the public interest as set out in s117B  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

44. I recognise that the First Appellant has in the past always  had  valid
    leave to be in the United  Kingdom.  I  must  however  also  take  into
    account my finding that the First Appellant does  not  today  meet  the
    requirement of the Rules for a further grant of leave. The  maintenance
    of effective immigration control is in the public interest.

45. It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
    economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that  persons  who  seek  to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak  English,
    because persons  who  can  speak  English  are  less  of  a  burden  on
    taxpayers, and are better able to integrate into society.  I have  been
    provided with no information about  whether  the  First  Appellant  can
    speak English to the required standard but I am prepared to infer  from
    the evidence, in particular the repeated grants of leave  as  a  Points
    Based Migrant, that he is able to  do  so.  I  accept  that  the  First
    Appellant can therefore speak English well  enough  to  permit  him  to
    integrate into society.

46. It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
    economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that  persons  who  seek  to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  financially  independent,
    because such person are not a burden on taxpayers, and are better  able
    to  integrate  into  society.   I  have  been  shown  no  evidence   to
    demonstrate that the First Appellant is financially  independent.   His
    most recent statement, of  12th  January  2021,  is  to  the  contrary.
    Therein the Appellant states that he has lost his job and  that  he  is
    finding it difficult to  feed  his  family.   This  must  therefore  be
    weighed against him in the balance.

47. Section 117B(4) mandates that "little weight"  should  be  given  to  a
    private or family life with a partner  that  is  established  when  the
    person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. For  the  purpose  of  this
    appeal I disregard this provision since I am satisfied that  the  First
    Appellant's private life was "established" when he was here with  valid
    leave, and his relationship with his wife was formed long before either
    arrived here.

48. Sub-section (5) must however be applied. Little weight should be  given
    to a private life established by a person at a time when  the  person's
    immigration status is precarious.  In Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2018] UKSC 58 the  Supreme  Court  held  that  any
    leave other than indefinite leave is "precarious". It follows that  the
    periods of leave held by the First Appellant  under  the  Points  Based
    System constituted precarious leave.

49. Sub-section (6) has no application in this appeal since  there  are  no
    qualifying children involved.  The Appellants' dependent child was  not
    born until 2018.

50. I have taken all of these matters into account. I have also taken  into
    account  that  the  First  Appellant,  and  his  family,  has  spent  a
    considerable amount of time and money investing  in  a  future  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I am prepared to  accept,  for  the  purpose  of  this
    appeal that he continues to suffer from back pain and that he has since
    childhood suffered from anxiety. As in his wife's appeal I accept, even
    in the absence of any actual evidence, that it would  be  in  the  best
    interests of their child to remain  with  them  both.   None  of  these
    matters, even weighed  cumulatively,  come  close  to  outweighing  the
    public interest in refusing leave to those who are unable to  meet  the
    requirements of the rules.  It is apparent from the evidence  that  the
    Appellant has family in India who are not without resources,  and  that
    he would therefore receive some assistance in resuming his life  there.
    His immigration history shows him to be educated and highly skilled and
    I have been shown no reason why he would be unable to work in India  as
    he has worked here.  There is nothing in the evidence before me to  say
    that the Respondent's decision is a disproportionate response in  light
    of the legitimate aim of protecting the economy through the  imposition
    of immigration controls.
