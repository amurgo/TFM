McCLOSKEY J



Introduction

   1) The Applicant is the father member of a family unit, the other members
      being his spouse and their four dependent children. All  of  them  are
      Kuwaiti Bidoons. The distinguishing feature of the Applicant  is  that
      he is a recognised refugee in the United Kingdom  with  current  leave
      until 21 May 2020. The oldest child resides with him, as a  dependant.
      The target of this judicial review challenge is the failure/refusal of
      the Respondent, the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (the
      "Secretary of State"), to determine the application of the Applicant's
      spouse and their twin infant boys  for  family  reunification  in  the
      United Kingdom.


   2) By Order of Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce dated 06 March 2017, permission
      to apply for judicial review was granted, in tandem  with  expedition.
      It is appropriate to note the terms in which urgent consideration  was
      requested in the Judicial Review Claim Form:


           "The Applicant's wife and two youngest children  are  living  in
           dire and severely over-crowded conditions  in  Iraq.   They  are
           asylum seekers registered with UNCHR who  had  to  flee  Kuwait.
           They survive on charity. The youngest  child  ........   has  to
           attend hospital every month for treatment  in  relation  to  her
           inflamed lungs ......


           The Applicant's daughter in the UK ..............,  is  severely
           affected by the separation from her mother.  She is  distressed,
           cannot concentrate, is struggling  in  school  and  has  regular
           support from her GP and Social Services in respect of her mental
           health .....


           The effect of prolonged separation is having a  damaging  impact
           on all parties, but in particular the four  children,  all  aged
           between 3 and 10 years."


The Broader Factual Matrix

   3) I distil the following from the  statement  of  supporting  facts  and
      grounds.  I shall  highlight  infra  whether  there  is  any  material
      contentious factual issue requiring particular consideration.


   4) All six members of the family were born in Kuwait.  The four  children
      are now aged 10, 8, 4 and 3 years respectively.  Some  few  years  ago
      the Applicant began  attending  demonstrations  in  support  of  equal
      rights for Bidoons in Kuwait.  This gave rise to several  episodes  of
      detention and mistreatment entailing a head injury  causing  epilepsy.
      In time, a warrant for the Applicant's arrest based on his attendances
      at demonstrations and alleged distribution of anti-state leaflets  was
      issued.  This precipitated his flight from Kuwait.


   5) On 31 October 2014 the Applicant arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  and
      claimed asylum. On 09  November  2014  the  oldest  two  children  did
      likewise.  All three were granted refugee status in 2015.


   6) Meanwhile, the authorities in Kuwait continued to pursue the Applicant
      resulting in the application of adverse attention to  his  spouse  and
      their two younger children, all of whom fled to Iraq.  There they live
      destitute  and  in  chronically  over-crowded   conditions   and   are
      registered with UNHCR as asylum applicants.


   7) The succeeding milestones in the  narrative  are  susceptible  to  the
      following tabulation:


   i) Aided by the Red Cross the Applicant submitted  on  line  applications
      for family  reunion,  giving  rise  to  an  appointment  at  the  Visa
      Application Centre ("VAC") in Basra on 28 August 2016.


  ii) The VAC staff demanded the production of passports as a  pre-requisite
      to considering the applications.


 iii) On 13 August 2016 Ms Mead of the Red Cross, transmitted the details of
      the application to the VAC  Entry  Clearance  Manager  at  the  Amman,
      without response.


  iv) Between September and November 2016 the Red Cross engaged in a  formal
      complaint process with UKVI in an attempt to stimulate progress.


   v) With the assistance of the Red Cross the Applicant  completed  new  on
      line visa applications and booked an appointment at the Baghdad VAC on
      06 December 2016.  An accompanying letter from the Red Cross explained
      that, being Kuwaiti Bidoons, the  family  members  concerned  did  not
      possess identity documents or travel documents, drawing  attention  to
      the supporting passage in the  Home  Office  Country  Information  and
      Guidance Publication "Kuwait: Bidoons" (the "CIG") of July 2016.


  vi)  The  application  included  a  substantial  quantity  of  documentary
      evidence  such  as  the  asylum  determination,  biometric   residence
      permits, the marriage contract, the asylum interviews of the Applicant
      and the aforementioned CIG.


 vii) At the  scheduled  appointment  on  06  December  2016  in  Baghdad  a
      repetition of (ii) occurred.


viii) Acting on a suggestion made by the VAC official on the last  mentioned
      occasion the Applicant travelled to Jordan in December 2016  where  he
      engaged with the  British  Embassy  in  Amman.   Promises  of  further
      enquiries came to nothing.
  ix) In January and February 2017 the  Applicant's  solicitors  engaged  in
      formal correspondence with the Home Office, to no avail.   Ultimately,
      pre-action protocol letters dated 18 February 2017 went unanswered.


The Respondent's Position

   8) The Applicant's solicitors received a reply to  their  initial  letter
      addressed to the Home Office which can  only  be  described  as  quite
      hopeless.  While, by the terms of the reply,  the  author  claimed  to
      have investigated the issues raised with  the  Amman  Entry  Clearance
      Manager, the thrust of the reply was that no one was able to  say  why
      the Amman VAC had refused to consider the applications registered with
      them.


   9) Following several  further  solicitor's  letters,  the  UKVI  Head  of
      International Visa Operations eventually responded, by letter dated 09
      March 2017 which contains the following passage of note:


           "Unfortunately, as no applications have actually been submitted
           we do not have available records to confirm exactly what has
           previously occurred ....


           Our  use  of  the  previously  referred  to   policy   and   its
           implementation has been through the  Home  Office  Council.   We
           have also previously had applications  for  JR  in  relation  to
           similar cases.  At the current time  the  policy  has  not  been
           highlighted as being unreasonable by the Courts."




      Pausing, at this juncture UKVI was not disputing the assertion that on
      two previous occasions, appointments at the Basra VAC and the  Baghdad
      VAC  had  resulted  in  a  refusal  to  even   consider   the   family
      reunification applications on the ground that the Applicants  did  not
      present suitable identification.  The UKVI position remained the vague
      one stated in its letter dated 08 February 2017:


           "...  It may be that [the Applicants] were refused because  they
           had not shown that they were  normally  resident  in  Iraq.   As
           individuals claiming to be from Kuwait, they would need to  show
           documentation  showing  that  they  normally  reside  in   Iraq.
           Without this, they would be refused."




      In passing, and not  to  be  lightly  dismissed,  by  this  stage  the
      Applicant had expended some �2,000 in securing the two  aforementioned
      VAC appointments.  His solicitors pointed out that he was  in  receipt
      of Employment Support Allowance and unable to work.


The UKVI Policy


  10) The less than illuminating  and  unparticularised  reference  to  UKVI
      "policy" in the second  of  the  Respondent's  aforementioned  letters
      invites  a  little  forensic  excavation.   In   their   letters   the
      Applicant's solicitors quoted the  following  extract  from  the  UKVI
      Family Reunion Guidance, published in July 2016.


           "Applicants must submit all original  documents  that  they  are
           able to provide to establish their identity and to support their
           claim to be related to the sponsor.  This could be


           A passport


           National Identity Cards


           Other official documents, including for example school ID  cards
           or letters, UNHCR attestations or identity cards. ...


           Where original documents are not available  to  submit  with  an
           application ....  the onus will be on the applicant to provide a
           reasonable alternative and explanation of their absence ...."


           [Emphasis added.]




  11) The thrust and intention of the policy emerged  from  considering  its
      terms as a whole.  I begin with the opening sentence under the heading
      "About this Guidance":


           "This guidance  tells  you  about  our  refugee  family  reunion
           policy, which allows a spouse or partner and children under  the
           age of 18  of  those  granted  refugee  status  or  humanitarian
           protection in the UK to reunite with them here,  providing  they
           formed part of the family unit before  the  sponsor  fled  their
           country of origin or habitual residence.  It  must  be  used  by
           caseworkers considering whether  to  grant  entry  clearance  or
           leave to enter or remain for the purpose of  family  reunion  in
           accordance with paragraphs 352A to  352FJ  of  Part  11  of  the
           Immigration Rules"




      The paragraph entitled "Purpose of Instruction" is revealing, for  two
      reasons.  First, the policy operates as, inter alia, an instruction to
      case workers.  Second,  this  passage  reiterates  that  case  workers
      "must" consider family reunion applications  in  accordance  with  the
      policy.  Third, it applies as fully to entry clearance officers abroad
      as to United Kingdom case workers.




  12)  The  "Background"  paragraph   makes   clear   that   the   potential
      beneficiaries  of  the  policy  are  "immediate  family  members"  and
      incorporates the Immigration Rules definition of "a spouse or  partner
      and children under the age of 18, who formed part of the  family  unit
      before their refugee sponsor fled their country of  origin  or  former
      habitual residence to claim asylum in the UK".


      The "Policy Intention" is expressed in these terms:


            "The policy objective is to deliver a fair and effective family
           reunion process, which supports the principle  of  family  unity
           by:

              . acknowledging the speed and manner  in  which  families  may
                become separated by conflict  and  persecution,  recognising
                the  stress  this  may  cause  and  providing  a  means  for
                immediate family members to reunite in the UK;
              . allowing a spouse or partner and children under the  age  of
                18  of  those  granted  refugee   status   or   humanitarian
                protection, to reunite with them in the UK,  providing  they
                formed part of the family unit  before  their  sponsor  fled
                their country of origin;
              . ensuring applications are properly considered  in  a  timely
                and  sensitive  manner  on  an  individual,  objective   and
                impartial basis, acknowledging the vulnerable situation that
                applicants  (particularly  women  and  children)  may   find
                themselves in and where possible, expediting claims  without
                unnecessary delay;
              . preventing abuse  of  the  process  by  carefully  reviewing
                applications where fraudulent  documents  are  submitted  or
                there  is  evidence  that  the  sponsor  obtained  leave  by
                deception, and refusing such applications where appropriate;
              . preventing those who would otherwise be  excluded  from  the
                Refugee Convention obtaining leave under the family  reunion
                Rules by subjecting them to  the  same  security  checks  as
                asylum seekers."


  13) The section relating to children is noteworthy:


           "Although  section  55  [of   the   Borders,   Citizenship   and
           Immigration Act 2009] only applies to children in  the  UK,  the
           statutory guidance, Every Child Matters -  Change  for  Children
           provides guidance on the extent to which the spirit of the  duty
           should be applied to children overseas. Caseworkers  considering
           overseas applications must adhere to the spirit of  the  Section
           55 duty and make enquiries when they suspect that a child may be
           in need of  protection,  or  where  there  are  safeguarding  or
           welfare needs that require attention."

      It continues:


           "Caseworkers must carefully consider all of the information  and
           evidence provided as to how a family member in the UK who  is  a
           child will be affected by a decision and this must be  addressed
           when assessing whether an applicant meets  the  requirements  of
           the rules. The decision notice or letter must  demonstrate  that
           all relevant information and evidence provided  about  the  best
           interests of a child in the UK have been considered. Caseworkers
           must carefully assess the  quality  of  any  evidence  provided.
           Original  documentary  evidence  from  official  or  independent
           sources must be given more weight in the decision-making process
           than unsubstantiated statements about a child's best interests.


           Where it is relevant to a  decision,  caseworkers  dealing  with
           overseas applications must  make  it  clear  in  their  decision
           letter that the child's  welfare  has  been  considered  in  the
           spirit of section 55 without stating that it is  a  duty  to  do
           so."
  14) The guidance continues:


           "Where an applicant does not meet the requirements of the  rules
           for entry clearance or leave to  remain,  caseworkers  must,  in
           every  case,  consider  the  family  exceptional   circumstances
           guidance or consider whether there are any compassionate factors
           which may warrant a  grant  of  leave  outside  the  Immigration
           Rules."

      Notably, in the same section, there is an express instruction to  give
      effect to the "key principles to take into account" by recourse to:


            . Section 55 Children's Duty Guidance
            . Every Child Matters - Change for Children
            . United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
            . Victims of human trafficking - guidance for  frontline  staff
              (where appropriate)



  15) The policy contains (at  pages  10  -  24)  an  impressively  detailed
      section entitled "Family Reunion Application Process".  This  includes
      the following noteworthy features:


        a) Family reunion applications are normally, though not invariably,
           to be made from outside the United Kingdom and using the on-line
           application process.


        b) All such applications must be "carefully considered".


        c) This policy  guidance  and  paragraphs  352A  to  352FJ  of  the
           Immigration Rules (the "Rules") will be applied  to  every  such
           application.


        d) Success outside the Rules, is  specifically  contemplated,  case
           workers being  enjoined  to  consider  "the  family  exceptional
           circumstances guidance or whether there  are  any  compassionate
           factors ....".


        e) Decisions will be made on the basis of the information  provided
           in the application form, the supporting evidence, the results of
           checks or enquiries and, in some  cases,  interviews  either  by
           telephone or in person.


        f) "Security and identity checks must be completed on the applicant
           and their sponsor  before  considering  the  application".   [My
           emphasis.]




      This is followed by a discrete "Proof of Identity" section  which,  in
      the context of these proceedings, it is appropriate to reproduce:


           "In all cases, caseworkers must be satisfied that the  applicant
           is who they claim to be. All applicants in-country and  overseas
           are required to give their biometrics.  For  applicants  over  5
           years of age, this will be a scan of their  fingerprints  and  a
           digital photograph. Applicants who are under 5 are not  required
           to  provide  their  fingerprints,  but  must  still  provide   a
           photograph. Caseworkers must refer to the Operating Mandate  for
           details of the business as usual biometric checks to be  carried
           out.


           Applicants must submit all original documents that they are able
           to provide to establish their  identity  and  to  support  their
           claim to be related to the sponsor, this could be:


               . a passport
               . national identity cards
               . other official documents, including, for example, school ID
                 cards or letters, UNHCR attestations or identity cards


           Where original documents are not available  to  submit  with  an
           application, such as a passport or marriage certificate, because
           they have been lost or they could not be  issued  due  to  there
           being no authority to issue in the country the sponsor and their
           family have left, the onus will be on the applicant to provide a
           reasonable  alternative  and  explanation  of   their   absence,
           including any attempts to obtain  them,  and  to  satisfactorily
           demonstrate they are related as claimed to  their  sponsor.  The
           Evidence section of this guidance provides further information."

  16) The policy guidance also contains a detailed "Evidence" section (pages
      21 - 31) which begins with the following general rule:


           "Although there is no requirement in the Immigration  Rules  for
           specified evidence to support a family reunion application,  the
           onus is on the applicant and their sponsor to provide sufficient
           evidence to prove their relationship and satisfy the  caseworker
           that they are related as claimed. The caseworker  must  consider
           whether, on the 'balance of probabilities', there is  sufficient
           information to accept that the sponsor and applicant are related
           as claimed and that the relationship is genuine and subsisting."

      The immediately succeeding passage is of some moment:


           "Caseworkers must be mindful of the difficulties that people may
           face in providing documentary evidence of their relationship  or
           the fact that it is subsisting. Those fleeing conflict zones  or
           dangerous situations may not have  time  to  collect  supporting
           documents and may not realise they would be required."

      The  next  paragraph  contains  an   acknowledgement   that   "genuine
      documentation" may  not  be  readily  available,  supplemented  by  an
      inexhaustive list of reasons why this may be  so.   Notably,  in  this
      context, there is specific reference to CIG:


           "In addition to individual  accounts  given  by  the  applicant,
           Country Information and Guidance (CIG) will  give  some  insight
           into challenges that they may face  in  acquiring  documents  or
           providing credible documentation  and  providing  evidence  that
           their relationship started before their sponsor left to  support
           their application."

      This is followed by:


           "Where original documents are not available to submit  with  any
           application, such as a passport  or  marriage  certificate,  the
           onus is on the applicant to provide a reasonable alternative  or
           an  explanation  of  their   absence   and   to   satisfactorily
           demonstrate that are  related  to,  or  in  a  relationship  as,
           claimed to  their  sponsor.  Applicants  and  sponsors  may  not
           understand the importance or  the  need  to  write  a  statement
           relating to lack of evidence. See Requesting further evidence."

  17)  The  remainder  of  this  section  contains  the  following   general
      statements of note:


       a) The civil standard of proof applies: "It is for the applicant  and
          their sponsor to provide sufficient  evidence  to  show  they  are
          related or in a relationship as claimed and satisfy this burden."


       b)  "Case  workers  may  request  further   information   about   the
          application.  Requests for further evidence or documents should be
          sensible and realistic, bearing in mind the  situation  which  has
          prompted the refugee to leave their country of origin or  habitual
          residence."


       c) "If the case worker considers that an explanation about  the  lack
          of documents or  further  evidence  is  required  to  support  the
          claimed relationship, enquiries should be made through either  the
          applicant's representative, by post or by  arranging  a  telephone
          call to the sponsor or applicant (where appropriate).  If the case
          worker is still not satisfied with the evidence they may, if  they
          think necessary, arrange an interview with the sponsor in  the  UK
          and/or with the applicant overseas."


       d) This discrete theme is repeated in a separate passage (page 24):


           "Caseworkers  may  defer  the  application  and   make   further
           enquiries to the Refugee Resettlement Programmes Unit (RRPU) for
           evidence that the relationship is as claimed. Caseworkers should
           include the sponsor's name, date of birth, Home Office reference
           number (if known) and specify which programme  the  sponsor  has
           arrived  in  the  UK  under  (Syrian  VPR   Programme,   Gateway
           Protection  Programme  or  Mandate   Refugee   Programme)   when
           contacting RRPU.


           Providing  the  caseworker  is  satisfied  that   the   evidence
           submitted shows that the dependant is who they claim to be, that
           the relationship with  the  sponsor  exists,  is  genuine,  they
           intend to live together in the UK and that the  requirements  of
           the Immigration Rules have been met, the  caseworker  may  grant
           leave - but not refugee status - in line with the sponsor."

       e) There are no prescribed requirements  concerning  the  documentary
          evidence to be provided to establish an  applicant's  relationship
          with the sponsor concerned.  This is particularly clear from  page
          23 of the policy guidance.


       f) Finally, it is specifically contemplated  that  an  Applicant  may
          provide DNA  evidence  "....   to  prove  their  relationship  and
          satisfy the case worker that they are related as claimed".


Consideration and Conclusions


  18) In her permission order (supra) Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce  considered
      all of the Applicant's legal grounds  of  challenge  to  be  arguable.
      These are, in summary, a failure to apply  the  Secretary  of  State's
      published policy, irrationality, breach of all of the family  member's
      rights under Article 8 ECHR and vis-�-vis  the  two  children  in  the
      United Kingdom, breach of the duties owed under section 55 of the 2009
      Act.


  19) The Secretary of State's policy guidance, summarised  above,  occupies
      centre stage in these proceedings. It is  the  instrument  upon  which
      attention  must  be  focused  in  the  exercise  of  identifying   the
      applicable legal principles.  Its elastic, non-prescriptive terms  and
      open textured content and structure reflect emphatically the essential
      characteristics of every policy instrument.  This is the first element
      of the legal perspective.  Second, this policy guidance is a  paradigm
      illustration of a policy which falls to be viewed through the analysis
      of Lord Clyde in R (Alconbury Developments) v Secretary of State  for
      the Environment, Transport and the Regions [2003] 2 AC 295, at [143]:


          "The formulation of policies is a perfectly proper course for  the
          provision  of  guidance  in  the  exercise  of  an  administrative
          discretion. Indeed policies are an essential element  in  securing
          the  coherent  and  consistent   performance   of   administrative
          functions. There  are  advantages  both  to  the  public  and  the
          administrators in having such policies. Of course there are limits
          to be observed in the way policies are applied. Blanket  decisions
          which  leave  no  room  for  particular   circumstances   may   be
          unreasonable. What is crucial is that the policy must not  fetter
          the exercise  of  the  discretion. The  particular  circumstances
          always require to be considered. Provided that the policy  is  not
          regarded as  binding  and  the  authority  still  retains  a  free
          exercise of discretion the policy may serve the useful purpose  of
          giving a reasonable guidance  both  to  applicants  and  decision-
          makers."


          [Emphasis added]


  20) I would add that it is long established that this type of  publication
      is not to be construed  by  adopting  the  approach  applicable  to  a
      statute, deed or contract. See, for example R v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department, ex parte Ozminnos [1994] Imm AR 287 at 292. The
      construction of every document is, of course, a question of  law  and,
      therefore, ultimately a matter for the court: In Re McFarland [2004]
      UKHL 17 at [24].

  21) The Applicant's challenge also engages the "Lumba"  principle,  namely
      public authorities should normally give full effect to their published
      policies.  See Lumba v SSHD [2012] 1 AC 245, per  Lord  Dyson  JSC  at
      [26]:


           ".....  a decision maker must follow his published  policy  (and
           not some different unpublished policy)  unless  there  are  good
           reasons for not doing so. The  principle  that  policy  must  be
           consistently applied is not in doubt ...."


      It is generally held that this principle  has  its  roots  in  another
      hallowed principle, namely the equal implementation of laws, in tandem
      with non-discrimination and the avoidance of arbitrariness.

  22) In this context I also draw attention  to  what  was  stated  by  this
      Tribunal in R (SM)  v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      (Unaccompanied Minors -  Article  17  Dublin  Regulation  -  Remedies)
      [2017] UKUT 124 (IAC) at [48] - [49]:


           "[48] It is convenient at this  juncture  to  express  our  view
                 - obiter of course - on the effect of a failure  of  this
                 species in the context of  a  human  rights  challenge.  In
                 human rights cases, the question for the court or  tribunal
                 concerned is whether the decision of the  public  authority
                 under challenge infringes the human  right  engaged.  Where
                 statutory appeals are  concerned,  the  judicial  authority
                 must confront, and answer, this  question.  However,  where
                 the challenge is pursued via the medium of judicial review,
                 as in this case, some calibration is required. All of  this
                 was addressed in extenso in the decision of this Tribunal
                 in R  (SA)  v   Secretary   of   State   for   the   Home
                 Department [2015]  UKUT  536  (IAC),  at  [17]  -   [30],
                 considered in the recent decision of the  Court  of  Appeal
                 in R (Caroopen and Myrie) v Secretary of State for the Home
                 Department [2016] EWCA Civ 1307.

           [49]  Bearing in mind that we did not receive full  argument  on
                 this issue,  we  confine  ourselves  to  two  propositions,
                 recognising that these might require  reconsideration  with
                 the benefit of more extensive argument. The first  is  that
                 Government policy statements may, in  principle,  sound  on
                 the issue of legitimate aim. The second is that  a  failure
                 by the decision maker  to  take  into  account  a  relevant
                 Government policy statement  may  illuminate  the  judicial
                 assessment  of  whether  the   impugned   decision   is   a
                 proportionate means of furthering  the  legitimate  aim  in
                 play."




  23) The context being one of public law, I consider that  it  matters  not
      whether  the  target  of  the  Applicant's   challenge   is   properly
      characterised as a failure on the part of the Secretary  of  State  to
      consider,  examine  and  determine  the   three   outstanding   family
      reunification claims or a positive decision to this effect.  There are
      elements of both characterisations. Common to each  is  the  indelible
      fact that the applications have not been examined and determined.  The
      question  to  be  decided  is  whether  this  involves  a  public  law
      misdemeanour  within  the  compass  of  the  Applicant's  grounds   of
      challenge.


  24) The irresistible answer to this question must be in  the  affirmative.
      First, by her published policy the Secretary of State was specifically
      enjoined to consider the applications and, in doing so, to examine the
      proof of identity and family relationships provided, together with the
      explanations given for the absence of documents such as a passport  or
      a national identity card.  The approach of the  Secretary  of  State's
      officials  conspicuously  fails  to  give  effect   to   this   policy
      requirement.  That is not of  course  the  end  of  the  matter  since
      policies do not generate absolute rules and their non-observance  may,
      in  principle,   be   capable   of   legitimate   justification.    No
      justification of any kind is proffered on behalf of the  Secretary  of
      State and none is identifiable in the evidential matrix.


  25) Second, I consider that the Secretary of State's  failure  to  examine
      the family reunification applications on their  merits  and  determine
      them accordingly infringes the rights of all six family members  under
      Article 8(1) ECHR.  Third, given that it is  manifestly  in  the  best
      interests of the children concerned that the family unit be recomposed
      in the United Kingdom, there has been a clear breach of section  55(1)
      of the 2009 Act (vis-�-vis the two older children) and  the  Secretary
      of State's policy which, in  substance,  applies  section  55  without
      material qualification to children outside the United Kingdom such  as
      the third and fourth children of this family.


  26) To summarise, figuratively the Secretary of State does not have a  leg
      upon  which  to  stand  either  factually  or  legally.    Thus   this
      application must succeed.


Remedy

  27) In the exercise of my  discretion,  having  regard  to  the  egregious
      nature of the public  law  misdemeanours  established,  the  extensive
      delay on the part of the Secretary of State, the factor of  protracted
      family  fragmentation,  the  involvement  of  four  directly  affected
      children of tender years and  the  lamentable  history  generally,   I
      would have granted the following remedies:


        a) an order quashing the refusals on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
           State  to  examine  each  of  the   three   outstanding   family
           reunification applications on their facts and merits; and


        b) a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to  determine
           these applications on their facts  and  merits  within  21  days
           maximum.




  28) However, at the eleventh hour,  the  Tribunal  was  requested  by  the
      parties to approve  a  draft  Consent  Order,  the  material  portions
      whereof are the following:


           "UPON THE RESPONDENT agreeing to accept  for  consideration  the
           Applicant's wife and children's family reunion applications,  to
           be submitted in person at the Visa Application Centre in  Basra,
           Iraq;


           AND UPON THE RESPONDENT agreeing to use her best  endeavours  to
           issue a decision as soon as possible,  and  no  later  than  the
           current published visa  processing  guidelines,  absent  special
           circumstances;

           BY CONSENT, it is ordered that:-

           1 . The hearing listed for 26 April 2016 be vacated;
           2. The Applicant do have leave to  withdraw  the  above-numbered
              claim for judicial review."




      This draft was not, of course, binding on the Tribunal.  There are two
      fundamental reasons for this.  First, in judicial  review  proceedings
      it is not open to the parties to dictate  the  outcome.   Rather,  the
      twofold question of whether a remedy should be granted and, if so,  in
      what terms, lies within the  discretion  of  the  court  or  tribunal.
      Second, the withdrawal of any case before the Upper Tribunal  requires
      the approval of the Tribunal, per Rule  17  of  the  Tribunals  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules of  Procedure  2008,  while  Rule  39  designates  the
      Tribunal the  arbiter  of  every  proposed  consent  order.  Thus  the
      Tribunal has the duty of adjudicating on the  issues of withdrawal and
      the terms of any withdrawal.




  29) In the event, taking into account the factor  of  consent,  the  clear
      theme of expedition  in  the  parties'  agreed  draft  order  and  the
      possibility that certain evidence having  a  bearing  on  the  content
      might not be before the Tribunal,  I  was  persuaded,  marginally,  to
      approve this draft.  However, what I have said at [27] above conveys a
      clear message to the Secretary of State and will be of significance in
      certain  future  eventualities,  including  the   issue   of   further
      proceedings.  Should this family find themselves driven to the  latter
      course, the Tribunal will process their case with  a  high  degree  of
      expedition (weeks, not months) and will exercise its discretion in the
      matters of remedy and costs appropriately.


Order

  30) The Order of the Tribunal encompasses the following elements:


   a) See the passage in quotation marks at [28] above.


   b) The Secretary of State will pay the Applicant's reasonable  costs,  to
      be assessed in default of agreement.

   c) There shall be detailed assessment of the Applicant's costs to reflect
      his publicly funded status in accordance  with  the  Civil  Legal  Aid
      (Costs) Regulations 2013.

   d) Liberty to apply.

   e) Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal is refused.
