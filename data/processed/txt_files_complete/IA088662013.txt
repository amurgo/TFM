                                                                  Respondent

For the Claimant:         Mr A Syed-Ali (Immigration Aid)
For the Respondent:        Mr P Nath (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal   by  the  Secretary  of  State
    against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal   (Judge  Glossop)  by
    which he allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal to grant him further leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 2. For the sake of clarity and continuity I shall continue  to  refer,  in
    this determination, to the Secretary of State as Respondent and  to  Mr
    Islam as the Appellant even though this is  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal.

 3. My first task is to decide whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an
    error of law and if so whether and to  what  extent  its  determination
    should be set aside.

 4. The Secretary of  State  was  not  represented  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The Appellant was represented, as he was  before  me,  by  Mr
    Syed-Ali. The Judge's determination is extremely brief. At paragraph  3
    the Judge noted that in a decision dated 6th March 2013 the Appellant's
    application was refused by the Secretary of State because  although  he
    had claimed 10 points for maintenance under Appendix C, the  Respondent
    was not satisfied that the documents  provided  contained  the  details
    required by the Rules  and  thus  the  application  was  refused  under
    paragraph 245ZX(d). The Respondent indicated  that  the  Appellant  was
    required to show that he had the required maintenance  funds  of  �2000
    plus any outstanding course fees which meant, in this case, a total sum
    of �3800 was needed. The Appellant had to show those funds were in  his
    account for the 28 day period required by paragraph 1A of  Appendix  C.
    The bank statement did not show the name of the account holder and  the
    letter from Lloyds TSB failed to show the account number. I  would  add
    at this stage that the Secretary of State was correct in those comments
    about the evidence produced by the Appellant.

 5. The Judge noted the evidence at the hearing which  included  a  witness
    statement, adopted by the Appellant  in which he  stated  that  he  had
    sent his bank statements to the Secretary of State with a letter  dated
    28th December 2012 which confirmed his name and address  and  that  the
    Respondent had not taken that letter into account. The  Appellant  said
    that he could have been contacted by the Secretary of State for further
    details and that he  had  been  continuing  his  course  and  attending
    regularly. His evidence was that he did have sufficient  funds  at  the
    time of the application.

 6. The Judge referred to submissions made on behalf of the Appellant  that
    he  ought  to  succeed  under  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  in
    accordance with Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).

 7. The Judge at paragraph 7  commented  that  he  may  take  into  account
    evidence at the date of the hearing.  I would state at this stage  that
    in making that remark the  Judge  erred  because  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which  applies  to  Points
    Based System appeals provides that only  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application can be taken into account and so evidence or  letters  sent
    to the Secretary of State after the  application  was  made  cannot  be
    taken into account.

 8. The Judge then says at  paragraph 8  "the  Appellant  has  demonstrated
    that he was sufficiently identified for the monies that banked be (sic)
    as it were credited to his account with the Respondent. The  Respondent
    could have come to the conclusion that the monies were available to the
    Appellant. I find that were that not the  case  the  Respondent  should
    have enquired of the Appellant when the matter could be clarified as it
    has been to the Tribunal."

 9. That paragraph is sadly lacking in clarity.  If the  Judge  was  saying
    that the Secretary of State should have considered the post-application
    evidence and allowed the application he was wrong.  If  he  was  saying
    that the Secretary of State should have made further enquiries  of  the
    Appellant he was right for reasons which follow.

10. At paragraph 9 the Judge allowed the appeal.

11.  Given  that  the  Appellant  could  not  succeed  outright  under  the
    Immigration Rules because of s.85A the  appeal  could  only  have  been
    allowed on the limited basis that the Secretary of State's decision was
    unlawful and required her to make a lawful decision.  In  allowing  the
    appeal outright the Judge made an error of law.

12. That error of law was accepted by both representatives before me and so
    I set the determination aside. I then proceeded to  rehear  the  appeal
    with the agreement of both representatives. I was provided by Mr  Syed-
    Ali with a copy of the Secretary of State's Policy Guidance in force at
    the relevant date for this application. Although the version that I was
    provided with is dated October  2013,  Mr  Nath  assured  me  that  the
    relevant part of the Policy was unchanged.

13. Paragraph 202 of that Policy Guidance reads as follows:-

         "The following documents can be used to  show  money  available  to
    you:

          i.  Personal  bank  or  building  society  statements  covering  a
          consecutive 28 day   period ending no more than 31 days before the
          date of your application. Your personal bank or  building  society
          statements must show:

             . your name or your parent (F)/legal guardians name; and

             . the account number; and

             . the date of the statement; and

             . the financial institutions name and logo; and

             . the amount of money available.

         Ad hoc  bank  statements  printed  on  the  bank's  letterhead  are
         acceptable as evidence (this excludes  mini  statements  from  cash
         points).

         If you wish to submit electronic bank statements these must contain
         all of the details listed above. In  addition,  you  will  need  to
         provide a supporting letter from your bank on company headed paper,
         confirming the authenticity of the statements provided.

         Alternatively an electronic bank  statement  bearing  the  official
         stamp of the bank in question will  be  accepted.  This  type  must
         appear on every page of this statement."

14. I have not included  the  remainder  of  paragraph  202  which  is  not
    relevant for the purposes of this appeal. The crucial part of paragraph
    202 is the final part recited above. Electronic bank statements are not
    required to have the same characteristics as personal  bank  statements
    detailed as  an  alternative.  In  this  case  the  Appellant  produced
    electronic bank statements which did bear the  official  stamp  of  the
    bank in question and  the  stamp  did  appear  on  every  page  of  the
    statement. The statement  also  clearly  included  the  sort  code  and
    account number on each page. Accordingly, it was accepted  by  Mr  Nath
    that in terms of the Policy Guidance the Appellant  had  complied  with
    the requirements  the  Rules  to  show  that  he  met  the  maintenance
    requirement and had the Secretary of State taken into account  her  own
    Policy Guidance as she should have done, then she would have found  the
    Appellant met the maintenance requirements.

15. Therefore it is apparent that the Secretary of State's decision was  an
    unlawful decision and it is appropriate therefore for to  me  to  allow
    the appeal to the limited extent that it is remitted to  the  Secretary
    of State for a lawful decision to be made.  It  is  apparent  from  the
    evidence and the Policy Guidance that  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to
    succeed under the Rules. However that is a decision for  the  Secretary
    of State to make.

16. The First-tier Tribunal having made an error of law for the  reasons  I
    have indicated above the determination is set-aside and so  the  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  In remaking the decision the  result
    of the Appellant's original appeal against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision is allowed to the limited extent  detailed  in  the  preceding
    paragraph.
