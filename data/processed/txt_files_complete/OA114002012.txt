Representation:

For the Appellant: Miss Khan instructed by Parker Rhodes Hickmotts
Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Spence - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. Following a hearing at Bradford on 21st August 2013 I set aside the
        determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Upson  promulgated  on
        30th January 2013 for the reasons set  out  in  the  error  of  law
        finding and directions document of the same date.


     2. Having considered the evidence  and  representations  made  by  the
        advocates I announced in court that I allow the appeal.  I now give
        my reasons.


     3. In addition to the evidence that was before the Upper  Tribunal  at
        the error of law stage, the appellant has now  provided  an  expert
        report written by Ticky Monekosso dated 16th October 2013 which  is
        admitted is pursuant to  Rule  15  (2A)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
        procedure rules.


     4. The appellant is a national of the Democratic Republic of Congo who
        claimed to have been born on 25th February 1995. His mother arrived
        in the United Kingdom on 28th June 2007 and claimed asylum. She was
        granted refugee status on 1st July 2008.  In February 2012 she made
        an application for  family  reunion  of  her  three  children,  the
        appellant and his two siblings.  All three applicants  relied  upon
        birth certificates issued in 2011 and passports issued in 2010. The
        appellant's passport was issued on 20th August 2010, his long birth
        certificate on 5th July 2011 and a short birth certificate  on  6th
        May 2011.  His brother AY, born 30th March 2007,  was  issued  with
        his passport on 19th August 2010  and  his  long  and  short  birth
        certificates on the same date as the appellant. The third child  PA
        was born on the 11th September 1999.  Her passport  was  issued  on
        13th May 2010 and her long and short birth certificates  issued  on
        the same day as her siblings.


     5. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) granted the applications of  both
        AY and PA raising no issue with  regard  to  the  validity  of  the
        documents they relied upon, but refused the appellant's  mainly  by
        reference to his appearance in photographs he  submitted.  The  ECO
        was not satisfied that the appellant could meet the requirements of
        352D(ii), as it was not accepted that he was under the age of 18.


     6. Miss Khan submitted it is notable  that  the  application  was  not
        refused under the mandatory paragraph 320 (3) which provides :


     "(3) failure by the person seeking  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  to
   produce to the immigration officer a valid  national  passport  or  other
   documents satisfactorily establishing his identity and nationality "


                And nor was the  application  refused  under  paragraph  320
   (10).


     7. The appellant's date of birth shown in the documents he relied upon
        in support of his application show him to have been under  the  age
        of 18 at the date of application.


     8. I find the fact the ECO did not rely upon the mandatory grounds  of
        refusal, or other grounds available, is a matter for the  ECO.  Not
        relying on such grounds does not in itself mean that  the  concerns
        raised can be ignored.


     9. Assessing an individual's age solely from photographic evidence  is
        a very difficult exercise without specific expertise. There  is  no
        indication that the ECO has such skills. Indeed in  B,  R  (on  the
        application of) v London Borough of Merton [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin)
        (14 July 2003), paragraph 37, the  High  Court  specifically  found
        that except in clear cases a decision maker  cannot  determine  age
        solely on the basis of the appearance of an applicant.


    10. The refusal of entry clearance, in effect,  put  the  appellant  to
        proof of the reliability of the documents he submitted as proof  of
        his age. He now also relies upon the expert report  which  confirms
        that the documents are genuine.  There  was  no  challenge  to  the
        status of Mr Monekosso and having considered the weight of evidence
        Mr Spence accepted he was in some difficulty opposing the appeal.


    11. Having reviewed all the evidence made available to me, and in light
        of the unchallenged statement by the expert  that  the  appellant's
        passport and birth certificates recording his date of birth as 25th
        February 1995 are genuine, I find he has discharged the  burden  of
        proof upon him to the required standard to show that at the date of
        application he was able to satisfy  the  requirement  of  paragraph
        352D (ii) in that he was, at that time, under the age of 18.


    12. I allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules. Although it is  not
        necessary to consider Article 8 ECHR this is a ground of appeal and
        in light of my finding  under  the  Rules  I  find  it  will  be  a
        disproportionate interference with the right  to  family  life  not
        only of the appellant but also his siblings and  mother  should  he
        not be permitted to join them in the United Kingdom.


Decision

    13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I have set
        aside the decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision as
        follows. This appeal is allowed.


   Anonymity.


    14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


          I make that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
   (Upper              Tribunal) Rules 2008) to protect the identity of the
   minor children.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
