               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Brazil, date of birth  25  November  1985,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 26 February 2014,  to
    revoke a residence card.  Her appeal against that decision came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge D S Borsada, who on 7 May 2014 dismissed  her
    appeal both under the 2006 Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and  with
    reference to Article 8 of the ECHR.

2.    Notice  of   hearing   was   sent   to   the   Appellant's   nominated
    representatives identified in her grounds of  application,  namely  DMA
    Legal Services at their given address in 8 Scrubs Lane, London NW10, by
    letter dated 22 August 2014 in which First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Zucker
    had granted permission to appeal.

3.   At 3.45pm on 4 September there was no appearance by the  Appellant,  no
    explanation for absence and no request for a postponement in advance of
    the hearing nor a request for an adjournment.

4.   Subsequent to the start of the hearing a fax was delivered coming  from
    Triaco Solicitors which  identified  that  they  were  acting  for  the
    Appellant and that they wished to withdraw the appeal.

5.    Having  checked  the  position   with   DMA,   the   nominated   legal
    representatives, today the court usher was informed that they  were  no
    longer acting for the Appellant and believed they had written a  letter
    shortly after receipt of  the  Tribunal's  letter  of  22  August  2014
    indicating that their instructions had been withdrawn.

6.    I  am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had   indeed   nominated   new
    representatives, had received the notice of the hearing for 4 September
    2014. Therefore her absence was simply a matter  of  choice  and  as  a
    result of giving the instructions that she had.

7.   In these circumstances, with leave, the appeal is withdrawn.



Signed                                  Date 9 September 2014


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey
