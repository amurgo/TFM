                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    In this decision the Appellant is referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.    The Claimant, a national of the Ukraine, date  of  birth  7  September
    1944, appealed against the Secretary  of  State's  decision,  dated  22
    October 2014, to refuse the application, dated 21  May  2014,  to  vary
    leave to remain and to make removal directions under Section 47 of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The matter  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Abebrese, who in a decision promulgated on  1
    June 2015  dismissed  the  Claimant's  appeal  with  reference  to  the
    Immigration Rules but  allowed  the  appeal  and  remitted  it  to  the
    Secretary of State for  a  new  decision  on  Article  8  ECHR  issues.
    Permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett on
    24 September 2015.

3.    Irrespective of the basis of the judge's decision or  the  grounds  of
    appeal it is common ground between the parties that  the  Secretary  of
    State have taken into account the fact that the Claimant was previously
    granted discretionary leave from 25 May 2011 to 24 May 2014 i.e.  prior
    to the new  immigration  rules  w.e.f.  9  July  2012.  The  Claimant's
    application  should  have  been  considered  under   the   Transitional
    Arrangements in the Discretionary Leave  Policy;  an  extant  published
    policy (section10) in 2014. As a result the Secretary of State did  not
    give the appropriate consideration to the  application  or  reasons  to
    reject it, on the basis of criminality or otherwise, which was an error
    of law.

4.    I note the Secretary of State granted discretionary  leave  to  remain
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds in 2011. It was arguable but for the  errors,
    that Article 8 considerations could have  been  relevant  to  the  2014
    application. Also it is clear that as  a  fact  the  Claimant  has  now
    accrued ten years of lawful residence in the United Kingdom.  It  seems
    inevitable that the outcome of a proper consideration,  whichever  path
    is chosen to be followed, means that the Claimant will not be removed.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The Secretary of State's  appeal  is  dismissed.   The  Original  Tribunal's
decision stands and the application is returned to the  Secretary  of  State
to await a fresh decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
