For the Appellant:     Mr Brown, Parkview Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Iraq born in 1991. On the 9th July 2019
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Malik) allowed, on human rights grounds,
    his appeal against a decision to deport him. The Secretary of State now
    has permission to appeal against that decision.

 2. The key finding  reached  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  the
    Respondent's deportation would have an unduly harsh impact upon four of
    his five British children/stepchildren. The Secretary of State disputes
    that finding on the grounds that it was not one open to the Tribunal on
    the evidence before it.

 3. The Secretary of State's grounds make reference to the decisions of the
    Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  PG
    (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213 and BL (Jamaica) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 357. Although  the  former  was
    not available at the date that  Judge  Malik  made  her  decision  both
    judgments are relied upon for their emphasis on the high  threshold  to
    be crossed when making a finding that deportation of a foreign criminal
    is  'unduly  harsh',  the  Court  underlining  that  the  'commonplace'
    distress that will be caused to children if a parent is removed is  not
    sufficient.   See to similar effect the decisions in Secretary of State
    for the Home Department v AJ (Zimbabwe) and VH  (Vietnam) [2016]  EWCA
    Civ  1012,  NA  (Pakistan)  v  Secretary  of   State   for   the   Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662, and indeed the decision of the Supreme
    Court in KO (Nigeria)(FC) [2018] UKSC 53.

 4. What none of these decisions do is render the  second  'exception'  set
    out at section 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002  meaningless.  They  are  not  to   be   read   as   imposing   an
    unrealistically high burden on appellants.  It can be inferred from the
    fact that the exception exists that parliament recognises that for some
    children separation from a parent will have such profound  consequences
    that deportation will not be a proportionate response. Decision  makers
    applying the statutory scheme must be mindful that the threshold  is  a
    high one, but be cautious not to elevate it to the even more  stringent
    test applied in the  case  of  family  members  of  criminals  who  are
    sentenced to four years' or more in prison:

         "On the other hand the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  seems  clearly
         intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of "reasonableness"
         under section 117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the
         deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word "unduly" implies
         an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a "due" level of
         "harshness", that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable
         in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies  something  going  beyond
         that level. The relevant context is that set  by  section  117C(1),
         that  is  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of   foreign
         criminals. One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond
         what would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
         deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my  view  (and
         subject to the discussion of the cases in the next  section)  is  a
         balancing of relative levels of severity of the  parent's  offence,
         other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn  by  the  section
         itself by reference to length of sentence.  Nor  (contrary  to  the
         view of the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2017] 1 WLR 240, paras 55 and 64) can  it
         be equated with a requirement to show  "very  compelling  reasons".
         That would be in effect to replicate the additional test applied by
         section 117C(6) with respect to sentences of four years or more."

         [per Lord Carnwath in KO]

 5. In the present case the First-tier Tribunal was tasked  with  examining
    the position of five children.

 6. The first, AL, is a little girl brain damaged at birth  who  now  lives
    with her maternal grandparents. She is cared for by them full time  and
    the Respondent  visits  her  every  two  weeks.  Judge  Malik  was  not
    satisfied that AL would suffer unduly harsh consequences if her  father
    were deported and there is no challenge to that finding.

 7. The remaining four children are the Respondent's daughter  R  (born  in
    2013), his son M (2018) their half-brothers  D  (2004)  and  K  (2005).
    These four are all the children of the Respondent's current partner NG.
    All  four  live  with  the  Respondent  and  NG.  The  salient  -   and
    unchallenged - findings about this family unit are:

          i) One year-old M was  born  prematurely  and  has  significantly
             impaired vision. The Respondent plays a day to day role in his
             care, for instance taking him swimming;

         ii) Five year-old R is under the care  of  paediatricians  and  is
             said  to   have   'challenging   behaviour'.   R's   Assistant
             Headteacher provided written evidence to the effect  that  the
             Respondent plays a significant role in her care, bringing  her
             to and from school and  attending  child  protection/child  in
             need meetings. The letter speaks of a "dramatic improvement in
             R's emotional well-being and behaviour" since  the  Respondent
             returned to the family home.

        iii)  Fourteen  year-old  D  has  a  diagnosis  of   ADHD,   Social
             Communication Disorder and Autism. He  stays  at  his  special
             school twice per week but otherwise lives at home.   He has  a
             close relationship with the Respondent. D's  Headteacher  gave
             written evidence that he had fully engaged with his  education
             since the Respondent was released  from  prison,  and  that  D
             derives "a great deal of consistency  and  security  from  his
             presence in the household". This in turn has a positive effect
             on D's  self-esteem  and  confidence,  enabling  him  to  make
             academic progress. The Head  believed  that  the  Respondent's
             removal would be "significantly damaging" to D,  and  that  if
             the deportation were to proceed D would  "undoubtedly  regress
             and it is highly probable that we would see a  return  of  the
             wholly inappropriate behaviours" that led D  to  being  placed
             with the school initially.

         iv) Thirteen year-old K has no medical conditions of note, but his
             behaviour has been classed as giving 'cause for concern'  with
             the  relevant  professionals  noting  a  decline  whilst   the
             Respondent was in prison. A letter from K's school  speaks  of
             an improvement in his "attitude, punctuality and focus"  since
             the Respondent's release,  attributed  by  the  writer  to  "a
             direct result of the extremely positive  influence  that  [the
             Respondent] has over K". The school considered that  it  would
             be "extremely  detrimental"  if  the  Respondent  were  to  be
             removed from K's life.  K himself wrote to the Tribunal saying
             that he wanted to "hurt himself" whilst  his  [step]  Dad  was
             away.

          v) NG has a diagnosis of depression. Concerns have been raised by
             those caring for her regarding  her  vulnerability,  depressed
             mood and intrusive suicidal thoughts. A Health Visitor who has
             worked with the family attributes NGs conditions  and  anxiety
             to abuse that she suffered  from  a  previous  partner.  Judge
             Malik notes that NG has in the past been hospitalised  because
             of her mental health needs.

         vi)  The  Respondent  and  NG  enjoy  a   close   and   supportive
             relationship. In the months that the Respondent was in  prison
             during 2018 NG found it physically and  emotionally  difficult
             to cope. She received help  from  her  mother,  her  aunt  and
             social services but her health took  a  turn  for  the  worse.
             Social services describe the Respondent as a  "hands  on  Dad"
             who takes a leading role in caring for the  children,  all  of
             whom face particular challenges as outlined above.

 8. It was against this background that the First-tier Tribunal found  that
    this is not an ordinary family. Neither the difficulties these children
    face, nor  their  consequent  dependence  upon  their  father,  can  be
    described as "commonplace".   All of the evidence before the Tribunal -
    from family members, from the GP, paediatricians, the  health  visitor,
    social workers and teachers - all pointed the same  way.  It  would  be
    strongly contrary to the best interests of these children - and  unduly
    harsh - should the Respondent be removed from the family home.

 9. The grounds of appeal plead  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    failing to consider whether the children could be taken into  care,  or
    that social services might otherwise fill the gap that would be left by
    the Respondent.   In light  of  the  decision  in  KO  (Nigeria)  -  in
    particular the passage from Lord Carnwath's judgment that  I  have  set
    out above - that is a startling submission to make. If children need to
    find themselves in care before the threshold can even  be  contemplated
    it is difficult to see what traumas would need to befall a child  of  a
    parent convicted of in excess of four years before an appeal could ever
    be allowed.   This submission,  not  pursued  with  any  vigour  by  Mr
    McVeety, entirely fails to engage with  the  ratio  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's judgment: that it is the nature of his relationship with his
    children that is regarded as important by the professionals  concerned,
    and their collective opinion that these children will  suffer  profound
    consequences should that relationship face  interference.    This  also
    dispenses with the other submission in the grounds, that  the  Tribunal
    failed to consider whether the needs of the children could  be  met  by
    professional support or other family members, such as  the  grandmother
    and aunt who helped NG out when the Respondent was in  prison.  I  note
    that in fact the Tribunal had express regard to  that  possibility  [at
    its �44-45] but for the reasons I have summarised, found that it  would
    not prevent the consequences  for  these  four  children  being  unduly
    harsh.  It was their emotional dependence upon their father, heightened
    by particular medical and social needs, that counted.

    Anonymity Order

10. The Respondent is a criminal and as such would not ordinarily be  given
    the protection of an order for anonymity. As I have set  out,  however,
    his case turns on the presence in the United  Kingdom  of  his  British
    children. Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of  2013:
    Anonymity  Orders  I  am  concerned  that  the  identification  of  the
    Respondent could lead to identification of the  children.  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Decisions

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and it is upheld.

12. There is an order for anonymity.
