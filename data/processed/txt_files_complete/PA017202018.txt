                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  I.
    M.  Scott  ('the  Judge'),  issued  on  28  June  2019,  by  which  the
    appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent  to  refuse  to
    grant him international protection was dismissed.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford intended  to  grant  permission  on  one
    narrow ground, as explained in  her  reasons  which  I  address  below.
    However, permission was stated as 'granted' in the Tribunal's  standard
    document and there were no words of limitation  upon  such  grant.  The
    appellant therefore enjoys permission to appeal on all issues: Safi and
    others (permission to appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 00388 (IAC); [2019]
    Imm. A.R. 437.

Anonymity

 3. The Judge issued an anonymity direction. The parties  did  not  request
    that the order be set-aside and I confirm the direction accordingly:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no  report
         of these proceedings or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This  direction
         applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the  respondent.  Any
         failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt
         of court proceedings. I do so in order to  avoid  a  likelihood  of
         serious harm arising to the appellant  from  the  contents  of  the
         protection claim being publicly known.'

Background

 4. The appellant is a national of  India  who  hails  from  the  State  of
    Harayana, which is located in the north of the  country  and  surrounds
    the capital, New Delhi. He worked as an engineer before  travelling  to
    this country.

 5. He met his ex-wife in February 2006 and the relationship  commenced  in
    July 2006. After her family found  out  about  the  relationship,  they
    began to threaten him. Her father is a police officer and the appellant
    began to receive threatening telephone calls from the police station at
    which he worked. The  appellant  was  required  to  attend  the  police
    station and was beaten by several police officers,  including  his  ex-
    wife's father. The couple were kept separated and  unable  to  talk  to
    each other for some weeks, but they then managed to  make  arrangements
    to meet again. His ex-wife commenced a nursing course and was  able  to
    live away from home and so they were able  to  rent  a  room  and  live
    together. In 2007 the appellant was disowned by  his  family  who  were
    against the relationship because  they  belong  to  the  Hindu  Brahmin
    caste, whilst his ex-wife is Sikh. His ex-wife became pregnant and  her
    family sought to persuade her that she undergo an abortion. She refused
    to do so, stating that she would kill herself if forced  to  abort  her
    child. Having confirmed her position,  her  family  insisted  that  the
    couple marry and then leave the country  immediately,  for  reasons  of
    honour, as the baby would be born within nine months of  the  marriage.
    The couple were married in April 2010.  Unfortunately,  the  child  was
    lost before birth.

 6. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 23  January  2012  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  His ex-wife had arrived a month earlier  but
    did not meet him at the airport. The appellant found out that  she  was
    having an affair and soon after his  arrival  he  moved  out  of  their
    accommodation. The appellant attempted suicide in July 2012 by  cutting
    his neck and wrists. He had previously suffered mental health  problems
    whilst in India. After his suicide attempt, he  returned  to  India  in
    July 2012 but had no contact with his family. His relationship with his
    ex-wife come to an end. With the support of her family she demanded 1.5
    million rupees. He was able to pay half of this sum  but  continued  to
    receive threats in relation to the remaining balance. He  received  the
    last threat in 2013. He cannot pay the outstanding  sum.  He  travelled
    back to this country on 4 December 2012.

 7. In the meantime, the appellant's second wife entered  this  country  in
    April 2011 as a Tier 4 student.  They  met  in  January  2013  and  the
    relationship began soon afterwards. They conducted a religious marriage
    in March 2013 and have lived together since this time. The couple  have
    a child who is now four years old. He has a speech and language problem
    for which he is receiving therapy. At the date of  the  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal the appellant's wife was expecting their second
    child.

 8. The family of the appellant's second wife are angry about the  marriage
    because he has  not  divorced  from  his  ex-wife  and  they  are  from
    different castes, Sikh Minhas. Members of  her  family  approached  the
    appellant's brother in India, and he was required to establish that the
    appellant's family had disowned him. They have reported to a friend  of
    the appellant that they will kill him if he returns to India. They live
    in the Punjab, some 200 miles from the appellant's family home.

 9. The appellant sought asylum on 18 June 2016 and  was  interviewed.  The
    respondent refused the asylum application by way of a decision dated 20
    January 2018.

Hearing before the FtT

10. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Taylor  House  on  7  March
    2019. The Judge found both the appellant and his wife to be credible as
    to their evidence. As to the application for international  protection,
    the Judge determined that the appellant was unable to establish that he
    is a member of a particular social group, at [53] and [54]:

         'It was not suggested that any of those persons whom the  appellant
         fears who wish to do him harm would  be  motivated  to  do  so  for
         reasons of race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.

         As regards  the  remaining  Convention  reasons,  membership  of  a
         particular social group, the appellant belongs to the Brahmin caste
         and has twice married Sikh women from lower castes. While that  has
         not been well-received by his own family or by the families of  his
         wives, there is no evidence  that  persons  in  his  situation  are
         perceived or treated differently  by  society  and/or  the  law  in
         India. That being so, I conclude that the appellant is not a member
         of a particular  social  group  for  the  purpose  of  the  Refugee
         Convention.'

11. In refusing the appeal on humanitarian protection  grounds,  the  Judge
    accepted that the appellant had established  that  substantial  grounds
    existed as to his facing a real risk of suffering serious  harm  if  he
    were to be returned to his home area in India, finding at [57]:

         'Threats of harm have been made against him and there have been two
         instances of physical assault on him, once when he  was  beaten  by
         his ex-wife's father and other police officers in  a  local  police
         station, and once when he was attacked in a market in October  2012
         by his ex-wife's uncle and four other men. Although those incidents
         happened some years ago, it is reasonably likely that the animosity
         which gave rise to them still endures,  connected  as  it  is  with
         matters of family honour.'

12. The Judge proceeded to find that 'the appellant could  safely  relocate
    to another part of India, which is a vast  and  populous  country,  and
    that it would be reasonable to expect him to do so', reasoning at [59]:

         'In relation to finding a safe place  in  which  to  relocate,  the
         background country information indicates that there is in general a
         sufficiency of protection  in  India,  in  terms  of  a  system  of
         criminal law which the authorities are able and willing to  operate
         and from which the appellant would not be excluded. Although his ex-
         wife's father is in the police and  it  was  he  and  other  police
         officers who first beat the appellant, the  background  information
         shows that each state and union territory in  India  has  its  own,
         separate, police force. The evidence and  the  conclusions  of  the
         Upper Tribunal in MD  (same-sex  oriented  males:  risk)  India  CG
         [2014] UKUT 00065 (IAC) also indicate  that  there  would  be  very
         little chance of the appellant being located elsewhere in India  by
         any of those who might wish to do him  harm.  Although  it  appears
         that his return to India in July 2012 was detected by his ex-wife's
         uncle, there are many other international airports in India and the
         evidence (as already noted) is that there would be little chance of
         his arrival elsewhere being discovered. The absence  of  a  central
         registration system was noted by the Upper Tribunal in MD  (India).
         For the same reason, the need to obtain  a  registration  card  for
         access to public services, etc. is very unlikely  to  lead  to  the
         appellant's return being noticed.'

13. The Judge further determined that the  appellant  could  access  mental
    health care in India and even if he were to  require  more  specialised
    psychiatric services in the future, it not having been established that
    he requires such services at this time, it was open to him to seek them
    by relocating to a major city or  travelling  there  from  wherever  he
    might be residing, such areas being situated away from his home area.

Ground of appeal

14. Unfortunately, the grounds of appeal  are  not  numbered,  and  it  has
    proven difficult on occasion to identify when one ground has  concluded
    and the next commences. JFtT Ford summarised the grounds as:

         'It is argued that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant
         would not be at real risk of being traced by family members  and/or
         his present in-laws through a central registration system in  India
         and in  finding  that  he  and  his  wife  had  a  viable  internal
         relocation option. It is not arguable that the  Tribunal  erred  in
         its understanding of country  guidance  (see  section  (e)  of  the
         headnote and paragraph 156 in  the  country  guidance  case  of  MD
         (India) CG [2014] UKUT 65 (IAC). The point made in  that  case  was
         that there was insufficient evidence to show that individuals  were
         traceable through a central registration system. The appellant  did
         not  produce  additional  evidence   to   persuade   the   Tribunal
         otherwise.'

15. Having considered the grounds of appeal, JFtT Ford reasoned:

         'The grounds are not arguable  with  one  exception.  The  Tribunal
         apparently accepted that the appellant had an uncle  in  India  who
         worked for Immigration and who traced him when he last returned  in
         2012 (see paragraph 28). The appellant was found  credible  in  his
         account. The only arguable material error of law is the absence  of
         any assessment of the risk of his uncle similarly tracing him again
         on his return to India.'

16. No rule 24 response was filed by the respondent.

Decision on error of law

17. The appellant's primary criticism is that the Judge considered  himself
    bound by the conclusion of the Upper Tribunal in MD (India), at [154]:

         'There is very limited evidence before us of families  successfully
         using the police in an attempt to track down those  family  members
         who have fled, with a view to  those  persons  being  'repatriated'
         back to the family. In any event, India is a country of 1.2 billion
         people and we have not been drawn to any evidence that there  is  a
         central registration system in place which would enable the  police
         to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in  their  own  state,  let
         alone in any of the other states or unions within the  country.  We
         consider the possibility of the police,  or  any  other  person  or
         body, being able to  locate,  at  the  behest  of  an  individual's
         family, a person who has fled to another state or union  in  India,
         to be remote.'

18. It is asserted by the appellant that this conclusion formed no part  of
    the relevant country guidance and the Upper  Tribunal's  attention  was
    not drawn to evidence of a central registration system  'which  persons
    including the police could use to trace the whereabouts of others.'

19. The paragraph of the country guidance decision considered by the  Judge
    is the Upper Tribunal's conclusion as  to  the  risk  to  persons  from
    family members, or non-state  agents,  upon  return  to  India.  Whilst
    undertaken in the context of an  assessment  of  LGBTQ+  failed  asylum
    seekers returning to India, the objective evidence assessed  enjoyed  a
    wide nature and so the conclusion could reasonably be  relied  upon  by
    the Judge in the context of this appeal.

20. As confirmed by Mr. Bedford at the hearing before me, the  true  thrust
    of this complaint,  and  another  related  one  identified  within  the
    grounds as to  a  risk  arising  from  the  requirement  to  possess  a
    registration card, is the existence of the Aadhaar ID system  in  India
    and  the  purported  possibility  of  a  public  official   to   access
    information held under the system for persecutory reasons by  using  it
    to track someone down, wherever they live in India. The grounds seek to
    rely upon the following finding of the Judge, at [59],  that  there  is
    'the need to obtain a registration card for access to public services.'
    The Aadhaar system, described as  a  'registration  system',  has  been
    promoted by the Indian central government.  It  is  a  12-digit  unique
    identity number that may be obtained voluntarily by residents of India,
    based on their biometric and demographic data. The data is collected by
    the Unique Identification  Authority  of  India  (UIDAI),  a  statutory
    authority  established  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of
    Electronics and Information Technology.

21. It is a concern that  this  issue  was  raised  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and relied upon in the grounds of appeal  to  this  Tribunal,
    without any clear reference  to  the  lawfulness  of  the  system,  and
    attendant  data  security  concerns,  having  been  considered   by   a
    Constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India. A Constitution  bench
    consists of at least five judges of the Court that sit  to  decide  any
    case 'involving a substantial question of law' as to the interpretation
    of the Constitution  of  India  or  for  the  purpose  of  hearing  any
    reference made by the President of  India  under  article  143  of  the
    Constitution. Several orders  and  judgments  concerned  with  specific
    issues falling for consideration within the claim may be given  by  the
    Court and in this matter an order of 25 March 2014 (a bar upon  sharing
    information to third parties without consent of registered  person),  a
    judgment of 24 August 2017 (privacy) and a  judgment  of  26  September
    2018 (legality of the Aadhaar system) are relevant when considering the
    issue raised by the appellant. Legal representatives are to be  mindful
    that sufficient care is to be undertaken to ensure  that  all  relevant
    evidence is provided to a Tribunal when a  novel,  or  core,  issue  is
    raised and relied upon.

22. A Constitutional bench considered several interrelated aspects  of  the
    Aadhaar system in Puttaswamy v. Union of  India,  No.  494  of  2012  &
    connected matters from 2012 to 2018. I understood at the  hearing  that
    Mr. Bedford was unaware of this lengthy civil claim and so gave him the
    options of having further time to consider this matter over the  course
    of the morning or making an adjournment  request.  He  asked  that  the
    Tribunal provide him with a summary of the Court's decision and  having
    been provided with an outline confirmed that he was willing to proceed.



23. The nature of the Aadhaar system under consideration was summarised  in
    simple terms in Puttaswamy (judgment of 26 September 2018), at [44}:

         'In this whole process, any resident seeking to obtain  an  Aadhaar
         number  is,  in  the  first  instance,  required  to   submit   her
         demographic information and biometric information at  the  time  of
         enrolment. She, thus, parts with her  photograph,  fingerprint  and
         iris scan at that stage by giving the same to the enrolling agency,
         which may be a private body/person. Likewise, every time when  such
         Aadhaar holder intends to receive a subsidy, benefit or service and
         goes to specified/designated agency or person for that purpose, she
         would be  giving  her  biometric  information  to  that  requesting
         entity, which, in turn, shall get the same authenticated  from  the
         Authority before providing a subsidy, benefit or service.  Whenever
         request is received for authentication by the Authority, record  of
         such a request is kept and stored in the CIDR  [Central  Identities
         Data Repository]. At the same time, provisions  for  protection  of
         such information/data have been made, as indicated  above.  Aadhaar
         number can also be used for purposes other than stated in  the  Act
         i.e. purposes other than provided under Section 7 of  the  Act,  as
         mentioned in Section 57 of the Act, which permit the State  or  any
         body corporate or person, pursuant to any law, for the  time  being
         in force, or any contract to this effect, to use the Aadhaar number
         for establishing the identity of an individual. It can be used as a
         proof of identity, like other identity proofs  such  as  PAN  card,
         ration card, driving licence, passport etc.'

24. It is appropriate to observe the position of the UIDAI as presented  to
    the Supreme Court in Puttaswamy, at [46]:

         'They  argue  that  in  the  first  instance,   minimal   biometric
         information of the applicant, who intends to have  Aadhaar  number,
         is obtained which is  also  stored  in  CIDR  for  the  purpose  of
         authentication. Secondly, no other information  is  stored.  It  is
         emphasised that there is no data collection in respect of religion,
         caste, tribe, language records of entitlement,  income  or  medical
         history of the applicant at the time of Aadhaar enrolment. Thirdly,
         the Authority also claimed that the entire Aadhaar  enrolment  eco-
         system  is  foolproof  inasmuch  as  within  few  seconds  of   the
         biometrics having been collected by the enrolling agency, the  said
         information gets transmitted the Authorities/CIDR, that too  in  an
         encrypted form, and goes out of the reach of the enrolling  agency.
         Same is the situation at the time of  authentication  as  biometric
         information does not remain with the requesting  agency.  Fourthly,
         while undertaking the authentication process, the Authority  simply
         matches the biometrics and no  other  information  is  received  or
         stored in respect of purpose, location  or  nature  or  transaction
         etc. Therefore, the question of profiling does not arise at all.'

25. A five-judge panel of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court  ('th
    Court') upheld the  validity  of  the  Aadhaar  system  in  Puttaswamy,
    finding that it is difficult for the authorities or  others  to  launch
    surveillance upon  citizens  through  the  system.  The  Court  further
    confirmed that no person would be denied benefits under social  welfare
    schemes consequent to not participating in the system. The Court  ruled
    that Section 57 of Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of  Financial  and  Other
    Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act  2016  ('the  Aadhaar  Act')  was
    unconstitutional, meaning that private  entities  cannot  compel  their
    customers to provide their Aadhaar number as a condition of service  to
    verify their  identity,  specifically  citing  requiring  it  for  bank
    accounts, school admissions, and mobile phone service  as  examples  of
    unlawful use cases. The mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts
    did not satisfy the  test  of  proportionality  and  so  was  unlawful.
    However, the Aadhaar number must still be quoted  to  file  income  tax
    returns and apply for a personal account number: see judgment  of  A.K.
    Sikri, J, on behalf of the majority, including the  Chief  Justice,  at
    [447].

26. The Judge's finding that there is 'the need to  obtain  a  registration
    card for access to public services', relied upon by the appellant,  was
    based upon a mistaken understanding of the facts caused by the  failure
    of the appellant's representatives to  place  details  of  the  Court's
    judgment before him.

27. The majority held at [447] that the architecture of Aadhaar as well  as
    the provisions of the Aadhaar  Act  have  not  created  a  surveillance
    state, and this is ensured by the manner in which the project operates:

         'During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in  the  form
         of iris and fingerprints  is  collected.  The  authority  does  not
         collect purpose, location or details of transaction.  Thus,  it  is
         purpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains  in
         silos. Merging of silos is prohibited.  The  requesting  agency  is
         provided answer only in 'Yes' or 'No' about the  authentication  of
         the person concerned. The authentication process is not exposed  to
         the internet world. Security measures, as  per  the  provisions  of
         section 29(3) read with section 38(g) [of the Aadhaar Act] as  well
         as regulation  17(1)(d)  of  the  Authentication  Regulations,  are
         strictly followed and adhered to.' [447(1)(b)(i)]

         ...

         'After going through the Aadhaar structure, as demonstrated by  the
         respondents in the powerpoint presentation from the  provisions  of
         the Aadhaar Actr and the machinery which the authority has  created
         for data protection, we are of the view that it is  very  difficult
         to create profile of a person simply on the basis of biometric  and
         demographic information stored in CIDR. Insofar  as  authentication
         is concerned, the respondents rightly pointed out  that  there  are
         sufficient  safeguard   mechanisms.   To   recapitulate,   it   was
         specifically submitted that  there  was  security  technologies  in
         place  ...,  24/7  security  monitoring,  data   leak   prevention,
         vulnerability management programme and independent  audits  ...  as
         well as the authority's defence mechanism ... [447(1)(c)]

28. The majority further held:

         'Section 29 [of the Aadhaar Act] in fact imposes a  restriction  on
         sharing information and is, therefore, valid  as  it  protects  the
         interests of the Aadhaar number holders. However,  apprehension  of
         the petitioners is that this provision entitles Government to share
         the information 'for  the  purposes  of  as  may  be  specified  by
         regulations.' The  Aadhaar  (Sharing  of  Information)  Regulations
         2016, as of now, do not contain any such provision. If a  provision
         is made in the regulations which impinges on the privacy rights  of
         the  Aadhaar  card  holders  that  can   always   be   challenged.'
         [447(4)(d)]

         'Section 33(1) of the  Act  prohibits  disclosure  of  information,
         including identity information or  authentication  records,  except
         when it is by an order of  a  court  not  inferior  to  that  of  a
         District Judge. We have held that the provision is to be read  down
         with the clarification that an  individual,  whose  information  is
         sought to be released, shall be afforded an opportunity of  hearing
         ...' [447(4)(f)]

29. It is appropriate to further observe that in  its  order  of  25  March
    2014,  issued  in  the  Puttaswamy  constitutional  case,   the   Court
    restrained the CIDR and the  UIDAI  from  sharing  the  vast  biometric
    database of Aadhaar with any third party or agency without the  consent
    of the registered person.

30. Consequent to this order, a nine-judge panel of the Court  handed  down
    its August 2017 judgment where it ruled unanimously that privacy  is  a
    constitutionally protected right in India and though  not  an  absolute
    right an  interference  must  meet  the  threefold  requirement  of  i)
    legality;  (ii)  the   need   for   a   legitimate   aim;   and   (iii)
    proportionality. It confirmed that as information privacy is a facet of
    the right to privacy, the Government was required to  put  in  place  a
    robust regime for data protection.  By  means  of  its  September  2018
    judgment, the Court was satisfied that there were  sufficient  security
    measures taken to protect data.

31. Mr. Bedford was reduced  at  the  hearing  to  countering  the  careful
    considerations of the  Supreme  Court  with  the  appellant's  personal
    belief that there is such corruption in India that his ex-wife's police
    officer father and immigration officer uncle could secure access to the
    information held by competent authorities concerned  with  the  Aadhaar
    system. Mr. Bedford observed that whilst it may  be  the  law  that  no
    information could be provided to the police outside of a request  to  a
    judge or for national security reasons (de jure), the Tribunal  was  to
    accept that such information can be unlawfully secured (de  facto).  An
    example of such ability can  be  established  by  the  ex-wife's  uncle
    becoming aware that the  appellant  had  travelled  through  New  Delhi
    airport. As to this event, the uncle worked at the same airport  as  an
    immigration officer and the appellant was not able  to  confirm  as  to
    whether such knowledge came to him orally, through a legitimate  search
    of computer systems or an unlawful search.

32. The Judge specifically addresses this issue simply,  and  cogently,  at
    [59] by deciding that there are many other  international  airports  in
    India to which the appellant could return and the evidence presented to
    the Tribunal established that there  would  be  little  chance  of  his
    arrival other than in New Delhi being discovered.

33. In the circumstances, the judgment of the Court in Puttaswamy  confirms
    the approach adopted by the Tribunal in MD (India), at  [154]  and  the
    Judge did not err when relying upon the latter. It was  reasonably  and
    lawfully open to the Judge to conclude to the appropriate standard that
    an immigration officer situated  at  New  Delhi  airport  or  a  police
    officer situated in Haryana would  not  have  access  to  the  relevant
    Aadhaar system databases so as to be able  to  track  a  person  living
    elsewhere in India. This ground of appeal fails.

34. The appellant further challenges in general terms the approach taken to
    the burden of proof, at [5] and [6] of the grounds:

         'Further, or alternatively, where evidence of serious ill-treatment
         in the past is accepted by the tribunal and the appellant has shown
         prima facie substantial ground for believing he would be exposed to
         a real risk of serious harm if returned, then in accordance with JK
         v. Sweden, 59166/12 (2017) 64 EHRR 15 the burden  switches  to  the
         respondent to dispel the doubt  with  respect  to  the  risk  of  a
         recurrence of past persecution. It follows in these  premises  that
         the respondent has the burden to dispel the doubt as to whether the
         appellant may be traceable via a registration system  of  which  he
         complains and/or such system by which he was traced in the past.

         'The Court of Appeal in SSHD v. PF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA  Civ  1139
         at  paragraph  16(iv)  confirms  the  Strasbourg  Grand   Chamber's
         guidance with regard to the switching of the burden of proof.'

35. The First-tier Tribunal's record of proceedings makes no  reference  to
    this point having been advanced of the appellant. Further, the skeleton
    argument filed on behalf of the appellant with the First-tier  Tribunal
    was authored by another counsel some months before the hearing and  the
    'JK' point was not identified within it. The  point  is  not  expressly
    addressed in the Judge's decision. Mr. Bedford informed me that he  had
    raised the issue before the First-tier Tribunal and, though aware as to
    the lack of corroborative evidence as to this assertion, I was  content
    to hear Mr. Bedford on this point.

36. When initially addressing this point  of  law,  I  had  understood  Mr.
    Bedford to be  relying  on  article  4.5  of  Directive  2004/83  ('the
    Qualification Directive'), as considered by the Court in  JK  v  Sweden
    and it was this provision that was initially discussed at the  hearing.
    Consequent to Mr. Bedford being referred to the  Tribunal  decision  in
    HKK (Article 3: burden/standard of proof) Afghanistan [2018] UKUT 00386
    (IAC); [2019] Imm. A.R. 373, he informed me that he  was  relying  upon
    article 4.4 of the Directive and not article 4.5.

37. Article 4.5 details:

         'Where Member States apply the principle according to which  it  is
         the duty of the  applicant  to  substantiate  the  application  for
         international protection  and  where  aspects  of  the  applicant's
         statements are not supported  by  documentary  or  other  evidence,
         those aspects  shall  not  need  confirmation  when  the  following
         conditions are met:

         (a)      the applicant has made a genuine  effort  to  substantiate
             his application;

         (b)      all relevant elements at  the  applicant's  disposal  have
             been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation has been  given
             regarding any lack of other relevant elements;

         (c)      the applicant's statements are found to  be  coherent  and
             plausible and do not run counter  to  available  specific  and
             general information relevant to the applicant's case;

         (d)      the applicant has applied for international protection  at
             the  earliest  possible  time,  unless   the   applicant   can
             demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and

         (e)       the  general  credibility  of  the  applicant  has   been
             established.'

38. Article 4.5 therefore provides that, where certain specified conditions
    are met, aspects of the statements of an  applicant  for  international
    protection that are not supported by documentary or other evidence will
    not need confirmation

39. Article 4.4 establishes:

         'The fact that an applicant has already been subject to persecution
         or serious harm or to direct threats of such  persecution  or  such
         harm, is a serious indication of the applicant's well-founded  fear
         of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, unless there
         are good reasons to consider that such persecution or serious  harm
         will not be repeated.'

40. Article 4.4 is therefore an  alleviating  evidentiary  rule  where  the
    applicant's previous  experiences  can  reduce  the  need  for  a  more
    extensive investigation and establishment of future risks. Article  4.5
    is  a  general  alleviating  evidentiary  rule  in  cases   where   the
    facultative rule of proof in article 4.1 is applied. In an  appeal,  an
    appellant's general credibility surfaces only  in  art.  4.5.e  of  the
    Directive, within the framework of a  general  alleviating  evidentiary
    rule.

41. Read as a whole, article  4  comprises  three  distinct  stages  of  an
    evidentiary procedure: i) a first stage where information is submitted;
    (ii) a second stage where the relevancy of information is assessed; and
    (iii) a third and final stage where the application is assessed, and  a
    decision taken on the basis  of  this  assessment.  Article  4.4  is  a
    procedural regulation falling within the  third  and  final  stage  and
    along with paragraphs 3 and 5 contain norms  regarding  what  shall  be
    included in the decision makers' assessment, the presumption effects of
    any earlier persecution, and a qualified alleviating evidentiary rule.

42. Article 4.4 has been transposed domestically by paragraph 339K  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The Tribunal has confirmed that if a finding of past
    persecution has been made paragraph 339K requires a particular approach
    to adopted as to assessing the risk of repetition: KB & AH (credibility-
    structured approach) Pakistan [2017] UKUT 00491 (IAC). The  alleviating
    evidentiary nature of the rule establishes a reduction in the need  for
    more  extensive  investigation  as  to  future  risk  by  means  of   a
    presumption. Such approach is supported by the assessment of the  Upper
    Tribunal in HKK, where it observed the Strasbourg Court judgments in in
    RC  v  Sweden  (application  41827/07)  unreported  and  FG  v   Sweden
    (application 43611/11) 41 B.H.R.C. 595 confirmed that that JK v  Sweden
    introduced no new approach to the issue  of  the  burden  of  proof  in
    article 3 cases. The requirement of a government to dispel doubts where
    an applicant adduced  evidence  capable  of  proving  that  there  were
    substantial grounds for believing expulsion would  violate  article  3,
    had been a feature of  the  Strasbourg  Court  jurisprudence  for  some
    considerable time.

43. The appellant relies upon the recent Court of  Appeal  judgment  in  PF
    (Nigeria) as confirming the  Strasbourg  Court's  guidance  as  to  the
    switching of the burden of proof, at [16 (iv)]:

         'There is a switching burden of proof (see AM (Zimbabwe)  at  [16],
         and MM (Malawi) at [9(iv)]). As Sales LJ put it  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)
         or:

             "It is common ground that where a foreign  national  seeks  to
             rely upon article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a  state  to
             remove him to another country, the overall legal burden is  on
             him to show that article 3 would be infringed in his  case  by
             showing that that there are substantial grounds for  believing
             that he would face a real risk of being subject to torture  or
             to inhuman or degrading treatment in that other country:  see,
             e.g., Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11  EHRR  439  at  [91],
             which is reflected in the formulations in Paposhvili at  [173]
             and [183].... In Paposhvili ,  at  [186]-[187]...,  the  Grand
             Chamber of the ECtHR has given guidance  how  he  may  achieve
             that, by raising a prima facie case of infringement of article
             3 which then casts an evidential  burden  onto  the  defending
             state which is seeking to expel him.'

44. In Paposhvili v. Belgium (application no 41738/10) [2017] Imm. A.R. 867
    the Grand Chamber held at [186] - [187}

         'In the context of these procedures, it is for  the  applicants  to
         adduce evidence capable of demonstrating that there are substantial
         grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be
         implemented, they  would  be  exposed  to  a  real  risk  of  being
         subjected to treatment contrary to  Article  3  (see  Saadi,  cited
         above, � 129, and F.G. v. Sweden, cited  above,  �  120).  In  this
         connection  it  should  be  observed  that  a  certain  degree   of
         speculation is inherent in the preventive purpose of Article 3  and
         that it is not a matter  of  requiring  the  persons  concerned  to
         provide clear proof of their claim that they would  be  exposed  to
         proscribed treatment (see, in particular, Trabelsi v. Belgium,  no.
         140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).

         'Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the authorities  of  the
         returning State, in the context of domestic procedures,  to  dispel
         any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G. v.
         Sweden, cited above, � 120). The risk alleged must be subjected  to
         close scrutiny (see Saadi, cited above, � 128; Sufi and Elmi v. the
         United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, �  214,  28  June  2011;
         Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, �  116;  and  Tarakhel,  cited
         above, � 104) in  the  course  of  which  the  authorities  in  the
         returning State  must  consider  the  foreseeable  consequences  of
         removal for the individual concerned in the receiving State, in the
         light of the general situation there and the individual's  personal
         circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, �  108;  El-
         Masri, cited above, � 213; and Tarakhel, cited above, �  105).  The
         assessment of the risk as defined  above  (see  paragraphs  183-84)
         must therefore take into  consideration  general  sources  such  as
         reports of the World  Health  Organisation  or  of  reputable  non-
         governmental organisations and the medical certificates  concerning
         the person in question.

45. The recent decisions do not aid the appellant.  They  simply  reconfirm
    the previous Strasbourg approach, as identified by the Tribunal in  HKK
    and so re-state the long-standing position. They do not amend the legal
    position as to which party  is  required  to  satisfy  the  burden  and
    standard of proof. The Judge's decision  as  to  the  burden  of  proof
    cannot be said to be unlawful.

46. In any event, for the reasons  detailed  above,  the  appellant  cannot
    establish on  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable for him to internally relocate in India  in  circumstances
    where his fears relate  to  non-state  agents  of  persecution,  namely
    family members of his ex-wife, or certain rogue agents  of  persecution
    who cannot through their professional employment track him  outside  of
    the State  of  Haryana  or  in  New  Delhi  by  means  of  his  Aadhaar
    registration.
