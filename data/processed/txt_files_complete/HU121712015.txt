For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr H Dieu instructed by Magrath LLP

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the United States of America who was born
    on 26 April 1991.  He is married to a British citizen, Stefani Lindblom
    who was born on 22 September 1976.

 3. On 14 August 2015, the appellant  made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain based upon his private  and  family  life  in  the  UK.   On  12
    November 2015, the Secretary of State refused his application under the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) and under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 4. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  decision
    promulgated on 19  October  2016,  Judge  Richards-Clarke  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 outside the Rules.

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal.  On 6  March  2017,
    the First-tier Tribunal (Acting R J Appleyard) granted the Secretary of
    State permission to appeal.

 6. The appellant filed a rule 24 response seeking to  uphold  the  judge's
    decision.

The Decision

 7. Before the judge, the appellant relied upon his relationship  with  his
    British citizen wife and the fact that his close family, including  his
    mother and father and younger brother lived in the UK  on  a  permanent
    basis.

 8. In  her  decision,  Judge  Richards-Clarke  first  concluded  that  the
    appellant could not succeed under the 'partner' rule in Appendix FM  as
    he could not meet the requirement in para EX.1. of Appendix FM as there
    were not "insurmountable obstacles" to their family life continuing  in
    the  USA  despite  the  difficulties  and  obstacles  they  would  face
    including in their careers (see para 23).

 9. Having reached that finding, the judge then went on to consider whether
    the appellant's claim should succeed outside the Rules under Art 8.  At
    para 27, the judge  found  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
    appellant and his wife and between the appellant and his  close  family
    in the UK in the following terms:

         "I must firstly satisfy myself that on a balance of  probabilities,
         whether the Appellant has established a private and/or family  life
         in the United Kingdom.  I find that she has because on the evidence
         before me:

         (a)   The  Appellant  have  been  a  relationship  with   Stephanie
             Lindblom, a British Citizen,  for  around  8  years  and  they
             married in June 2015.

         (b)  The relationship between the Appellant and Stephanie  Lindblom
             is genuine and subsisting and they live together.

         (c)  The Appellant's father, mother and brother  all  live  in  the
             United Kingdom and  have  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to
             remain.  The Appellant  has  a  close  relationship  with  his
             family, particularly his younger brother."

10. Then at paras 28-30, the judge considered whether any interference with
    that private and family life would be proportionate.  She concluded  it
    would not be proportionate.  Her reasons were as follows:

         "28.     The decisions are in accordance with the law as they  seek
             to maintain immigration  control.   The  consequences  are  of
             sufficient gravity to engage Article 8 and the question for me
             to consider is  one  of  proportionality.   I  find  that  the
             interference  with   family   life   is   not   necessary   or
             proportionate.  I say so because on the evidence before  me  I
             find that given the circumstances that I have  set  out  above
             this to be a case that falls  for  consideration  outside  the
             rules.  In addition to my finding above about his family  life
             with his wife and his parents and brother:

             (a)  The Appellant is now 25 years old, he  was  born  in  the
                  United Kingdom, spent the first 2 years of his  life  here
                  and has again lived in the United Kingdom  as  a  teenager
                  and a young adult form the age of 16.

             (b)  The Appellant's immediate family all live in  the  United
                  Kingdom and have no intention to return to USA.

             (c)  The Appellant does not have family in the USA that  would
                  be able to  provide  him  with  the  support  that  he  is
                  provided with in the United Kingdom.

             (d)  Where the Appellant is in the United Kingdom he  and  his
                  wife are now able to meet the  financial  requirements  if
                  the Immigration Rules.  If the Appellant were to return to
                  the USA these would not be met by  his  wife  and  so  the
                  Appellant's removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  would  be
                  permanent.

         29.  I have taken account of the  Appellant's  immigration  history
             and the maintenance of effective immigration  control  in  the
             public interest by the Respondent as is set out in s 117A-117D
             Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act 2002.  I find that on the
             evidence before me the Appellant is able to speak English,  is
             integrated into his local community and is not  a  burden  the
             taxpayer and that his  relationship  with  his  wife  was  not
             formed when his leave in the United Kingdom was precarious  or
             unlawful.

         30.  I have found that Article 8 is engaged and  I  find  that  the
             Respondent has not discharged the  burden  to  show  that  any
             interference with an Appellant's rights  under  Article  8  is
             justified, necessary  and  proportionate.   Having  taken  all
             these factors into  account  and  carried  out  the  balancing
             exercise and bearing in mind the exceptional circumstances  of
             this case, I reach the conclusion that it would be justifiable
             and proportionate to allow this appeal under Article 8."

The Grounds

11. The Secretary of State's challenge is set out in para 3(a)-(f)  of  the
    Grounds as follows:

         "The SSHD asserts that these findings are wholly wrong in  law  for
         the following reasons:

         a.   There is no finding at all as to why one element  of  the  A's
             support from his family - the financial  assistance  from  his
             father {�8(b) &  �10(d)}  -  could  not  continue  in  the  US
             (predicated upon the basis that  the  A  still  required  such
             support of course);

         b.    The  Judge  provides  no  further  detail  as  to  why   this
             constituted a compelling feature where the A is an  adult  and
             does not live with his parents in the UK  -  especially  where
             the Judge does not appear to find family life  between  the  A
             and those family members [see {�27(c)}];

         c.   The Judge's understanding of precariousness  is  flawed  as  a
             matter of law.  The Judge gives no reason at all  for  finding
             that the A's  immigration  history  was  anything  other  than
             precarious.  The SSHD quotes the  relevant  history  as  taken
             from the RFRL:

                  'It is noted that you entered the  UK  on  a  Work  Permit
                  Dependant Visa valid from 10 September 2007  to  1  August
                  2012.  On 1 August you were granted T2 SW  Dependant  Visa
                  valid until 15 August 2015.  On 14 August 2015 you applied
                  for further leave to remain  on  the  family/private  life
                  route.'

         d.   It must be plain from the extract above that the A was  always
             dependent upon others for his original leave to remain and had
             no expectation (legitimate or  otherwise)  that  he  could  be
             settled  in the UK - the absence of any consideration of  this
             issue is manifestly unlawful to the application of s. 117B;

         e.   The Judge also clearly erred in respect of the weight given to
             the A's ability to 'meet the Rules' at the date of the hearing
             {�28(d)} - this is manifestly wrong in fact and  law.   As  is
             plain  from  the  rules  the  A  was  required  to  have   the
             appropriate maintenance at the date of  the  application  [see
             for instance FM-SE  (2)(a)(i)]  -  to  find  otherwise  is  to
             completely  miss  the  underlying  point  of  the  maintenance
             elements of FM-SE read with Appendix FM  and  means  that  the
             Judge has plainly not identified a compelling feature  outside
             of the Rules;

         f.   Additionally the Judge's speculation about the  likelihood  of
             an entry clearance application being successful  (or  not)  at
             {�28(d)} was also materially  inconsistent  with  the  binding
             decision of the Court in SB (Bangladesh) v Secretary of  State
             for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 28 at {�36}."

12. In his oral submissions, Mr Richards who represented the  Secretary  of
    State accepted that the grounds as drafted  were  largely  misconceived
    and that he was in some difficulty in establishing an error of law.

13. First, Mr Richards accepted that, contrary to  what  was  contended  in
    ground 3(b), at para 27(c) of the judge's decision she had not  treated
    the relationship between the appellant and his parents in the UK  as  a
    "compelling feature".  Rather, he accepted that in para 27(c) the judge
    was making a factual finding  that  family  life  existed  between  the
    appellant and his close family in the UK.  Mr Richards submitted  that,
    nevertheless, given that the appellant is 25 years of age and  did  not
    live with his parents the weight to be attached  to  that  family  life
    should be commensurately reduced.

14. Secondly, Mr Richards did not seek to rely upon the  judge's  reference
    to the appellant's family life as having been formed whilst  his  leave
    in the  UK  was  "precarious".   He  accepted  that  s.117B(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "NIA Act 2002")  only
    applied to family life which had been established whilst an  individual
    was "unlawfully" in the UK.  He placed no reliance on ground 3(c).

15. Thirdly, he placed no reliance upon ground 3(d).  He was unable to  put
    forward a positive case  that  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  no
    expectation that he could settle in the UK was, as the ground  claimed,
    "manifestly unlawful to the application of s.117B".

16. Fourthly, as regards ground 3(e), Mr Richards  accepted  that  in  para
    28(d) the judge had not stated (erroneously) that the appellant met the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  He acknowledged that the  judge
    had merely stated  that  the  appellant  was  "now  able  to  meet  the
    financial requirements" of the Rules.

17. Fifthly, as regards ground 3 (f), Mr Richards did  not  seek  to  argue
    that in para 28(d) the judge was not  entitled  to  take  into  account
    that, if the appellant returned to the USA to seek entry clearance,  he
    would not be able to meet the requirements of the Rules although, as Mr
    Richards pointed out, the judge's use of the word  "permanent"  was  an
    "odd choice of words".

18. Mr Richards did, however, place reliance upon ground 3(a) of the ground
    and the contention that the judge had made no finding as to whether the
    appellant's father would continue to provide  financial  assistance  to
    him if he lived in the USA.

Discussion

19. The Secretary of State's grounds are carefully tailored in  para  3(a)-
    (f).  It is not contended that the  judge's  decision  was  irrational.
    The bulk of the grounds are no longer relied upon by the  Secretary  of
    State before me.  Taking each of the grounds in turn:

    (1)  3(a): As Mr Dieu, who represented the appellant,  pointed  out  in
         his submissions the appellant's father had given evidence, set  out
         at para 10(d) of the judge's decision, that he  would  continue  to
         provide financial support to the appellant.  The judge accepted the
         evidence from the appellant and his witnesses at the  hearing.   It
         is clear, therefore, that  although  the  judge  made  no  specific
         reference to that aspect of the evidence, it must have been well in
         her mind when she reached her findings, in particular in para 28 of
         her decision.

    (2)  3(b): It is clear that the judge's reference to  the  relationship
         between himself and his parents in the UK  in  para  27(c)  of  the
         decision is not a statement  of  a  "compelling"  circumstance  but
         rather a finding that the closeness of the relationship amounts  to
         family life.  That is a finding which  is  not  challenged  in  the
         grounds.   The  effect  of  the  appellant's   removal   upon   his
         relationship with his parents was an aspect of  the  positive  case
         put forward by him and nothing in the decision leads me to conclude
         that the judge placed undue weight upon  those  relationships  when
         considering the impact as a whole on the appellant,  his  wife  and
         his family.

    (3)  3(c): Mr Richards  again  placed  no  reliance  upon  the  judge's
         reference to the appellant's relationship with his wife having  not
         been formed whilst his leave in the UK was "precarious".  I  accept
         that submission in relation to the terms of s.117B(4)  of  the  NIA
         Act 2002 which only applies to such a  relationship  formed  whilst
         the individual is "unlawfully" in the UK.  However, the  precarious
         nature of his leave - meaning here that his leave was  temporary  -
         did however mean that "exceptional circumstances" were required  to
         outweigh the public interest  based  upon  that  relationship  (see
         Jeunesse v The Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR 17  and  R  (Agyarko  and
         another) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11  at  [49]-[53]).   Nevertheless,  in
         allowing the appeal, the judge (in  paras  25  and  30)  sought  to
         identify  "exceptional  circumstances"  to  outweigh   the   public
         interest.  That clearly in  substance  was  commensurate  with  the
         requirement to establish "compelling" circumstances (see Agyarko at
         [54]-[60]).

    (4)  3(d):  Mr  Richards  acknowledged  this  ground  had  no  coherent
         substance with its reference to s.117B.  To the extent  the  ground
         relies upon the appellant having no expectation of remaining in the
         UK, there is no suggestion in the judge's reasoning  that  she  was
         other than well  aware  that  the  appellant's  current  leave  was
         temporary.

    (5)  3(e): Mr Richards acknowledged that  the  judge  had  not  wrongly
         found that the appellant met the requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules on the basis of evidence, not at the time of application  but
         at the time of hearing.   There  is  no  doubt  that  in  assessing
         whether the appellant's removal would be disproportionate under Art
         8.2 outside the Rules it was relevant to look  at  the  appellant's
         financial situation including that the  funds  currently  available
         equated to the level of funding required  under  the  Rules  for  a
         couple.  Providing that the judge did not, as  indeed  Mr  Richards
         acknowledged she did not, wrongly equate this with succeeding under
         the Rules  a  broader  assessment  of  financial  support  than  is
         permitted   under   the   Rules   was   relevant   in   determining
         proportionality (see, e.g., R (MM  (Lebanon)  and  others)  v  SSHD
         [2017] UKSC 10 at [93]-[101] dealing with "alternative  sources  of
         funding").

    (6)  3(f): Mr  Richards  also  placed  no  reliance  upon  this  ground
         recognising that the judge was entitled to take into  account  what
         affect the removal would have  upon  the  appellant  and  his  wife
         including the length of any separation to which the likely  success
         on entry clearance application was relevant.

20. As  I  have  already  indicated,  the  grounds  do  not  challenge  the
    rationality of the judge's decision.  It may well  be  that  not  every
    judge,  in  carrying  out  the  balancing  exercise   in   respect   of
    proportionality, would have reached the same positive  finding  as  did
    Judge Richards-Clarke.  Even if an  irrationality  challenge  had  been
    made, and it was not, although generous this was not a  decision  which
    was out with the range of decisions  which  a  reasonable  judge  could
    reach on the evidence.

21. For those reasons, the judge  did  not  err  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 outside the Rules.

Decision

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under Art 8 did not involve the  making  of  an  error  of  law.   That
    decision, therefore, stands.

23. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.
