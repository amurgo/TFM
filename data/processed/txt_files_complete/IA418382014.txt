Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against a decision of Judge Carroll  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 14th May 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Pakistan born 25th October 1969 who
    on 25th October 2010 was granted a visa  entitling  her  to  visit  the
    United Kingdom until 25th October 2020.

 4. On 16th October 2014 the Claimant was refused leave to enter the United
    Kingdom following an  interview,  and  was  served  with  a  Notice  of
    Immigration Decision refusing her leave to enter pursuant to  paragraph
    321A of the Immigration Rules, on the basis that there had been such  a
    change of circumstances since her initial leave was granted,  that  the
    leave should be cancelled.

 5. The Secretary of State contended that  the  Claimant's  visa  had  been
    issued on the basis of a six  week  visit  to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    accompany her children who  study  here.   However  since  her  initial
    arrival in the United Kingdom on 15th February 2011, the  Claimant  had
    spent ten months in the UK in 2011, ten months in the UK in 2012,  nine
    months in the UK in 2013, and to date had spent a further six months in
    the UK in 2014.  This meant that in the past three years and ten months
    the Appellant had only spent ten months in total  in  Pakistan,  and  a
    total of 35 months in the UK.  It was also noted that the Claimant  had
    been refused two Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visas, the latest refusal  being
    on 13th October 2014.  It was contended that this demonstrated that the
    Claimant intended to reside in the UK on a  long-term  basis,  and  the
    Secretary of State cancelled her continuing leave, which had the effect
    of cancelling her entry clearance.

 6. The appeal was heard by the FTT on 29th April  2015  and  allowed  with
    reference to the Immigration Rules.  The conclusions  of  the  FTT  are
    contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 which are reproduced below;

         "9.  The Appellant's husband remains in Pakistan  where  he  has  a
             business.  The evidence  does  not  support  the  Respondent's
             assertion that the immigration history of the Appellant  shows
             her intention to reside in the United Kingdom on  a  long-term
             basis.

         10.  In light of all of the evidence, I am not satisfied as to  the
             basis of the refusal by reference  to  paragraph  321A  of  HC
             395."

 7. The Secretary of State applied for and was granted permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that the  FTT  had  failed  to  give
    reasons or any adequate reasons for findings on a material matter.   It
    was noted that the FTT had concluded that the evidence did not  support
    the  assertion  that  the  Claimant's  immigration  history  showed  an
    intention to reside in the UK on a long-term basis, but  the  Secretary
    of State submitted that on the face of it, two applications  for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant did suggest  an  intention
    to reside in the United Kingdom on a long-term basis.

Error of Law

 8. The error of law hearing took place on 13th October 2015.  Full details
    of the application and submissions made are  set  out  in  my  decision
    promulgated on 20th October 2015 and I set out below my conclusions and
    reasons for setting aside the decision of the FTT;

         "17. In my view the judge erred  in  the  first  paragraph  of  the
             decision by finding  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
             Claimant.   It  is  generally  correct  to   state   that   in
             immigration appeals the burden of proof is  on  an  Appellant,
             but in a case such as  this,  where  the  Secretary  of  State
             relies upon paragraph 321A, the burden  of  proof  is  on  the
             Secretary of State to prove there has been such  a  change  of
             circumstances since the leave was given,  that  it  should  be
             cancelled.  This however is not a material error, as the judge
             allowed the Claimant's appeal.

         18.  The issue before me relates to adequacy of reasons.  I set out
             below for ease  of  reference  the  head  note  to  Budhathoki
             (reasons for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) which  provides
             guidance on adequacy of reasoning;

                  'It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for  First-tier
                  Tribunal judgments  to  rehearse  every  detail  or  issue
                  raised in the case.   This  leads  to  judgments  becoming
                  overly long  and  confused  and  is  not  a  proportionate
                  approach to deciding cases.  It is, however, necessary for
                  judges to  identify  and  resolve  key  conflicts  in  the
                  evidence and  explain  in  clear  and  brief  terms  their
                  reasons, so that the parties can understand why they  have
                  won or lost.'

         19.  I conclude that the judge has not engaged  with  the  evidence
             provided by the Secretary of State, which is set  out  in  the
             Explanatory  Statement  and  the  attached  appendices.   This
             evidence included interviews both with the  Claimant  and  her
             husband, and an acceptance by the Claimant of  the  length  of
             time that she had spent in the United Kingdom,  and  that  she
             had made two applications for Tier 1 visas, which prima  facie
             indicated a wish to remain in the United Kingdom long-term.

         20.  The judge sets out the Claimant's case  in  paragraph  8,  and
             makes conclusions and findings in paragraphs 9  and  10  which
             are set out above.

         21.  The judge concludes that the evidence  does  not  support  the
             Secretary of State's assertion that the Claimant's immigration
             history shows her intention to reside in the United Kingdom on
             a long-term basis, but does  not  give  adequate  reasons  for
             reaching that conclusion.  The losing party, in this case  the
             Secretary of State, reading paragraphs 9  and  10,  would  not
             understand why the evidence presented has not  been  analysed,
             and reasons given for accepting or rejecting  it.   The  judge
             observes in paragraph 8 that there is no reason in law why the
             Claimant should  not  have  made  applications  as  a  Tier  1
             (Entrepreneur) but in my view this misses the  point  made  by
             the Secretary of State, which is that there has been a  change
             of circumstances  since  entry  clearance  as  a  visitor  was
             initially granted.  That is the issue that  should  have  been
             analysed, considered, and findings made thereon."

 9. The decision of the FTT was set aside and the hearing adjourned so that
    the decision could be re-made by  the  Upper  Tribunal,  after  hearing
    further evidence from the Claimant.



Re-making the Decision

Preliminary Issues

10. The resumed hearing took place on 11th  December  2015.   The  Claimant
    attended the hearing.  It was confirmed that there was no need  for  an
    interpreter.

11. I ascertained that I had  all  documentation  upon  which  the  parties
    intended to rely, and that each party had served  the  other  with  any
    documentation upon which reliance was to be placed.  I had received the
    Claimant's bundle comprising 60 pages, and  the  Secretary  of  State's
    bundle with appendices A - I.  I had also received Mostafa [2015]  UKUT
    00112 (IAC) from Mr Ahmed.

12. Mr Ahmed clarified that the Claimant's case was that this appeal should
    succeed under the Immigration Rules, on the basis that the Secretary of
    State could not discharge the burden of proof in relation to  paragraph
    321A.  If that was not the case, reliance was placed upon Article 8  of
    the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).  No
    reliance was placed  upon  Appendix  FM  or  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

Oral Evidence

14. The Claimant gave evidence adopting her witness  statement  dated  22nd
    April 2015 the contents of which may be summarised as follows.

15. The Claimant is married to Tahir Javed and she and her husband have two
    children, a daughter born in September 1999 who is 16 years of  age  at
    the date of hearing, and a son born in October 2001 who is 14 years  of
    age at the date of hearing.

16. The children have been studying in the UK as Tier  4  (Child  Students)
    since 2011.  Both attend boarding school.

17. The Claimant applied for and was granted a multiple visit  visa.   This
    was valid between  25th  October  2010  and  25th  October  2020.   The
    Claimant accepts that since that visa was  issued  she  has  spent  the
    majority of her time in the UK rather than in Pakistan.

18. On 16th October 2014 she was seeking leave to enter the UK when she was
    refused  leave  to  enter  following  an  interview,  and   her   leave
    subsequently cancelled.

19. The Claimant  applied  in  July  2013  and  July  2014  for  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) visa because she intended to invest in a  hotel  in  the
    UK.  The second application was refused on  the  grounds  of  deception
    which means that if the decision stands, she will not be able to  enter
    the United Kingdom for a ten  year  period.   She  has  applied  for  a
    judicial review of that decision.

20. The Claimant has been visiting the UK since 2003.  Since  her  multiple
    visa was issued in October 2010 she has not stayed in the UK in  excess
    of six months in any visit.

21. The Claimant and her husband pay a substantial amount of money to  fund
    the education of their children.  They also own a property in  the  UK.
    In Pakistan the Claimant and her husband have a medical college and the
    Claimant is responsible for running a hostel for the students.

22. In answering questions put by Mr Ahmed the Claimant estimated that  the
    cost of educating each of her children in the United Kingdom is between
    �45,000 and �50,000 per year.

23. The Claimant's husband has a visa to visit the UK, and has  visited  on
    five or six occasions since October 2014 when the Claimant was  refused
    leave to enter.

24. If the Claimant had to leave the UK and was not allowed to  visit,  she
    said that she would also take the children out of  school  and  educate
    them in Pakistan or in some other country.

25. The Claimant was cross-examined.  She stated that she and  her  husband
    bought their property in the UK in 2005 or 2006.   She  confirmed  that
    her frequent visits to the UK were because she did not  wish  to  leave
    her children.  That is why she spent most of her time in the UK.

26. When she initially applied for a visit visa she said that she  had  not
    intended to spend most of her time in the  UK.   When  asked  what  had
    changed, she said that the children were very attached to her.

27. The Claimant said that between 2011 and  2014  her  son,  who  had  not
    settled well, only spent one week a month as a boarder  and  spent  the
    rest of the time living with her at the family home in the UK.  The son
    now spent three weeks a month as a boarder at school.

28. When asked whether the  Claimant  applied  for  her  visa  in  2010  to
    accompany the children to the UK, it was intended that  her  son  spend
    his time at school as a boarder, the Claimant  said  that  it  was  but
    because he did not settle he remained at home with her.

29. The Claimant confirmed that she had applied for Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    visas because her children were in the UK.

30. The Claimant was asked about a comment she made in interview in  answer
    to question 26, when she said that if she was granted a Tier 1 visa she
    would start to wind up her business in Pakistan.  She  said  that  this
    was not the case and did not know why she said that.  She  stated  that
    she was suffering with anxiety in the interview, and is still suffering
    from anxiety and high blood pressure.

31. The Claimant confirmed that she had in her possession in October 2014 a
    list of dates that she had remained  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  she
    confirmed the list was accurate.

32. In answer to some questions that I put, the Claimant stated  that  both
    her children returned to Pakistan in school holidays but this does  not
    apply to half-term.  She explained that her daughter  boards  full-time
    but returns to her at the family home every weekend.

33. In answer to a further question put by Miss Fijiwala the  Claimant  was
    asked where her son would stay if she was not in the UK, and  she  said
    she was not sure, her brother lived here, but her son was not  used  to
    staying with anybody else.

34. In answer to a further question put by Mr Ahmed the Claimant said  that
    her son would stay with her brother if  she  was  successful  with  her
    appeal and she was in Pakistan.  She explained that when her son boards
    for a period of three weeks, she does not see him at weekends at  home.



The Secretary of State's Submissions

35. Miss Fijiwala relied upon the decision dated 16th October 2014 refusing
    the Claimant leave to enter the UK and the Explanatory Statement  dated
    28th March 2015.

36. I was asked to find that there had been a clear change of circumstances
    since the Claimant was initially granted  the  visit  visa  in  October
    2010, as that visa was granted on the basis of  a  six  week  visit  to
    accompany her children to the UK.

37. It was submitted that there had been a change of circumstances,  and  I
    was asked to note that the Claimant  accepted  in  oral  evidence  that
    between 2011 and 2014 her son had lived with her in the family home  in
    the UK during term-time.  I was asked to note the total amount of  time
    that the Claimant had spent in the UK, and while it was  accepted  that
    she had not overstayed, in that she had not remained in the UK for more
    than six months at any one time, it was clear  that  she  was  in  fact
    residing in the UK rather than visiting.

38. I was asked to take  into  account  that  the  Claimant  had  made  two
    applications for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and she had
    explained that she made these applications so she could stay in the  UK
    long-term to take care of her children.  I was also asked to note  that
    she had indicated in interview that she was  willing  to  wind  up  her
    business in Pakistan and have a manager run it.

39. In relation to the ten year ban on re-entry that had been referred  to,
    I was asked to note that that did not relate to this issue, but related
    to a finding of deception in  the  latest  application  for  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) visa.  I was asked to dismiss the appeal with  reference
    to the Immigration Rules

40. In relation to Article 8 it was accepted  that  family  life  had  been
    established and I was asked to take into account section 117B(1) of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, in that  the  maintenance
    of immigration controls is in the public interest.   It  was  submitted
    that in this case, by relying upon Article 8, the Claimant  was  trying
    to circumvent the Immigration Rules.  I was asked to dismiss the appeal
    with reference to Article 8 on the basis that the Secretary of  State's
    decision is in accordance with the law, necessary and proportionate.

The Claimant's Submissions

41. Mr Ahmed submitted that the burden of proof  of  proving  a  change  of
    circumstances  had  not  been  discharged  and  pointed  out  that  the
    Secretary of State had not provided the Tribunal with  the  application
    form submitted by the Claimant when she applied for her visa in October
    2010.

42. Mr Ahmed submitted that it was not  sufficient  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to contend in the refusal decision dated 16th October  2014  that
    the visa had been issued on the basis of a six week visit to the United
    Kingdom, to enable the Claimant to accompany her children.  I was asked
    to note that a multiple  visa  had  been  issued,  which  entitled  the
    Claimant to remain for periods of up  to  180  days  at  a  time.   The
    Claimant had not overstayed.

43. Mr Ahmed submitted that as there was no  evidence  that  the  visa  was
    initially issued for a six week visit, and there was no  evidence  that
    the Claimant had breached any of the conditions of the visa, there  was
    no change of circumstances.

44. The Claimant was entitled to make  applications  for  a  Tier  1  visa.
    These applications did not amount to a change  of  circumstances.   The
    Claimant's position was that she intended to remain in  the  UK  for  a
    substantial period only if she was granted a Tier  1  visa.   Mr  Ahmed
    confirmed that there was a judicial review application in  relation  to
    the refusal on the grounds of deception, as the Claimant did not accept
    that she had used deception in her application.

45. I was asked to note that the Claimant  was  spending  very  substantial
    sums of money in educating her children in the UK.  The  property  that
    had been purchased was purchased prior to  the  visa  being  issued  in
    October 2010 and so could not amount to a change of circumstances.

46. In the alternative, if I found that there was a change of circumstances
    I was asked to allow the appeal pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the  1950
    Convention outside the Immigration Rules.  I was  asked  to  take  into
    account that the ten year ban that would currently apply, would have  a
    huge impact upon the Claimant and her family.

47. I was referred to paragraphs 16 onwards of Mostafa.  The  Claimant  had
    confirmed that her children intended to be studying in  the  UK  for  a
    considerable period of time, as they intended to go to university.

48. I was asked to consider the best interests of the children, which would
    not be served by the Claimant being excluded  from  this  country.   In
    relation to section 117B of the 2002 Act, Mr Ahmed pointed out that the
    Claimant speaks English and is financially  independent.   I  was  also
    asked to note that her husband was still allowed to travel to  the  UK,
    and had done so on five or six occasions since the Claimant was refused
    entry in October 2014.

49. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

50. I have taken into account all the evidence, both oral and  documentary,
    placed before me, and the submissions made by both representatives.   I
    have considered the evidence in the round, and taken into  account  the
    circumstances as at the date of hearing.

51. The first issue that I have to decide relates to paragraph 321A(1)  and
    whether there has been such  a  change  in  the  circumstances  of  the
    Claimant's case since her leave was given, that it should be cancelled.

52. The issue therefore is whether there has been a change of circumstances
    since the Claimant's visa was issued in October 2010.   The  burden  of
    proof is on the Secretary of State on a balance of probabilities.

53. Because the Claimant's visa was issued in October 2010,  at  that  time
    the Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the  Claimant  satisfied  the
    requirements of paragraph 41(i) in  that  the  Claimant  was  genuinely
    seeking entry as a visitor for  a  limited  period  not  exceeding  six
    months, and (ii) intended to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the
    period of the visit.  I therefore have to decide whether the  Secretary
    of State has proved that the Claimant is no longer  a  genuine  visitor
    who intends to leave the UK at the conclusion of her visit.

54. It is common ground that the  Claimant's  children  have  been  granted
    visas enabling them to study at boarding school in the UK.  It is  also
    common ground that the Claimant's husband has a visa  enabling  him  to
    visit his children.

55. I accept the Claimant's circumstances in Pakistan, in that she and  her
    husband run a college and a hostel.  I  also  accept  that  substantial
    sums of money are being paid to educate the  children  in  the  UK.   I
    further accept that the Claimant and her husband own a property in  the
    UK in which she  is  currently  living,  and  that  this  property  was
    purchased prior to the Claimant being granted a visa in October 2010.

56. It is relevant to consider the purpose for which the  Claimant  applied
    for a visit visa in October 2010.  It is correct that the Secretary  of
    State has not produced the visa application.  However the Secretary  of
    State contended in the decision refusing  leave  to  enter  dated  16th
    October 2014, that the visa was issued on the basis of a six week visit
    to the United Kingdom to enable the Claimant to accompany her children.
     The Claimant did not dispute that in her evidence.  Mr Ahmed  did  not
    ask the Claimant why the visa had initially been issued.   When  cross-
    examined the Claimant confirmed that when she  was  granted  her  visit
    visa she did not intend to spend most of  her  time  in  the  UK.   She
    explained that there had been a change, and that she had spent most  of
    her time in the UK because her children were very attached to  her.   I
    set out below the dates during which the Appellant has remained in  the
    UK since her visa  was  issued.   These  dates  were  prepared  by  the
    Claimant and confirmed by her as accurate;

         '15/2/11 - 3/8/11

         11/8/11 - 11/12/11

         27/12/11 - 18/3/12

         22/3/12 - 26/7/12

57. The Claimant calculated that she had spent 153 weeks in the UK  between
    15th February 2011 and 6th July 2014, and in that period spent 22 weeks
    four days in Pakistan.

58. It is common ground that the Claimant did  make  two  applications  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and that she  in  fact  left
    the UK in July 2013 and again in July 2014 to make  those  applications
    in Pakistan.

59. The Appellant's husband confirmed when he was interviewed, (question 8)
    that in the last ten years the Claimant had spent most of the  time  in
    the UK because their children were studying.  In answer to question  17
    of his interview, the Claimant's husband stated that the  Claimant  was
    trying to legalise her long stay in the UK.  He went on to say that  if
    the Claimant did not obtain a Tier 1 visa she would return to Pakistan.

60. The Claimant in her interview in answer to question 30 stated that  her
    son had not settled which was why she was spending more of her time  in
    the UK.  In her oral evidence the Claimant  confirmed  that  she  spent
    most of her time in the UK because of her  children  and  that  between
    2011 and 2014 her son had only spent one week a month as a  boarder  in
    school, and had spent the rest of the time living with the Claimant  in
    the family home in the UK.  The Claimant confirmed  that  it  had  been
    intended that her son would board at school, but  because  he  did  not
    settle, he had to stay with her.

61. I was not referred by either representative  to  any  legal  authority,
    with the exception of Mr Ahmed referring me to Mostafa in  relation  to
    Article  8,  but  I  have  considered   Sawmynaden   (Family   visitor-
    considerations) [2012] UKUT 00161 (IAC).  This  case  is  not  directly
    relevant to paragraph 321A, but is relevant in that guidance  is  given
    as to the  considerations  that  should  be  taken  into  account  when
    deciding whether an individual is a genuine visitor.  That is  relevant
    in this case, as the Secretary of State's case is  that  the  visa  was
    issued to the Claimant on the basis that she was a genuine visitor, but
    her length of stay in the UK, and her applications for  Tier  1  visas,
    indicate that she is no longer a genuine visitor.

62. In brief summary the Upper Tribunal in Sawmynaden confirmed that  there
    is no restriction on the number of visits a person may make to  the  UK
    nor  any  requirement  that  a  specified  time  must  elapse   between
    successive visits.  The periods of time spent in the UK and the country
    of residence will always be important.   The  express  purpose  of  the
    visit and what an individual has done in the past and intends to do  in
    future is material, together with the length of time that  has  elapsed
    since previous visits.

63. The links that the individual  retains  with  the  initial  country  of
    residence is a material consideration and the presence of other  family
    members also a material consideration.  The  Tribunal  is  required  to
    ascertain what is the reality of the arrangement entered  into  between
    the visitor, and the host (in this case the children) in  the  UK.   Is
    the reality that the visitor is resident in the UK and  intends  to  be
    for the foreseeable future?

64. Guidance is given that the  issue  may  be  approached  by  considering
    whether the reality is that the visitor is now no more than  a  visitor
    in her country of residence, as the  purpose  of  the  return  home  is
    confined to using her presence there  solely  as  a  means  of  gaining
    readmission to the  UK,  although  this  does  not  preclude  her  from
    remaining in the country of residence for  the  least  amount  of  time
    sufficient to maintain her status as a genuine visitor.

65. There may be comparisons with a person who owns home in  two  different
    countries.  Is he resident in both or a visitor to one of them?

66. Considering the period of time spent in the UK it  is  clear  that  the
    Claimant accepts that she has spent far more time in  the  UK  than  in
    Pakistan.  It is also clear, using the Claimant's  own  Schedule,  that
    there have been a number of occasions when she  has  spent  substantial
    periods of time in the UK, and then returned to Pakistan for very short
    periods of time before returning again to the UK.

67. In my view, when the visa was granted, it was granted on the basis that
    the Claimant would be visiting the UK for a  period  of  six  weeks  to
    accompany her children.  The Claimant has not denied this.  It was  not
    envisaged, when the visa  was  granted,  that  the  Claimant  would  be
    spending 153 weeks in the UK, in a period  between  February  2011  and
    July 2014, and just over 22 weeks in that period in Pakistan.

68. I find that the Claimant has accepted that there has been a  change  of
    circumstances since the visa was granted.  It was  intended  that  both
    her children would board at school in the UK and return to Pakistan  in
    the holidays.  However her son did not settle, which meant that for the
    period between 2011 and 2014, as confirmed by the Claimant in her  oral
    evidence he only attended boarding school for approximately one week  a
    month, and spent the rest of the time living with the Claimant  at  the
    family home in the UK.

69. I conclude that on this basis, the Secretary of State has  proved  that
    there has been a change of  circumstances  since  the  visit  visa  was
    granted.  I find that the Appellant has been residing in the UK  rather
    than visiting, and therefore the Secretary of  State  was  entitled  to
    refuse her leave to enter and to  cancel  her  leave.   The  Claimant's
    appeal therefore must be dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

70. I now consider Article 8.  Mr Ahmed  confirmed  that  no  reliance  was
    placed upon Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules.
    I have considered the five stage approach advocated  in  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27, and I find that the Claimant has  clearly  established  family
    life with both her children.  I find that the Respondent's decision  to
    refuse her leave to enter and cancel her leave does interfere with that
    family life in the UK, and therefore Article 8 is engaged.  I find that
    the proposed interference is in accordance with the law, on  the  basis
    that the Immigration Rules are not satisfied, and I then have to decide
    whether the proposed interference is necessary  and  proportionate.   I
    find that the burden is on the Secretary of State  to  prove  that  the
    decision is proportionate.

71. When considering proportionality, I must consider the best interests of
    the children as a primary consideration.  This however is not the  only
    consideration, and can be outweighed by other factors,  depending  upon
    the circumstances.  Generally when considering the  best  interests  of
    children, it can be said that their best interests are  to  live  in  a
    family unit with both parents.  I see no reason why  this  is  not  the
    case here.  The Claimant and her husband have however decided that  the
    best interests of the children will be served by being  educated  at  a
    boarding school in the United Kingdom.

72. There is no reason why that cannot continue, if that is thought  to  be
    in the best interests of the children by their parents.   The  children
    could return to Pakistan in the school holidays, and I  note  that  the
    Claimant's husband still has a visa entitling him to visit.  It may  be
    that the Claimant would be issued with another  visa  enabling  her  to
    visit the UK, although a multiple visa  would  be  extremely  unlikely,
    given the length of time she has remained in the UK during the term  of
    this visa.  There is the issue of a possible  ten  year  ban  on  entry
    clearance on the Claimant, but that is a separate issue  and  is  being
    challenged by way of judicial review.

73. My primary finding, based on the limited evidence before me, is that it
    would be in the best interests of the  children  to  reside  with  both
    their parents, and I do not accept that this would entail allowing  the
    Claimant, to live with the children in the UK  on  a  long-term  basis.
    The children are citizens of Pakistan, and I do not find that it  would
    be adverse to their best interests for them to return  to  Pakistan  to
    live with their parents.  Alternatively, they could remain in education
    in the UK and return home in the holidays.

74.  In  considering  proportionality  I  have  taken  into   account   the
    considerations set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act.  I place weight
    upon the fact that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is
    in the public interest.  I accept that the Claimant can  speak  English
    and is financially independent, but as confirmed in  AM  Malawi  [2015]
    UKUT 0260, the Claimant can obtain no positive  right  to  a  grant  of
    leave to remain whatever the degree of fluency in English  or  strength
    of financial resources.

75. I have also taken into account the principles in Mostafa when  deciding
    whether the Secretary of  State's  decision  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.  I note the concluding
    sentence of paragraph 24 which is set out below;

         "... In a limited class of cases where Article 8(1) ECHR is engaged
         the refusal of entry clearance must be in accordance with  the  law
         and proportionate.  If a  person's  circumstances  do  satisfy  the
         Immigration Rules and they have not acted in a way that  undermines
         the system of immigration control, a refusal of entry clearance  is
         liable to infringe Article 8."

76. In this case, the Claimant has not satisfied the Immigration Rules, and
    has, in my  view,  acted  in  a  way  that  undermines  the  system  of
    immigration control by reason of the length of time spent  in  the  UK.
    My conclusion is that in being asked to allow the appeal under  Article
    8 outside the Immigration Rules, I am being  asked  to  circumvent  the
    Immigration Rules, and allow the Claimant to reside in the UK while her
    children are studying, which may be for a substantial period of time.

77. I bear in mind what was stated in paragraph  57  of  Patel  and  Others
    [2013] UKSC 72 that "it is important to remember that Article 8 is  not
    a general dispensing power."

78. I conclude, for the reasons given above, that the Secretary of  State's
    decision is in accordance with the law,  necessary  and  proportionate,
    and does not breach Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.
