For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal against a decision by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
   Bradshaw who dismissed an appeal by the appellant against  a  refusal  of
   leave to remain as a spouse.

2) The appellant was born in 1990  and  is  a  national  of  the  USA.   She
   entered the UK as a visitor in January  2014.   She  came  to  visit  the
   Whiteside family, to whom she was related by  marriage.   While  she  was
   here Patrick Whiteside proposed to her and the couple were married on  14
   July 2014.  On 28 July 2014 the appellant replied for leave to remain  as
   a spouse but this application was refused by  notice  dated  3  September
   2014.

3)  The  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  heard  evidence   about   the
   appellant's father-in-law, who is elderly and disabled.  The  appellant's
   husband, Patrick Whiteside, cares for him on  a  full  time  basis.   The
   judge had before him evidence from the appellant's GP in relation to  the
   appellant's father-in-law.  This stated that the  appellant's  father-in-
   law requires 24 hour care.  If care and assistance  from  family  members
   were not available he would be  incapable  of  being  cared  for  in  the
   community and would require to be admitted to residential  accommodation,
   a nursing home or hospital.  The judge pointed out, at  paragraph  70  of
   the decision that the GP referred to care by family members  rather  than
   specifically care by the appellant's husband only.  The judge  was  aware
   that there were other family members living near the appellant's  father-
   in-law and there was a question as to whether or not other family members
   were involved in the care of the appellant's  father-in-law.   The  judge
   also commented that the GP's letter did not address  the  possibility  of
   local authority support and stated from his own knowledge  he  was  aware
   that local authority support can extend to visits by carers  up  to  four
   times a day.

4) The appellant's husband is himself disabled and suffers  from  PTSD.   He
   receives the highest care component of Disability  Living  Allowance  and
   the lower rate of mobility component.

5) Before the First-tier Tribunal it was accepted that the  appellant  would
   not qualify for leave under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and  the
   appeal would  only  succeed  under  Article  8  outside  the  Rules.   In
   considering Article 8 the judge found that there would be no  significant
   difficulty for  the  appellant  in  returning  to  the  USA  to  make  an
   application for entry clearance from there.  The appellant would have  to
   obtain employment and might take three months or longer to  save  up  the
   application fee.  There would then be a period of 60-90  days  while  the
   application was being processed.  The judge noted that the appellant  and
   her husband were able to produce ï¿½601 to pay for the  application  giving
   rise to the refusal decision under appeal.  The judge considered that the
   appellant's husband might be able to assist her with the application  fee
   in the USA, although at the hearing he said he had no savings.  There are
   no children of the marriage.  The appellant came to  the  UK  in  January
   2014 as a visitor  and  was  not  expecting  to  receive  a  proposal  of
   marriage.  If she was to be separated from her husband for  a  period  of
   time they would be able to keep in contact with each other through modern
   means of communication.  The appellant's husband had visited the  USA  in
   2013 with his father.  There was the  possibility  that  the  appellant's
   husband would be able to visit the USA again and this  would  reduce  the
   adverse effects of separation.

6) On this basis the judge concluded at paragraph 86 that the appellant  had
   not shown there were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain
   outwith the Rules and accordingly it was not necessary for the  judge  to
   consider whether there were  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
   recognised under the Rules.

7) At the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  it  was  pointed  out  on
   behalf of the respondent that the appellant had visited the UK on several
   occasions previously.  On one of these occasions she had appealed against
   an adverse immigration decision and her appeal was dismissed by the First-
   tier Tribunal.  It was submitted by the respondent that the appellant was
   aware of the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

8) The application for permission to appeal  contended  that  the  appellant
   had relied upon the decision of the Outer House of the Court  of  Session
   in Muhammad Irfan Khan [2013] CSOH 176 but the Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had failed to have regard to this decision.  This was said to be
   an error of law.  In the case of  Khan  the  Lord  Ordinary  stated  that
   separating a couple affected the proportionality exercise under paragraph
   8.  A policy of requiring applicants  to  make  their  applications  from
   abroad should not usually be applied without more and an Article 8 appeal
   should not normally be dismissed on this  basis.   The  findings  of  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal contradicted the decision in Khan.

9) It was submitted in the application  that  the  judge  further  erred  by
   relying on matters that were said to be within  his  own  knowledge.   At
   paragraph 71, as already noted, the judge referred to  the  provision  of
   care by local authorities as being within  his  own  knowledge.   It  was
   contended that this was not a matter which was within judicial  knowledge
   and no evidence had been led in respect of this.

10) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal further  erred,  according  to  the
   application, by concluding that there were no good arguable  grounds  for
   granting leave to remain outwith the Rules.  It was submitted  that  this
   was the wrong test and that the Upper Tribunal in the case of Oludoyi IJR
   [2014] UKUT 00539 made it clear there was no threshold test of  having  a
   good arguable case.

11) Permission was granted on all three grounds.

12) A rule 24 notice was lodged on behalf of the respondent contending  that
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had issued a comprehensive  decision
   dealing with all the facts of the case and giving considered reasons  why
   it would not be disproportionate for the appellant to return to  the  USA
   and apply for entry clearance.  In response  the  appellant  submitted  a
   rule 25 notice reiterating the grounds of the application and emphasising
   the argument  that  the  judge  did  not  apply  the  correct  test  when
   considering Article 8.

Submissions

13) At the hearing  before  us  Mr  Mullan,  for  the  appellant,  began  by
   referring to the judge's reference to his own knowledge of the care which
   might be provided by a local authority, as recorded at  paragraph  71  of
   the decision.  There the judge stated: "From my own knowledge I am  aware
   that local authority support can extend to visits by carers four times  a
   day, seven days a week, and I note this issue of local authority  support
   has not been referred to in the said letter from the GP especially  where
   there is evidence on behalf of the appellant to the effect  that  it  was
   previously provided albeit to a very limited extent."  It was pointed out
   that the judge's comment could mean no more than that  local  authorities
   had power to provide support to elderly and disabled persons such as  the
   appellant's father-in-law.  Mr Mullan nevertheless  contended  that  this
   was a matter which should have been the subject of proof.  He referred to
   paragraph 72 of the decision, where the judge observed from the  evidence
   that the appellant's husband takes  medication  called  Venlafaxine.   In
   relation to this the judge stated: "I understand this medication is  used
   to treat major depressive disorders, anxiety and  panic  disorders."   Mr
   Mullan again submitted that this should not be regarded as  a  matter  of
   judicial knowledge.  It was pointed out, however, that the judge did  not
   express a  view  on  why  the  appellant's  husband  was  receiving  this
   treatment but only stated what he understood to be  the  general  use  of
   this medication.

14) Mr Mullan referred to the difficulty for the appellant in  returning  to
   the USA to obtain a visa.  This  process  might  take  six  months.   The
   appellant had no funds or savings.  The appellant would need to travel to
   her home in South Dakota and earn money to pay for her application.   The
   application itself would be  no  more  than  a  "tick-box"  exercise.   A
   balance should be drawn between  the  likely  period  of  separation  and
   allowing the appeal outwith the  Rules.   The  appellant's  husband  took
   medication and he was in receipt of benefits.  Mr Mullan suggested  there
   was Chikwamba issue.  The appellant was being expected to apply for entry
   clearance for the sake of it.  She had arrived with a visit visa but  her
   engagement had come out of the blue.  This was not a ruse  to  remain  in
   the UK.  She had committed only a minor  infraction  of  the  Immigration
   Rules and reliance was placed on the case of Khan.

15) Mr Mullan concluded in summary that a common sense  approach  should  be
   taken.  The appellant  found  herself  in  a  situation  where  her  visa
   required to be changed.  She satisfied all the requirements for a spousal
   visa.  An adverse decision would  place  a  considerable  burden  on  her
   relationship with her husband.  She might have to spend up to a  year  in
   South Dakota seeking entry clearance.  She was being sent  away  only  to
   bring her back.  She would have to work in South Dakota and  save  money.
   She had not committed any crime.  She was simply required to meet a  visa
   requirement.

16) Mr Mullan continued that the impact on the  appellant's  husband  should
   be considered, including the impact on her husband's health.

17) Having heard from Mr Mullan we did not consider it necessary to hear  at
   length from Mrs O'Brien.  Mrs O'Brien  stated  that  she  relied  on  the
   respondent's rule 24 notice.

Discussion

18) The first issue on which Mr Mullan relied was the  question  of  whether
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal wrongly relied on his own  knowledge
   of matters which should, out of fairness  to  the  appellant,  have  been
   decided only upon the evidence.  The first of  these  issues  arose  from
   paragraph 71 of the decision, where the judge referred to the possibility
   of local authority support being provided to the  appellant's  father-in-
   law.  As was pointed out at the hearing before us, however, the judge was
   essentially  doing  no  more  than  referring  to  the  powers  of  local
   authorities to provide care and support.  These powers exist as a  matter
   of law and can therefore be regarded as being within judicial  knowledge.



19) There is a wider point, however, which is that it  was  clear  from  the
   evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant's husband  had
   no intention of accompanying her throughout the period in which she would
   have to reside in the USA until her visa was granted.   He  would  remain
   behind to look after his father, even if he were to visit  the  appellant
   for a short period.  Essentially, therefore,  the  possibility  of  local
   authority support was not material to the judge's decision.  There was no
   prospect of the appellant and her husband going to reside together in the
   USA.  The basis of the judge's decision  was  that  the  appellant  would
   return alone to the USA to obtain a visa.

20) The second issue where Mr Mullan submitted the judge was wrong  to  rely
   on personal knowledge was at paragraph  72,  where  the  judge  gave  his
   understanding  of  the  use  of  Venlafaxine,  which  is  taken  by   the
   appellant's husband.  As was pointed out at the hearing  before  us,  the
   judge did not say from his own knowledge why the appellant's husband took
   this medication but he simply recorded  his  understanding  of  what  the
   medication was generally used for.  There was evidence before  the  judge
   showing that the appellant's husband suffers from PTSD.  He is in receipt
   of Employment Support Allowance because of incapacity to work and is also
   in receipt of Disability Living Allowance.  It does not appear to us that
   the judge's reference to the general  use  of  this  medication  had  any
   material bearing on  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.   There  was  medical
   evidence relating to the appellant's husband, which the judge fully  took
   into account.  In any event, we are not persuaded that the  general  uses
   of common medication  are  a  matter  which  cannot  be  within  judicial
   knowledge.

21) We turn next to the  question  of  consideration  of  the  appeal  under
   Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.   Our  attention  was  drawn  to
   paragraph 86 of the decision, where the judge stated that  the  appellant
   had not established "that there may be arguably good grounds for granting
   leave to remain outwith the Rules" and because of this the judge did  not
   consider  it  necessary  to  consider  whether  there   were   compelling
   circumstances under Article  8  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
   Rules.

22) It was pointed out that the judge's  decision  was  issued  in  December
   2014 within days of the decision of  Upper  Tribunal  in  Oludoyi,  cited
   above.  We  see  nothing  of  substance  in  the  judge's  conclusion  at
   paragraph 86, however, which runs contrary to the views of the  Court  of
   Appeal in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, at paragraph 33 in  particular,
   to the effect that compelling circumstances  need  to  be  identified  to
   support a claim for the granting of leave outside the Rules  in  Appendix
   FM.

23) Although Mr Mullan placed reliance on the Outer House decision  in  Khan
   he made no reference to the subsequent decision of  the  Inner  House  in
   that case, cited as [2015] CSIH 29, or to other recent decisions  of  the
   Inner House on the application of Article 8, such as  Mirza  [2015]  CSIH
   28, Asif Ali Ashhiq [2015] CSIH 31 and Shahzad Butt [2015] CSIH 72.

24) The case of Mirza, like Khan, is largely dependent upon  its  particular
   facts.  As was pointed out by Lady Smith in Shahzad  Butt,  at  paragraph
   29, the outcome of the proportionality exercise in each  individual  case
   is bound to turn very much on its own particular facts and  circumstances
   as placed before the decision maker by the applicant.

25) In Asif Ali Ashiq Lady Smith stated at  paragraph  6,  referring  to  MM
   (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985, that reference to "a good  arguable  case"
   does not impose a separate hurdle to  be  overcome  by  an  appellant  in
   pursuing a claim under Article 8.  The concept of a  good  arguable  case
   refers to the need for it to be evident from the terms of the application
   that an Article 8 issue arises.  It does not raise a bar any higher  than
   the need for there to be "realistic prospects" of the claim succeeding.

26) As already noted, in the present appeal  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal found that it was open to the appellant to return to the USA  to
   obtain entry clearance as a spouse in accordance with Immigration  Rules.
   This was a finding that was open to the judge upon the evidence.   Having
   made this finding the judge concluded that there were  no  arguably  good
   grounds  for  granting  leave  outwith  the  Rules  and   no   compelling
   circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the  Rules  which  would
   require him to consider Article 8 outside the Rules.  This was a decision
   the judge was entitled to make.

27) Mr Mullan referred briefly to the case of Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40  and
   the reasonableness of expecting the appellant to return  to  the  USA  to
   apply for entry clearance.  While Mr Mullan submitted that an application
   for entry clearance as a spouse by the appellant would be no more than  a
   "tick-box" exercise, the  respondent's  position  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal was that any practical difficulties the appellant would face  in
   returning to the USA to  apply  for  entry  clearance  would  not  engage
   Article 8.  The  judge  appears  to  have  accepted  this  submission  in
   finding, at paragraph 83, that there would be no  significant  difficulty
   in the appellant returning to the USA to make  an  application.   As  was
   pointed out in Chen IJR [2015] UKUT 189, it was for the appellant to show
   that temporary separation would be a disproportionate  interference  with
   protected rights and it is apparent from the judge's decision that he was
   not satisfied that this had been demonstrated.

28) In this appeal the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal reached  a  decision
   which was based upon the evidence and supported by adequate reasons.   Mr
   Mullan has not shown that any of the  material  findings  or  conclusions
   reached by the judge are affected by an error of law.   Accordingly,  the
   decision shall stand.

Conclusions

29) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

30) We do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

31) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   We  have
   not been asked to make such an order and we see no  reason  of  substance
   for so doing.
