For the Respondent:    Mr A L Din


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer Islamabad appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against  the  determination  of  the  FtT  (Judge  Moore)  which  in  a
    determination dated 7th August  2014  allowed  Mr  Syed  Shah's  appeal
    against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  of  8th  November  2013
    refusing him entry to the UK as the spouse of Sonia Qureshi.

 2. For the sake of clarity I will refer throughout this  determination  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer as "the Respondent" and to Mr Shah as  "the
    Appellant", which reflects their position as they were before the FtT.

 3. The Appellant applied for entry to the UK and his application  fell  to
    be decided under Appendix FM of  the  current  Immigration  Rules.  The
    application was refused on two grounds. The  first  ground,  which  was
    that the parties were not in a subsisting relationship, was reviewed by
    the Entry Clearance Manager and that ground fell away. It was  accepted
    that the relationship between  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  is  a
    genuine one.

 4. The remaining ground of refusal is that the Entry Clearance Officer was
    not satisfied that the Appellant had submitted the specified  documents
    required to show that he met the financial requirements of  the  Rules;
    in particular documents showing that his Sponsor earned a gross  income
    of at least �18,600 per annum.

 5. The matter  came  before  Judge  Moore,  who  in  accordance  with  the
    Appellant's request, dealt with the appeal on the documentary  evidence
    before him. He noted that the Sponsor claimed to have income  from  two
    sets of employment; which together it was said enabled the Appellant to
    reach the income threshold of �18,600. The first  employment  in  which
    the Sponsor is engaged was accepted by the Entry Clearance  Officer  as
    genuine. Evidence of that employment  was  produced  showing  that  the
    sponsor worked at McDonald's for 37 hours per week. Her  annual  income
    from that employment, which  was  verified  by  payslips,  amounted  to
    �14,248.

 6. The  Judge  noted  concerns  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    regarding the second claimed employment. This  was  employment  at  the
    Jewel of India Restaurant in Otley. It was said that  the  Sponsor,  in
    addition to her employment at McDonald's, worked a further 28 hours per
    week at the Jewel of India Restaurant.  Her  average  income  from  the
    Jewel of India employment it was said amounted to �266 per  week  which
    she was paid cash in hand. Although eight months' payslips  from  Jewel
    of India were provided, and they  showed  payments  in  cash,  no  bank
    statements were produced showing  a  corresponding  deposit  for  those
    wages.

 7. Nevertheless  the  Judge  went  on  to  allow  the  appeal  saying  the
    following,

         "The Respondent is correct in stating that  the  Santander  current
         account for the  Sponsor  does  not  show  salary  paid  into  that
         account. However it would not, and could not, since the Sponsor was
         paid in cash. It cannot be correct that any Sponsor employee who is
         paid in cash can never in those circumstances satisfy the Rules."

 8. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 9. Mrs Pettersen on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer  submitted  that
    the FtT Judge had erred because he had ignored the  provisions  of  the
    Rules which are comprehensively set out. She submitted that Appendix FM
    provides the terms for salaried employees who are paid in  cash.  Those
    terms provide that the following evidence must be provided;

          a) Wage slips covering

             (i) A period of six months prior to the date of application...

         (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as
             the wage slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the  salary  has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person  or  their
             partner jointly.

    She submitted that in the absence of that evidence the Judge fell  into
    error in his approach. To date, nothing has been put  forward  to  show
    bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as  the  wage  slips
    showing cash salary paid to the Sponsor. Therefore the Judge's decision
    was unsustainable. She asked that I set aside the Judge's decision  and
    substitute one dismissing Mr Shah's appeal.

10. Mr Din on behalf of the Appellant produced an  up-to-date  letter  from
    the Jewel of  India  Restaurant  confirming  the  Sponsor's  employment
    there. He submitted that the Judge had found that the employment at the
    Jewel of India was genuine and the income earned by the Sponsor in  her
    two employments exceeds the �18,600 threshold required  by  the  Rules.
    The determination should stand.

Consideration

11. Whilst I accept that Mr Din tried valiantly to  press  the  Appellant's
    appeal, what he was unable to do was to provide  any  evidence  showing
    deposits in the Sponsor's personal bank statements  which  corresponded
    with her claim to receive cash from her  employment  at  the  Jewel  of
    India Restaurant in Otley. It  is  clear  therefore  that  there  is  a
    failure to comply with the Immigration Rules and that  the  Appellant's
    appeal must fail on that basis. I find that the FtT Judge erred in  his
    findings that the  Rule  was  satisfied.  The  Judge  approach  to  the
    evidence was erroneous when he said at paragraph [15],

         "It cannot be correct that any sponsor employee who is paid in cash
         can never in those circumstances satisfy the Rules".

    The Rules in  fact  make  provision  for  and  recognise  that  Sponsor
    employees may be paid in cash. The Rules also  provide  that  specified
    documentary evidence must be produced in those circumstances.

12. For the sake of completeness I also record that there were no Article 8
    grounds raised before either the FtT or before me.







Decision

13. The decision of the FtT is set aside for  legal  error.  I  remake  the
    decision. Mr Syed  Raza  Shah's  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal to grant him entry clearance is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
