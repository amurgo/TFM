                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms J McCallum, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her letter dated 17 December 2015.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hillis dismissed the appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 18 March 2017.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the UT  on  the  following
    grounds:

         "... the judge's decision contains several arguable errors in law:

         (1).     The credibility assessment rests partly on the finding  at
         paragraph 43 that the US  asylum  application  of  the  appellant's
         brother, Samuel, contains a discrepant date  as  to  when  he  fled
         Ghana.  This is repeated at paragraph 44. The judge appears to have
         misread the date  which  is  written  in  the  American  format  of
         MM/DD/YY rather than the format of DD/MM/YY ... Samuel  is  stating
         he left on 6 September 2006, not 9 June 2006. This  error  of  fact
         has clearly affected  the  credibility  statement  and  the  weight
         placed on the appellant's brother's refugee status.

         (2).     Separately ... the judge erred when he states at paragraph
         44 any states that there is no evidence of  the  factual  basis  on
         which the appellant's stepmother and brother  were  granted  status
         ... various documents were lodged in the respondent's bundle - item
         S was a copy of Samuel's asylum application (at S6  he  provides  a
         detailed description  of  the  claim  which  matches  that  of  the
         appellant) and 13 contained a copy of his asylum  status  document.
         If this evidence was properly considered, the credibility and  risk
         assessment may have been different."

 4. On 19 July 2017 FtT Judge Bennett granted permission:

         "... because it is arguable that the judge misunderstood  the  date
         given by the appellant's brother in his application for  asylum  in
         the USA as the date of his departure from Ghana, as argued  in  the
         first proposed ground."

 5. Ms McCallum relied on the grounds, and submitted  further  as  follows.
    The judge misunderstood the date when the appellant's brother fled from
    Ghana.  That misapprehension fed  doubt  into  the  judge's  mind,  and
    affected the weight which he gave to the claims made by the appellant's
    relatives in the USA. But for that misapprehension, those claims  could
    and should have been given significant weight.  As  to  ground  2,  the
    judge overlooked that the appellant's brother on the copy form produced
    gave a  detailed  description  of  his  claim,  matching  that  of  the
    appellant. That was another matter  which,  once  properly  understood,
    might make a significant difference to the outcome. The decision should
    be set aside and remade.

 6. The Presenting Officer submitted thus. Ground 1 did disclose  an  error
    of fact. However, that did not undermine the judge's  overall  analysis
    and his rejection of the account of the family's forcible eviction from
    their home. The more fundamental point made by the judge remained -  he
    had no evidence of the reasons why family members were  granted  status
    in the USA.  The description referred to in ground 2 was  not  detailed
    and did not show any basis for protection.   No error of fact  material
    to the decision was shown. The grounds overlooked the  conclusion  that
    although there was support for the appellant's claim that  his  father,
    like other senior officers, had been treated unfairly by  the  military
    in Ghana, there was nothing at all to show that the  families  of  such
    soldiers were targeted. Even "taken at highest" the appellant's account
    of events did not support the  proposition  that  he  was  at  risk  of
    persecution if he were now to return to Ghana.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. Ground 2 may be dealt with first.  The passage referred to at  page  S6
    shows that the appellant's brother  answered  a  question  about  their
    father's part in the military by describing his rise to high rank.   It
    says nothing about circumstances giving rise to a protection claim, and
    does not significantly  advance  the  appellant's  case.   This  ground
    discloses no error.

 9. The error over a date disclosed by ground 1 did play some part  in  the
    Judge's thinking.  It led to  the  view  that  eviction  from  military
    accommodation in Ghana could not have placed a  part  in  the  family's
    departure, because it occurred after not before the date of  travel  to
    the USA.

10. However, that slip did not bear decisively on the outcome, and  is  not
    of such significance as to translate into an error of law requiring the
    decision to be set aside.

11. The Judge found at �42-46 that at its realistic highest the appellant's
    account was one of  forceful  eviction  of  the  family  from  military
    accommodation in Ghana in June 2006, a contractual dispute between  his
    father and his employers showing no past persecution of family members.
     At �48-55 he  found  no  reliable  evidence  of  risk  to  members  of
    soldiers'  families,  and  held  that  possibility  to  be  remote  and
    speculative.  The  appellant  has  shown  no  error  of  law  in  those
    conclusions.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
