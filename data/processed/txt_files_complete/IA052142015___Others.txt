                        ____________________________
                           ERROR OF LAW & REASONS
                        ____________________________

1.    The First Appellant is a national of  Nigeria,  born  on  27  December
1985. This appeal arises from an application made by her  on  21  July  2014
for leave to remain based on Article 8 of  ECHR.  Her  husband,  the  second
Appellant, born on 18 June 1974 and her three children born on [ ]  2007,  [
] 2008 and  [  ]  2013  (the  Third  to  Fifth  Appellants)  were  named  as
dependents to that application, which was ultimately refused with the  right
of appeal on 21 January 2015. All five Appellants exercised their rights  of
appeal and the appeals came before Judge of the First tier  Tribunal  Malins
for hearing on 27 July 2015, when  the  first  and  second  Appellants  gave
evidence.

2.    In a decision dated 26 August 2015,  the  First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
dismissed  the  appeal.  She  entirely  rejected  the  credibility  of  both
witnesses  at  [10]  and  [11]  and  went  on  to  dismiss  the  appeal.  An
application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  made  on  7
September 2015. The grounds in support of the application  assert  that  the
Judge erred materially in law: (i)  in  failing  to  make  a  finding  under
paragraph 276ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules and in failing to identify  or
apply the relevant test set out therein; (ii)  in  treating  the  third  and
fourth  Appellants  as  dependents  on  their  mother's  appeal;  (iii)   in
attaching weight to immaterial  considerations  in  the  assessment  of  the
children's best interests; (iv) in failing to give adequate  reasons  and/or
to make a finding as to the impact of the  prevalent  practice  of  corporal
punishment in the Nigerian educational system on the best interests  of  the
children and (v) making findings that were not compatible  with  Article  14
and 8 of ECHR on the basis  that  they  were  racially  and  or  religiously
discriminatory [14(b)] and [13(h)] refer.

3.    Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  16  January
2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Mark Davies on the basis  that  "there  is
no indication in the body of the decision what the standard of proof is  and
that the Judge has applied that  standard  to  the  evidence  that  was  put
before her  and  it  is  arguable  that  the  Judge  was  in  error  by  not
considering the application of the Immigration Rules." A  rule  24  response
was filed by the Respondent  on  25  January  2016  seeking  to  uphold  the
decision of the First tier Tribunal Judge.

Hearing

4.    At the hearing before me, Mr Clarke stated that he was  in  difficulty
in that he felt unable to defend the Judge's  finding  at  paragraph  14(b).
Paragraph 14(b) relates to the findings by the First tier Tribunal Judge  in
respect of the best interests of the third and fourth Appellants and  refers
to the guidelines set out by the Upper Tribunal in Azimi-Moayed [2013]  UKUT
178 (IAC) viz: "the development of  social  cultural  and  educational  ties
that it would be inappropriate to disrupt." The Judge held in this respect:

    "... any disruption would I find, be less than  might  at  first  sight
    seem: the third and fourth appellants are at school with a majority  of
    black children with no doubt, a similar or even in some cases, the same
    cultural heritage."

5.    This finding is impugned at [10] and [11] of the  grounds  of  appeal,
which I set out in full:

    "10.   For the avoidance of doubt, the assertion  that  the  third  and
    fourth appellants are at school with a majority of black  children  was
    not supported by any evidence  before  the  Tribunal  -  including  the
    "class photo" mentioned at paragraph 12 (c) of the determination [which
    would in any event have been a poor yardstick to measure the  diversity
    of an entire school]. Moreover, the cultural background  of  a  boy  of
    Nigerian origin cannot be asserted to be similar to that of  any  other
    black child in his class. This is a bizarre and  troubling  finding  on
    which to rely upon to conclude that disruption on  removal  to  Nigeria
    would be diminished.

    11.    First, the finding is predicated  on  the  assumption  that  all
    black children share "similar heritage" by virtue of  their  race  -  a
    crude and offensive racial stereotype that  perpetuates  the  lie  that
    skin colour is a sound indicator of  a  person's  cultural  background.
    Culture is an entirely  distinct  concept  to  racial  appearance,  and
    dependent on countless factors removed from the amount of melanin in  a
    person's skin. Second, it suggests that the cultures  of  black  people
    are lacking in any significant diversity and hence can be assumed to be
    "similar" which is - as should not be necessary  to  state  -  patently
    false."

6.    In light of this finding and the content of paragraphs 10  and  11  of
the grounds  of  appeal,  Mr  Clarke  submitted  that  apparent  bias  would
potentially undermine the decision as a  whole  and  he  expressly  conceded
that the decision contained a material error of law. Ms  Sirikanda  did  not
seek to make any submissions in light of Mr Clarke's concession.

Decision & reasons

7.    I have recorded Mr Clarke's submission that the decision of the  First
tier Tribunal Judge is vitiated  by  the  appearance  of  bias.  It  is  not
necessary for me to make a finding in respect of that submission given  that
this was not a point taken in the grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
I simply record that the President of  the  Upper  Tribunal  made  clear  in
Alubankudi (Appearance of bias) [2015] UKUT 00542 (IAC):

    "14.   We consider that the linguistic formula selected  by  the  Judge
    was unfortunate. It had the potential to cause offence  and  we  accept
    that, in this instance, it did so. It was insensitive. It  further  had
    the potential to convey to the Appellant and her mother an unfavourable
    impression of the legal  process  in  which  they  had  been  involved,
    generating a sense of unease. We are satisfied that it had this effect.
    The  interface  between  the  judiciary  and  society  is  of   greater
    importance nowadays than it has ever  been.  In  both  the  conduct  of
    hearings and the compilation  of  judgments,  Judges  must  have  their
    antennae tuned to the immediate and wider audiences. As the decision in
    AAN demonstrates,  Judges  must  be  alert  to  the  sensitivities  and
    perceptions of others, particularly in  a  multi-cultural  society.  We
    consider that statements of the kind  which  stimulated  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal  in  the  present  case  should  be  avoided.  The
    interaction of most litigants with the judicial system is  a  transient
    one and it is of seminal importance that the fairness, impartiality and
    detached objectivity of the judicial office holder  are  manifest  from
    beginning to end."

8.    I further note that, whilst it is  also  apparent  from  her  decision
that the First tier Tribunal Judge did not find the second Appellant  to  be
a credible or honest witness, it is unnecessary to  repeatedly  state  this,
eight times in all at [10] and in so doing run the  risk  of  breaching  the
principles set out by the President in Alubankudi (op cit).

9.    I find that Mr Clarke's concession that the First tier Tribunal  Judge
erred materially in law was properly made. The Appellants' counsel  did  not
seek to pursue any of the other grounds of appeal and accordingly I make  no
finding on them.

Decision

10.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins made a material error of law and  her
decision cannot stand. The appeal is remitted to  the  First  tier  Tribunal
for a hearing de novo before a different First tier Tribunal Judge.
