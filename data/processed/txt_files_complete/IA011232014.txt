Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Querton of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 17 February 1982.  She is a citizen of Kenya.

 2. She appealed against the respondent's refusal to grant  her  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled
    here.  That appeal was heard by Judge C J E Nicholls (the judge) who in
    a decision promulgated on 23 September 2014, dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal.  He found and it was not in  dispute  that  the  appellant  was
    unable to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   The  judge
    went on to say that  where  the  Rules  as  in  the  appellant's  case,
    provided a complete code, the Rules met the requirements of Article  8.
    He went on to consider the best interests of Ruby and s.117B(6).

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that Ruby being British, the judge did not apply Sanade  (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) (India) [2012] UKUT 48 (IAC)  and  failed
    to give sufficient weight to the public  interest  considerations  that
    fell in the appellant's favour when considering  s.117B.   The  judge's
    failure to give weight to that part of the appellant's case resulted in
    him placing the public interest too high  and  in  any  event,  it  was
    apparent that he imposed too high a test at [21]  of  his  decision  by
    referring to "...... any risks ......".

 4. Judge T R P Hollingworth refused permission to appeal.   His  view  was
    that grounds were  without  merit.   It  was  clear  from  reading  the
    determination as  a  whole  that  the  judge  had  considered  all  the
    available evidence appropriately and did not exclude  anything  on  the
    basis that the grounds suggested.  As regards the claim that the  judge
    failed to give weight to the  position  of  Ruby  and  the  appellant's
    husband, the judge gave consideration to all aspects referred to him by
    the appellant's representatives.  Sanade was not put before  the  judge
    at the hearing.  As regards the claim that the  judge  failed  to  give
    sufficient weight to public interest considerations,  it  was  apparent
    that he had given careful consideration to the public interest element.
     He had concluded in balancing  the  public  interest  that  there  was
    nothing in principle which precluded the appellant returning  to  Kenya
    where she continued to have settled ties.  She could either  take  Ruby
    with her or alternatively, leave her with her father,  if  it  was  the
    father's decision to remain here for work purposes.

 5. The grounds were renewed.  Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce found that
    all grounds were  arguable.   The  Sanade  principles  and  the  public
    interest considerations in s.117A-D applied, whether or not  they  were
    expressly mentioned in submissions to the judge.

 6. Thus the matter came before me.

Submissions on Error of Law

 7. Ms Querton relied upon her skeleton argument but told me that  she  was
    not pursuing the Sanade argument  at  [10]-[17]  of  the  skeleton.  Mr
    Kandola relied upon the Rule 24  response.  There  were  no  compelling
    circumstances.  The  appellant  was  not  Ruby's  sole  primary  carer.
    Sanade was a case that was heard before the respondent  introduced  new
    Rules to codify Article 8 and the judge had  carried  out  the  correct
    assessment in that regard.

Conclusion on Error of Law

 8. I do not accept that the judge was compelled to apply Sanade given  its
    codification  within  the  Immigration  Rules.   See  the  respondent's
    reasons for refusal dated 13 November  2013  and  in  particular,  with
    regard to EX.1 of Appendix FM.

 9. The judge took into account all of the evidence put  before  him.   The
    appellant did not have leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    partner and following the expiry of her own leave on 4 September  2012,
    she had what the judge described as a precarious situation  here.   The
    judge did not consider that the  appellant's  circumstances  were  such
    that there were demonstrated insurmountable obstacles to the  appellant
    continuing family life in Kenya or that it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect Ruby to travel to Kenya with the appellant.  The judge took into
    account the best interests of Ruby who at the date of the hearing was 3
    years and 4 months old.  There was evidence from the appellant that the
    child had required surgical procedures to  her  fingers  and  toes  but
    there was no medical evidence  that  there  would  be  any  unusual  or
    particular difficulties for Ruby if either the  appellant  returned  to
    Kenya to apply for entry clearance or the whole of the family chose  to
    go back to live there.  The judge considered it would be a  matter  for
    the family whether the  appellant  was  separated  from  Ruby  and  her
    husband for a while but that in any event and in  the  absence  of  any
    evidence in that regard, the judge found the  best  interests  of  Ruby
    would not be adversely affected by the decision of  the  respondent  to
    refuse leave to remain and to remove the appellant.

10. The judge considered part 5A Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 as implemented by the Immigration Act 2014.  He went on to  assess
    the public interest question as to whether  an  interference  with  the
    appellant's right to respect for private and family life was  justified
    under Article 8(2).  He considered that the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control was in the public interest.  In particular in  that
    regard, that those resident here  were  financially  independent.   The
    appellant's husband did not satisfy the Immigration Rules  because  his
    annual salary was below ï¿½18,600.

11. The judge went on to consider s.117B(6) that the  public  interest  did
    not require the  appellant's  removal  where  she  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child and  it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK.   Ruby  was  a
    qualifying child as she is a British citizen.

12. The evidence before the judge was that the appellant had  close  family
    in Kenya.  See [12] of the decision.  The appellant's husband also  had
    family there.  See [10] of the decision.

13. Ms Querton submitted  that  the  judge  imposed  too  high  a  test  by
    commenting that "...... I have received no evidence to show that  there
    would be any risks (my emphasis) to the child if  she  accompanied  the
    appellant back to the appellant's country of  nationality.".  I  accept
    that the judge might have made more clear what he meant by the  use  of
    the words "any risks"  but I do not accept they indicate  that  he  was
    imposing too high a standard of proof; there is nothing to suggest  the
    same. I speculate that  the  context  of  what  the  judge  was  saying
    indicates that he was referring to Ruby's welfare on  accompanying  her
    mother to Kenya.

14. The judge took into account the medical procedures to Ruby's  toes  and
    fingers which had been referred to him but commented  that  no  medical
    evidence had been produced.  He found that the appellant had a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  but  the
    evidence did not disclose that it would be unreasonable to expect  Ruby
    to leave the United Kingdom in the company of the appellant.

15. I conclude that the decision does not contain a material error of  law,
    such that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set  aside.
