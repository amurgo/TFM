                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellants' appeal  made  against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Phillips made following a hearing at Bradford on 21st March 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellants are nationals of Bangladesh born on 12th July  1995  and
    15th January 1994 respectively.  They applied to come to the UK as  the
    children  of  the  Sponsor,  Mrs  Khatun,  who  has  a  Certificate  of
    Entitlement to the Right of Abode.

 3. Entry clearance was refused on the 27th February 2012.because the Entry
    Clearance Officer was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellants  were  the
    children of a Sponsor present and settled in the UK or that there would
    be adequate accommodation for them or that  they  could  be  adequately
    maintained. DNA testing established that the Appellants are related  as
    claimed to the Sponsor.  No issue was taken with respect to the size of
    the accommodation.

 4. The judge found that the Sponsor was employed as claimed but  that  her
    income only amounted to a monthly equivalent of �899  per  month  which
    was not adequate.  He was not satisfied that the Sponsor's husband Rais
    Ali was working as claimed.  If his income had been accepted  it  would
    have  meant  that  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  with  respect  to
    maintenance could be met as, on the  unchallenged  figures,  the  joint
    income of the Sponsor and her husband exceeded by some way  the  amount
    of money which the family  would  be  entitled  to  receive  on  income
    support.

 5. The judge noted that the evidence was that Mr Ali worked for  only  one
    or two weeks at Bollywood Lounge in Wakefield, in January  2012  before
    he commenced his employment  as  a  kitchen  assistant  at  the  Rupali
    Restaurant in Shipley on 27th January 2012.

 6. The judge noted that a letter had been supplied by  the  proprietor  of
    the Rupali Restaurant dated 5th December 2012 claiming that Mr Ali  had
    earned �8,752.64 to date.  He supplied payslips from 3rd February  2012
    stating that he had been paid �160 per week in February and March  2012
    and a P60 for the year ending 5th April 2012 stating that he had earned
    �1,514.88 from that employment. A bank statement had been  supplied  in
    Mr Ali's name indicating sums of �160 credited to his account over  six
    weeks from February to Marc 2012.

 7. The judge noted that the P60 did not indicate that Mr Ali had  received
    payment from any previous employment and Mr Ali stated in oral evidence
    that he could not explain this  state  of  affairs  which  called  into
    question the reliability of the information he had supplied in relation
    to his claimed employment.

 8. He then wrote as follows:

         "Documentation submitted by or on behalf of Mr  Ali  prior  to  the
         time of the issue of the refusal letters did not state that Mr  Ali
         had  ceased  working  for  Bollywood  Lounge.   In  the  settlement
         application forms dated 11th January 2012 the Appellants had stated
         at section 8.7.11 that Mr Ali's monthly  income  was  approximately
         �600.  That  income  cannot  have  been  accurate  because  on  the
         information provided either Mr Ali had been employed for  one  week
         or a fortnight only at that time, as disclosed by the  payslip  and
         his oral evidence or he had had no employment, as indicated by  the
         P60 form, and he did not claim to have started employment at Rupali
         Restaurant until February."

 9. The judge then referred to  the  case  of  KA  &  Others  (adequacy  of
    maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 and wrote:

         "I find that in the present case there is in factual terms no basis
         for concluding that as at the date of  decision  Mr  Ali's  alleged
         income could appropriately be  described  as  in  a  genuine  sense
         available on an indefinite sense as part of the  household  income.
         There was and remains no  contract  of  employment  that  has  been
         produced.  A letter dated 5th December 2012 purports to state  that
         in December 2012 more than nine months after the date  of  decision
         Mr Ali is in employment.  The letter states that  he  is  currently
         employed on a permanent contract.  There is no information from the
         alleged employer as to the basis of any employment in February 2012
         or whether  or  not  any  such  employment  was  enforceable  as  a
         permanent contract.  The payslips provided  do  not  resolve  those
         uncertainties.

         The position therefore of the Sponsor's income  is  distinguishable
         from that of Mr Ali.  The Sponsor was in a position to  demonstrate
         continuity and foreseeability of permanent  employment  as  at  the
         date of decision whereas Mr Ali was not.  In these circumstances  I
         do not find that the Appellants are able to demonstrate through the
         Sponsor that there would  be  adequate  funds  to  accommodate  and
         maintain them without recourse to public funds as at  the  date  of
         decision."

The Grounds of Application

10. The Appellants sought permission to appeal, in summary, on the  grounds
    that the judge's reasoning was not intelligible.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Poole on 21st Jun 2013.

12.  On  2nd  July  2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.

Submissions

13. Mr Hussain submitted that there was no rational basis for the judge  to
    distinguish between the evidence adduced in support of the  claim  that
    the Appellants' mother was working from that of her  husband  since  it
    was almost identical.

14. It was not clear what points the judge was trying to make in  paragraph
    32 of the determination when he was recording  his  assessment  of  the
    evidence of employment.  The bank statements were corroborative and the
    figure given for Mr Ali's earnings in the settlement  application  form
    was wholly consistent with the payslips.

15. Mrs Pettersen submitted that it was open to the judge to  observe  that
    the P60 was not a true reflection of what Mr Ali's income had been  but
    she accepted that it seems that the judge may have  conflated  the  two
    employments in his mind and accepted that he may have  focused  on  the
    earlier employment.

Consideration of whether there is a material error of law

16. It was open to the judge to observe that  the  P60  did  not  make  any
    reference to the previous  employment  at  Bollywood  Lounge.   However
    there was consistent and substantive evidence to show that Mr  Ali  was
    working as claimed at Rupali Restaurant.

17. The determination does not demonstrate that the judge focused his  mind
    on whether Mr Ali was employed as at the date  of  decision.  It  seems
    that the judge was distracted by the fact that Mr Ali  had  worked  for
    one or two weeks at a previous restaurant.  Furthermore,  by  directing
    himself to the question of whether Mr Ali's income was available "on an
    indefinite sense" he was arguably not addressing himself to  the  right
    issue, namely, as at the date of decision, were  the  Appellants  in  a
    position to be adequately maintained?

18. Paragraph 32 consists of a recitation of the evidence both in favour of
    the Appellants and the P60 point which is taken against  them.   It  is
    not clear why the judge rejects  the  letter  from  the  employer,  the
    payslips, the bank statements, the consistent evidence as  between  the
    settlement application and  the  payslip  and  why  he  considered  the
    omission of the earnings of one or two weeks at the previous employment
    on the P60 outweighed all of the other evidence before him.

19. The judge erred in law in failing to  give  adequate  reasons  for  his
    decision.

Re-making the Decision

20. Mr Hussain sought permission to adduce further evidence from HM Revenue
    and Customs giving Mr Ali's tax details and employment  history  and  a
    further P60 showing that he earned �8,674.01 in the tax year  to  April
    2013.  It gave his employers' name as Rupali Restaurant.

21. Mrs Pettersen noted that the letter from the  Rupali  Restaurant  dated
    5th December 2012  gave  the  company's  tax  reference  as  072/VZ0589
    whereas the HM Revenue and Customs gave the employers' tax reference as
    072/VZ05289.  The letter from the employer therefore omitted the figure
    2 from the reference.  She submitted that the Tribunal should  continue
    to have doubts over Mr Ali's employment.

22. Mr Hussain said that he was mystified  by  that  submission  since  the
    missing digit was clearly a typographical error  and  he  had  produced
    original documentation from HM Revenue and Customs stating that Mr  Ali
    was employed as he claimed.  The Sponsor  was  working  at  the  Rupali
    Restaurant at the date of decision and continues to do so.





Findings and Conclusions

23. I am satisfied that the evidence  from  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  does
    establish that Mr Ali was working at the date of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision and he continues in his employment with  the  Rupali
    Restaurant and, that, on the balance of probabilities,  the  letter  of
    5th December 2012 contains a mistake in that a digit  is  missing  from
    the company tax reference.  Since the Sponsor's income has already been
    accepted that is determinative of the appeal.

Decision

24. The original judge erred in law and the decision is set aside.   It  is
    re-made as follows.  The Appellants' appeals are allowed.
