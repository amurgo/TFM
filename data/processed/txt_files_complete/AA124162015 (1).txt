DIRECTION Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Applicant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent (the Applicant) is an Albanian  born  in  1999.   On  28
    February 2015 he left Albania for Macedonia on  his  own  passport  and
    from there travelled across Europe to arrive in the United  Kingdom  on
    30 March 2015.  The next day he claimed asylum because he feared return
    to Albania on account of the harm he had suffered at the hands  of  his
    father who abused alcohol and  to  find  nearly  ï¿½500,000  to  pay  his
    creditors.

The Home Office Decision

 2. On 7 September 2015 the Appellant (the SSHD)  refused  the  Applicant's
    application and declined to grant him discretionary  leave.   The  SSHD
    considered the Applicant had not shown that the reasons for  his  claim
    formed a nexus with the Refugee Convention.  The SSHD accepted that the
    Applicant had been the subject of abuse  by  his  father  but  did  not
    accept the part of his account relating to debts his father owed.   The
    SSHD considered the Applicant had failed to approach the authorities in
    Albania and there was no reason that if he genuinely  had  a  fear  why
    they would be unable to provide a sufficiency of protection.   Further,
    the Applicant would be able to relocate in Albania.   The  SSHD  stated
    these conclusions had  been  reached  after  taking  into  account  the
    Applicant's best interests as a child under Section 55 of the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

 3. On 24 September 2015 the Applicant lodged  a  notice  of  appeal.   The
    grounds asserted he was a member of a  Particular  Social  Group  (PSG)
    namely, the child victims of abuse or domestic  violence  and  that  in
    Albania there was an insufficiency of protection for such persons.  The
    Applicant was an unaccompanied asylum-seeking minor and  the  SSHD  had
    failed to make efforts to trace his family beyond ascertaining that the
    family was registered as living in  Albania.   Further,  the  SSHD  had
    failed to consider the several factors relevant to showing  there  were
    compassionate circumstances so as to require  a  consideration  of  his
    claim by way of reference to Article 8 of the European Convention.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 4. By a decision promulgated on 16 March  2016  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Afako allowed the appeal on asylum and Article  8  grounds  on
    the basis that the SSHD  had  accepted  that  the  Applicant  "was  the
    subject of severe abuse at the hands of his father".   He  referred  to
    the background evidence and the  indifference  of  the  authorities  to
    victims of violence in the home.

 5. On 7 April 2016 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Parkes  granted  the
    SSHD permission to appeal finding that it was arguable  the  Judge  had
    erred by failing to consider why the Applicant was to be  considered  a
    member of a PSG and had mis-understood the SSHD's acceptance  that  the
    Applicant had "faced problems with your father in Albania":  see  para.
    25 of the SSHD's Reasons for Refusal Letter and had  experienced  abuse
    from his father in Albania: see para. 34.  However  the  SSHD  had  not
    accepted that the Appellant had suffered severe abuse.  The  permission
    grounds were  limited  to  whether  the  Applicant  had  suffered  ill-
    treatment amounting to persecution and the  issues  of  protection  and
    internal relocation.

 6. The Applicant lodged a response under Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 stating that the SSHD  had  not  challenged
    the Applicant's claim to have suffered abuse three or four times a week
    over a period of eighteen months.   The  SSHD  had  not  qualified  the
    nature of the abuse referred to in  the  concession  contained  in  the
    reasons letter.  The issue in this appeal was  not  whether  the  abuse
    suffered was sufficiently serious to amount to persecution, but whether
    there was a sufficiency of protection and whether the  Applicant  could
    be expected to relocate within Albania.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. The Applicant attended the hearing.   I  explained  the  purpose  of  a
    hearing  to  ascertain  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal's   decision
    contained a material error of law and  the  procedure  to  be  adopted.
    Other than to confirm his address,  he  took  no  active  part  in  the
    proceedings.

SSHD'S submissions

 8. Mrs Pettersen for the SSHD  accepted  that  the  permission  should  be
    considered as limited to a consideration of the  Judge's  treatment  of
    the SSHD's concession that the Applicant had been the victim  of  abuse
    and whether that abuse was capable of amounting  to  persecution.   The
    issue of relocation was not available because it had not been raised as
    a ground for appeal by the SSHD.  In this light I  suggested  that  the
    issues related only to asylum and/or humanitarian protection under  the
    Qualifying Directive but the permission did not extend to claims  under
    the European Convention.  Mr  Hoshi  stated  he  objected  but  without
    giving any reasons.  Mrs Pettersen submitted the Judge had  dealt  with
    the nature and extent of the concession made in relation to  the  abuse
    suffered by the Appellant at the hands of his father at  paragraphs  24
    and 25 of his decision.  The issue for consideration in  the  error  of
    law hearing was whether  this  treatment  was  sufficiently  severe  to
    amount to persecution so as to engage the Refugee Convention.

 9. She continued that the Applicant had been the victim of  abuse  at  the
    hands of his father but not for any Refugee Convention  reason.   There
    was no nexus between the harm he suffered and a Convention  reason;  if
    there was no nexus between the harm suffered and reason  for  it  being
    specified in the  Refugee  Convention,  then  the  Convention  was  not
    engaged.  The SSHD had difficulty in  understanding  of  what  PSG  the
    Applicant considered himself to be a member so as to enable  his  claim
    to engage the Refugee Convention.  It was accepted that the grounds for
    appeal had not complained of the Judge's treatment  of  the  issues  of
    sufficiency of protection or internal flight.



Applicant's submissions

10. Mr Hoshi for the Applicant submitted  the  appeal  grounds  raised  the
    following issues:-

      i) whether the Applicant's claim engaged a Refugee Convention reason;

     ii) whether it was reasonable for the Judge to consider that the SSHD's
         concession that the Applicant had suffered abuse at  the  hands  of
         his father justified the description of it as "severe"; and

    iii) whether whatever the abuse the Applicant may have suffered amounted
         to was sufficient to be considered persecution for the purposes  of
         the Refugee Convention.

11. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parkes had rejected the first issue as
    a ground for appeal.  The Judge's finding  that  the  Applicant  was  a
    member of a PSG had not been challenged.  There followed  a  discussion
    about the apparent gap between the SSHD's concession that the Appellant
    had suffered abuse and the Judge's finding  that  it  was  severe.   Mr
    Hoshi requested that he be allowed to continue his submissions on  this
    point even if he might later require further time to consider the issue
    whether the Appellant's claim showed a sufficient nexus with a  Refugee
    Convention reason.

12. He continued that from the outset the Applicant's claim  was  based  on
    his fear of mental and physical abuse at the hands of his  father.   He
    had referred to it when screened and when interviewed as well as in his
    first statement and the claim had been recorded at paragraphs 3 and 24-
    25 of the SSHD's reasons letter.  The SSHD had accepted this  and  gone
    on to refuse the Appellant's claim on the basis the  authorities  would
    be able to offer him a sufficiency of protection in Albania and, in the
    alternative, he would be able without undue  hardship  to  relocate  in
    Albania.  In  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  SSHD  had  confirmed  the
    concession that the Applicant had suffered  abuse.   He  had  not  been
    cross-examined on the nature and extent of the abuse he  had  suffered.
    I noted that this was not  inconsistent  with  the  Judge's  Record  of
    Proceedings.

13. The SSHD had never  submitted  that  the  violence  the  Applicant  had
    suffered at the hands of his father was not  sufficient  to  cross  the
    threshold of harm amounting to persecution.  At paragraphs 24 and 26 of
    his decision the Judge had accurately set out the evidential and  legal
    position.  Further, the SSHD  had  never  suggested  that  the  minimum
    threshold had not been crossed.  The skeleton argument before the Judge
    at paragraphs 14 and 15 addressed  the  law  on  this  issue.   If  the
    threshold of persecution had been crossed it was to be noted  that  the
    SSHD had already accepted internal  relocation  was  not  possible  and
    there was not a sufficiency of protection available to the Applicant.





Response for the SSHD

14. Mrs Pettersen referred to paragraph  18  of  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter which had noted that  the  Applicant's  claim  did  not  have  a
    sufficient nexus with the Refugee Convention.  She accepted it made  no
    reference to humanitarian protection under the Qualification Directive.
     She continued that even if the abuse suffered  by  the  Appellant  did
    cross the threshold so as to amount to persecution  he  had  not  shown
    that it was persecution for a Refugee Convention reason.  The  decision
    therefore contained errors of law and should be set  aside.   Mr  Hoshi
    repeated his earlier request that if the nexus between the  Applicant's
    claim and the Refugee Convention was an issue then  he  would  wish  to
    make written submissions.

Consideration and Conclusions

15. The statement which the Applicant  submitted  with  his  self-completed
    Statement of Evidence Form dated 29 April 2015, some  two  and  a  half
    months  before  his  interview,  attributes  the  abuse  the  Applicant
    suffered at the hands of his father to his father developing a drinking
    habit: see paragraphs 9-15.   The  Judge  noted  the  submissions  made
    before him for the SSHD accepted that the abuse was consequent upon the
    Applicant's father's  excessive  drinking.   At  paragraph  39  of  his
    decision the Judge rejected the Applicant's claim to have been  pursued
    by masked men whom he claimed represented his father's creditors.

16. The Applicant's evidence is that his father slapped him  and  beat  him
    and sometimes would punch him in the stomach.  This is set out  in  his
    statement forming part of his self-completed Statement of Evidence Form
    and at interview replies 57 and 66-67.

17. The Applicant's evidence at the hearing was that  his  father  used  to
    drink and would beat him, but that he became increasingly violent  when
    he started drinking more on account of his  debt  problems.   The  SSHD
    accepted that matters had  deteriorated  when  the  Applicant's  father
    drank excessively, but there was  no  exploration  at  the  hearing  or
    supporting  evidence  about  the  extent  of  the  beatings  which  the
    Applicant stated he suffered at the hands of his father.  The SSHD  set
    out her position at paragraphs 24 and 25 of the reasons letter.

18. The Judge did not sufficiently address the nature  and  extent  of  the
    abuse claimed by the Applicant because at paragraph 26 of his  decision
    he mis-construed the SSHD's position. It might be said  that  the  SSHD
    could have framed whatever concession was being made in  clearer  terms
    but I find from the thrust and tenor of the SSHD's reasons letter  that
    the  term  "abuse"  was  not  intended  to  mean  abuse  amounting   to
    persecution or similar  ill-treatment.  Paragraph  29  of  the  Judge's
    decision does not engage directly with the specific parts of section  4
    of Dr  Young's  report  dealing  with  domestic  violence.   Given  the
    rejection of a substantial element of the Applicant's account, a fuller
    engagement with the background evidence was necessary  to  support  the
    Judge's conclusions that the Applicant had  been  subjected  to  severe
    abuse sufficient to amount to persecution.  This amounted to  an  error
    of law sufficiently material to require the decision to be set aside in
    its entirety.  It is therefore unnecessary for  the  purposes  of  this
    decision to decide the Refugee Convention nexus point although it  will
    doubtless feature in any hearing afresh.

19. The appeal will need to be heard afresh  in  all  respects  which  will
    require an extensive fact-finding exercise. Therefore, having regard to
    Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and
    paragraph 7.2 of  the  Practice  Statement  of  10  February  2010  (as
    amended) I direct  that  the  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for hearing afresh before a Judge other than Judge Afako.

Anonymity

20. The matter of anonymity was not addressed at the hearing before me  and
    in the circumstances because this case involves a minor and  his  claim
    is based on his home circumstances I make  an  anonymity  order.   This
    will need to be re-visited by the First-tier Tribunal when  the  appeal
    is heard afresh.

The Remitted Hearing

21. In addition to making findings  on  all  relevant  facts,  the  hearing
    afresh will likely need to  include  a  consideration  of  whether  the
    Applicant's circumstances as found engage and have  a  nexus  with  the
    Refugee Convention  or  the  Qualification  Directive.   If  the  claim
    proceeds to a consideration  of  Articles  3  and  8  of  the  European
    Convention the Judge will need to take into account the  best  interest
    of the Applicant as  a  child  and  so  far  as  may  be  relevant  the
    provisions of Part VA of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 as amended.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law such that it should be set aside.  The appeal is  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
