Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  6th  December
       1987.  He appeals with permission  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  (Judge  Pickup)  to  dismiss   his   appeal   against   the
       Respondent's decision to refuse to issue him with  a  residence  card
       confirming his right of residence as an extended family member of  an
       EEA national exercising treaty rights[1].


    2. The basis of the Appellant's case was that he is dependent  upon  his
       aunt, Mrs Rubina Shaheen. Ms Shaheen is an Italian national living in
       the UK. The Appellant has been receiving  treatment  in  the  UK  for
       Hodgkins Lymphoma and heart failure: in this regard he further relies
       on Regulation 8(3) to claim that he is strictly dependent on his aunt
       for personal care.  His  illnesses  also  founded  the  basis  for  a
       submission that his removal from the UK would be  a  disproportionate
       interference with his Article 8 rights and a breach of Article 3.


    3. The First-tier Tribunal first considered the Appellant's  case  under
       the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ('the
       Regs').    The Tribunal correctly referred itself to the decision  in
       Dauhoo (EEA Regs 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (IAC). That case clarifies  the
       requirements for an applicant claiming a right  of  residence  as  an
       extended family member.  The  headnote  to  that  decision  reads  as
       follows:


           Under the scheme set  out  in  reg  8  (2)  of  the  Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, a person can  succeed
           in establishing that he or she is an  "extended  family  member"
           in any one of  four  different  ways,  each  of  which  requires
           proving a relevant connection both prior to arrival  in  the  UK
           and in the UK:


                 i. prior dependency and present dependency
                ii. prior membership of a household and  present  membership
                    of a household
               iii. prior dependency and present membership of a household;
                iv. prior membership of a household and present dependency.


           It is not  necessary,  therefore,  to  show  prior  and  present
           connection in the same capacity: i.e. dependency- dependency  or
           household membership-household membership ((i) or (ii) above). A
           person may also qualify if able to show (iii) or (iv).


    4. Following that framework the Appellant relied on (ii) and (iv): prior
       membership of a household and present membership of a household  plus
       present dependency.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
       demonstrate that he was currently dependent upon his aunt.  That  was
       because he had been living with his elder brother  since  2007,  even
       when he was briefly  married  to  a  Czech  national.   The  evidence
       indicated that if anyone, it was his brother who was  supporting  him
       financially rather than his aunt. There was evidence that his brother
       was no longer able to offer such support, and so they had all  become
       reliant on the financial support of Ms Shaheen; Judge Pickup rejected
       this evidence as "contrived" and did not accept that  they  lived  on
       her contribution of ï¿½100 per month.  Nor was  it  accepted  that  the
       Appellant is currently living in "her household".  She lives  in  the
       same house, but this is the home of the Appellant's brother  who  has
       been supporting him since he arrived in the UK in  2007.  As  to  the
       situation before the Appellant left Pakistan, Judge  Pickup  did  not
       accept that the Appellant had there been part of her  household.  The
       evidence was that the Appellant,  his  sister,  his  parents  and  Ms
       Shaheen had all lived in a 'joint family system' in a house owned  by
       his grandfather. That house had, at some point, been transferred into
       Ms Shaheen's name, on the basis that she was not  married,   but  the
       period in which she might be said to have become the nominal head  of
       the household by virtue of that ownership predated her  migration  to
       Italy and acquisition of Italian nationality. Applying  Moneke  (EEA-
       OFM) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  held  that  the
       Appellant cannot rely on membership of the same household prior to Ms
       Shaheen becoming an EEA national.  In respect of Regulation 8(3)  the
       Tribunal found there to be insufficient evidence to support a finding
       that the Appellant strictly required his aunt's  care:  he  is  fully
       mobile, his cancer is now in  remission  and  he  attends  occasional
       outpatient appointments.


    6. As for human rights the medical evidence did not  support  a  finding
       that that the Appellant's removal would violate Article 3.    At  the
       hearing the Tribunal indicated that if the Appellant wished  to  rely
       on Article 8 consideration would have to be given to  s117A-s117D  of
       the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  There  was  no
       removal decision; if the Appellant wished to make an  application  on
       Article 8 grounds he could do so. Given that  indication  Mr  Timson,
       who appeared for the Appellant, made no submissions.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on all grounds.


    8. The Appellant's initial application  for  permission  to  appeal  was
       refused but was granted upon renewed application  by  Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Warr.  The  Appellant  was  granted  permission  to  argue  the
       following points:


        i) The finding that the  evidence  of  the  family  as  to  present
           dependency was "contrived" was not supported  by  reasoning  and
           there was a failure to take evidence into account;


       ii) The finding that the Appellant and his aunt were not members  of
           the same "household" (in both  Pakistan  and  the  UK)  was  not
           supported by reasoning, particularly since it was accepted  that
           they did live in the same house.




       No Error of Law


    9. Under Reg 8(2) the Appellant must show  that  two  of  four  possible
       means of qualification apply to him.


   10. I deal with the UK first. It was the Appellant's case that  he  is  a
       member of the same household as his aunt in the UK  and  that  he  is
       dependent upon her. Judge Pickup heard evidence  that  the  Appellant
       came to the UK in 2007 as a student. He then made  an  EEA  residence
       card application to be able to reside with a Czech national  whom  he
       had married. This application was unsuccessful, as was  a  subsequent
       one on the same basis, and by December 2012, a  little  over  a  year
       after that initial application, he withdrew  his  appeal.  Throughout
       that entire period he lived with his brother. His aunt did  not  come
       to the UK until October 2013. She moved in to the  same  house  where
       the Appellant had been living all along  with  his  brother  and  his
       family.  It was on this basis that Judge Pickup found  the  Appellant
       to be part of his brother's household rather than that  of  his  aunt
       (see para 30). The grounds suggest that there was no legal basis  for
       that distinction and that the mere fact of living under the same roof
       is  sufficient.   The  grounds  contain   no   authority   for   that
       proposition, which is contrary to the plain wording of the Directive:
           2.    Without prejudice to any right to free movement and
           residence the persons concerned may have in their own right, the
           host Member State shall, in accordance with its national
           legislation, facilitate entry and residence for the following
           persons:
                (a)    any other family members, irrespective of their
                nationality, not falling under the definition in point 2 of
                Article 2 who, in the country from which they have come, are
                dependants or members of the household of the Union citizen
                having the primary right of residence, or where serious
                health grounds strictly require the personal care of the
                family member by the Union citizen;
       As well as the Regulations:


           8.  - (1)   In these Regulations "extended family member"  means
                a person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
                regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  the
                conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).


            (2)  A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
                person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his
                civil partner and-


                 a) the person is residing in an EEA State in which the EEA
                    national also resides and is dependent upon the EEA
                    national or is a member of his household;
                 b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and
                    is accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom
                    or wishes to join him there; or
                 c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has
                    joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and
                    continues to be dependent upon him or to be a member of
                    his household.


   11. The determination itself refers to KG (Sri Lanka) [2008] EWCA Civ  13
       and Bigia & Ors [2009] EWCA Civ 79, both of which reflect those plain
       words - the household must be that of the EEA national.   I find that
       the First-tier Tribunal was entitled, on the evidence before  it,  to
       conclude that the Appellant was in fact a  member  of  his  brother's
       household. The fact that his aunt had latterly moved  into  the  same
       house did not make it "her household".


   12. As for present dependency, reasons are given for why the evidence was
       found  to  be  "contrived".    The  Appellant's  case  was  that  his
       dependency upon his brother had ceased because his brother's business
       had gone "down and down" and  had  eventually  closed.   The  grounds
       complain that the Tribunal failed to mention documentary evidence  to
       the effect that the business had in  fact  closed  down.    There  is
       nothing in this, since the determination does  not  appear  to  doubt
       that it did close down: the point is that  Judge  Pickup  finds  that
       entire situation to have been contrived for the purpose of supporting
       the Appellant's claim to be dependent upon his aunt. The evidence  of
       the witnesses on this matter was "not entirely credible" and that  of
       the brother in particular was found to be "vague  and  inconsistent".
       It was not accepted that Ms Shaheen's ï¿½100 per month contribution  to
       the household budget of was in reality supporting the  Appellant.   I
       can find no error in the reasoning in respect of the position in  the
       UK.


   13. As to the question  of  "household"  in  Pakistan  the  determination
       contains the following finding: "Until October  2013  he  last  lived
       with his aunt when she was part of a larger joint  family  system  in
       Pakistan in 1999, when the appellant was no more than 12 years of age
       and part of his parental family with his sister".   It  was  on  that
       factual basis that the Tribunal determined that the Appellant was not
       part of his aunt's household in Pakistan. The fact that at some point
       she inherited the title to the property did not make her the head  of
       that household.  More importantly  the  Tribunal  finds  against  the
       Appellant on the ground that it is quite plain that at the time  that
       the Appellant was living in that house - owned by his aunt - she  was
       not an EEA national.  He left  Pakistan  in  2007  and  the  evidence
       before the Tribunal suggested that she did not become an EEA national
       until 2013. There is no error of law in respect of these findings.


   14. The written grounds raise no issue as to the findings on Reg 8(3) but
       in his oral submissions Mr Timson nevertheless dealt with this aspect
       of the determination. Mr Timson submits that no reasons are given for
       the conclusion that the  Appellant  does  not  strictly  require  his
       aunt's assistance for his personal care.  Reasons are  given.  It  is
       found that although the Appellant has obviously been extremely unwell
       in the past, he is now in remission and doesn't require any help with
       anything apart from perhaps a lift to  his  outpatient  appointments.
       There was no credible medical evidence to  show  that  the  Appellant
       needed any personal care.  The brother's evidence that  he  "did  not
       have time" to give the Appellant a lift to the hospital  even  though
       he was unemployed was very fairly dismissed as "not credible".


       Decisions


   15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law
       and it is upheld.
