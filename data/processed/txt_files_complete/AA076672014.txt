Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Eaton, instructed by Brighton Housing Trust
For the respondent:    Ms E Sage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, AFG, with notional date of birth of 1.1.00, is a citizen
    of Afghanistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Webb promulgated 2.2.15, dismissing on all grounds his  appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 11.9.14,  to  refuse  his
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 5.12.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  White  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. The appellant did not attend the appeal hearing. At the  conclusion  of
    the submissions of the parties I reserved my decision on error of  law,
    which I now give.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant claims that he lived in Ghazni Province with his parents  and
    4 younger siblings. He attended the local mosque for  Islamic  studies.
    When his old Qari (religious teacher) left he began studying with a new
    Qari, who told him that he  would,  or  would  like  to,  take  him  to
    Pakistan. When he recounted this to his family, his  father  was  angry
    and went out, the appellant presuming that he intended  to  speak  with
    the Qari. His father was murdered. As his mother  feared  he  would  be
    taken to Pakistan or otherwise harmed, it was decided to send  him  out
    of the country. He claims to have arrived in the UK in April 2014.  His
    asylum claim was made on 30.4.14.

 7. The Secretary of State's  decision  refused  his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims. However, as the appellant was  just
    14 years of age, he qualified for  discretionary  leave  as  an  asylum
    seeking child until he turned 17.5 years on 1.7.17, but  the  Secretary
    of State would not seek to remove him until contact had been made  with
    his family, or until he turned 18 on 1.1.18.

 8. Following detailed and careful assessment of  the  appellant's  various
    accounts, Judge  Webb  rejected  the  appellant's  core  claim  as  not
    credible and thus found he had  failed  to  demonstrate  to  the  lower
    standard of proof that he faced a real risk of  persecution  on  return
    for a Convention reason, or that there was a real risk of serious  harm
    on return. Article 8 ECHR, whilst addressed in the Secretary of State's
    refusal decision, does not appear to have been pursued  at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal appeal hearing and no decision was made in respect of the
    same. Neither is article 8 addressed in the grounds of application  for
    permission to appeal and thus there is no material error of law in  not
    addressing article 8.

 9. The grounds assert:

      a) That the judge did not adopt the correct approach in assessing  the
         evidenced of an unaccompanied minor and placed undue weight on what
         are contended to be minor  or  non-existent  discrepancies  in  the
         evidence, failed to consider concerns raised about the  conduct  of
         the asylum interview;

      b) Failed to consider the expert  evidence  of  Dr  A  Guistozzi  when
         assessing the appellant's credibility;

      c) That having accepted that the Secretary of State  failed  to  carry
         out her tracing duties, the judge failed to  consider  whether  the
         appellant would be (in theory) returned to Afghanistan as  a  minor
         without family support;

      d) Failed to properly consider the risk of returning an  unaccompanied
         minor to Afghanistan in a situation of internal armed conflict.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge White  considered  it  arguable
    that the judge had not given due allowance  for  the  appellant's  age;
    failed to properly engage with the expert report; and that insufficient
    consideration was given to the (hypothetical)  risk  of  returning  the
    appellant to Afghanistan as an  unaccompanied  minor  without  adequate
    reception facilities.

11. The Rule  24  response  submits  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    directed himself appropriately. "The Immigration  Judge  has  noted  at
    paragraph 23 the advice of the UNHCR on interviewing minors  and  there
    is no indication that the Immigration Judge has not paid heed  to  this
    advice in the  determination.  Further  at  paragraph  26  onwards  the
    Immigration Judge has given an extensive recital of the  questions  and
    answers of the appellant and has at paragraph 27  highlighted  some  of
    the more important inconsistencies. He  records  at  paragraph  31  the
    complaint from the  appellant's  solicitors  concerning  the  interview
    record and comes to a conclusion open to him at paragraph  33  that  he
    simply does not believe the core account given. Further the Immigration
    Judge is required to make a  finding  on  the  expert  evidence  of  Dr
    Giustozzi and it is submitted that the finding he has made at paragraph
    25 is entirely open to him. It is submitted that there is  no  material
    error in the determination."

Error of Law

12. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was no material  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as
    to require the determination of Judge Webb to be set aside.

13. My attention has been drawn to KS (benefit of the  doubt)  [2014]  UKUT
    552 (IAC),  where  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  in  assessing  the
    credibility of an asylum claim, the benefit of the doubt  as  discussed
    in the UNHCR Handbook is not to be regarded as a rule of law, but is  a
    general guideline. The benefit of the doubt adds nothing  of  substance
    to the lower standard of proof. The UNHCR Handbook proposition that  in
    assessing the evidence of a minor  there  may  need  to  be  a  liberal
    application of the benefit of the doubt is also not to be regarded as a
    rule of law, or statement of universal application and adds nothing  of
    substance to the lower standard of proof.

14. The appellant left Afghanistan when he was only 13 and was aged  14  at
    the date of the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. At  �23  the  judge
    took KS into account and it is clear from reading  the  decision  as  a
    whole that the judge very much had the appellant's  young  age  at  the
    forefront of his mind when considering the factual credibility  of  his
    claim. It is mentioned at �1, �9, �13, �23, �24, and �33. For  example,
    the judge took care to remind the representatives to be  sensitive  and
    aware of the appellant's age and to ensure that questions were  phrased
    appropriately, in simple terms. The judge also acknowledged Mr  Eaton's
    submissions that a liberal approach should be taken to the  benefit  of
    the doubt in assessing the  appellant's  evidence.  At  �33  the  judge
    stated that, "The fact that the appellant was only a young teenager  at
    the date he states the  relevant  events  occurred  in  Afghanistan  is
    obviously  something  that  must  be  considered  when  assessing   the
    credibility  of  his  account."  However,  the  standard  of  proof  in
    demonstration his factual claim remains the lower  standard  of  proof.
    Despite making allowances for the appellant's  age  and  maturity,  the
    judge concluded at �33 that he had not established his core account  to
    that lower standard. The judge is entitled to reach such  a  conclusion
    notwithstanding the appellant's youth. Frankly,  his  account  was  not
    believed and the judge concluded that the submission  that  he  was  at
    risk from the Taliban was no more than speculative. I find no error  of
    law in respect of this issue.  It  cannot  be  said  that  the  judge's
    findings were perverse or irrational.

15. Related to this ground is the complaint that in making the  credibility
    findings the judge relied on so-called discrepancies which were "by and
    large not significant" according to Mr Eaton, and  that  some  of  them
    were mistakes of fact. It is further submitted that far too much weight
    was put on the discrepancies. With respect to Mr Eaton the question  of
    weight to be placed on the evidence is a matter for the judge.  I  note
    that whilst the judge  has  very  carefully  set  out  the  appellant's
    different accounts, extending to some 10 pages  of  the  decision,  the
    judge did not rely on all of those matters but at �27 stated, "I  shall
    now highlight the matters I believe are of particular  relevance,"  and
    proceeded to identify those matters between �27 and  �32,  taking  into
    account  at  �31  and  �32  the  complaint  made  by  the   appellant's
    representative,  expressing  concern  at  the  conduct  of  the  asylum
    interview. As a result of  that  concern,  the  judge  paid  particular
    attention to the substantive asylum interview record. On analysis,  the
    judge was not satisfied that the complaint was made out and found  that
    it did not, in any  event,  address  the  inconsistencies  between  the
    interview and other statements of the  appellant,  and  could  not,  of
    course, address the further inconsistencies  identified  by  the  judge
    from the oral evidence at the appeal hearing.

16. I have carefully considered the matters relied on by Mr  Eaton  in  his
    submissions, as well as the grounds  of  appeal,  but  find  that  this
    ground is no more than a disagreement with the findings  of  the  judge
    and does not disclose any material  error  of  law.  The  findings  and
    conclusions therefrom were entirely open to the judge on  the  evidence
    and for which he has provided cogent reasoning. The submissions  of  Mr
    Eaton  are  in  effect  that  because  of  his  youth  the  appellant's
    unsupported account should have been accepted in its entirety,  despite
    the vagueness and inconsistencies with the core claim. That  is  not  a
    correct  view  of  the  Tribunal's   task.   Despite   giving   careful
    consideration to his youth, the appellant still has to meet  the  lower
    standard of proof. It was clearly open to the  judge  to  consider  the
    criticisms of the interview process, look into the interview record and
    make his own conclusions. In the circumstances, there is  no  error  of
    law in this regard.

17. Mr Eaton also complained that the judge failed to properly engage  with
    the expert report of Dr Guistozzi. Frankly, the expert and professional
    opinion of Dr Guistozzi is rather undermined by a  series  of  somewhat
    astonishing  pure  speculations  as  to  what  may  have  happened   in
    Afghanistan, as the judge analysed at �25 of the decision. For example,
    suggesting that the father may have been in  an  altercation  with  the
    Qari over money, or pressure put on the family, and that Qari have  may
    reacted violently. Or that the Qari is  likely  to  have  reported  the
    killing  of  the  appellant's  father  as  a  execution  of  a  spy  or
    collaborator.  There  is  absolutely  no  factual   basis   for   these
    speculations and they only serve to undermine  the  credibility  of  Dr
    Giustozzi as an objective and impartial expert. I am satisfied that  an
    expert properly applying himself to his professional duties  would  not
    have promoted such speculation in a so-called expert  report.  However,
    it is clear from reading the decision as a whole that the judge did not
    ignore the expert report. For example,  at  �24  the  judge  noted  the
    expert's evidence that the Taliban do not practice forced  recruitment,
    but that some children are taken from villages for  religious  training
    against the wishes of the family. The judge expresses the view  at  �24
    that more evidence from the  expert  on  this  issue  would  have  been
    helpful. It is thus clear that the report was not dismissed  wholesale.
    In the circumstances, I find no error of law in the judge's  engagement
    with the expert report. The conclusions in respect of the  report  were
    entirely open to the judge.

18. Finally, Mr Eaton complains that, putting aside  the  claimed  specific
    risk to the appellant, the judge failed to address the general risk for
    a 14 year old youth, returning to Afghanistan. The judge noted that the
    particular vulnerability of unaccompanied minor children led to special
    provisions in handling their cases. At �22 the  judge  noted  from  the
    case authorities that a failure to discharge the tracing  duty  may  be
    relevant  to  judicial  consideration  of  an  asylum  or  humanitarian
    protection  claim,  but  that  such  consideration  is  fact  specific,
    requiring the appellant to provide a credible  account.  "When  one  is
    considering asylum or humanitarian protection the burden of proof  lies
    on an appellant not just to establish the failure by the respondent  to
    discharge the duty  to  endeavour  to  trace  but  also  that  he  (the
    appellant) is entitled to what he is seeking." At �35 the  judge  noted
    that the appellant's family had not yet been traced and so there was no
    evidence that he would be able to be met by family at Kabul Airport  on
    return to Afghanistan. However, the judge found in the  same  paragraph
    that the appellant has relatives in Afghanistan, including a parent who
    arranged or financed his  departure  and  a  paternal  uncle  in  Kabul
    itself. The judge took these matters into account but  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to discharge the burden on him to demonstrate that
    he is at risk of persecution or serious harm on return. His account was
    not accepted at all, which would include his claim  as  to  his  family
    circumstances and that his father was murdered. The appellant  did  not
    therefore demonstrate that  he  would  be  without  family  support  on
    return. In the circumstances, it was for the appellant  to  demonstrate
    that his family would not be able  to  meet  him  on  return  to  Kabul
    Airport.

19. In assessing this issue, the judge had  regard  to  AK  (Article  15(c)
    Afghanistan CG  [2012]  UKUT  163  (IAC),  noting  that  the  level  of
    indiscriminate violence, including in  the  appellant's  home  area  in
    Ghazi Province, is not at such a level as  to  mean  that  a  civilian,
    solely by being present, faces a real risk which threatens his life  or
    person. However, the judge also recognised the continued  applicability
    of AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 0016  (IAC),  to
    the   effect   that   when    considering    whether    children    are
    disproportionately affected by the consequences of the  armed  conflict
    in Afghanistan, a distinction should be drawn between  children  living
    with a family in  Afghanistan  and  those  who  are  not.  'Unattached'
    children returned to Afghanistan face a real risk of serious harm  from
    indiscriminate violence, forced recruitment, etc.

20. In HK and others (minors - indiscriminate violence - forced recruitment
    by Taliban - contact with family members) Afghanistan  CG  [2010]  UKUT
    378 (IAC) the Tribunal had said amongst other things that where a child
    has close relatives in Afghanistan who have assisted him in leaving the
    country, any assertion that such family members  are  uncontactable  or
    are unable to meet the child in Kabul  and  care  for  him  on  return,
    should be supported by credible evidence of efforts  to  contact  those
    family members and their inability to meet and care for  the  child  in
    the event of return.

21. Ms Sage also drew the Tribunal's attention to EU  (Afghanistan)  [2013]
    EWCA Cic 32, a case on similar facts to  the  present,  where  the  two
    appellants were in the UK as unaccompanied  minors,  aged  15  and  16,
    whose asylum claims were refused but  who  were  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain  until  the  age  of  17�.  The  appellants  failed  to
    establish a need for international  protection  or  an  entitlement  to
    asylum, but relied on the  Secretary  of  State's  breach  of  duty  to
    endeavour to trace their  respective  families.  The  Court  of  Appeal
    applied the principles  of  KA,  accepting  that  the  failure  may  be
    relevant to the assessment of risk on return.

22. Sir Stanley Burnton stated at �6 that, "Of course, breaches of the duty
    of Secretary of State in addressing a claim may lead to an  independent
    justification for leave to remain, of which the paradigm is the Article
    8 claim of an asylum seeker whose  claim  has  not  been  expeditiously
    determined, with the result that he has been in this country so long as
    to have established private and family life here. But to grant leave to
    remain to someone who has no risk on return,  whose  Convention  rights
    will not be infringed by his return, and who has no  other  independent
    claim to remain here (such as a claim to be a skilled migrant),  is  to
    use the power to grant leave to remain for a purpose  other  than  that
    which it is conferred. In effect, it is to accede to a claim to  remain
    here as an economic migrant. The principle in Rashid has been  referred
    to as 'the protective principle,' but this is a  misnomer:  the  person
    seeking to rely on this principle needs to do so only  because  he  has
    been found not to be in need of protection. I do  not  think  that  the
    Court should require or encourage the Secretary of State to grant leave
    in such circumstances either in order to mark the  Court's  displeasure
    at her conduction, or as a sanction for her  misconduct."  However,  it
    was accepted that the breach of duty may be relevant to the  assessment
    of risk on return and the Tribunal should take into account the lack of
    evidence from  the  Secretary  of  State  as  to  the  availability  or
    otherwise of familial support.

23. The Court of Appeal also  considered  as  a  point  of  substance  that
    submission of the Secretary of State that  unaccompanied  children  who
    arrive in the UK have done so as a result of someone, presumably  their
    families, paying for their fare or an agent to arrange their journey to
    the UK. They are unlikely in the circumstances to be happy to cooperate
    with an agent of the Secretary of State for the return of  their  child
    to Afghanistan, which would mean the waste of their investment  in  the
    child's journey to the UK.

24. On the particular facts of the appellant EU, the Court of Appeal  noted
    that the tribunal had dismissed his  appeals,  finding  his  account  a
    fabrication designed to gain him  access  to  the  UK.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge found that no reliance could be placed on his claim  not
    to be in touch with his family. He had an aunt who lived in  Kabul  and
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge found it was a matter  for  him  and  his
    family whether he remained in Kabul or returned to his village, but  it
    was not unreasonable to expect him to relocate to Kabul. The  Court  of
    Appeal found that the findings  of  fact  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    included rejection of the assertion that he was not in touch  with  his
    family and it thus followed that there was no link between  the  breach
    of tracing duty by the Secretary of State and EU's claim to  remain  in
    the UK. His case was unmeritorious.

25. Similarly, in the case of SU, the Tribunal did not accept that  he  had
    lost contact with his family. The Court of Appeal did not  accept  that
    the corrective principle should be applied given the rejection  of  his
    claim. The appeals of each appellant were dismissed.

26. It follows from the above, that on the factual findings  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Webb, the appellant is not entitled to  the  application
    of the 'corrective principle' just because the Secretary of  State  had
    not traced the appellant's family. The judge was entitled to  conclude,
    for the reasons stated, that the appellant had failed to demonstrate  a
    risk on return, either in  relation  to  his  specific  claim,  or  the
    general risk on return of a minor.

Conclusions:

27. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to  rule
45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity direction.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
