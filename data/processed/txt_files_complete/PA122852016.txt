For the Respondent:       Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iran  born  in  1965.  He  appeals  with
    permission the 28th April 2018  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  GRJ
    Robson to dismiss his protection appeal.


    Anonymity Order


 2. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

          "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    The Appeal Before the First-tier Tribunal


 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim for international protection is that
    he is a former Muslim who has now converted to Christianity and as such
    would face a real risk of persecution in his home country  for  reasons
    of his religious belief.


 4. The Respondent  did  not  believe  him,  and  nor  did  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


 5. The primary reason for doubting the Appellant's claims to have "started
    his faith journey" to Christianity as early as 2007 was that he  failed
    to mention any of that during the course of a fresh claim for asylum in
    2011. He had in particular failed to make any mention of his new  faith
    at a hearing in March 2012 before First-tier Tribunal Judge Upson.  The
    Appellant had not told  the  Home  Office  that  he  had  converted  to
    Christianity until 2015 and when he  did  he  had  given  contradictory
    evidence about whether he had been evangelising or whether he kept  his
    faith private.


 6. A number of ordained ministers had written letters in  support  of  the
    Appellant's claim.  Reverend  Rutherford  of  King's  Cross  Church  in
    Hexthorpe wrote to confirm that the Appellant had been attending church
    every Sunday, and bible study  groups  on  Thursdays.    Reverend  Omid
    Moludy, Minister in charge of the Persian study group at  King's  Cross
    Methodist Church said that he had met the Appellant in May 2013 when he
    started attending bible study groups. Of  these  letters  the  Tribunal
    said this [at �62]:

         "Regrettably, neither of these  gentlemen  was  present  to  enable
         cross examination to take place and go into more detail  about  the
         depth of study and understanding of the Appellant of his  Christian
         faith"

 7. Further evidence came from a Reverend Edwards of a Methodist Church  in
    Rotherham, dated 19th June 2015. He stated that the Appellant had  been
    attending his church between 2012 and 2013, including participation  in
    the Iranian Christian Fellowship study  sessions.   He  had  undertaken
    study on the 'Alpha Course', but because he was moved to  Doncaster  he
    could not complete it. Of this letter the Tribunal concluded [at �63]:

         "I find that that letter is lacking in detail as to the  nature  of
         the practising of the Appellant's faith and again, is not supported
         by the presence of the actual Minister in question".

 8. The Tribunal went on to attach minimal weight to a letter from Reverend
    Philip Ireson of the Christs Church, Pitsmoor, Sheffield:  this  letter
    had simply confirmed that the Appellant volunteered  and  helped  cook.
    Sheffield Community Church had written to confirm that he had  attended
    one event. St Thomas' Church in Philadelphia, Sheffield had  "endorsed"
    the view of one of the Farsi prayer leaders, a  man  named  Karim,  who
    said "I am satisfied as far as I can be  that  he  is  genuine  in  his
    faith".  Since Karim himself had given no direct evidence, the Tribunal
    found that very little weight could be attached to that letter.


 9. In sum the Tribunal was not prepared to attach any  significant  weight
    to any of the six letters  written  in  support  because  none  of  the
    authors attended court in person. It was further significant that there
    was no evidence from the vicar of  the  Appellant's  current  place  of
    worship, a church in Dewsbury. It was said that  this  vicar  was  "too
    busy" to attend. The Tribunal concluded [at �69]: "I  have  taken  into
    account the decision in Dorodian. The absence of a vicar  does  detract
    from the weight to be put on the evidence prepared otherwise". Although
    it was accepted that the Appellant had undergone "some form of baptism"
    it was not accepted that he was a genuine convert to Christianity.


10. Turning to assess risk the Tribunal referred itself to the guidance  in
    SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran  CG  [2016]  00308
    (IAC). Finding that the Appellant is nothing more than a failed  asylum
    seeker the protection appeal is dismissed.


11. Although there is no discrete challenge to this part of its decision, I
    note for the sake of completeness that the Tribunal went on to consider
    Article 8 and to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.




    The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal


12. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the First-
    tier Tribunal:

          i) Gave inadequate reasons for its findings;


         ii) Failed to have regard to material evidence;


        iii) Made a material legal misdirection.

13.  The composite complaint made by grounds  (i)  and  (ii)  is  that  the
    Tribunal erred in its approach to the Appellant's  claimed  conversion.
    It is submitted that  the  determination  does  not  give  intelligible
    reasons for disbelieving the Appellant's evidence  and  fails  to  make
    clear whether the evidence of the six Dorodian witnesses  was  accepted
    (in respect of his church attendance). In  the  absence  of  reason  to
    reject that evidence, it is submitted that the  burden  of  proof  must
    have been discharged. As to (iii) it is  submitted  that  the  Tribunal
    failed to have regard to the evidence in SSH about what  is  likely  to
    happen to an individual such as the Appellant upon return to Iran. That
    evidence, read in line with the principles set out in HJ (Iran) and  HT
    (Cameroon) [2011] UKSC 596 establishes a real likelihood of risk.


    Discussion and Findings


14. I granted permission in this case. By my decision of 25th October  2017
    I pointed out that if the  witnesses  failed  to  attend  court  it  is
    arguable  that  they  are  not  Dorodian  witnesses  at  all.   I   was
    nevertheless  prepared  to  grant  permission.  Ground  (iii)  was   in
    particular arguable,  since  the  Tribunal  does  not  appear  to  have
    considered whether the fact of the Appellant's baptism or attendance at
    church would in itself place him at risk, regardless of whether he  was
    'genuinely' a Christian.


    Grounds (i) and (ii)


15. As I note above, the grounds as originally drafted  (by  counsel  other
    than Mr Greer) had submitted that the error in  approach  was  to  have
    declined to place weight on, or to have failed to make findings on, the
    evidence of  the  six  Christian  ministers  who  had  written  in  the
    Appellant's support.


16. In granting permission I observed that  the  Tribunal  must  have  been
    rationally entitled to place limited weight on the  evidence  of  these
    witnesses in view of the fact that they had not attended  court  to  be
    cross examined. Basic principles of evidence make it so,  but  in  this
    case the  very  guidance  upon  which  the  Appellant  placed  reliance
    expressly stipulates that such witnesses  should  attend  the  hearing.
    The guidelines in Dorodian (01/TH/01537) are:

          a) no-one should be regarded as a committed Christian who is  not
             vouched for as such by a minister of some  church  established
             in this country: as we have said,  it  is  church  membership,
             rather than mere belief, which may lead to risk;


          b) no adjudicator should again be put in the position faced by Mr
             Poole in this case: a statement or  letter,  giving  the  full
             designation of the minister, should be sent to the Home Office
             at least a fortnight before the hearing of any  appeal,  which
             should give them time for  at  least  a  basic  check  on  his
             existence and standing;


          c) unless the Home  Office  have  accepted  the  appellant  as  a
             committed church member in writing in advance of the  hearing,
             the minister should invariably be called to give oral evidence
             before the adjudicator: while witness summonses are available,
             adjudicators may reasonably expect willingness to do so  in  a
             genuine case;


          d) if any doubt remains, there is no  objection  to  adjudicators
             themselves testing the religious knowledge of  the  appellant:
             judicial notice may be taken of the main beliefs  and  prayers
             of the Church.

17. In light of my comments in the grant of permission Mr Greer shifted the
    emphasis in his submissions. He pointed out that the  Tribunal  had  in
    fact accepted two central matters arising from the evidence of the  six
    witnesses. It had been  expressly  accepted  that  the  Appellant  knew
    something about Christianity,  and  that  he  was  regularly  attending
    church. Given that their evidence had held good in respect of these two
    central issues, Mr  Greer  suggested  that  it  was  incumbent  on  the
    Tribunal to give significant weight to the third  matter  arising  from
    that evidence: the belief of the witnesses that  the  Appellant  was  a
    genuine Christian.  If they  did  not  accept  that  evidence,  it  was
    obliged to give reasons why not.


18. I am afraid that I am unable to accept Mr Greer's analysis.


19. First, the evidence itself does not  uniformly  speak  to  whether  the
    Appellant is a genuine  believer.  Revd  Edwards,  for  instance,  says
    nothing at all about the  Appellant's  beliefs;    Revd  Ireson  simply
    confirms that he helps run a monthly meal for asylum  seekers;  as  the
    Tribunal noted, all that Revd Findlay could do was to report the  views
    of a third person who had not himself written directly.


20. Second, what evidence there is in the letters is not so powerful as  to
    compel acceptance. The closest  that  the  written  evidence  comes  to
    confirming the witnesses' views on the Appellant's true  belief  is  in
    the letter from  Revd  Moludy,  who  said  that  he  thought  that  the
    Appellant  had  shown  "passion  and  love  for  Jesus  Christ";   Revd
    Rutherford states that he discerned the Appellant's change of heart  to
    be "sincere". The Tribunal was rationally  entitled  to  find  that  it
    could place less weight on these scant few lines than if the  witnesses
    had  attended the hearing "to enable cross examination  to  take  place
    and go into more detail about the depth of study and  understanding  of
    the Appellant of his Christian faith".


21. Third, and most importantly, the Tribunal must make its own  assessment
    of credibility. It had before it  the  Appellant's  entire  immigration
    history and interview records, and it was bound to make its  assessment
    in  light  of  all  of  that  evidence.  Even  if  the   Tribunal   had
    wholeheartedly accepted that Revds. Moludy and Rutherford believed  the
    Appellant, it did not mean it had to.


22. Finally I note that the subject of Judge Freeman's  oft-misquoted  2001
    decision was not whether Mr Dorodian was actually a Christian. That had
    already been established.  It was about whether  he  could  demonstrate
    that it was a fundamental part of his new faith to openly  practice  it
    by participating  in  common  worship:  pre  HJ  such  cases  had  been
    routinely  refused  on  the  grounds  that  Christians  could   conduct
    themselves  "discreetly".  Contrary  to  Mr  Greer's  submissions   the
    'guidelines' were in no way concerned with whether the putative refugee
    has accepted Jesus into his heart; confirmation of that matter  is  not
    the purpose of a Dorodian witness.   The  argument  for  the  Appellant
    before  me  was  ultimately  based  on  a  fallacious  syllogism:  'the
    Appellant attends  church,  Christians  attend  church,  therefore  the
    Appellant is a Christian'. Plainly, that is not so.


23. I can find no deficit in the Tribunal's reasoning,  nor  error  in  its
    approach to the written evidence.








    Ground (iii)


24. The focus of ground (iii) is an entirely different  argument,  and  one
    that the First-tier Tribunal does not appear to have  considered.  That
    is this. If the Appellant  is  a  complete  mountebank  and  is  not  a
    Christian at all, is he nevertheless at risk upon return to Iran?  That
    was the question  posed  by  HHJ  Gilbart  in  SA  (Iran),  R  (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2012]
    EWHC 2575 (Admin):

         "Thirdly, there is a matter closely related to the second point  of
         concern. What appears to have impressed the immigration judge,  and
         then the Home Secretary,  is  that  the  Claimant's  conversion  to
         Christianity was not regarded by  him  as  genuine,  and  had  been
         manufactured to assist her asylum claim. It is  a  dangerous  thing
         for anyone, and perhaps especially a judge, to peer into what  some
         call a man or woman's soul to assess whether a professed  faith  is
         genuinely held, and especially not when it was and is  agreed  that
         she was and is a frequent participant in church services. It  is  a
         type of judicial exercise very popular some centuries ago  in  some
         fora, but rather rarely exercised today. I am also  uneasy  when  a
         judge, even with the knowledge one gains judicially in  a  city  as
         diverse as Manchester,  is  bold  enough  to  seek  to  reach  firm
         conclusions about a professed conversion, made by a woman raised in
         another culture, from the version of Islam practised therein, to an
         evangelical church in Bolton within one strand of  Christianity.  I
         am at a loss to understand how that is to  be  tested  by  anything
         other than considering whether she is an active participant in  the
         new church. But I accept that such judicial boldness as this  judge
         showed does not necessarily undermine a decision in law if he  does
         so, and his decision was not successfully appealed. But that is not
         the only point. There must be a real risk that if she has professed
         herself to be a Christian,  and  conducted  herself  as  one,  that
         profession, whether true or not, may be taken in Iran  as  evidence
         of apostasy. On the  basis  of  the  Home  Secretary's  now  stated
         position, that amounts to a potentially different circumstance from
         that addressed by the Immigration Judge".

    It is a question that Mr Diwnycz accepts that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    does not address, notwithstanding that it was expressly  argued  before
    it. I therefore consider it here.


25. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the  Appellant  had  undergone  a
    baptism (the parties agreed that nothing appeared to turn on the  words
    "a form of" baptism).  It accepted that he had  been  attending  church
    for a number of years.


26. We know that when he is returned to Iran as a failed asylum  seeker  he
    is likely to be questioned about what he has been doing in the UK:  SSH
    and HR v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (illegal  exit  -
    failed  asylum  seeker)  Iran  CG   [2016]   UKUT   00308   (IAC),   BA
    (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return)  Iran  CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
    (IAC), AB and Others (internet  activity  -  state  of  evidence)  Iran
    [2015] UKUT 257 (IAC). It was the evidence of  the  expert  before  the
    Tribunal in SSH, Dr Kakhki, that this would include  questioning  about
    his failed asylum claim:  see  paragraph  35  of  Appendix  A  to  that
    decision.  The Appellant would at that point have a choice  about  what
    to say.


27. He could lie and say that he had simply lived in the UK illegally  with
    no contact with the authorities, or that he had claimed asylum on  some
    other ground.  He would of course have to do so in the hope  that  none
    of the Iranians he had come into  contact  with  through  the  numerous
    churches he has  attended  in  UK  were  actually  informants  for  the
    government  (see  AB,  BA),  or  that  the  authorities  had  otherwise
    discovered his history. He would have to do so in the knowledge that he
    had in fact publicly denounced Islam, an offence  punishable  by  death
    according to  classical  principles  of  Islamic  law.   Setting  these
    difficulties aside, the requirement that  he  lie  in  order  to  avoid
    persecution is now settled to be contrary to the Refugee Convention. In
    RT (Zimbabwe) and Others [2012]  UKSC  38  the  Supreme  Court  made  a
    significant extension to the principles set out in  HJ  (Iran)  and  HT
    (Cameroon) [2011] UKSC 596. In HJ the court held that claimants  should
    not be expected to conceal matters fundamental  to  their  identity  in
    order to avoid harm. In RT the court held that even absent  any  'core'
    characteristic - in that case political opinion - claimants should  not
    be expected to lie. That is because the 'core' right is the  right  not
    to be persecuted  -  in  this  case  for  religious  beliefs  that  the
    Appellant, on the findings of the First-tier Tribunal, does not have.


28. The question therefore becomes: if the Appellant decides  to  tell  the
    truth, will he face a real risk of harm?  The truth would  be  that  he
    had claimed asylum on the basis that he was an apostate from Islam, and
    in order to support this claim had regularly attended  church  and  had
    undergone baptism. In both SSH and BA the Tribunal  heard  evidence  to
    the effect  that  the  Iranian  authorities  are  aware  that  economic
    migrants make false asylum claims in Europe, and that in the  case  of,
    for instance, alleged political opponents they will  be  discerning  in
    their treatment of returnees; decision-makers  are  urged  to  consider
    whether the political activity in question would give the impression of
    real commitment to a cause, rather than opportunism.   At paragraph  23
    of SSH the Tribunal puts it like this:

         "The evidence in our view shows no more  than  that  they  will  be
         questioned, and that if there are any particular  concerns  arising
         from their previous activities either in  Iran  or  in  the  United
         Kingdom or whichever country they are  returned  from,  then  there
         would be a risk of further questioning, detention and potential ill-
         treatment".

29. Would there be any "particular concerns" arising from  the  Appellant's
    activities in the UK?  It seems to me that in the context of Iran -  an
    oppressive and paranoid theocracy - there is  good  reason  to  suppose
    that there will be a particular sensitivity around religion (as opposed
    to general  antipathy  towards  the  regime).  I  am  doubtful  whether
    protestations that it was all a sham would carry much weight. A baptism
    itself constitutes a formal denunciation of Islam.  It  would  arguably
    matter not to the Appellant's interrogators whether he did this because
    he was a Christian, an atheist, or an economic  migrant.  Applying  the
    lower standard of proof I am satisfied that there must be a  real  risk
    that many years of regular Christian worship and having  been  baptised
    will be the kind of facts that would give an Iranian border guard cause
    to transfer the Appellant  for  "further  questioning",  where,  it  is
    accepted, there may be a real risk of serious harm.


30. As unpalatable as it might be, I can only conclude that a real risk  of
    harm arises from the simple fact of the Appellant's open  adherence  to
    Christianity as opposed to Islam. Applying the principles in  Danian  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2009]  EWCA  3000  the
    Appellant cannot be excluded from protection because of bad  faith.  It
    follows that his appeal must be allowed.


    Decisions


31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  to  the  extent
    identified above.


32. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:


    "the appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.


    The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection because he  is
    a refugee".


33. There is an order for anonymity.

Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
3rd May 2018
