Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C. Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mss A. Akusu-Ossai of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge promulgated on 26 June  2018  following  a  hearing
    that took  place  on  31  May  2018.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    considered the deportation appeal in relation to Mr  [W],  to  whom  we
    shall refer as 'the appellant' as he was in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    He was born on 7 November 1972 and is now 45 years old.  On  22  August
    2016 the Secretary of State made a decision to make a deportation order
    and, in doing so, he reflected what he considered to be the  misconduct
    of the appellant in circumstances to which we shall later refer.

 2. The immigration history is relatively straightforward.   The  appellant
    entered the United Kingdom in July 2002 and applied  lawfully  in  July
    2004 to remain as the spouse of a British national.   The  couple  were
    married on 8 November 2003 and they subsequently had six children.   Of
    those, the relevant ones for our purposes are T, a  daughter,  who  was
    born on 15 March 2004 and is now 14 years old and D, their son, who was
    born on 3 May 2005 and is now 13.  As a result of the family life  that
    the appellant enjoyed in the United Kingdom with his British wife,  the
    appellant successfully made an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain which was granted on  5  September  2006.   The  making  of  the
    deportation order revokes that grant.

 3. There is only one conviction which is of concern to us and  it  is  the
    centrepiece of the deportation decision.  On 13 June 2014 the appellant
    was convicted at Inner London Crown Court of possession  of  ammunition
    without a certificate, possession of a hand gun  and  possession  of  a
    firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.   He  was  sentenced  to
    seven years and two months' imprisonment.

 4. The bare recital of the offences for which he was  convicted  does,  of
    course, little justice to the events underlying those convictions.

 5. What had occurred  is  that,  on  an  occasion  in  January  2014,  the
    appellant had entered a kebab shop late at night.   He  was  unable  to
    recollect the events as a result of his being either drunk or  high  on
    narcotics and, in those circumstances, he was not able to  account  for
    his actions (or indeed to be responsible for them) except in  the  very
    real, legal, sense.  What he did was to enter the shop  with  a  loaded
    gun.  There was ammunition in the chamber.  It was cocked and ready  to
    fire.  He brandished the gun in order to ensure that he was served with
    food as he considered that those behind the counter were being too slow
    in their service of customers.  Those in the shop were threatened  with
    the gun.  The appellant himself was not responsible for his own actions
    as a result of the influence of drugs or  alcohol  and  anything  could
    have happened in the course of those events, even a fatality.  It might
    have been a person who spoke out  of  term.   It  might  have  been  an
    indication that somebody was trying to resist what he  was  doing.   It
    only  needs  a  little  imagination  to  see  what   terrible,   tragic
    consequences might have flowed from his behaviour.

 6. It was accepted that the weapons which were found  in  the  appellant's
    possession were weapons that he had been asked to store and it was also
    accepted  that  a  reduction  in  sentence  of  25%  should  be  given,
    reflecting his plea of guilty.  He did so at an early stage.  There was
    in the preparation of his appearance in the Crown Court  a  psychiatric
    report.

 7. The tariff for an offence of this type was 9� years.  In  the  case  of
    the appellant the judge properly reduced that by  25%  to  reflect  his
    plea of  guilty  but  it  has  to  be  said  that  a  guilty  plea  was
    inescapable.  Nevertheless, we look at this offence not as  an  offence
    meriting a sentence of 9� years, but as  an  offence  which  merited  a
    sentence of 7� years imprisonment.  That offence, and the gravity which
    is associated with a sentence of imprisonment of such  length,  is  the
    centrepiece of the Secretary of State's appeal.

 8. The determination refers to the sentencing remarks  of  the  sentencing
    judge without comment at paragraph 6 of the determination.

 9. The judge then immediately moves on to the  appellant's  case  and  the
    importance of the position of T and  D  who  were  the  relevant  minor
    children affected by the decision.  They are now aged 14 and 13.   They
    remain therefore the focus of the appellant's claim to  resist  removal
    and properly so.

10.  The  determination  then  goes  on  to  deal   with   the   mitigating
    circumstances, as it were, of the  situation  in  which  the  appellant
    found himself.   He  and  his  wife  had  been  separated  following  a
    difficult period in their relationship.  The appellant was living in  a
    hostel.  Since his release, he had returned to the family home.  He was
    in a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  both  his  wife  and
    children.  Thus far, the determination centres wholly upon  the  impact
    of the deportation order upon the family.

11. In paragraphs 9 and 10 the judge refers to the fact that T suffers from
    emotional behavioural problems and D had a number of school  exclusions
    for aggressive and disruptive behaviour.  In each case it is said  that
    the presence of the father has a beneficial  effect.   The  judge  then
    repeats in general terms that removal would lead to  further  emotional
    instability and impact upon the family's wellbeing.

12. In paragraphs 13 to 15 the judge then recites the medical evidence  and
    does so at considerable length.  Those documents are within the bundle.
     They are set out at length in the determination  and  so  it  is  only
    necessary for us to refer to them in the most general terms.

13. On 11 July 2017 a letter was written which described the impact  on  T,
    describing the fact that the sudden  loss  of  her  father  was  likely
    further to increase her distrust of the services provided to her by the
    authorities and making the engagement of a supporting relationship with
    her in the future extremely difficult.

14. There was also a letter of 28 February 2018 which  evidenced  the  fact
    that the children were involved in a  multi-systemic  therapeutic  team
    for children and  adolescents  suffering  mental  health  difficulties.
    That is sometimes  referred  to  as  MST.   This  treatment  was  being
    provided to the family and the report indicated that there had  been  a
    marked improvement in the behaviour of T and D.  In  particular,  focus
    was directed towards the position of T who had been diagnosed with ADHD
    and conduct disorder.  Both T and her  brother,  it  was  said,  had  a
    strong attachment to their father and his removal would lead to further
    emotional instability and the  writer  had  grave  concerns  about  the
    children's future emotional development.  That was particularly  so  in
    the case of T.

15. There was a final piece of the medical evidence in the form of a letter
    dated 30 May 2018 which described how the changes that  were  improving
    the condition of the children by reason of the treatment with MST  were
    likely to be jeopardised.  There was concern that the effect  upon  the
    children, in the event of the appellant leaving the family home,  would
    be incredibly disruptive and destabilising for T and the  rest  of  the
    family.  The report continued that, without the input of the appellant,
    D would struggle to be heard because the appellant was often seen as  a
    mediator between him and the tensions within the home and he  would  be
    left unsupported without him.  Necessarily the report concluded that  a
    return to Jamaica would cause great distress to the family as  a  whole
    but particularly to the children.

16. It follows from the description that we have provided in  summary  form
    of the medical evidence that  this  was  solely  directed  towards  the
    interest of the children.  In paragraph 16 there was a reference to the
    interests of the appellant's wife and her gynaecological problems.

17. In paragraph 17 the  judge  then  goes  on  to  consider  the  case  by
    reference to Article 8 and s. 117 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  At this  point  it  is  as  well  to  point  out  the
    considerations that are in play in a case  of  this  nature.   Sections
    117A, B, C and D are Parliament's  instruction  to  decision-makers  to
    take  into  consideration  various   factors   when   considering   the
    deportation of what are described within s.117D as  foreign  criminals.
    The appellant himself of course falls within that definition.

18. Section 117C is in these terms:

         117CArticle 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign
         criminals


         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.


         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.


         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.


         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-


             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,


             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and


             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.


         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2. [Our emphasis.]


19. It is important to see the centrality, as well as the common sense,  of
    s.117C (2) which states, 'The more serious the offence committed  by  a
    foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation  of
    the criminal.'  In the context of this case, it can hardly be necessary
    to repeat the fact that the  appellant  was  convicted  of  an  offence
    which, on any view, was of the most serious nature, as reflected in the
    sentence of 7 years and 2 months.

20. The judge then went on to consider the family  life  considerations  in
    paragraphs 18 and 19 and the issue of proportionality  considering  the
    best interests of T and D as a primary  consideration.   She  made  the
    general comment that, in most circumstances, their best  interests  are
    to live as a family unit with both parents.  The judge noted  what  was
    apparent from the evidence that there was very  little  evidence  of  a
    private life that required protection.  We are  concerned  simply  with
    family life.

21. Paragraph 21 is of the greatest significance because  it  is  the  only
    effective reference in the determination to the public  interest.   The
    judge said:

         "I attach great weight to the public interest in deporting  foreign
         criminals and there can be no dispute as  to  the  gravity  of  the
         offence for which the appellant was convicted in 2014."

    That is the global recognition of the offending.

22. It  is  then  followed  by  a  series  of  mitigating  factors.   Those
    mitigating factors are prefaced by the  word,  'However,  ...'.   There
    then is a reference to  the  appellant  having  learning  difficulties.
    Those appear to be centred upon the fact that he had  learned  to  read
    and write comparatively recently whilst in prison.  The judge  repeated
    the fact that the appellant had been asked  to  store  the  ammunition.
    The judge then went on to deal with  the  OASys  Assessment  suggesting
    that his lack of accommodation and the fact that he  was  living  in  a
    hostel may have been linked to his offending and that the absence of  a
    stable environment may have made  the  appellant  vulnerable.   All  of
    these factors seem to be directed towards reducing  the  weight  to  be
    attached to the public interest.  It continues in  paragraph  22  where
    the  sentencing  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  no   previous
    convictions for any similar offences.   That  is  not  exactly  correct
    because the appellant had a previous conviction for possessing a bladed
    or pointed instrument.

23. The OASys Assessment is then relied upon as assessing the appellant  as
    posing a medium risk of harm to the public and that he is in  a  stable
    relationship with  adequate  accommodation.   The  judge  concludes  in
    dealing with the OASys Report the probability  of  proven  re-offending
    and  proven  violent-type  re-offending  are  all  assessed   as   low.
    Accordingly, the reference to the public interest is then subjected  to
    reduction by the various factors outlined from 21 to 23.

24. The judge then concludes by saying in paragraph 24:

         "I have  set  out  at  length  the  relevant  medical  evidence  at
         paragraphs 13  and  following.   The  appellant's  wife  has  shown
         considerable fortitude in dealing with T and D whilst she has  been
         living apart from the appellant.   I  found  that  they  are  in  a
         genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  following  the  appellant's
         release but the presence of the appellant in the household  amounts
         to far more than another pair of hands to help  with  the  shopping
         and cooking whilst the appellant's wife is working  part-time.   As
         appears from the psychological evidence the return of the appellant
         to the family has had a marked and very important impact  upon  the
         children,  in  particular  T.   The  mental  health   professionals
         involved  in  dealing  with  her  complex  range  of  problems  are
         satisfied that she and her brother both enjoy a  strong  attachment
         to the appellant and  that  'his  removal  could  lead  to  further
         emotional instability' with consequent impact  upon  her  emotional
         development.  The most recent letter of 30 May 2018  describes  the
         impact of removal of the appellant as  'incredibly  disruptive  and
         destabilising for T and the rest of the family'.  She goes  on  say
         that in the context of T's education that the removal of her father
         would cause her further distress during the first year as beginning
         to study for her GCSEs."

25. It is on the basis of that passage that the judge then  concluded  that
    the importance of the presence of the appellant in the light of his two
    minor  children,  in  particular  T,  amounted  to   'exceptional   and
    compelling circumstances' having regard to the best  interests  of  the
    children.  According to the judge, the respondent's decision gave  rise
    to a disproportionate breach  of  Article  8  in  the  context  of  the
    appellant's family life.

26. This is a reference, somewhat misquoted,  to  the  seminal  passage  in
    s.117C (6) that 'in the  case  of  a  foreign  criminal  who  has  been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least  four  years,  the
    public interest requires deportation unless there are  very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1  and  2'.
    The exceptions include, in Exception 2, where there is  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child and the effect
    of C's deportation on the partner of the child would be  unduly  harsh.
    However, the exceptions are not directly applicable in the  case  of  a
    person sentenced to 4 years or  more.   Those  are  confined  to  those
    sentenced to less than 4 years.

27. Importantly as is set out in sub-paragraph (6) in the case of a foreign
    criminal who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least
    four years the public interest requires deportation  unless  there  are
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2.  It was therefore necessary for the judge  to  find
    very compelling circumstances in order to reach  that  conclusion.   It
    was not enough to find that the effect of deportation would be harsh or
    even unduly harsh.

28. The circumstances upon which she clearly relies as being the  governing
    circumstances are plainly in relation to T and to a  lesser  extent  in
    relation to D.  However,  what  is  in  our  judgment  lacking  in  the
    determination is any proper consideration of the public interest.   The
    public interest in this case has been engendered by the fact that  this
    was a most serious offence and that very compelling circumstances  have
    to be identified and  balanced  against  the  very  significant  public
    interest  when  an  individual  has  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment of such a length.

29. In the determination there is no sense in which the public interest  is
    given proper ventilation.  It  is  true  that  the  judge  records  the
    sentencing remarks but does so without comment.  It is also  true  that
    the judge says that she attaches great weight to the public interest in
    deporting foreign criminals and to the gravity of the offence for which
    the appellant was convicted.  However, that simply does not address the
    seriousness of this offence  and  the  requirement  to  find  the  very
    compelling circumstances which compelled the decision maker to  prevent
    his removal  notwithstanding  this  very  serious  offending.   In  our
    judgment there was simply nothing within the evidence that was  recited
    that amounted to the very compelling circumstances that are  needed  in
    the context of the case where the offending  is  of  such  seriousness.
    For these reasons we consider the appeal of the determination discloses
    an error of law and we set it aside.

30. That brings us on to  the  disposal  of  this  case.   Directions  were
    provided in this case.  Paragraph 4 of them  states  that  there  is  a
    presumption that in  the  event  of  the  Tribunal  deciding  that  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal is to be set aside as erroneous in  law
    the re-making of the decision will take place at the same time  at  the
    same hearing.  The  fresh  decision  will  normally  be  based  on  the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.  Any further evidence admitted
    must be submitted in accordance with provisions made in the directions.
    The parties must be so prepared in every case.

31. There has been no submission of further evidence and, at the conclusion
    of the submissions in relation to the error of law,  we  asked  whether
    there was any further evidence that was to be provided.  We  were  told
    only that there was  the  possibility  of  psychiatric  evidence  being
    sought relating to the appellant.  With the greatest  respect  to  that
    submission, the possibility of further evidence is not sufficient,  not
    even psychiatric evidence which has not yet been obtained, the contents
    of which is entirely speculative.  In  particular,  given  that  it  is
    suggested that there may be psychiatric evidence  in  relation  to  the
    appellant, it is very unlikely that  such  psychiatric  evidence  would
    prevent his removal if it was not before the sentencing court.

32. The consequence therefore is that  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  the
    Tribunal this afternoon from re-making the decision in accordance  with
    the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and  paying
    proper regard to the public interest.

33. In re-making the decision, we have well in mind the evidence  that  was
    so meticulously set out by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in  favour  of
    this family and the reasons why they should not suffer the  removal  of
    the appellant.  For our part  we  consider  we  should  exercise  great
    sympathy for people who are the victims of a deportation order.  We use
    the word 'victims' advisedly because that is what they are.  But it  is
    as well to remember that it is not the Secretary of  State  who  causes
    the inevitable adverse consequences  that  flow  from  the  appellant's
    misconduct, nor is it the Courts or Tribunals that cause  that  damage.
    Rather it  is  the  appellant's  conduct  that  is  the  cause  of  the
    disruption that will inevitably flow from the appellant's removal.

34. Sympathy for the victims of  a  deportation  order  however  cannot  be
    determinative and merely to list the disadvantages that a  family  will
    suffer as a result of the removal of an individual cannot be sufficient
    unless there is proper reference made  to  the  public  interest.   The
    amorphous concept of  the  public  interest  is  perhaps  difficult  to
    describe and is certainly less easy to describe when  compared  with  a
    simple description of the heartache that will be suffered by an 8 year-
    old or a 10 year-old or a 14 year-old by the removal of  their  father.
    However, that is what deportation often does, when the  seriousness  of
    the offence merits it and, in this case, we would regard the  offending
    as very serious indeed.

35. For these reasons we consider that we have to do that which  the  judge
    did not do.  This requires  a  clear  and  express  assessment  of  the
    balance that has to be struck between the public interest and the  harm
    that these children will suffer.  In our judgment, that balance, paying
    due regard to the requirements of s. 117C and the fact that this  is  a
    very serious offence and that the more serious the offence committed by
    a foreign criminal the greater the public interest  in  deportation  is
    weighed against the effect upon the family.

36. Bearing in mind these factors there is, on one side of the  balance,  a
    very heavy public  interest  in  favour  of  the  appellant's  removal.
    Merely to  look  at  that  side  of  the  balance  however  is  plainly
    insufficient.  What we must do is to look at those  consequences  which
    were identified by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in  her  determination
    and balance them, one against the other.  In  doing  so  we  are  quite
    satisfied that the balancing factors advanced by the appellant  do  not
    amount to the very compelling circumstances which are  necessary  in  a
    case of this nature and that the hardship that  will  undoubtedly  flow
    from this decision is a hardship which is the  inevitable  consequences
    of serious misconduct.  It is not unduly harsh when considered  against
    the level of offending in respect of which the appellant was convicted.
     Further, s.117C(6) requires something more than ('over and above') its
    being  found  that  it  is  harsh,  even  unduly   harsh.    In   those
    circumstances carrying out the re-making of the  decision  we  consider
    that the balance is firmly in favour of the appellant's removal.

37. We need say little more save this.   There  was  a  significant  factor
    which the judge did not take into account in her determination and that
    is the long period of absence that has  occurred  in  the  relationship
    between the appellant and his family.  We were told that some  eighteen
    months before the offence took place in January 2014 the appellant  had
    left the matrimonial home and had  spent  some  eighteen  months  in  a
    hostel.  The period that then followed was a period where the appellant
    was detained.  We calculate  that  he  would  have  been  detained  for
    something  like  43  months  being  one  half  of  the  term   of   his
    imprisonment.  Consequently  on  our  calculations  the  appellant  was
    absent from the family home for a full period of five  years,  probably
    five years and two months before he was reunited in mid-September  2017
    when he was released.  We consider this to be an  important  factor  in
    the overall consideration and by the time the judge dealt with the case
    in May of 2018 the family had only been reunited for a period of  eight
    months.  That consideration was omitted from the determination.

38. We consider it was an important consideration.   The  father  left  the
    matrimonial home when the children were aged 8 and 7  respectively  and
    he returned home in the middle of September 2017 when the children were
    then 13 and 12.  That is a factor we take into account.

39. We also take into account the very careful gradation  which  exists  in
    these cases of deportation depending upon the period  of  imprisonment.
    The periods of imprisonment within the terms of sections 117A-D in  the
    2002 Act draw clear distinctions between periods of imprisonment  which
    are less than twelve months, periods of imprisonment which are at least
    twelve and periods of imprisonment which are four years and more.  This
    shows  a  decisionmaker  that  there  is  a  distinct  pattern  in  the
    consideration of offending which has to be  taken  into  account.   The
    persons who are therefore deported as a result of serious offending are
    not simply deported on a blanket basis but by careful analysis  of  the
    various categories into which they fall.  In this  case  it  was  plain
    that, in the case of a period  of  seven  years  and  two  months,  the
    appellant fell within that most serious category (and by a  significant
    margin).  That is something to which, inevitably, proper  consideration
    is to be given.  We  are  quite  satisfied  that  deportation  was  the
    inevitable result of this  appellant's  offending  notwithstanding  the
    circumstances which he could properly put forward as to his family  and
    the consequences upon his children.

40. For these reasons we re-make the decision allowing the  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State,  setting  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and  re-making  it  by  dismissing  Mr  [W]'s  appeal  to  the
    Tribunal.

             the decision of the Secretary of State is dismissed.
