Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms G Patel, counsel, instructed by Ashwood
solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. Mr [L] appealed the decision dated 13 June  2016  by  the  SSHD  to
         refuse his human rights claim which was based upon his marriage  to
         a British Citizen. The application was considered under the 10-year
         partner and private life routes contained within  Appendix  FM  and
         paragraphs 276ADE-CE of the Immigration Rules and outside the rules
         on the basis of exceptional circumstances. The SSHD accepted Mr [L]
         met the suitability requirements but did not accept that he met the
         eligibility requirements namely it was not accepted  he  was  in  a
         genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  his  claimed  partner,
         Andrea [N].  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  Heatherington  found  the
         couple were in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and  allowed
         the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


         Error of law


      2. The SSHD sought and was granted permission to appeal on the grounds
         that the judge had failed to consider EX.1  and  it  was  incumbent
         upon the  judge  to  consider  whether  there  were  insurmountable
         obstacles to Ms [N] going to Algeria with him; the SSHD argued that
         the judge had failed to make findings of fact on  a  central  issue
         once the existence of the relationship had been found to be in  the
         appellant's favour.

      3.  Ms  Patel,  relying  upon  the  Rule  24  response  filed  by  the
         solicitors, submitted that the only  issue  before  the  judge  was
         whether the relationship was genuine and subsisting;  having  found
         that it was there was no necessity for the judge to consider  other
         aspects of the Immigration Rules.

      4. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  allowed  the  appeal  against  the
         rejection of the human rights claim under the Immigration Rules. He
         failed to consider the Rules in their totality. The SSHD's decision
         was predicated upon a conclusion that  there  was  no  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship. In those circumstances and on  that  basis
         for  her  to  go  on  to  consider  issues  such  as  finance   and
         accommodation would be futile because it was  the  SSHD's  position
         that he would not in any event have met  the  requirements  of  the
         Rules.  Ms Patel submitted that  Mr  [L]  had  addressed  the  case
         against him and it was unfair that  matters  should  be  raised  of
         which he was not aware.

      5. This is a  surprising  submission.  Solicitors  who  specialise  in
         Immigration  know  that  compliance  with  the  Immigration   Rules
         requires compliance with all aspects of the Rules. They  also  know
         that to succeed on a human rights claim, the requirements of  s117B
         Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 have  to  be  met.  The
         judge did not begin to address this. Furthermore, the SSHD  in  the
         decision letter addressed whether there were significant  obstacles
         to Mr [L] returning to Algeria and  the  judge  failed  to  address
         this.

      6. Although Ms Patel  did  not  formally  concede  that  there  was  a
         material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  judge's  decision
         she did not make any further submissions on this point or  identify
         where the judge had considered the relevant requirements.

      7. The First-tier Tribunal judge erred  in  law  in  failing  to  make
         findings and reach conclusions on material matters. I set aside the
         decision to be remade, the only finding preserved is that there  is
         a genuine and subsisting relationship between the couple.

         Remaking the decision

      8. The starting point is  that  there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship between the couple. They first met in April  2010  and
         they started living together in  2012.  They  were  married  in  an
         Islamic ceremony  on  25th  April  2015.  They  underwent  a  civil
         marriage on 23rd September 2017 and Ms [N] has changed her name  to
         [L].

      9. Ms [L] owns the property they live in, subject to  a  mortgage.  Mr
         Bates did not dispute that this property was suitable and  met  the
         requirements of the Rules.

     10. Ms [L] has two adult sons. The oldest has recently moved out of the
         family home to live close by with his fianc�e. The youngest (who is
         aged 24) still lives at home. He is employed  and  has  no  medical
         needs. Mr Bates did not dispute this evidence.

     11. Ms [L] had a very  traumatic  first  marriage.  Her  first  husband
         attacked her (about 20 years ago) and she received 11  stab  wounds
         resulting in two collapsed lungs  and  she  nearly  died.  Her  ex-
         husband was sentenced to seven years in prison and has  since  been
         released from prison with a condition that he makes no contact with
         her. The two boys do not have any  contact  with  him.  I  was  not
         provided with details of the  offence  or  the  sentencing  judge's
         remarks or  medical  evidence  to  support  her  oral  evidence  or
         evidence as to the long-term psychological effect this had  on  her
         or the treatment she received for this. Mr Bates did not  challenge
         this evidence and, having seen Ms [L] give evidence I  am  entirely
         satisfied that she told the truth. I am entirely satisfied that the
         incident had a  profound  and  long-term  effect  on  her  and  has
         resulted in her, her two boys and her parents being far closer  and
         emotionally dependent upon each other than would otherwise  be  the
         case.

     12. Ms [L]'s evidence of the development of her  relationship  with  Mr
         [L] is symptomatic of the profound effect the attack had upon  her.
         She describes  the  cautiousness  with  which  she  approached  the
         relationship, her concern for her two boys and her parents and  the
         effect it would have upon them as a family. This  was  even  though
         the  two  boys  were,  at  the  time  the  relationship  commenced,
         approaching  adulthood.   Her  description   of   the   two   boys'
         protectiveness of her because of the past history and their gradual
         acceptance of Mr [L] as a family member  are  a  testament  to  the
         strength of the relationship and  the  profound  closeness  of  the
         family unit.

     13. Mr Bates raised some  objections  because  neither  boy  gave  oral
         evidence and there was no witness statement from them or  Ms  [L]'s
         parents. Ms [L] explained that the two boys were at  work  and  her
         mother had a hospital appointment which her father  had  taken  her
         mother to. Ms Patel had not asked for an adjournment. It is perhaps
         surprising that solicitors who profess to be experts in this  field
         of law did not provide up-dating witness  statements,  particularly
         because the parents and one son had been at the First-tier Tribunal
         hearing and the directions sent with the  Notice  of  Hearing  make
         clear that if an error of law is found the  re-making  may  follow.
         Nevertheless, I note that supporting  statements,  although  brief,
         were submitted with the original application. I found Ms [L] to  be
         an impressive and truthful witness and I am entirely satisfied that
         Mr [L] is an integral member of this close knit family unit and has
         become so because of his care and love for his wife.

     14. Ms [L]'s parents (Mr and Mrs [B]) have some physical  disabilities.
         They are mobile but with aids. Mr [B] can drive. They live close to
         Mr and Mrs  [L]  who  call  in  most  days  and  undertake  various
         supportive tasks for them. Mr [L] slightly exaggerated  their  lack
         of mobility but I am satisfied that her parents are dependent  upon
         Mr [L] and his wife for assistance. That assistance is not physical
         in the sense that they could not cope without it  but  consists  of
         assistance with tasks around  the  house,  and,  very  importantly,
         emotional support. This derives from the very close bond between Ms
         [L] and her parents after her ex-husband's  attack  upon  her.  The
         physical  tasks  undertaken  by  Mr  and  Ms  Lakhal,  for  example
         housework, taking them out on trips, "odd jobs" around  the  house,
         could be undertaken by other people - possibly Ms [L]'s  sons.  The
         presence of Mr and Ms [L] is not necessary, physically, for Mr  and
         Mrs [B] and there was insufficient evidence before me to find  that
         they would suffer unduly if Mr and Ms [L]  were  to  leave  the  UK
         permanently or for a period of time.

     15. I was provided with extracts from Human Rights Watch and  the  Home
         Office Country Guidance. Ms Patel stated it  was  not  possible  to
         obtain information about  the  position  that  Ms  [L]  would  find
         herself in. I am surprised she did not refer me to the  FCO  travel
         advice, which is in the public domain and which has  a  bearing  on
         the position that Ms [L] would find  herself  in  if  she  were  to
         travel to Algeria to be with her husband.


     16. I made directions on 15th January 2018 in the following terms:


             Having heard submissions in this appeal on 11th  January  2018
             and having considered the evidence before me, I am  minded  to
             take into account, in reaching my decision,  the  current  FCO
             advice on travel to Algeria.


             I therefore direct that  any  written  submissions  by  either
             party which they wish me to consider, on that Advice,  are  to
             be filed and served by 4pm  on  26th  January  2018.  I  shall
             thereafter take my decision on the basis of the  evidence  and
             submissions before me.


     17. I received written submissions on behalf of Mr [L],  which  I  have
         taken into account but none on behalf of the SSHD.


     18. The travel advice includes:

             The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all
             travel to areas within:


           . 30km of the borders with Libya, Mauritania, Mali and Niger


              . 30km of the border with Tunisia in the provinces of Illizi
                and Ouargla and in the Chaambi mountains area


             The FCO advise against all but essential travel to within 30km
             of the remainder of the border with Tunisia.


             Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in
             Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focused
             on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and
             include foreigners. There's also a risk that lone actors could
             target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and
             take additional security precautions, especially in: towns and
             cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural
             and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara.


             The threat from terrorism is higher in some parts of the
             country:


               . the southern border (where the kidnap risk is concentrated)


               . the Libyan and Tunisian borders


               . rural, and particularly mountainous, areas in the north and
                 between Tunisia and Algiers


               . the Sahara


             The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the
             safety of foreign visitors. In cities there's a clear security
             presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to
             know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities
             and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.


             If you're travelling independently you should notify the
             Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your
             plans. Your hotel should be able to help you with contacting
             local authorities. This doesn't apply if you have dual
             Algerian nationality. You should accept any security escort
             you're offered and co-operate with authorities. See Terrorism.


             When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, you
             should avoid areas that you don't know, especially after dark.
             Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky
             and it's always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or
             companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night
             outside the major cities and motorways. See Crime and Local
             travel


             ...


             Local travel


             Seek the advice of your hosts about appropriate security
             measures. If possible you should arrange to be met on arrival
             in Algiers. You should stay at one of the main hotels where
             proper security precautions are taken.


             Where possible, make journeys by air and stay in pre arranged
             accommodation at your destination. Business visitors without
             established contacts should seek advice in the first instance
             from the British Embassy, Algiers or the Algeria desk in UK
             Trade and Investment.


             Tourists should confirm travel arrangements before arrival in
             Algeria, using a reputable tour operator with good local
             knowledge.


             It's generally safe to move around the centre of Algiers
             during the day. Ideally, travel around with someone who knows
             the city well. Avoid areas that you don't know, particularly
             in the suburbs of the city and especially after dark. Don't
             carry large amounts of money or valuables around with you. If
             you plan to tour the Casbah area of Algiers, use a good local
             guide and make sure local police and your hosts/hotel know
             about your plans. Don't accept lifts from people you don't
             know - use a taxi service recommended by the hotel.

     19. There was no evidence before me where Mr [L]'s family live and with
         whom the couple could be expected to live, at least for  the  first
         few months that they re-located there. The  couple's  evidence  was
         that  it  would  be  extremely  difficult  for  Ms  [L]  to  obtain
         employment because of her ethnicity and lack of  language  ability.
         Although Mr [L] thought there might be some personal pressure  from
         his parents for her to convert to Islam, he did not  consider  this
         would be anything more than their personal desire. Mr [L] said that
         his parent's accommodation was small - 3  bedrooms  with  8  people
         already living there.


     20. Mr [L] said that there was very little tourism in  Algeria  and  he
         would also find it difficult to obtain employment. He expressed his
         concern at the level of terrorism in Algeria.

     21.  I  accept  Mr  [L]'s  evidence  regarding  the   availability   of
         accommodation and the significant difficulties that  Ms  [L]  would
         face in finding employment. Because I do not know  where  Mr  [L]'s
         family live, I have taken the view that they are in Algiers  rather
         than in a rural area. Because there are 8  people  in  a  3-bedroom
         house I have concluded that they are not particularly well-off  but
         there would be accommodation available in the short term,  although
         they may well have to share a bedroom with other  adults.  Although
         Mr [L] may find it difficult to find employment because he has been
         in the UK for so long, he has during his time in  the  UK  acquired
         excellent English  language  skills  and  there  was  very  limited
         evidence before me as to the lack of possible job opportunities  in
         Algeria for him. I am satisfied,  given  the  absence  of  evidence
         otherwise, that he would be able to find some sort of employment.

     22. Ms [L] gave oral evidence that  she  earns  �28,500  per  annum.  A
         letter from her employers confirms she is employed as a  Litigation
         Department Manager but does not  provide  details  of  her  income.
         Although wage slips were provided to the SSHD with the  application
         (according to the covering letter for the  application)  they  were
         not  before  me.  Nor   have   bank   statements   been   produced.
         Nevertheless, both Mr and Ms  [L]  confirmed  her  income;  she  is
         paying a mortgage and the job she holds is  a  responsible  job.  I
         accept her evidence of her income.

     23. Mr [L] arrived in the UK in 2000. Although not specified  the  SSHD
         accepts that he is an overstayer rather than an illegal entrant.

     24. It was not submitted by Ms Patel, realistically, that Mr [L]  would
         face very significant obstacles to his integration into  Algeria  -
         he is Algerian, he speaks Arabic, French and English, he spent  the
         first 26 years of his life in Algeria, all his family  continue  to
         live there and he has no mental or  physical  problems  that  could
         affect his integration.

     25. In terms of Paragraph  EX.1[1]  the  issue  is  whether  there  are
         insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  between   the   couple
         continuing outside the UK. This is amplified as  "very  significant
         difficulties...which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
         serious hardship for" either of them.

     26. Ms Patel submitted both  that  there  was  no  public  interest  in
         removing Mr [L]; he has been resident in the UK for some  17  years
         and in a strong and subsisting relationship with a British Citizen.
         She referred to the above matters and in  addition  submitted  that
         were Mr [L] to leave the UK and apply for entry clearance he  would
         be granted such entry clearance and therefore the  public  interest
         in removing him was significantly diminished.

     27. She also however submitted that he would not succeed in  his  entry
         clearance application because he is  a  long  time  overstayer  and
         thus, because of the enormous difficulties that would be  faced  by
         Ms [L] in Algeria and that she could not leave  her  sons  and  her
         parents, it would mean the end of their family life.

     28. Although the decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 is  well  known,  I
         set out below the relevant paragraphs for ease of reference:

             "45.  By  virtue   of   paragraph   EX.1(b),   "insurmountable
             obstacles" are treated as a requirement for the grant of leave
             under the Rules in cases  to  which  that  paragraph  applies.
             Accordingly, interpreting the expression in the same sense  as
             in the Strasbourg case law, leave to remain would not normally
             be granted in cases where an applicant  for  leave  to  remain
             under the partner route was in the UK in breach of immigration
             laws, unless the applicant or their partner  would  face  very
             serious difficulties in continuing their family life  together
             outside the UK, which could not be overcome  or  would  entail
             very serious hardship. Even in a case where such  difficulties
             do not exist, however, leave to  remain  can  nevertheless  be
             granted outside the Rules in "exceptional  circumstances",  in
             accordance  with  the  Instructions:  that  is  to   say,   in
             "circumstances in which refusal would result in  unjustifiably
             harsh consequences for the individual such that refusal of the
             application would not be  proportionate".  Is  that  situation
             compatible with article 8?


             ...


             48.  The Secretary of State's view that the public interest in
             the removal of  persons  who  are  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws is, in  all  but  exceptional  circumstances,
             sufficiently compelling to outweigh the individual's  interest
             in family life with a partner in  the  UK,  unless  there  are
             insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with  that  partner
             continuing outside the UK, is challenged in these  proceedings
             as being too stringent to be compatible with article 8. It  is
             argued that the Secretary of State has treated "insurmountable
             obstacles" as a test applicable to persons in the UK in breach
             of immigration laws, whereas the European court treats it as a
             relevant factor in relation to non-settled migrants.  That  is
             true, but it does not mean that the Secretary of State's  test
             is incompatible with article 8. As  has  been  explained,  the
             Rules are not a summary of the European court's case law,  but
             a statement of the Secretary of State's policy. That policy is
             qualified by the scope allowed  for  leave  to  remain  to  be
             granted outside the Rules. If the  applicant  or  his  or  her
             partner would face very significant difficulties in continuing
             their family life together outside the UK, which could not  be
             overcome or would  entail  very  serious  hardship,  then  the
             "insurmountable obstacles" test will be met, and leave will be
             granted under the Rules. If that test  is  not  met,  but  the
             refusal of the application would result in unjustifiably harsh
             consequences, such that refusal would  not  be  proportionate,
             then leave will be granted outside the Rules on the basis that
             there are  "exceptional  circumstances".  In  the  absence  of
             either    "insurmountable    obstacles"    or     "exceptional
             circumstances" as defined, however, it is not apparent why  it
             should be incompatible with article 8 for leave to be refused.
             The Rules  and  Instructions  are  therefore  compatible  with
             article 8. That is not,  of  course,  to  say  that  decisions
             applying the Rules and Instructions in individual  cases  will
             necessarily be compatible with article 8: that is  a  question
             which,  if  a  decision  is  challenged,  must  be  determined
             independently by the court or tribunal in  the  light  of  the
             particular circumstances of each case.


             ...


             51.  Whether the applicant is in  the  UK  unlawfully,  or  is
             entitled to remain in the UK only  temporarily,  however,  the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be. For example, if  an
             applicant would  otherwise  be  automatically  deported  as  a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the  public  interest  in
             his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on
             the other hand, an applicant - even  if  residing  in  the  UK
             unlawfully - was otherwise certain  to  be  granted  leave  to
             enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the
             UK, then there might be no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
             removal. The point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department.


             ...


             56.  The European  court's  use  of  the  phrase  "exceptional
             circumstances" in this context was considered by the Court  of
             Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192; [2014] 1 WLR 544. Lord  Dyson
             MR, giving the judgment of the court, said: "In our view, that
             is not to say that a test of exceptionality is being  applied.
             Rather it is that, in  approaching  the  question  of  whether
             removal is a proportionate interference with  an  individual's
             article 8 rights, the scales are heavily weighted in favour of
             deportation and  something  very  compelling  (which  will  be
             'exceptional') is required to outweigh the public interest  in
             removal." (para 42) Cases are not, therefore, to be approached
             by searching for a unique  or  unusual  feature,  and  in  its
             absence rejecting the application without further examination.
             Rather, as the Master of the Rolls made clear, the test is one
             of proportionality. The reference to exceptional circumstances
             in the European  case  law  means  that,  in  cases  involving
             precarious family life,  "something  very  compelling  ...  is
             required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest",   applying   a
             proportionality test. The Court of Appeal  went  on  to  apply
             that approach to the interpretation of  the  Rules  concerning
             the deportation of foreign criminals, where  the  same  phrase
             appears; and their approach was approved  by  this  court,  in
             that context, in Hesham Ali.


             57.  That  approach  is  also  appropriate  when  a  court  or
             tribunal is considering whether a refusal of leave  to  remain
             is compatible with article 8  in  the  context  of  precarious
             family life. Ultimately, it has to decide whether the  refusal
             is proportionate in the particular case before  it,  balancing
             the strength of the public interest  in  the  removal  of  the
             person in question against the impact on  private  and  family
             life. In doing so, it should give appropriate  weight  to  the
             Secretary of State's policy, expressed in the  Rules  and  the
             Instructions, that the public interest in immigration  control
             can be outweighed, when considering an application  for  leave
             to remain  brought  by  a  person  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration  laws,  only  where  there   are   "insurmountable
             obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined. It  must
             also consider all factors relevant to  the  specific  case  in
             question, including, where relevant, the matters discussed  in
             paras 51-52  above.  The  critical  issue  will  generally  be
             whether, giving due weight  to  the  strength  of  the  public
             interest in the removal of the person in the case  before  it,
             the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it.  In
             general, in cases concerned with  precarious  family  life,  a
             very strong or compelling claim is required  to  outweigh  the
             public interest in immigration control.


             58.  The expression "exceptional circumstances" appears  in  a
             number of places in the Rules and the Instructions. Its use in
             the part of  the  Rules  concerned  with  the  deportation  of
             foreign offenders was considered in Hesham Ali. In the present
             context, as has been explained, it appears in the Instructions
             dealing with the grant of leave to remain in  the  UK  outside
             the Rules. Its  use  is  challenged  on  the  basis  that  the
             Secretary of State cannot lawfully impose a  requirement  that
             there should be "exceptional circumstances", having regard  to
             the opinion of the Appellate Committee of the House  of  Lords
             in Huang.


             59.  As was explained in para 8 above, the case of  Huang  was
             decided at a time when the  Rules  had  not  been  revised  to
             reflect the requirements of article 8. Instead, the  Secretary
             of State operated arrangements under which effect was given to
             article 8 outside the Rules. Lord Bingham, giving the  opinion
             of the Committee, observed that the ultimate question for  the
             appellate immigration authority was  whether  the  refusal  of
             leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where the  life  of
             the family could not reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
             elsewhere, taking full account of all considerations  weighing
             in favour of the refusal, prejudiced the family  life  of  the
             applicant in a manner sufficiently  serious  to  amount  to  a
             breach of article 8.  If  the  answer  to  that  question  was
             affirmative, then the refusal was unlawful. He added:  "It  is
             not  necessary  that  the  appellate  immigration   authority,
             directing itself along the lines indicated  in  this  opinion,
             need ask  in  addition  whether  the  case  meets  a  test  of
             exceptionality. The suggestion that it should is based  on  an
             observation of Lord Bingham in Razgar [R (Razgar) v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27; [2004]  2  AC
             368], para 20. He was there expressing an expectation,  shared
             with the Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal,  that  the  number  of
             claimants  not  covered  by  the   rules   and   supplementary
             directions but entitled to succeed under article 8 would be  a
             very small minority. That is still his expectation. But he was
             not purporting to lay down a legal test." (para 20)


             60.  It remains the position that the ultimate question is how
             a fair balance should be struck between the  competing  public
             and individual interests involved, applying a  proportionality
             test. The Rules and Instructions in issue in the present  case
             do not depart from that position. The Secretary of  State  has
             not imposed a test of exceptionality, in the sense which  Lord
             Bingham had in mind: that is to say, a  requirement  that  the
             case should exhibit some  highly  unusual  feature,  over  and
             above the application of the test of proportionality.  On  the
             contrary, she has defined the word "exceptional",  as  already
             explained, as meaning "circumstances in  which  refusal  would
             result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual
             such  that  the  refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be
             proportionate".  So   understood,   the   provision   in   the
             Instructions that leave can be granted outside the Rules where
             exceptional circumstances apply involves  the  application  of
             the test  of  proportionality  to  the  circumstances  of  the
             individual case, and cannot be regarded as  incompatible  with
             article  8.  That  conclusion  is  fortified  by  the  express
             statement in the Instructions that "exceptional" does not mean
             "unusual" or "unique": see para 19 above."

     29. As can be seen from the extract from Agyarko  set  out  above,  the
         essential issue in this case is an issue of the proportionality  of
         refusal of leave to remain in the context of the public interest in
         the maintenance of immigration control. In  the  vast  majority  of
         cases, the refusal of leave to remain for an applicant who has been
         an overstayer for some 17 years but has a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a British Citizen of 7 years will not  sustain  a
         conclusion that the decision is disproportionate. That  is  not  to
         say that there must be some exceptional feature; rather  that  when
         considering the whole of the circumstances including the particular
         characteristics not only of an applicant but also the  family  unit
         and in particular the spouse and whether the obstacles faced  would
         be significant and harsh.


     30. In this case one of the defining features is  the  terrible  attack
         sustained on Ms [L] by her ex-husband and the consequences to  her.
         Although I was not provided with medical details  it  must  be  the
         case that to have come so close to death with  two  young  children
         would inevitably lead to an intensely close relationship  with  her
         parents and her children and a perceptible reluctance to embark  on
         a new relationship. The relationship she has with Mr [L]  is  close
         and integral to the family. Although her two children  are  adults,
         one remains living at home  and  the  other  lives  close  by.  Her
         parents, although not in need of her care, are provided  with  care
         by her, albeit that care is non-essential.  She  clearly  feels  an
         immense sense of duty to them and such duty cannot be  replaced  by
         arranging for her sons to undertake visits for 'odd jobs' or  trips
         out. If she goes to Algeria she will be away from the daily contact
         she has with those who have supported her in her recovery from  the
         traumatic attack and enabled her to develop to the extent that  she
         now holds down a responsible job and has brought up  two  sons  who
         are both employed. Although she will be with her husband, she  will
         not, I am satisfied, be able to obtain employment and will, because
         of the culture of Algeria and  her  lack  of  language  skills  and
         ethnicity, find herself living a very restricted life  in  Algeria.
         She will be isolated when her husband is at work. She will not only
         have given up a well-paid job in the UK and embarked on a life with
         limited face to face contact with  her  other  family  members  but
         will, on the basis of the FCO advice,  be  living  in  a  dangerous
         society. Such a prospect would be formidable for any British  woman
         but for Ms [L], with  her  personal  history  of  having  sustained
         serious and severe violence, to live in such a  society  where  she
         would be unable to communicate with anyone other than  her  husband
         or travel around unaccompanied and be surrounded by danger  and  be
         unemployed, would be harsh in the extreme.


     31. Weighed against this is the long-term overstaying of Mr [L].  There
         is little evidence that he has done anything other than casual work
         whilst in the UK and it is difficult to understand  why  he  should
         have remained for such a long period of time in such circumstances.
         He gave no explanation for this. He did not disclose  to  his  wife
         for several months  that  he  was  an  overstayer.  They  have  not
         discussed her going to Algeria with him in  any  detail,  it  being
         apparently understood that she would find it tremendously  hard  to
         integrate into such a society without her wider family and for  the
         reasons given above. The couple have not investigated how long they
         would be apart whilst Mr [L] returned to Algeria in order to obtain
         a 'spouse' visa, it  being  realistically  accepted  by  them  that
         because of his long term overstaying he would be very  unlikely  to
         obtain such a visa  even  though  their  relationship  is  of  such
         length, closeness and financially secure.


     32. Taking all of these findings into account and placing the  required
         weight upon the public interest in maintaining immigration control,
         I am satisfied that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
         life continuing if  Mr  [L]  is  refused  leave  to  remain.  Those
         obstacles  cannot  be  overcome  without  entailing  very   serious
         hardship for Ms [L]. Relocation to Algeria for her would be  unduly
         harsh and would entail very serious hardship.


     33. This case is therefore one of  very  few  cases  where  the  appeal
         succeeds.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


    I set aside the decision


    I re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by  allowing  Mr  [L]'s  appeal
    against the decision to refuse his human rights claim.
