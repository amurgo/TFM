Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr Z Malik, instructed by Malik Law Chambers
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, Ganga Bahadur Thapa, date  of  birth  2.12.81  and  his
    wife, Anu Khapung Thapa, date of birth 25.8.87, are citizens of  Nepal.



 2. These  are  their  appeals  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Clapham promulgated  25.8.14,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decisions of  the  respondent,  dated  26.9.13,  to
    refuse their applications made on 28.8.13 for  variation  of  leave  to
    remain in the UK and to remove them from the UK by  way  of  directions
    under section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 19.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Clapham should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. The first appellant came to  the  UK  in  2007  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student. The second appellant came to the UK in 2008  as  the
    dependant  of  the  first  appellant.  Their  leave  was   subsequently
    extended. On 7.3.11 the appellants were granted limited leave to remain
    in the UK until 30.8.13. The applications which are the subject of this
    appeal were made  two  days  before  the  expiry  of  that  leave.  The
    appellants have no children.

 7. The applications were made on the basis of private life in the UK, both
    under paragraph 276ADE and article 8 ECHR. In essence,  the  appellants
    claimed that after some 6-7 years in the UK they  have  both  lost  all
    ties to Nepal.

 8. Having considered the evidence and the appellants' circumstances, Judge
    Clapham found  that  they  failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules (�22) and  considering  the  proportionality  of  the
    decision outside the Rules under article 8, found that the decisions to
    remove were not disproportionate.

 9. In summary, the application for permission to appeal submits  that  the
    judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by:

      a) failing to make a rounded assessment of  the  appellants'  ties  to
         Nepal;

      b) failing to consider the respondent's policy on  the  assessment  of
         such ties; and

      c) assuming that it was for the appellant to show that  the  decisions
         were disproportionate in terms of article 8.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Pooler found  that  "The  judge
    arguably erred in  law,  as  alleged  in  the  grounds,  in  his  brief
    assessment at [21] of whether the appellants had no ties to  Nepal.  It
    is unlikely that his failure to consider the respondent's policy or his
    assessment of proportionality disclose a material  error  of  law,  but
    since permission is to be granted all grounds may be argued."

11. The Rule 24 response, dated 14.11.14, submitted that the judge directed
    himself appropriately and  stated,  "The  IJ  considers  and  finds  at
    paragraph 21 that both appellants given their involvement  in  Nepalese
    culture maintained ties in Nepal. This finding was open to  the  IJ  to
    make."

12. Mr Malik relied on Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT
    60 (IAC), to the effect that the meaning of  ties  in  paragraph  399A,
    which has a similar requirement to 276ADE, imports a concept  involving
    something more than merely remote or abstract links to the  country  of
    proposed deportation or removal. It involves there being  a  connection
    to life in that country. "Consideration of whether  a  person  has  'no
    ties' to such a country must involve a rounded assessment of all of the
    relevant circumstances and is not to be limited  to  'social,  cultural
    and family' circumstances." However, for the reasons set out  below,  I
    find not only that the judge did conduct a rounded  assessment  of  the
    relevant circumstances, but that even if the decision were  to  be  set
    aside and remade, no proper assessment of those circumstances would  or
    could result in a finding that the appellants meet the requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE, so that the appellants have failed to demonstrate any
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

13. The reasoning for the finding at �22  that  the  appellants  failed  to
    establish that they had no ties to Nepal, including cultural, social or
    family, the then test under paragraph 276ADE, is set out in �21 of  the
    decision. That the judge found that  the  appellants  are  citizens  of
    Nepal is an inadequate reason, otherwise all applications under  276ADE
    would be bound to fail. It would have been relevant to  point  out  the
    relatively short period of time in the UK and that  they  retain  their
    native  language.  However,  the  judge  relied  on   the   appellants'
    significant involvement in Nepalese cultural organisations to find that
    they retained a cultural tie to Nepal.

14. That evidence included many pages in the appellants'  bundle  detailing
    the first appellant's involvement in cultural events and organisations.
    These documents include a certificate of appreciation from the  Kandara
    Performing Arts Centre and details of  the  London  Himalaya  film  and
    cultural festival in 2011.  A  letter  from  the  Pashupatinath  Temple
    confirms that he is a prominent member of  the  Nepalese  community  in
    Charlton and an active volunteer at the temple, contributing  immensely
    towards community events by singing and playing music  to  raise  funds
    for the temple. He has also performed at a fund-raising event  for  the
    Help Nepal organisation. Most significantly, the appellant  produced  a
    letter from the Nepalese Embassy in London, dated 27.8.13, which states
    that he has been working in the Nepalese  Community  in  the  field  of
    culture and music since 2007. The letter  also  states  that  he  is  a
    resident of Syangja, Nepal. Taken as a whole, this is  cogent  evidence
    that the appellants and in particular the first appellant have retained
    very strong ties to the culture of Nepal. Indeed, it would be  hard  to
    imagine  better  evidence  of   continuing   cultural   ties   in   the
    circumstances of an applicant under paragraph 276ADE.

15. Earlier in the decision the judge took  into  account  the  appellants'
    witness statements and in particular that the second  appellant  has  a
    mother and 5 siblings in Nepal. The  witness  statement  of  the  first
    appellant reveals that his own father is living  in  Nepal.  He  claims
    that his father did not care for him or support him, but  in  his  oral
    evidence he said that both parents attended his  wedding  in  2005.  He
    claims to have no siblings. At �27 the  judge  took  into  account  the
    claim that the appellants  had  been  ostracised  by  their  respective
    families, but noted that families fall out for all  kinds  of  reasons.
    That does not by itself demonstrate that there are not family ties.  In
    my view, whether or not the family ties issue was adequately  addressed
    by the First-tier Tribunal Judge, any objective assessment of the facts
    of this case would undoubtedly conclude that the appellants both retain
    family ties in Nepal.

16. In the circumstances, it is  manifestly  plain  and  obvious  that  the
    appellants cannot demonstrate, the burden being on them to do so,  that
    they have lost all  ties  to  Nepal,  including  cultural,  social  and
    family. It follows that I find no material error of law in this  aspect
    of the determination.

17. In relation to policy, as referenced in �5 of the  grounds,  I  see  no
    basis for suggesting that application of such policy provisions as  are
    there set out would or could have made any difference to the outcome of
    the appeals. I find that in effect the judge gave  proper  and  careful
    consideration to those issues, even without there being  any  reference
    to policy. In the circumstances, I  find  no  material  error  in  this
    ground of appeal.

18. In relation to article 8, I agree  that  the  judge  was  in  error  in
    suggesting that the burden was on the appellants to establish that  the
    decisions were disproportionate. That  burden  is  on  the  respondent,
    provided  the  appellants  can  first  establish  that  the   decisions
    constitute such a grave interference with their rights to private  life
    as to engage article 8.

19. In any such an assessment,  it  has  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  the
    appellants have not been in the UK very long, less than 7 years at  the
    date of their application and the decision. Further, the fact that  the
    appellants did not meet the Rules for leave to remain on the  basis  of
    private life is a  factor  that  should  be  taken  into  account  when
    assessing  the  public  interest.  Article  8  is  not  a  shortcut  to
    compliance with the Immigration Rules and the appellants could have had
    no legitimate expectation of being able to remain  further  in  the  UK
    except in strict compliance with Immigration Rules.

20. The judge took into account the claim that the appellants would not  be
    able to obtain work in Nepal, but noted that the  first  appellant  had
    worked as a musician in the UK and it had not been shown that he  would
    not be able to work as a musician in Nepal. The judge accepted that the
    second appellant might not be able to work as a beautician in Nepal but
    noted that her good English would  provide  an  advantage  in  the  job
    marker and that other work could be open to her. I find no error of law
    in this aspect of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

21. In relation to medical care, it is clear from  the  decision  that  the
    judge took some care to assess this issue  and  the  first  appellant's
    disabling condition, for which he had some sympathy. However, the judge
    found that the appellants had failed to demonstrate that  medical  care
    would not be available in Nepal. On  the  limited  evidence  available,
    that was a finding open to the judge.

22. Even though the judge applied the wrong burden of proof in relation  to
    the issue of proportionality, I am satisfied that if the decision  were
    to be set aside and remade applying the correct burden and standard  of
    proof, it is inevitable that any judge properly  directing  himself  on
    the available evidence would have to conclude  that  the  decision  was
    entirely proportionate and not disproportionate to  the  family  and/or
    private life rights of the appellants under article 8 ECHR.

23. As students in the UK the  appellants  could  have  had  no  legitimate
    expectations of  being  able  to  remain,  except  in  accordance  with
    specific leave to do so.

24. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations  under  article  8  ECHR  in  relation  to
    private life as students. Whilst each case must be  determined  on  its
    merits, the Tribunal noted that the judgements of the Supreme Court  in
    Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, "serve to re-focus attention on
    the nature and purpose of article 8 of the ECHR and, in particular,  to
    recognise that article's limited utility in private life cases that are
    far removed from the protection of an individual's moral  and  physical
    integrity."

25. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

26. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:
         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."
27. The panel pointed out that at this point on the continuum,

         "the essential elements of the private life relied on will normally
         be transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in
         their essential respects, following a person's return to their home
         country, (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its  limited  utility  to  an
         individual where one has  moved  along  the  continuum,  from  that
         Article's core area of operation towards what might be described as
         its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises, both from what  will  at
         that point normally be the tangential effect on the  individual  of
         the proposed interference and from the fact that, unless there  are
         particular reasons to  reduce  the  public  interest  of  enforcing
         immigration controls, that interest will  consequently  prevail  in
         striking the proportionality balance (even assuming that  stage  is
         reached)."

28. Applying the above guidance and case authority, there was no  realistic
    basis for the appellants' appeals to succeed under article  8  ECHR  in
    relation to either private or family life. In the circumstances, I find
    no error of law in this regard.

Conclusion & Decision:

29. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of   each   appellant   remains   dismissed   on
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
