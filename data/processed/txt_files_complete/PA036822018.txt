Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Radford (for Elder Rahimi Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr A Lindsay (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is the appeal of [HJ], a citizen of Iran born  28  June  1988,
         against the decision of the First-tier  tribunal  of  6  June  2018
         dismissing her appeal against the refusal of her  asylum  claim  by
         the Respondent (on 16 February 2018).

      2. Her asylum claim as advanced to the Tribunal below was based on her
         religious conversion to Christianity. She had been  born  a  Muslim
         and forced to practice Islam by her family. She thus had  no  faith
         by the time she became an adult, though she was nevertheless forced
         to adhere to the Islamic dress code. She had  met  an  old  friend,
         [D], at a party, who had been imprisoned for three years after  the
         presidential  election  in  2009.  During  her   imprisonment   [D]
         converted to Christianity. She  disclosed  this  to  the  Appellant
         around August/September 2016.

      3. The pair continued to meet until [D] invited  the  Appellant  to  a
         house church meeting, which followed an incident  which  encouraged
         the Appellant to look into spiritual matters more closely. One  day
         the Appellant was taking her dog to the vet  in  her  car.  It  was
         necessary to do  so  discreetly  because  the  Iranian  authorities
         disapproved generally of dog ownership. The security forces stopped
         her car, forcing her out of the vehicle and beating  both  her  and
         her dog. A crowd gathered and in the ensuing confusion she and  the
         animal escaped by returning to the car and driving away.

      4. Following this incident [D] introduced the Appellant to  the  house
         church. The Appellant attended the house church  some  15-16  times
         before it was learned of by the authorities  and  raided:  she  was
         absent on that occasion because she was attending  a  family  event
         around the birth of Immam Rezza.  She  learned  of  this  when  she
         sought to contact [D] and rang [D]'s mother, who told her that  her
         friend had disappeared. She had then switched off her mobile  phone
         and left Iran with her family's help, her brother  sending  her  to
         stay with a friend of hers. Her mother had told the Appellant  that
         the  authorities  had  once  visited  the  house  looking  for  her
         following her departure from Iran.

      5. In the UK she now attended  St  Thomas  Church,  having  previously
         frequented the Iranian North Church of London. She evangelised  via
         Instagram.

      6. The Secretary of State refused the asylum claim. The decision maker
         considered  that  the  Appellant's  account   was   generally   not
         plausible; for example it was thought unlikely that [D] would  take
         the risks arising from her conduct in relation to  a  person  whose
         own religious commitment was uncertain or that the Appellant  would
         risk learning about Christianity; and her account of her  emotional
         journey  to  Christianity  was  unpersuasive.  Furthermore  at  her
         screening interview she  simply  referenced  involvement  in  anti-
         government  propaganda   and   anti-Islamic   activities,   without
         mentioning any religious problems.

      7. Before the First-tier tribunal the Appellant's case  was  supported
         by three witnesses who had written letters  or  statements  in  her
         support. Each gave live evidence in the Appellant's support.

      8. [SC] said he had been a Minister at St Thomas Church for 10 of  his
         25 years in the Christian ministry; and that in  the  Appellant  "I
         have seen someone who seeks to follow Jesus Christ." In his opinion
         the genuineness of the Appellant's conversion was  "not  in  doubt"
         and unrelated to her immigration status she was in the  process  of
         baptism.

      9. [GC], a serving police officer and deacon, gave  evidence  that  he
         had known the Appellant since January 2018 and had experienced  her
         enthusiasm  to  share  her  Christian  faith;  his  wife  had  also
         befriended her. The Appellant was keen to find out more  about  her
         new found faith and had  recently  encouraged  a  close  friend  to
         attend the church. [OK]'s witness statement explained he was a non-
         practising lawyer presently working in catering. The Appellant  was
         very keen on Christianity and attended  church  services  regularly
         with him; she was very keen on searching  and  learning  about  the
         faith. They had lived together in Newton Abbot and her social media
         account was followed by hundreds of people.

     10. The First-tier tribunal did not accept the Appellant's  account  of
         her conversion as genuine, concluding that it was  likely  to  have
         been concocted post arrival in the UK as she would have appreciated
         such a claim had the best chance of success. The Judge held against
         her the fact that there was absolutely no reference to her asserted
         conversion in her screening interview,  and  her  explanation  that
         that failure was because en route to the UK she had  been  accepted
         the advice of  individuals  themselves  swayed  by  the  unreliable
         advice of smugglers and agents was unpersuasive. Furthermore it was
         absurd that she  would  move  from  having  no  faith  to  adopting
         Christianity when that might entail a risk of persecution,  and  it
         was inexplicable that someone who hated Allah would  fall  in  love
         with the God of another religion.

          a)  Her  account  of  the  miracle  of  the  Dog  was  presumably
             predicated around  the  public  domain  information  that  the
             Iranian authorities were opposed  to  dog  ownership;  it  was
             unexplained how it was that the  dog  was  discovered  by  the
             authorities if travelling in a box;

          b) It was not plausible that she would forgo  attendance  at  the
             house church on the occasion that it was to be raided  by  the
             authorities because of an alternative family event  given  her
             previous dedication to worshipping there;

          c) It was implausible that her brother could secure her exit from
             Iran within a matter of days  after  [D]'s  disappearance  and
             that the authorities would only visit the family home once;

          d) The brother's letter supporting her claim was "astonishing" in
             its detail - he had stated on 5 August 2017  that  his  mother
             had contacted him to say that the house church had been raided
             by intelligence officers and its members arrested, whereas the
             Appellant's account had been relatively vague.  There  was  no
             doubt that this was contrived evidence which was one more part
             of a well-orchestrated effort to falsify an asylum claim,  and
             his statement regarding the dangers to  an  apostate  in  Iran
             "could not have been better written by a country expert";

          e) Whilst the witnesses  supporting  her  claim  at  the  hearing
             doubtless "did so with the best of intentions",  they  had  no
             personal knowledge of her background in Iran  and  had  simply
             taken her Christianity at face value.

     11. Overall the Judge concluded that she was not a credible witness and
         thus her  claim  to  be  a  Christian  convert  was  rejected.  Her
         evangelising on Instagram did not  corroborate  her  claim  -  that
         behaviour was presumably contrived simply to suggest that she might
         be in danger, and in reality she would not have so  acted  had  she
         believed the authorities might read those messages, as  that  would
         have endangered herself and  her  family.  Besides,  there  was  no
         objective evidence that  the  authorities  monitored  every  single
         posting on a social network.

     12. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier tribunal had  erred
         in law:

          a) Taking an unduly negative approach to the Appellant's  account
             and failing to take account of the relevance of the supporting
             witnesses;

          b) Failing to take account of the fact that the brother's  letter
             was expressly stated by him as predicated on the inference  of
             the possibility that the  church  had  been  exposed  and  its
             members arrested;

          c) Making findings which were unduly predicated on  plausibility,
             which was inherently objectionable.

     13. The First-tier tribunal granted permission to appeal on  24  August
         2018, on the basis  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  were  generally
         arguable.

     14. Before me Ms Radford submitted that the Judge had  approached  this
         appeal on the basis that the Appellant's account was  not  credible
         and thus discounted potentially corroborative evidence. Amongst the
         evidence relied upon by the Appellant was  a  court  notice  of  19
         September 2017 requiring the attendance of  [SH]  (who  Ms  Radford
         explained had been identified early in examination in  chief),  the
         house church pastor, requiring his attendance within 3  days  at  a
         branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court. This was  a  significant
         structural failure and not just a simple matter as to the order  in
         which the appeal had been addressed.

     15. There was no material  discrepancy  between  the  evidence  of  the
         Appellant and her brother's letter: both said that the house church
         had been raided, and the Judge had made a  significant  mistake  of
         fact in finding this to be discrepant. The  occasional  use  of  an
         exclamation mark typified the response of the First-tier  Tribunal,
         which was unduly focussed  on  essentially  subjective  notions  of
         plausibility. The judge was wrong to impose a framework  predicated
         on his own theology, whereas the Appellant had given a nuanced  and
         detailed account of  her  reasons  for  abandoning  Islam  and  her
         preference for Christianity over the Muslim faith.  Indeed  it  was
         the Appellant's own perception of the dog incident as  an  unlikely
         event that caused her to attribute it to divine intervention.

     16. Mr Lindsay submitted that the documents needed to be established as
         genuine by cogent evidence from the Appellant. The Judge  had  made
         findings to which he was entitled having regard to the full span of
         the evidence before him. It was not accepted that the  Judge's  own
         beliefs infected his decision making: it  could  not  seriously  be
         disputed that the Gods of the Islamic and Christian faiths were one
         and the same. The finding that  the  Iranian  authorities  did  not
         exhaustively monitor social media was a reasonable one.

    Findings and reasons

     17. It seems to me that the grounds of appeal were  made  out  in  this
         appeal.

     18. Firstly, a failure to make findings on  the  evidence  of  material
         witnesses is likely to be fatal in  the  vast  majority  of  asylum
         appeals, which must be approached applying the appropriate  anxious
         scrutiny. As Carnwath LJ explained in YH [2010] EWCA Civ  116  that
         term "has by usage acquired special significance as underlining the
         very special human context in which such cases are brought, and the
         need for decisions to show by their  reasoning  that  every  factor
         which might tell in favour of an applicant has been properly  taken
         into account."

     19. Here the evidence of the witnesses was hardly assessed at all. Such
         treatment as they received was only after the  credibility  of  the
         Appellant's  account  had  been  considered  and   found   wanting.
         Doubtless a Judge must come up with a sensible order  by  which  to
         assess the evidence, and the fact that corroborative witnesses  are
         assessed second rather than first is not inherently  objectionable.
         However, what may be legally untenable  is  to  adopt  an  approach
         which compartmentalises the evidence, such that  material  that  is
         relevant to a key conclusion is excluded from assessment.   I  fear
         that is the case here. The genuineness of the Appellant's Christian
         conversion was in issue. The assessment of her beliefs by witnesses
         who had personal knowledge of her conduct in the UK was relevant to
         that assessment. This was particularly so when  a  Minister  and  a
         police officer had given evidence based on their personal knowledge
         of her. The witnesses  were  clearly  aware  that  the  Appellant's
         credibility was in dispute, and did not simply  take  her  word  at
         face value. The Minister made this particularly clear in  his  oral
         evidence cited above.

     20. Secondly, it is always necessary to take some care  when  assessing
         credibility on the basis of plausibility. Neuberger LJ in HK [2006]
         EWCA Civ 1037 �28: "in many asylum cases, some, even most,  of  the
         appellant's story may seem inherently unlikely but  that  does  not
         mean that it is untrue. The ingredients of the story, and the story
         as a whole, have to be considered  against  the  available  country
         evidence and reliable expert evidence, and other familiar  factors,
         such as consistency with what the appellant has  said  before,  and
         with other factual evidence (where there is any)." Keene  LJ  in  Y
         [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1223  identified  a  critical   principle   when
         credibility is assessed in an asylum claim:

             "The fundamental one is that  he  should  be  cautious  before
             finding an account to be inherently incredible, because  there
             is a considerable risk that he will be over influenced by  his
             own views on what is or is not plausible, and those views will
             have inevitably been influenced by his own background in  this
             country and by the customs and ways of our own society. It  is
             therefore important that he should seek to view an appellant's
             account of events, as Mr Singh rightly argues, in the  context
             of conditions in the country from which the  appellant  comes.
             The dangers were well described in an article  by  Sir  Thomas
             Bingham ... from an article in Current Legal Problems ...

                  'An English judge may have, or think that he has, a shrewd
                  idea of how a Lloyds Broker or a Bristol wholesaler, or  a
                  Norfolk farmer, might react in  some  situation  which  is
                  canvassed in the course of a case but he may, and I  think
                  should, feel very much more uncertain about the  reactions
                  of a Nigerian merchant, or an Indian ships' engineer, or a
                  Yugoslav banker. Or even, to take a more homely example, a
                  Sikh shopkeeper trading in Bradford. No  judge  worth  his
                  salt  could  possibl[y]  assume  that  men  of   different
                  nationalities, educations, trades, experience, creeds  and
                  temperaments would act as he might  think  he  would  have
                  done  or  even  -  which  may  be  quite  different  -  in
                  accordance with his concept of what a reasonable man would
                  have done.'"

     21. The assessment of religious belief is  an  exercise  that  must  be
         conducted with particular care. Lord Nicholls stated in  Williamson
         [2005] 2 AC 246, �22:

             "When the genuineness of a claimant's professed belief  is  an
             issue in the proceedings  the  court  will  inquire  into  and
             decide this issue as a question of fact.  This  is  a  limited
             inquiry. ... emphatically, it is not for the court  to  embark
             on  an  inquiry  into  the  asserted  belief  and  judge   its
             'validity' by some  objective  standard  such  as  the  source
             material upon which the claimant  founds  his  belief  on  the
             orthodox teaching of the religion in question or the extent to
             which the claimant's belief conforms to or  differs  from  the
             views of others  professing  the  same  religion.  Freedom  of
             religion protects the subjective belief of an  individual  ...
             religious belief is intensely personal  and  can  easily  vary
             from one individual to another. Each individual is at  liberty
             to hold his  own  religious  beliefs,  however  irrational  or
             inconsistent they may seem to some, however surprising."

     22. In the same vein, the Administrative Court in SA (Iran) [2012] EWHC
         2575 (Admin) warned that "it is a dangerous thing for  anyone,  and
         perhaps especially a judge, to peer into what some call  a  man  or
         woman's soul to assess whether a professed faith is genuinely held,
         and especially not when it was and is agreed that she was and is  a
         frequent participant in church services."

     23. Having regard  to  the  principles  identified  in  Williamson  and
         applied in SA (Iran), a Judge should be relatively circumspect when
         adjudicating upon the beliefs of a person who espouses adherence to
         a particular religion. An assertion of Christian faith is  not,  of
         course,  immune  from  assessment  as  to  its  veracity,  but  the
         assessment needs to take account of the various dangers  identified
         in those authorities as  to  the  propriety  of  making  particular
         assumptions as to why  an  individual  may  come  to  adhere  to  a
         particular belief system and to the manner in which  they  exercise
         their religion.

     24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  unfortunately  pervaded
         by value judgments as to how  a  person  would  act  in  particular
         circumstances according to the Judge's own world view,  and  cannot
         stand.

     25. Accordingly the appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
         re-hearing afresh; no findings are preserved.

     26. I note that the First-tier Tribunal relied heavily on its view that
         the Appellant had failed to mention her Christian conversion at her
         screening interview. However, she is recorded as stating  that  she
         was involved in activities which were  "anti-government  and  anti-
         Islam." Given that the stated purpose of the screening interview is
         to simply provide the  very  briefest  summary  of  an  Appellant's
         claim, it seems to me that a Judge  re-hearing  the  appeal  should
         take some care before finding that the  phrase  "anti-Islam"  could
         only  be  intended  to  pr�cis  political  rather  than   religious
         activities.

    Decision

    The appeal is allowed, as there was a material  error  of  law  in  the
    reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal.
