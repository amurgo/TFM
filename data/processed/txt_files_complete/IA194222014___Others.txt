First and second Appellants:    In person
Third Appellant   No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appeals of Mr Junaid Ali Shaikh, born 25  December  1984,
    Mr Imran Shariff, born 6 December 1986 and Mrs  Sheerin  Taj,  born  22
    July 1988.   The First Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  The  Second
    and Third Appellants are citizens  of  India.   The  Second  and  Third
    Appellants are husband and wife.

 2. On 6th February 2014 the First and Second Appellants  made  a  combined
    application for leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrants under the points-based system and for biometric
    residence permits.  The Third Appellant made application in  line  with
    her husband.

 3. On 16th April 2014 decisions  were  made  to  refuse  the  applications
    principally on the basis that letters, from the Habib Bank, in  respect
    of each of the First and Second Appellants could not be verified.   The
    letters are dated 31st January 2014.   The appellants and each of  them
    appealed and their appeals were heard on 19th November 2014 by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Horvath.  She dismissed each  of  the  appeals.
    Not content with the decisions made, by Notice dated 16th December 2014
    the Appellants and each of them  made  application  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 25th January 2015 Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Ford granted permission.  Thus the  matter  comes  before
    me.

 4. There was a preliminary matter. I was quite properly informed that  the
    Third Appellant, Mrs Taj, had returned to India.   All  parties  agreed
    that  the  effect  of  that,  having  regard  to  Section  104  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 Act was  that  the  appeal
    was to be treated as abandoned in her case. The appeals in  respect  of
    the first and second Appellants, however, remain live.

 5. The Appellants represented themselves and I have to say that they  have
    done so commendably well.  Their case notwithstanding the complexity of
    the determination produced in the First-tier Tribunal is,  after  their
    careful distillation of the essential facts really quite simple.

 6. The letter from the Habib Bank in respect of Mr Shaikh makes plain that
    the bank account is with respect to his own  funds.   The  letter  from
    Habib Bank with respect to Mr Shariff makes plain that  the  funds  are
    those of Mr Shaikh.

 7. The Secretary of State's  correspondence  relied  upon  in  making  her
    decision reads as follows (email dated 25th March 2014)

         "Madam

         As discussed, we have investigated and warning  letters  have  been
         issued to the delinquent staff  involved  in  issuing  third  party
         sponsorship letters. We have also instructed  our  Faisalabad  Bank
         branches  not  to  issue  such  types  of  certificate  in  future.
         Furthermore, we would like to  inform  you  that  all  third  party
         sponsorship letters issued  by  Faisalabad  branches  will  not  be
         verified by us.

         Assuring you of our best cooperation at all times to come.

         Regards."

 8. In refusing the applications the Secretary of State  not  only  refused
    them on the basis that the documents specified under Appendix A of  the
    Immigration Rules could not  be  verified,  but  also  because,  having
    considered her own flexibility policy, and in particular 245AA, was  of
    the  view  that  even  if  she  exercised  her  discretion  under   the
    flexibility policy she would have arrived at the same decision.

 9. The Appellants submit that the Secretary of State had misunderstood the
    effect of the email because the  email  related  only  to  third  party
    sponsorship letters.  The letter with respect to Mr Shaikh on any  view
    was not a third party letter  and  by  extension  if  the  letter  with
    respect to Mr Shaikh was genuine then as I have already  said,  so  too
    was that of Mr Shariff since it was by reference to the same funds, and
    as Mr Wilding rightly points out, the second letter was  not  really  a
    third party letter either, but "inter-party".

10. When one reads the determination of the First-tier Tribunal it is clear
    that the judge had misunderstood the basis upon which  the  appeal  was
    brought and he erred in the same manner as the Secretary of  State.   I
    find that there is a material error of law in the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and Mr Wilding, in fairness to him, very wisely and
    fairly, accepted that he could not really resist the  appeal  that  was
    brought.

11. The question then is what to do given the material error of law.  It is
    open to me to remake the decision.   The  only  basis  upon  which  the
    refusal was made was that the bank statements could  not  be  verified.
    In fact there could have been, or least there is no sufficient evidence
    to say that he could not have been.  The Secretary  of  State  had  the
    documentation from the bank.  There is no suggestion of any forgery  or
    any fraud.  In the circumstances the proper course, and one which again
    Mr Wilding quite properly did not suggest that I should not  adopt,  is
    that the appeals should in each case, save for the Third Appellant,  be
    allowed.

Notice of Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  and  remade  such
    that the appeals of Mr Imran Shariff  and  Mr  Junaid  Ali  Shaikh  are
    allowed. The appeal of Mrs Sheerin Taj is treated as abandoned.

Fee Award

13. Having allowed the appeals it seems to me only proper that in each case
    a fee award should be made and because it seems to me  that  there  was
    simply a misunderstanding on the part of the Secretary of State and  no
    other basis for refusing the applications when everything else  was  in
    order, a full fee award in each case shall be made in the sum  of  ï¿½140
    in respect of each of the First and Second Appellants.
