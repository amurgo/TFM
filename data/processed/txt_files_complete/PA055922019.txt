                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the appellant.  A failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.



Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who arrived in  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally on 30 November 2018.  He made a claim for asylum.  He claimed
    he was born in 2002 so that  he  was  a  minor  (16  years  old).   The
    appellant was subsequently assessed to have a different date  of  birth
    instead of being assessed as age 16, the appellant was assessed  as  an
    adult of around 22 years of age.

 3. The basis of the appellant's asylum claim was that he came from Jalawla
    in the Diyala province of Iraq.  He claimed that he had formed a sexual
    relationship with an Arab girl ("K") whose father was a  senior  figure
    in the Hashd  Al-Shaabi  militia  or,  alternatively  in  his  account,
    someone who played a role in the Baghdad government.  That relationship
    had been discovered and the appellant was required to marry K  but  had
    refused and he feared that he would be killed on return.  In  addition,
    the appellant claimed that his father worked for the Shi'a militia, the
    PMF as a cook and that he would be at risk on  return  because  of  his
    father's association with the PMF.

 4. On 2 June 2019, the Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  claims
    for asylum, humanitarian protection and on human rights grounds.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  detailed
    determination, Judge Raymond dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  all
    grounds.  He made an adverse credibility finding  and  did  not  accept
    that the appellant was from Jalawla in the  Diyala  Province  of  Iraq,
    that he had formed a sexual relationship with K and was  at  risk  from
    her father on return or that his own father had worked for the PMF.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal on a  number  of  grounds.
    First, it was contended that the judge had been wrong to find that  the
    appellant was not from Jalawla in the Diyala province on the basis that
    the appellant had wrongly described himself, in his  asylum  interview,
    as coming from 'Kurdistan'.  Secondly, it was contended that the  judge
    had been wrong to find  aspects  of  the  appellant's  account  of  his
    'secret relationship' with K as being  implausible.   Thirdly,  it  was
    contended that the judge had wrongly relied upon minor discrepancies in
    the appellant's evidence.

 7. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but, on renewal to the Upper Tribunal, on 13  July  2020  UTJ  Sheridan
    granted permission to appeal.  His reasons are set out at paras 1 and 2
    of his decision as follows:

         "1.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Raymond found damaging to the
             appellant's credibility that although he claimed  to  be  from
             Jalawla in Diyala Province he also  referred  to  coming  from
             Kurdistan.

         2.   Arguably, it was not inconsistent for  the  appellant  to  say
             that he came from Kurdistan given, inter alia, the evidence of
             Dr Fatah in SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity  documents)
             Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400 (IAC) at [103] that there are parts of
             Diyala which had been controlled by the Kurds prior  to  2017.
             It is arguable, therefore, that there was  no  basis  for  the
             judge to find it damaging to the appellant's credibility  that
             he said he came from Kurdistan."

 8. As regards the other grounds of appeal, UTJ Sheridan described them  as
    "weak" but, nevertheless, granted permission on all grounds.

 9. Plainly, therefore, UTJ Sheridan considered that the  first  ground  of
    appeal was the most meritorious and the  remaining  grounds  of  appeal
    lacked any real strength.

10. Following directions, the appeal was listed for hearing at the  Cardiff
    Civil Justice  Centre.  The  UT  worked  remotely  and  Mr  Gayle,  who
    represented  the  appellant,  and  Mr  Howells,  who  represented   the
    respondent, joined the hearing remotely by Skype for Business.

The Submissions

11. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Gayle relied upon the  grounds  although
    he focused upon the first ground.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    given considerable weight to the issue of whether  the  appellant  came
    from 'Kurdistan' in assessing his credibility.  Mr  Gayle  pointed  out
    that  before  the  2017  Kurdish  Referendum,  the   Kurdish   Regional
    Government ("KRG") had control (at least  jointly)  of  the  area  from
    which the appellant claimed to come.  Mr Gayle submitted  that  it  was
    entirely possible that the appellant considered his home area was  part
    of Kurdistan even if it was not part of the Kurdistan  Region  of  Iraq
    ("KRI") itself.

12. As regards the remaining grounds, Mr Gayle accepted that he  could  not
    point to any blatant errors and that he did not wish to go through what
    was in each of the remaining grounds.  However, he  submitted  that  it
    was not implausible that the appellant would form the relationship,  as
    he claimed,  including  taking  the  risk  of  discovery  when  he  was
    concentrating (as he claimed) from having any sexual relationship  with
    K.

13. On behalf of the respondent, Mr  Howells  submitted  that  the  judge's
    determination  was  a  detailed  and  long  one.   He  submitted   that
    notwithstanding that there  were  some  deficiencies  in  some  of  the
    judge's findings, he had given  a  large  number  of  reasons  for  not
    believing the appellant on the  three  main  points:  (1)  his  claimed
    relationship with K; (2) his father's claimed association with the PMF;
    and (3) that he came from Jalawla in the Diyala governorate.

14. As regards the point upon which UTJ Sheridan had  specifically  granted
    permission, Mr Howells submitted that the judge was aware that the area
    from which the appellant claimed to come had been under Kurdish control
    until 2017.  The judge had referred to this in paras 30 and 31  of  his
    determination and it had been accepted by the respondent  in  paras  67
    and 80 of the decision letter.  Mr Howells pointed out that  in  answer
    to Q149 of his asylum interview, the appellant had said  he  came  from
    'Kurdistan'.  That, Mr Howells accepted, had  been  picked  up  by  the
    interviewer at Q153 where he  had  asked  a  question  about  what  had
    happened to the appellant's father "up until you left  Kurdistan".   Mr
    Howells acknowledged that 'Kurdistan' as a term could encompass an area
    greater than the KRI under the control of the  KRG.   In  answer  to  a
    question from me, Mr Howells was unable to provide any  explanation  as
    to why the judge in para 30 assumed that the  appellant  meant  by  the
    term "Kurdistan", the KRI itself.  Nevertheless, Mr  Howells  submitted
    that even if the judge had made an error it was  not  material  to  his
    adverse findings that led him to dismiss the appeal.

15. As regards the plausibility  points,  Mr  Howells  submitted  that  the
    grounds lacked detail and  UTJ  Sheridan  had  considered  them  to  be
    "weak".  He submitted that the judge was entitled at paras 79 - 115 not
    to accept  the  appellant's  evidence  that  he  had  formed  a  sexual
    relationship with K who was the daughter of a senior figure in Hashd Al-
    Shaabi militia or  an  important  figure  in  the  Baghdad  government.
    Likewise, the judge was entitled to find at paras 116 - 120 that he did
    not accept that his father worked for the PMF.   Mr  Howells  submitted
    that apart from the contention that the appellant's claim  was  wrongly
    found to be implausible, the grounds gave no detail as  to  the  "minor
    discrepancies" which, at paras 100 -  139  of  the  determination,  the
    grounds claim the judge wrongly took into account.

Discussion

16. The judge's determination is a detailed  and  lengthy  running  to  143
    paragraphs over 35 pages.  I set it out in summary only to  the  extent
    necessary to deal with the grounds and whether the decision is  legally
    sustainable.

17. The judge set out the appellant's claim  ("the  asylum  narrative")  at
    paras 10-74.  In that section, the judge dealt at paras 10-17 with  the
    appellant's claim to come from Jalawla in  Diyala  province.   Then  at
    paras 29-36,  the  judge  gave  reasons  for  not  accepting  that  the
    appellant was, as he claimed, from Jalawla.

18. At para 29, the  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  said  in  his
    substantive interview that he had left  'Kurdistan'  and  that  he  had
    correctly described the Kurdistan flag.  Then, at  para  30  the  judge
    said this:

         "The appellant would seem to mean  by  'Kurdistan'  the  'Kurdistan
         Region of Iraq" or KRI.  However, Diyala province, and []  Jalawla,
         is not considered  in  the  objective  evidence  as  part  of  KRI.
         Although as the CPIN of August 2017 on  Political  opinion  in  the
         Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) points out by  reference  to  a  map
         showing the concentration of Kurds in KRI, there is  a  significant
         number of  Kurds  living  to  the  north  of  Diyala,  in  an  area
         constituting just under half of the province, and in which is found
         the town of Khanaqin, that the appellant  identified  (with  Sadita
         and Kalar) as a district near Jalawla (q162).  This area, and  that
         part of Diyala which is not  considered  to  have  any  significant
         Kurdish presence, falls outside the Kurdish Autonomous  Region  (as
         the KRI is also referred to) proper, and where are to be found  the
         cities of Erbil and Sulaymaniya (5.1.2).  This  fits  in  with  the
         assessment  already  noted  from  SMO  of  Diyala  province  as  an
         ethnically diverse region of Iraq [� 13 above], but  it  cannot  be
         seen to come within a geographical area that could be considered as
         part  of  KRI,  or  Kurdistan,   which   comprises   the   northern
         governorates of Erbil, Dohuk, Sulamaniyah  and  Halabja  (6.1.1-2).
         Although Diyala, because of its population of Kurds, is  one  of  a
         number of Disputed Territories between  the  Kurdistan  authorities
         and the federal government of Baghdad (7.4.1).  The refusal  letter
         refers to the home area of the appellant as having been  under  the
         control of both the Iraqi government and the IKR (sic) (80), and it
         is apparent from the objective evidence that this would  have  been
         before the forces representing the KRG, principally  KDP  and  PUK,
         were pushed back to the 1991 frontiers of Kurdistn in the aftermath
         of the 2017 Kurdish referendum."

19. Then at para 31 the judge dealt with a  broader  meaning  of  the  term
    'Kurdistan' as follows:

         "As the August 2017 CPIN points out, 'Kurdistan' itself is  also  a
         term of reference for an area  where  Kurdish  people  reside  that
         spans Western  Kurdistan  in  Syria,  Eastern  Kurdistan  in  Iran,
         Southern Kurdistan  in  Iraq,  and  Northern  Kurdistan  in  Turkey
         (4.1.2)."

20. The judge then referred to  the  political  position  in  the  KRI  and
    continues as follows:

         "SMO sets out how after the expansion of ISIS into  the  region  of
         the KRG was able to extend its de facto control into what  are  now
         the disputed territories, but after the defeat  of  ISIS,  and  the
         Kurdish Referendum of 2017 for independence, the Iraqi  authorities
         have been able to reclaim the Disputed Territories, which  includes
         the governorate of Diyala with those of Ninewa, Kirkuk and Salah-al-
         Din, thus pushing back the KRG to its 1991 frontiers [� 18-19]."

21. At para 32, the judge referred to the appellant's evidence, inter alia,
    the distance between Jalawla and where he  went  to  avoid  K's  family
    after his relationship was discovered.

22. At para 33, the judge  dealt  with  the  respondent's  submissions  and
    evidence  concerning  the  so-called  Disputed  Territories   and   the
    appellant's estimate of the distance  between  Jalawla  and  Kalar  (at
    least in his asylum interview) as being 35km was not  credible  looking
    at the map to which the judge had been referred.

23. At para 34, the judge referred,  inter  alia,  again,  to  that  latter
    issue.  Then  at  paras  35  -  36  the  judge  reached  the  following
    conclusions:

         "35. Because of the confusion the appellant sows in this regard  it
             seems necessary to have to speculate whether by saying he  was
             living in Kurdistan, he thereby means that he  places  Jalawla
             in that region, Diyala province,  with  its  ethnological  mix
             that includes Kurds, a  greater  majority  of  whom  could  be
             expected to want to see the disputed territories within Diyala
             province to be part  of  KRI,  a  point  of  view  that  would
             normally have meant that they would have nothing to fear  from
             the  KPD  (sic)  and  PUK.   Unless,  of  course,  they   were
             supporting the PMF, which is what the appellant claims for his
             father, when they were living  in  Diyala  province,  Jalawla,
             after their return there in 2017.

         36.  I find that this confusion created  by  the  appellant  having
             randomly it seems thrown out the information that he lived  in
             Kurdistan, as well as Jalawla in Diyala province, is  damaging
             to the credibility of his asylum narrative."

24. The judge then went on in paras 37  -  59  to  reject  the  appellant's
    account of his relationship with K and at paras 60 - 71 to  reject  his
    claim that his father worked for the PMF.

25. Having approached the issues in that way, and having made some  factual
    findings, the judge, at paras 78 - 138 under the heading "Reasons" gave
    further reasons based upon  the  evidence  for  his  finding  that  the
    appellant's asylum claim was not credible and  for  rejecting  the  two
    main strands of his claim, namely  his  relationship  with  K  and  his
    father's involvement with the PMF.  In this  section,  the  judge  said
    little about the appellant's claim  to  come  from  Jalawla  in  Diyala
    province, no doubt because the judge has  already  reached  an  adverse
    finding on that issue in paras 29 - 36.

26. At para 121 the judge said this:

         "I further find that considerable difficulties, which have  already
         [been] touched upon, attach to the claim of the appellant  that  he
         comes from Jalawla in Diyala governorate."

27. At para 122, the judge stated that the appellant had failed to  give  a
    credible account of how he had obtained a residence certificate for the
    district of Jalawla from his uncle.  He  referred  to  the  appellant's
    "elaborate account in his oral evidence" as to how he had relied upon a
    friend  to  find  his  uncle  on  Facebook  and  obtain  the  residency
    certificate signed (purportedly) by the Mukhtar.   The  judge  rejected
    the appellant's explanation and at para 134 said this:

         "In the light of the proceeding reasons that call into question the
         credibility of the appellant on where he  claims  to  originate  in
         Iraq, and which includes, as well as the incomprehensible assertion
         of the appellant that he lived in Kurdistan, the principal  feature
         of his not providing any credible explanation  for  why  his  uncle
         would have had this document on his phone so as to send it  to  him
         on the same day of the one and only occasion that they  spoke,  for
         only some 5 - 10 minutes according to the appellant, at some  point
         over the first two months after the appellant arrived in the UK  in
         November 2018.  I find by reference to Tanveer Ahmed (Starred) 2002
         UKIAT 00439, that upon looking at the residency certificate in  the
         round, that the residency certificate is not a document upon  which
         reliance can properly be placed."

28. Then at paras 135 - 137, the judge made the following findings:

         "135.    I find that in a fabricated asylum narrative the appellant
               made a false assertion of being  illiterate  as  a  means  of
               helping him to avoid any difficult issues  that  could  arise
               from his falsely claiming that he and his  family  come  from
               Jalawla, which was, in November 2018 when he made his  asylum
               claim, in the contested area of Diyala province, and to which
               it would not have been safe to return in  the  light  of  the
               country guidance then obtained.  However, this has  since  in
               any case  been  overtaken  by  the  latest  country  guidance
               assessment in SMO which found  that  Diyala  province  is  no
               longer a contested area.

         136. In  the  light  therefore  of  the  totality  of  my  negative
               credibility findings, and in particular the very  substantial
               fault lines  that  undermine  the  credibility  of  the  core
               features to the asylum narrative of the appellant, consisting
               of his claimed secret relationship with an Arab girl; and his
               father having an association with the PMF.  I therefore  find
               that the appellant has not established a well-founded fear of
               persecution at the lower level.  For the same reasons I  find
               that he did not qualify for humanitarian protection.

         137. In the light  of  all  my  specific  findings  on  the  asylum
               narrative set out in the preceding I do not accept he  has  a
               relationship with an Arab girl from which arose  his  claimed
               fear of her family.  I do not accept that his father has ever
               had any form of association with the PMF.  I  do  not  accept
               that the appellant comes  from  Jalawla  in  Diyala  province
               which in any case if it was a contested area when he made his
               asylum claim in November 2018, this  is  not  now  the  case.
               ..."

29. The judge made a clear finding that the appellant was not from,  as  he
    claimed, Jalawla in Diyala province.  The basis for that  finding  was,
    substantially, at paras 29 - 36 that the appellant had  been  wrong  to
    say that he was from 'Kurdistan'.  Mr Howells submitted, the judge  was
    plainly aware that the term 'Kurdistan' had a broader meaning than  the
    KRI in Iraq.  Yet, at para 30 the  judge  interpreted  the  appellant's
    claim that he came from 'Kurdistan' to mean that he came from the  KRI.
    Mr Howells was unable to offer any basis upon  which  the  judge  could
    have made that assumption.

30. In  truth,  the  appellant  only  once  referred  to  his  coming  from
    'Kurdistan' in his evidence at Q149 of his asylum interview.  The other
    reference to it in his asylum interview (at Q153)  was  a  use  by  the
    interviewer, no doubt picking up on what the appellant had earlier said
    in Q149.

31. The evidence before the judge showed  that  the  area  from  which  the
    appellant claims to come had been both an area with significant Kurdish
    population in the past, had been under the joint control of the KRG and
    others prior to the 2017 Kurdish Referendum and was, at  the  time  the
    appellant left Iraq and came to the UK and claimed asylum,  a  Disputed
    Territory.

32. The judge made a great deal out of the appellant's single  use  of  the
    term 'Kurdistan' to reach his adverse finding that he  did  not  accept
    that the appellant came from Jalawla in  Diyala  province.   There  was
    nothing in the appellant's evidence, that was drawn to my attention, to
    suggest that the appellant meant that he came from an  area  which  was
    part of the KRI.  Not inconsistently with what he was saying, it was  a
    Kurdish area which he might well have regarded as part  of  'Kurdistan'
    used in a broad sense.  Further, it does not seem that this  point  was
    ever put to the appellant so  as  to  enable  him  to  explain  why  he
    described himself as coming from 'Kurdistan'.

33. In my judgment,  the  reasons  given  by  the  judge,  based  upon  the
    appellant's answer to Q149, to conclude  that  he  did  not  come  from
    Jalawla in Diyala province, were  inadequate  to  sustain  his  adverse
    finding.  Whilst the judge did also point up an inconsistency, at least
    in the appellant's evidence interview though not it would seem  in  his
    oral evidence, as to the distance between Jalawla and Kalar  where  his
    maternal uncle lived, the weight of his adverse  finding  lies  in  his
    reasoning that the appellant was wrongly describing his  home  area  as
    being part of 'Kurdistan'. To  that  extent,  therefore,  I  accept  Mr
    Gayle's submission that the judge erred in law in reaching his  adverse
    finding as to the appellant's home area.

34. Mr Howells, however, submitted that if there was such an  error,  given
    the detailed reasons given by the judge for  his  adverse  findings  in
    respect of the relationship with K and his  father's  involvement  with
    the PMF, any such error is not material.

35. That submission has some attraction given the  detail  of  the  judge's
    reasons for not accepting other aspects  of  the  appellant's  account.
    Clearly, if his erroneous finding as to the appellant's home  area  had
    no overall effect on his credibility findings and his specific  adverse
    findings on other aspects of the appellant's account, that error  would
    not be material.

36. It is tempting to postulate, given the detail of reasons given  by  the
    judge on other aspects of the appellant's account, that  the  error  in
    reaching the adverse finding on  the  appellant's  home  area  was  not
    material.  Not every error in reaching an adverse  credibility  finding
    on one issue in a case will necessarily lead to a  conclusion  that  no
    adverse findings are sustainable.  The error  must  be  material,  i.e.
    affected the other findings or the judge's overall conclusions.   There
    are two principal  reasons  why  I  conclude  that  the  error  I  have
    identified was material.

37. First, the issue  of  the  appellant's  home  area  and  origins  is  a
    fundamental aspect of an international  protection  claim.   Here,  the
    judge began his detailed  assessment  of  the  appellant's  account  by
    making a  positive  adverse  finding  on  a  significant  part  of  the
    appellant's claim, namely where he came from  as  supporting  his  fear
    both from the father (and family) of K with whom  he  claimed  to  have
    formed a sexual relationship and as a result of his father's activities
    with the PMF.  It was an impermissible,  and  unsatisfactory,  starting
    point for his assessment of the two strands of the claim.

38. Secondly, the judge himself turned to his adverse findings in regard to
    the appellant's  claimed  origins,  having  considered  the  "two  main
    strands" to the appellant's claim.  At paras 134-137  (set  out  above)
    the judge rehearsed his adverse credibility finding in relation to  the
    appellant's claimed home area in Iraq.  The judge would appear to  have
    the adverse finding on the appellant's home are in mind  when  reaching
    his later adverse findings on the claim.

39. In this case, notwithstanding the detailed reasons given by the  judge,
    I cannot be confident that the adverse finding made explicitly  at  the
    beginning of the judge's  assessment  of  the  appellant's  account  in
    relation to the appellant's claimed place of origin  in  Iraq  has  not
    infected his overall credibility findings and  adverse  conclusions  on
    the two main principal strands of the appellant's claim to fear serious
    harm or death on return to Iraq.

40. For these reasons, therefore, the judge's error of law was material  in
    rejecting the appellant's international protection claim.

41. In the light of this conclusion on the ground upon which permission was
    explicitly granted by UTJ Sheridan, it is unnecessary to  consider  the
    remaining grounds set out in the grounds of appeal  though  not  relied
    upon, with any force, before me orally by Mr Gayle.   The  weakness  of
    those grounds was commented upon by UTJ Sheridan.  Given their lack  of
    detail and general attack upon  the  judge's  assessment  that  certain
    aspects of the appellant's claimed relationship were implausible, is  a
    characterisation which has much to attract it. But, as I  say,  I  need
    not address those grounds as the decision cannot stand for the  reasons
    I have given.



Decision

42. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of a material error of law.   That  decision
    cannot stand and is set aside.

43. Both representatives indicated that, if this  was  my  conclusion,  the
    proper disposal of the  appeal  was  to  remit  it  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo re-hearing.

44. I agree.  In the  light  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  fact-finding
    required, and having regard to  para  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement, the proper disposal of this appeal is to  remit  it
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a de  novo  re-hearing  before  a  judge
    other than Judge Raymond.

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                                9 March 2021
