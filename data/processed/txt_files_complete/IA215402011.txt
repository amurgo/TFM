For the Respondent:    Mr McVetie, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Davies made following a hearing  at  Manchester  on  1st
    November 2011.



 Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Germany, born on 23rd October  1981.   On
    25th July 2007 a decision was made to make a deportation order  against
    him by virtue of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

 3. At the date of the Respondent's decision  the  Appellant  had  provided
    evidence of exercising treaty rights from 1st December  2004  to  April
    2009.  He came to the adverse attention of the authorities on 9th  July
    2010 when he was convicted of conspiracy to commit offences outside the
    UK at Liverpool Crown Court.  He was sentenced to two and a half years'
    imprisonment.

 4. The judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal but did  not  make  a  clear
    finding as to how long he had been in the UK.  It was  the  Appellant's
    case that he had been here since 2001.

 5. The Appellant sought permission to challenge  Judge  Davies's  decision
    which was granted on 1st December 2011 by Immigration Judge Blandy.

 6. On 26th September  2012  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Coker  set  aside  his
    decision on the grounds that the judge had failed to make a finding  as
    to the Appellant's residence in the UK.

The Hearing

 7. This matter came before me on 2nd July 2013.

 8. Prior to  the  hearing  the  Appellant  produced  documentary  evidence
    showing that he had made national insurance contributions from 2001  to
    2012.  The national insurance record showed that the Appellant had "ten
    qualifying years up to April 2012".

 9. The Respondent also noted that there was a letter from the  Appellant's
    GP which confirmed that he had registered with them  as  a  patient  on
    28th November 2001 until his records were transferred in December 2007.

10. The Respondent therefore accepted that the evidence indicated that  the
    Appellant has been present in the UK for recordable periods of time.

11. Mr McVetie told me that he was content to rely on the  evidence  before
    me and would make no submissions  in  this  appeal  save  that  it  was
    accepted that the Appellant had been here for ten years.

Findings and Conclusions

12. Under Regulation 21(4) a relevant decision may not be taken  except  on
    imperative grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who
    has resided in the UK for a continuous period of  at  least  ten  years
    prior to the relevant decision.

13. Mr McVetie made no submission that the requirements of paragraph  21(4)
    could be satisfied in this case.

14. In MG & VC [2006] UKAIT 00053 the Tribunal stated, in relation  to  the
    phrase 'imperative grounds of public security'

         "We do not think that it is a phrase which is appropriate to  cover
         the ordinary risk to society arising from the commission of further
         offences by a convicted criminal.  That is the risk  which  has  in
         the past been met by removal decisions based on grounds  of  public
         policy."

15. Between his arrival in the UK in 2001 until the conviction in 2010  the
    Appellant  was  not  convicted  of  any  offence.   He   was   employed
    continually during that  period  in  the  UK.  He  committed  a  single
    offence, albeit a serious one, having been found  in  possession  of  a
    holdall with 10 kilos of  cannabis,  the  street  value  of  which  was
    approximately ï¿½100,000. However, the offender manager accepted that the
    index offence was committed to pay off debts which had incurred due  to
    his use of cocaine and he was assessed as being of low risk of harm  to
    the public.  There has been no  re-offending  since  that  offence  was
    committed.

16. During his period in prison the Appellant was drug free as evidenced by
    negative test results.  His probation officer wrote as follows:

         "Mr Baerwolf-Goddard is currently assessed as posing a low risk  of
         harm to the public and low risk of offending... Mr Baerwolf-Goddard
         appears highly motivated to remain drug free.  As far as I am aware
         there is no evidence to suggest he would return to drug use in  the
         six weeks since his release."

17. The Appellant has strong links with the UK.  Since 2006 he has been  in
    a long-term relationship with his partner with whom he entered  into  a
    civil partnership in 2007.  In May 2007 they  purchased  their  present
    home.  Both are HIV positive but the condition is controlled.

18. The fact  that  the  Appellant  has  committed  no  criminal  offences,
    remained drug free and working and in  a  close  personal  relationship
    with his civil partner indicate that there are no imperative grounds of
    public security which justify deportation  in  this  case.  Indeed  the
    Respondent has put forward no argument that he should be removed and in
    the absence of those arguments being made I conclude that the  decision
    to make  a  deportation  order  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations.

Decision

19. The decision of the judge has been set aside and is re-made as follows.
     The Appellant's appeal is allowed with respect to the EEA Regulations.

20. As the Appellant has succeeded with respect to  the  challenge  to  the
    decision under  the  EEA  Regulations  it  follows  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate for him to be deported with respect to Article 8.
