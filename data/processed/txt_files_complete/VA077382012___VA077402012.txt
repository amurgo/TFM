                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants, citizens of Pakistan born on  1  January  1959  and  20
    September  1999  respectively,  appeal,  with  permission,  against   a
    decision of Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Peter  Grant-Hutchinson
    who, in a determination promulgated on 29 October 2012,  dismissed  the
    appellants' appeals against a decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Abu Dhabi to refuse their applications for  visit visas. When  I  refer
    to the appellant in this determination I am referring to the  principal
    appellant who is the mother of the second appellant.

2.   The notice of decision dated 12 October 2011 states:-

         "Guidance on  the  types  of  documents  that  might  give  a  visa
         applicant the opportunity to show that their circumstances  are  as
         they have set  out  in  their  application  form  is  available  at
         www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas .  In  assessing  your  individual
         application, I have taken into  account  the  supporting  documents
         provided,  your  passport   and   travel   history,   your   family
         circumstances and  the  financial  and  employment  information  as
         declared by you in your application form and weighed these  against
         the Immigration Rules.  In reaching my  decision,  which  has  been
         made on the balance of probabilities,  I  note  in  particular  the
         following points:


             'The passport that you have  presented  with  the  application
             does  not  show  any  previous  travel  outside  Pakistan   or
             therefore any previous compliance with the  Immigration  Rules
             of another country.  You have provided documents  relating  to
             your sponsor, however the onus is on you to qualify for  entry
             clearance in your own right.


             I have considered the letter of support provided by the Member
             of Parliament,  the  Right  Honourable  Eric  Joyce.   I  have
             considered your application carefully but I am still bound  to
             assess it against the Immigration Rules.   I  have  considered
             the  evidence  provided  and  written  statements   you   have
             provided, but I  am  not  satisfied  that  you  have  met  the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules on this occasion.


             On your application you have stated that you  own  a  bungalow
             and some land and earn 35,000 rupees (�321 if �1 = 140 rupees)
             per month; however, your stated income is not reflected in the
             bank statement you have  provided,  which  shows  deposits  in
             excess of this income.  From 24 May 2011  to  30  August  2011
             your balance was below 12,00 rupees (�85) and on 24  September
             2011 you deposited 950,000 rupees (�6,785) which  is  over  21
             times your indicated monthly income.   You  have  stated  that
             this is from the sale of your  car.   However,  you  have  not
             provided  any  evidence  of  this.   You  have  not   provided
             satisfactory evidence to show the origin of these funds or  if
             they are under your exclusive control.  I note  too  that  the
             balance of funds fluctuates.  I  am  not  therefore  satisfied
             these bank statements  are  an  accurate  reflection  of  your
             personal and financial circumstances.  You have  not  provided
             any   satisfactory   evidence   of   adequate    accommodation
             arrangements for you in the United Kingdom.  Given all of  the
             above I am not satisfied that your circumstances  are  as  you
             have indicated, or of your intentions in wishing to  visit  to
             travel to the United Kingdom now.  I am not satisfied that you
             are genuinely seeking entry as a visitor or that you intend to
             leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of the visit
             as stated by you.  In addition I am  not  satisfied  that  you
             will adequately maintain and accommodate yourself or can  meet
             the cost of the return or onward journey.  41(i) and (ii)  and
             (vi) and (vii).


             You have stated that you have been separated from your husband
             for a year, and you have proposed to travel  to  the  UK  with
             your son.  In view of this I consider that you have failed  to
             demonstrate that you have sufficient  ties  to  Pakistan,  and
             given your personal circumstances, I  am  not  satisfied  that
             your intentions are genuine in wishing to travel to the United
             Kingdom now.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  you  are  genuinely
             seeking entry as a visitor or that you  intend  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom at the end of the period of the visit as stated
             by you 41(i) and (ii).


             On your  application  you  have  stated  that  you  have  made
             available 140,000 rupees (�2,000) of your own money  to  spend
             on  your  visit.   I  am  aware  that  this  appears   to   be
             considerably  higher  (approximately  three  times)  than  the
             monthly income you have indicated.  You have not indicated  in
             your evidence further income that I may consider.   I  am  not
             satisfied that it is reasonable to make  this  expense  having
             considered  the  personal  and  financial  circumstances   you
             declare.  I am not satisfied as to your intentions in  wishing
             to travel to the United Kingdom now.  I am not satisfied  that
             you are genuinely seeking entry  as  a  visitor  or  that  you
             intend to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of
             the visit as stated by you 41(i) and (ii).


             I therefore refuse your application because I am not satisfied
             on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  you  meet  all  the
             requirements  of  the  above  paragraphs  of  the  Immigration
             Rules.'"

3.   The grounds of appeal lodged by the appellant stated that the  ECO  had
    failed to have proper  regard  to  the  documents  submitted,  had  not
    considered all the documents, and that the concerns raised by  the  ECO
    did not go beyond mere suspicion. They  claim  that  discretion  should
    have been exercised differently.

4.   It was claimed that sales deeds and transfer documents relating to  the
    sale of the car had been submitted and  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application and that the ECO had not attempted to read or look at them.
     It was claimed that the appellant  would  be  bearing  all  travelling
    expenses from her own resources. Reference was made to  a  letter  from
    Eric Joyce MP and to a letter from the sponsor.

5.   It was claimed that the ECO  had  completely  ignored  the  appellant's
    annual  income,  monthly  spending  and  monthly/annual  savings  which
    justified her financial position.  It  was  stated  the  appellant  had
    strong  financial,  social  and  economic  ties  in  Pakistan  and  was
    financially secure.  It was stated that the appellant's separation from
    her husband should not be a reason for refusal.

6.   It was argued that the appellant's son's education at  high  school  in
    Pakistan was important and that the appellant had  close family  there.
    It was  said that she had  her  husband's  family  and  their  children
    around her and that she  was  close  to  them.   Family  mediation  was
    underway through the SELSI Council.

7.   It was claimed that  the appellant had sufficient funds for the visit.

8.   Attached to the grounds of appeal was a  letter  from  the  appellant's
    husband, as well as the transfer deed relating to the car.

9.   There is a valuation certificate of the appellant's home  and  evidence
    from the sponsor that he would sponsor the appellant and details of his
    personal circumstances here.

10.  At the hearing of the appeal the First-tier Judge heard  evidence  from
    the sponsor Mr Azmat Saeed who is the brother of  the  appellant.   The
    evidence related to the sale of the  sponsor's  care  and  the  sponsor
    stated that the appellant had a  four  bedroomed  house  with  gas  and
    electricity and that the first  appellant  had  rental  income  from  a
    bungalow in Lahore.  She had sisters and  ten  nieces  and  nephews  in
    Pakistan and had never worked.  Her husband was a textile engineer.

11.  The judge set  out  his  decision  in  paragraphs  11  onwards  of  the
    determination.  He found that although the claim was being put  forward
    that the appellant and  her  husband  were  reconciled,  there  was  no
    evidence that that was the case.  There was no evidence of  the  amount
    deposited  in  the  appellant's  account  and  he  said  there  was   a
    substantial question about whether the first appellant  owned  property
    which would generate income such as that indicated in her bank account.
     He considered that the sponsor knew very little about the  appellant's
    circumstances.

12.  He concluded by stating that  the  appellant  had  not  discharged  the
    burden of proof upon her.

13.  The grounds of appeal claimed the appellant had discharged  the  burden
    of proof, that there were mistakes in the determination, and there  was
    evidence showing that the appellant would be able to fund her visit  to
    Britain.

14.  A large number of further documents were submitted.

15.   Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Appleyard   granted
    permission on 10 January 2013.

16.  Further documents have been submitted.  They contained a  copy  of  the
    determination over which many comments had been written.  There is also
    a list of documentary evidence produced.  There  was  also  a  detailed
    statement by the appellant which argued that she was still  undertaking
    counselling with her husband although they were separated, and that her
    first priority was  "referring  to  my  husband"  rather  than  leaving
    Pakistan permanently.  She asserted that she and her husband  had  been
    happily reconciled and had started living together. She referred to the
    letter from her husband stating he  supported  the  application  for  a
    family visit.  The appellant submitted that she  owned  two  properties
    and that she had two accounts, one with the Al-Fallah Bank Limited  and
    the other  with  Habib  Bank  Limited,  the  first  holding  the  rupee
    equivalent of �3,380 and  the  second  with  the  rupee  equivalent  of
    �2,356.  Moreover, the appellant stated that she owned  a  bungalow  in
    Lahore which had been given to her by her brother-in-law  in  1995  and
    she asserted that her husband had been a high income earner.

17.  The reality is that it was incumbent upon the Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to consider the facts  as  they  stood  at  the  date  of  the
    decision by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  Abu  Dhabi.   Much  of  the
    financial evidence now in  place  postdates  that  decision.   Relevant
    information, however, does relate to the sale of the appellant's car  -
    that money was in the account and there is now evidence  that  the  car
    was sold.

18.  There appeared also to be evidence that the  appellant  owned  property
    in Lahore.  There was not before the judge evidence of the  Habib  Bank
    Limited account.

19.  The evidence placed before me is certainly not  entirely  clear  and  I
    have had to endeavour to sort out what evidence was submitted with  the
    application and therefore was before the Entry Clearance  Officer  when
    the decision was made, and what  evidence  was  subsequently  produced.
    Having said that I consider that the most relevant piece  of  financial
    evidence - the large sum in  the  appellant's  account  which  she  has
    stated was from the sale of the car - was evidence  before  the  judge.
    Moreover, it appears that the bungalow which the appellant claimed  she
    owned in Lahore was a gift not from her  brother,  as  thought  by  the
    Judge who commented adversely  on the  appellant's brother evidence  in
    that regard,   but from her brother-in-law.  I consider that  on  those
    two points the judge made findings of fact  which  did  not  take  into
    account the evidence before him.  To that extent  I  consider  that  he
    made material errors of law in the determination and I  now  set  aside
    his decision.

20.  I have gone on to reconsider the appeal.  I would again emphasise  that
    I have to consider the facts as they were at the date of decision.   In
    particular, at that date, the appellant was separated form her  husband
    and was planning to visit Britain with their son.  The  fact  that  she
    may now be reconciled with her husband is not a factor which I can take
    into account.  Given that she has a brother here I  consider  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was correct to question her intention to return
    to Pakistan after the visit.  I also consider that the Entry  Clearance
    Officer was correct to take into account that she had not travelled out
    of Pakistan (apart, it appears, from a visit to India) before.

21.  I have  endeavoured  to  consider  the  evidence  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's income.

22.  The appellant claims at paragraph 5.10 of the  application  to  have  a
    monthly income of 45,000 rupees, being 35,000 from the house  rent  and
    10,000 from agricultural land.  Her monthly living costs are 25,000  to
    30,000 rupees.  Those figures do not appear to be cross  referenced  in
    the bank accounts before me.   They  do  not  appear  to  show  regular
    deposits amounting to 45,000 rupees per month.  While I can accept  the
    large amount deposited from the sale of the car, I do not consider that
    that, of itself, can be taken into account as  the  appellant,  if  she
    were returning to Pakistan, would, presumably, need to buy a new car to
    replace the car which she had sold.

23.  While the financial evidence is unclear I  consider that there is  just
    sufficient to show that, all other factors being equal,  the  appellant
    would meet the financial requirements of the visitor Rules for a  short
    family  visit.  I  am,  however,  concerned  about  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's intention to return to Pakistan.  The reality is  that,  as
    at the date of decision, her marriage appeared to be ending -  she  had
    separated from her husband - she  had  no  work  in  Pakistan  and  her
    principal relative, her brother, was  here.   I  consider  that  taking
    those factors into account the Entry Clearance Officer was correct  not
    to be satisfied that she intended to return to Pakistan at the  end  of
    the visit.  I find that she has not discharged the burden of proof upon
    her.

25.  I therefore conclude that although I have set aside  the  determination
    of the Judge of the First-tier, it is appropriate  that  I  remake  the
    decision dismissing these visit appeals.

Decision.
These visit appeals are dismissed.
