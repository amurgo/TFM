Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs R Petersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs N Khan, Joseph & Khan Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The claimant is a citizen of Ghana born on  13th  December  1984.   She
    entered the UK as a visitor on 10th July 2014 and subsequently  applied
    for leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. It was accepted that  she  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules because she entered as a visitor and therefore  could
    not comply with Appendix FM paragraphs E-LTRP.2.1 and R-LTRPT.3.1.  The
    judge considered whether there  were  exceptional  circumstances  which
    would allow him to consider the appeal outside of the  Rules.   He  had
    regard to Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 and wrote as follows

         "I have to consider whether exceptional circumstances exist in this
         case such as to allow me to consider it outside of the  Immigration
         Rules.  I have found that the appellant did not know that  she  was
         pregnant when she entered the UK in July 2014.  She has given birth
         to a son who is a UK citizen who holds a UK passport and who she is
         breastfeeding.  She is married to a UK citizen who also holds a  UK
         passport.  Her husband works and at the date of the hearing in  all
         probability earns sufficient to meet the financial requirements  of
         Appendix FM if the appellant were to be returned to Ghana and  make
         an appropriate application  from  there.   If  the  appellant  were
         compelled to leave the UK she would have to decide whether to  take
         her son with her.  If she did he would be deprived of the care  and
         love of his father.  If she did not the opposite  would  apply  but
         the child would no longer have the benefit of  his  mother  feeding
         him.  In addition it is highly likely that the father would have to
         give up his employment to care for his son.  The impact of that  on
         his  earning  capacity  might  well  be  carried  through  to   the
         application to be made."

 3. On that basis he allowed the appeal outside the Rules.

The Grounds of Application

 4. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had failed to conduct an adequate assessment of  why  it  was
    considered that the claimant could not return to Ghana  to  obtain  the
    correct entry clearance.  There was no assessment of how long she would
    have to remain to enable her application to be processed and  how  this
    would render the decision disproportionate.  There was also no adequate
    assessment of her ability to meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM/SE,
    and in any event the fact that the claimant's husband is British and in
    employment does not in any way constitute an exceptional circumstance.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cox  on
    19th October 2015.

Submissions

 6. Mrs Petersen submitted that the judge had used Article 8 as  a  general
    dispensing provision.  He had failed to assess how long it  would  take
    her to apply for entry clearance  from  abroad.   She  asked  that  the
    decision be reversed.

 7. Mrs Khan submitted that the judge had reached a sustainable conclusion.
     He was right to take into account the welfare of the child who was  15
    months old at the date of the hearing.  She was  now  pregnant  with  a
    second child and should not be required to leave.



Consideration of Whether there is an Error of Law

 8.  The  judge  plainly  failed  to  take  into   account   all   relevant
    considerations, in particular the ability of the claimant to return  to
    Ghana to apply for entry clearance.

 9. In R (On the  Application  of  Chen)  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM-Chikwamba-
    temporary separation-proportionality) UKUT 2015 the Upper Tribunal held



         "Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question whether
         it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to  return  to
         his home country to make an entry clearance application  to  rejoin
         family members in the UK.  There may be cases in which there are no
         insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the
         UK but where temporary separation to enable an individual  to  make
         an application for entry clearance may be disproportionate.  In all
         cases it will be for the individual to place before  the  Secretary
         of State evidence that such  temporary  separation  will  interfere
         disproportionately with protected rights.  It will not be enough to
         rely solely upon case law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL
         40."

10. The claimant's circumstances are by no means unusual.  The judge simply
    did not adequately explain why he considered they were such that  leave
    should be granted outside the rules and  why  removal  would  interfere
    with her Article 8 rights.

11. Accordingly the decision is set aside.

Further Submissions

12. Mrs Petersen submitted that  on  the  evidence  before  the  judge  the
    sponsor was  earning  a  sufficient  sum  to  satisfy  the  maintenance
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.  It  appeared  that  he  had  over
    �18,600 from his main job which would meet the requirements, since  his
    two children were British and the rules did not require  an  additional
    sum for them.  There was no reason to conclude that there would be  any
    particular delay in an application for entry clearance.

13. Mrs Khan submitted that the claimant had been advised not to travel  by
    her midwife.  She risked being  separated  from  her  husband  and  two
    children for an indefinite period of time which could not be  in  their
    best interests.

Findings and Conclusions

14. The starting point in considering this appeal  is  the  fact  that  the
    claimant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   There
    then has  to  be  an  examination  of  whether  her  circumstances  are
    sufficiently compelling to require a grant of leave outside them, which
    includes an assessment of the  best  interests  of  the  children.   In
    reality, that comes down to the question of  the  return  to  Ghana  to
    enable an application for entry clearance to be processed.

15. The claimant has one child and is pregnant with  another.   It  may  be
    that she is unable to fly at the moment because of her  late  stage  of
    pregnancy, but she could make a voluntary  departure  as  soon  as  the
    child is born or if she becomes well enough to fly.  That in itself  is
    not a sufficient reason to require a grant of  leave  under  Article  8
    outside of the Rules.

16. The sponsor works for Bradford District Care Trust and according to his
    witness statement, he earns �17,353.60  gross,  for  a  30  hour  week,
    although the judge concluded that he  earned  a  little  more,  �21,100
    gross. He also had a second job with an  NHS  professionals  employment
    agency with a minimum 16 hours a week at an hourly rate  of  �7.79  per
    hour.

17. Mrs Khan said that he was no longer doing the extra work,  but  he  has
    been working as a health trainer administrative support with them since
    2013, and there is no reason why he could not start up with them again,
    or with another agency. The children would not be expected to leave the
    UK, as British citizens, but they could remain here for a short  period
    whilst the entry clearance application was processed.  The parties  are
    aware of the Immigration Rules and the maintenance  requirements  which
    they  have  to  satisfy,  and  they   have   the   benefit   of   legal
    representation. If properly  advised,  and  they  put  in  all  of  the
    required evidence as set out in Appendix FM/SE, there is no  reason  to
    think that there will be any undue delay in the claimant's  application
    for entry clearance.

18. The claimant has not argued that there are any difficulties per se  for
    her in staying in Ghana for a short period.

19. No circumstances  have  been  put  forward  which  establish  that  the
    temporary  separation  required  to  make  an  application  for   entry
    clearance  would  be  disproportionate  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    legitimate aim of maintaining law and order and immigration control.
