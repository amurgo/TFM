For the appellant:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Neeraj Kumar, date of birth  4.9.90,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is his attempt to appeal the determination of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Coates promulgated on 22.5.14, refusing to extend time to  appeal
    against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to  refuse   his   asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims and to remove him  from
    the UK under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999.   The
    Judge dealt with the matter on the papers on 13.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kamara  purported  to  grant  permission  to
    appeal on 18.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.10.14, listed as an appeal in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 5. There is no right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the  decision
    made under Rule 10 of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
    Rules 2005.

 6. The relevant provisions dealing with the right of appeal from decisions
    of the First-tier Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal are contained in  s.11
    of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 as follows:

          "11. Right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal

          (1) For the purposes of subsection (2), the reference to  a  right
         of appeal is to a right to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  any
         point of law  arising  from  a  decision  made  by  the  First-tier
         tribunal other than an excluded decision.

          (2) Any party to  a  case  has  a  right  of  appeal,  subject  to
         subsection (8).

          (3) That right may be  exercised  only  with  permission  (or,  in
         Northern Ireland, leave).

          (4) Permission (or leave) may be given by -

         (a) the First-tier Tribunal, or

         (b) the Upper Tribunal,

         on an application by a party."

 7. The right of appeal is from any decision of the First-tier Tribunal  on
    a point of law other than an "excluded decision." Section 11(5) of  the
    2007 Act sets out what, for  the  purposes  of  subsection  (1)  is  an
    "excluded" decision. None of the decisions in  s.11(5),  as  originally
    enacted, are relevant to this appeal. However, Article 3 of the Appeals
    (Excluded Decisions) Order  2009  (SI  2009/275  as  amended)  added  a
    further decision to the  category  of  "excluded  decisions"  which  is
    relevant. Article 3 states that:

          "3. For the purposes of section 11(1) and 13(1) of the  Tribunals,
         Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the  following  decisions  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal are excluded decisions -

         ....

         (m) any procedural,  ancillary  or  preliminary  decision  made  in
         relation to an appeal against a decision under section 40A  of  the
         British  National  Act  1981,  section  82,  83  or  83A   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, or regulations 26  of
         the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006."

 8. That provision reflects the wording of s.103A(7)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (now repealed) which excluded from  the
    category of decisions of the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  which
    could be subject to the reconsideration process  any  "decision  on  an
    appeal" which was "a procedural, ancillary  or  preliminary  decision".
    The words "procedural,  ancillary  or  preliminary"  which  define  the
    nature of the decision remain the same; the current provision (s.11(1))
    requires that the decision be "in relation to an  appeal",  whilst  the
    reconsideration framework (s.103A(7)) required it to be a decision  "on
    an appeal".

 9. There is no doubt that the decision in this  case  is  a  "preliminary"
    decision by the First-tier Tribunal. Indeed, rule 10(6) of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Procedure Rules states, inter alia, that

          "The Tribunal must decide any issue as  to  whether  a  notice  of
         appeal was given in  time,  or  whether  to  extend  the  time  for
         appealing, as a preliminary decision without a hearing..."

10. That reflects what must be the natural meaning, and  consequent  effect
    of, the legislative words initially in s.103A(7) of the  2002  Act  and
    now found in Art 3(m) of the 2009 Order as amended.

11. In the circumstances, Judge Kamara was in error to grant permission  to
    appeal. There can be no valid appeal before the Upper Tribunal  against
    the refusal of the First-tier Tribunal to extend time.

12. The appellant's only remedy is to seek Judicial Review.

Decision

13. There is no valid appeal before the Upper Tribunal. The decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal stands.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There was no fee payable in this case and thus there can be no  fee
award.
