                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. In a decision dated 7 February 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge  Allen  found
    an error of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cohen
    promulgated on 20 November 2019 which allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision to deport her dated 17 May 2019.  For
    ease I continue to refer to the parties as they were before the  First-
    tier Tribunal, with Ms Sobieraj as the Appellant and the  Secretary  of
    State as the Respondent.  This is  the  re-making  of  the  Appellant's
    appeal against deportation.

The appeal

Applicable law

 2. Pursuant to regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 (the  "EEA  Regulations"),  the  Respondent  may
    deport an EEA national where that person's removal is justified on  the
    grounds of public policy, public security or public health.   Any  such
    deportation must be in accordance with regulation 27 which provides  as
    follows:


        1) In this regulation, a "relevant decision" means an EEA  decision
           taken on the grounds of public policy, public security or public
           health.
        2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
        3) ...
        4) ...
        5) The public policy and public security requirements of the United
           Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred by  these
           Regulations in order to protect  the  fundamental  interests  of
           society, and where a relevant decision is taken  on  grounds  of
           public policy or public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles -
             a)  the  decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
                proportionality;
             b) the decision must  be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
                conduct of the person concerned;
             c) the personal conduct of the person must represent a genuine,
                present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
                fundamental interests of society, taking into  account  past
                conduct of the person and that the threat does not  need  to
                be imminent;
             d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or  which
                relate  to  considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
                justify the decision;
             e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do   not   in
                themselves justify the decision;
             f) the decision may be taken on preventative grounds,  even  in
                the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided  the
                grounds are specific to the person.
        6) Before taking a relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
           policy and public security in relation to a person ("P") who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  heath,
           family and economic situation of P, P's length of  residence  in
           the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural integration into the
           United Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's  country  of
           origin.
        7) ...
        8) A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements of this
           regulation are met must  (in  particular)  have  regard  to  the
           considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of public
           policy, public security and the fundamental interests of society
           etc).

 3. Further to regulation 27(8), Schedule 1 provides as follows:

       Considerations of public policy and public security


        1. The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of  public  policy
           or public security  values;  Member  States  enjoy  considerable
           discretion, acting within the parameters set by the EU Treaties,
           applied where relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own
           standards of public policy and  public  security,  for  purposes
           tailored to their individual contexts, from time to time.

       Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom


        2. An EEA national or the family member of an EEA  national  having
           extensive familial and societal links with persons of  the  same
           nationality or language does not amount to  integration  in  the
           United Kingdom; a  significant  degree  of  wider  cultural  and
           societal integration must be present  before  a  person  may  be
           regarded as integrated in the United Kingdom.
        3. Where an EEA national or the family member of  an  EEA  national
           has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent  offender,
           the longer the sentence, or the more numerous  the  convictions,
           the greater  the  likelihood  that  the  individual's  continued
           presence in the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present and
           sufficiently serious threat affecting the fundamental  interests
           of society.
        4. Little weight is to be attached to the  integration  of  an  EEA
           national or the family member of  an  EEA  national  within  the
           United Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were  formed  at
           or around the same time as -
             a) the commission of a criminal offence;
             b) an act otherwise  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
                society;
             c) the EEA national or family member of an EEA national was  in
                custody.
        5. The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA  national  or  the
           family member  of  an  EEA  national  who  is  able  to  provide
           substantive evidence of not demonstrating a threat (for example,
           through demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member
           of an EEA national has successfully reformed  or  rehabilitated)
           is less likely to be proportionate.
        6.  It  is  consistent  with  public  policy  and  public  security
           requirements in the United Kingdom that  EEA  decisions  may  be
           taken to refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right  otherwise
           conferred by these Regulations in the case of abuse of rights or
           fraud, including -
             a) entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person to
                enter or to attempt to enter, a marriage, civil  partnership
                or durable partnership of convenience; or
             b) fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain, or assisting
                another to obtain or to attempt to obtain, a right to reside
                under these Regulations.

       The fundamental interests of society


        7. For the purposes of these Regulations, the fundamental interests
           of society in the United Kingdom include -
             a) preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the immigration
                laws, and maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the
                immigration   control   system   (including   under    these
                Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;
             b) maintaining public order;
             c) preventing social harm;
             d) preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;
             e) protecting public services;
             f) excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of an
                EEA national with a conviction (including where the  conduct
                of that person is likely to cause, or has  in  fact  caused,
                public  offence)  and  maintain  public  confidence  in  the
                ability of the relevant authorities to take such action;
             g) tackling offence likely to cause harm to  society  where  an
                immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify  but
                where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related
                to  the  misuse  of  drugs  or  crime  with  a  cross-border
                dimension as mentioned in Article 8391) of the Treat on  the
                Functioning of the European Union);
             h) combating the effects of persistent offending  (particularly
                in relation to offences, which if taken  in  isolation,  may
                otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation
                27);
             i) protecting the rights and freedoms of  others,  particularly
                from exploitation and trafficking;
             j) protecting the public;
             k) acting in the best interests of  a  child  (including  where
                doing so entails refusing a child admission  to  the  United
                Kingdom, or otherwise  taking  an  EEA  decision  against  a
                child);
             l) countering terrorism and  extremism  and  protecting  shared
                values.


 1. Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations sets  out  an  increased  level  of
    protection in certain circumstances as follows:

       (3)    A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
           with a right of permanent residence under regulation  15  except
           on serious grounds of public policy and public security.


       (4)    A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
           grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who -
           (a)    has a right of permanent residence  under  regulation  15
                and who has resided in the United Kingdom for  a  continuous
                period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision;
                or ...

 2. Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations  sets  out  the  circumstances  in
    which a  person  acquires  the  right  of  permanent  residence,  which
    includes, for present purposes, an EEA national who has resided in  the
    United Kingdom in accordance with the EEA Regulations for a  continuous
    period of five years.  An EEA national is entitled to an initial period
    of residence in the United Kingdom for a period of three  months  under
    Regulation 13 of the EEA Regulations and thereafter,  under  Regulation
    14, is entitled to reside here for as long as they remain  a  qualified
    person (as defined in Regulation 6).

Explanation for the refusal

 3. The Respondent served the Appellant  with  a  notice  of  liability  to
    deportation under the EEA Regulations on 20 April  2018  following  her
    convictions on 29 September 2017 for conspiracy to  act  to  facilitate
    the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person and
    on 16 October 2017 for conspiracy to act to facilitate  the  commission
    of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU  person.   The  Appellant
    was sentenced on 3 November 2019 to seven years' imprisonment  for  the
    first conspiracy, with a further five years' imprisonment for  the  use
    or possession of criminal property and six years' imprisonment for  the
    second conspiracy; all to run concurrently.

 4. The Respondent decided to make a deportation order on 17  May  2019  on
    the basis that the Appellant had committed serious criminal offences in
    the United Kingdom with a real risk  that  she  may  re-offend  in  the
    future.  The Appellant had not made  any  representations  against  her
    deportation and overall the Respondent considered  that  the  Appellant
    posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to one of  the
    fundamental interests of society and that her deportation was justified
    on the grounds of public policy in accordance with regulation  23(6)(b)
    and overall the decision to deport was proportionate.

 5. The Appellant appealed against the  decision  on  31  May  2019,  which
    included details of the Appellant's relationship with her  partner  and
    daughter; pursuant to which the Respondent sought  further  information
    which was provided.  As a result, the Respondent issued a supplementary
    decision letter dated 7 August 2019 which maintained  the  decision  to
    deport but with much more  detailed  reasons.   First,  the  Respondent
    considered the Appellant's  claimed  period  of  residence  from  2004.
    There was no evidence of when  the  Appellant  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom and the documentary evidence she  provided  was  dated  between
    2017 and 2019.  The Respondent sought further information from HMRC  as
    to employment, which showed total income,  primarily  from  Southampton
    PCT, as well as with  Best  Connection  Group  and  Simple  Recruitment
    services as follows:


         2006/07 - Southampton PCT �4423.66
         2007/08 - Southampton PCT �3105.94
         2008/09 - Southampton PCT �1593.33
         2009/10 - Southampton PCT �1100.03
         2010/11 - Southampton PCT �124.63
         2011/12 - Best Connection Group �796.02
         2012/13 - Simple Recruitment Services - �153.52
         2013/14 - �0
         2014/15 onwards - no employment recorded.

 6. The Respondent did not  accept  that  the  earnings  were  genuine  and
    effective to reflect a whole year's continuous employment such that  it
    was not accepted that the Appellant had  established  that  she  had  a
    sufficient employment history  for  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom for a continuous five-year period and it was noted  that
    the Appellant was involved in criminal activity between 2009 and  2016.
    The Appellant had  not  acquired  permanent  residence.   Further,  the
    Respondent did not accept that  the  Appellant  has  been  continuously
    resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  exercising  treaty  rights  for   a
    continuous ten year period.  As such, the Appellant was  entitled  only
    to the basic level of protection on public policy  or  public  security
    grounds under the EEA Regulations.

 7. In assessing  the  level  of  risk,  the  Respondent  referred  to  the
    Appellant's criminal offending, impact  on  the  wider  community,  the
    sentencing remarks and the OASys assessment.  The overall assessment of
    the Appellant posing a low risk of reoffending was  however  considered
    to be in conflict with the written comments in  the  report,  including
    the Appellant's denial of any involvement in the first  conspiracy  and
    was yet to accept responsibility for her  actions;  that  the  offences
    were financially motivated; that any  further  offending  from  similar
    offences would cause serious harm and that the Appellant has refused to
    engage in work relating to her past behaviour (with no evidence of  any
    courses being undertaken in custody).  The Respondent  considered  that
    there was no evidence that the Appellant has distanced herself from her
    criminal associates or that  she  would  be  able  to  support  herself
    financially on release and had previously used a number of alias  names
    and dates of birth.  Overall, the Respondent decided that the Appellant
    had a  propensity  to  re-offend  and  posed  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the public to justify deportation on the
    grounds of public policy.

 8. The Appellant's circumstances were considered, including that  she  was
    in good health, had some employment and  relationships  in  the  United
    Kingdom, spoke Polish, had spent the majority of her life in Poland and
    would be able to seek employment and reintegration there.   There was a
    lack of evidence of rehabilitation in the United Kingdom and no  reason
    why work  in  this  area  could  not  be  undertaken  in  Poland.   The
    Appellant's deportation was considered to be proportionate.

 9. The Respondent gave separate consideration to the Appellant's right  to
    respect for private and family life under Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights, finding that she did not meet  any  of  the
    exceptions to deportation  in  paragraphs  399  and  following  of  the
    Immigration Rules and there were no very  compelling  circumstances  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.

The appeal

10. The Appellant appeals, in summary, on the basis that she is entitled to
    a level of enhanced protection against deportation on  the  basis  that
    she has acquired a permanent right of residence in the  United  Kingdom
    and further that she has more than  ten  years'  continuous  residence;
    that she does not pose a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat to one of the fundamental interests of society and  overall  her
    deportation is not proportionate.   Further,  in  the  alternative  the
    Appellant appeals on the basis that her deportation would be in  breach
    of her right to respect for private and family life under Article 8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Appellant's evidence

11. In her  written  statement  signed  and  dated  5  November  2019,  the
    Appellant states that she came to the United Kingdom in  2004  to  work
    and study, with her first job as a receptionist in a casino  and  after
    that she worked as an interpreter on an employed and then self-employed
    basis.  She states that at all times in the United Kingdom she has been
    working or job-seeking other than her period of maternity  leave.   The
    Appellant is unable to recall the exact dates of  her  employment,  but
    worked as an interpreter in the NHS between 2006 and 2010, with  Access
    to Communication and Wessex Translation.  Her translation work  varied,
    with some weeks working every day and other weeks the Appellant was not
    needed at all.  Other than periods of illness, she never went more than
    a few days without a shift.

12. The Appellant states that she has lived in the United  Kingdom  for  15
    years and has no remaining ties to Poland, with no  friends  of  family
    there and her whole life is based in the United Kingdom, including with
    her partner and daughter (born in September 2015).

13. In relation to the Appellant's offending, she states  that  she  became
    involved in sham marriages when she was young  and  single  and  didn't
    think about the consequences and only understood what  she  had  become
    involved in through a client who she interpreted for  when  the  police
    intervened.  The Appellant  had  not  been  involved  in  any  criminal
    activity for some time before she started  her  relationship  with  her
    partner.

14. The Appellant describes difficulties with her partner  as  new  parents
    and at a stressful  time  leading  up  to  her  criminal  trial;  which
    involved a volatile situation where they both lost control.  The  worst
    incident involved the  Appellant  stabbing  her  partner  without  even
    realising what had happened and she can not imagine how they  got  into
    that position.  As a  result,  social  services  became  involved,  the
    Appellant's daughter was placed on the child  protection  register  and
    home assessments were made weekly.  The Appellant believes that  social
    services did not take a balanced view of the case, having already  been
    involved  on  a  previous  occasion  of  domestic  violence  when   the
    Appellant's partner restrained her on the sofa during an  argument  and
    the police were called; but no further  action  was  taken  then.   The
    Appellant felt threatened by one social worker and  made  a  complaint.
    It is not true that she refused to engage  with  any  anger  management
    course, just that it was not practical for her and her partner to do it
    at the same time for childcare reasons and  before  the  Appellant  was
    able to obtain a date for her to do the course, she was  sentenced  for
    her criminal offences.  In prison she has undertaken  anger  management
    and other courses to address what happened  and  prevent  it  happening
    again.

15. The Appellant has maintained regular contact with her  daughter  during
    her imprisonment, with her  partner  becoming  her  daughter's  primary
    carer (for which he has had to  give  up  work  and  now  suffers  from
    depression) with assistance from the Appellant's mother.  The Appellant
    describes the difficulties of separation for all of them, both everyday
    and on special occasions.

16. The Appellant anticipates that  leaving  custody  will  be  hard,  with
    anxiety and stress and does not think that she could manage on  top  of
    that if she is deported to Poland and separated from her  family.   The
    Appellant's partner does not speak Polish and would have little if  any
    job prospects in Poland, he is settled in the United  Kingdom  and  has
    family here.  There is no support network available to the Appellant on
    return to Poland, so she does not know how she would  support  herself,
    find employment or accommodation.  The Appellant's partner and daughter
    would not be able to afford  regular  visits  to  Poland  and  indirect
    contact is not the same.

17. The Appellant states she is a different person to  when  she  committed
    her offences, with her thinking and perception having changed, with her
    priority being a mother and her relationship  is  also  now  completely
    different with both parties having the skills now  to  deal  with  each
    other in a different way and without reacting badly  or  risking  their
    daughter  seeing  any  further  incidents  between  them.   The  family
    continued to live together after the most serious incident for  a  year
    before the Appellant was sentenced and there were no further incidents.
     The Appellant intends to return to the family  home  on  release  from
    prison.

18. In prison the Appellant has completed a  number  of  courses  including
    level 2 beauty, business enterprise level 2 (currently working on level
    3) and has  started  an  Open  University  course  in  criminology  and
    psychology.  She intends to find employment on release and  would  like
    to work in the housing industry or administration and does not think it
    would be a good idea to return to interpreting.

19. At the oral hearing, the Appellant confirmed her details,  adopted  her
    written statement and gave oral evidence  in  English.   The  Appellant
    gave an update as to recent circumstances for her and in particular the
    impact of Covid-19 on life in  prison  and  on  the  lack  of  physical
    visits, as well as causing a delay to  her  application  to  study  the
    second year of her criminology course. The Appellant has been appointed
    as a peer mentor to emotionally  support  vulnerable  women,  help  new
    arrivals in prison, help with reading and writing,  reporting  bullying
    or harassment and as part of her role has a  weekly  meeting  with  the
    prison governor. The Appellant also stated that she had applied  for  a
    position with the City of London as a social worker, for which she  was
    accepted but which she has not been able to commence because of  Covid-
    19. Following her release from prison she states that a job is  waiting
    for her doing this (albeit there is no documentary evidence of this).

20. In cross-examination, the Appellant confirmed that she had no remaining
    connections with anyone or anything in Poland  and  had  not  made  any
    attempts to search for connections which had been lost. Her mother  had
    one brother who passed away 15 to 20 years ago who had  never  married.
    She doesn't know very much about her father's side of  the  family.  Mr
    Lindsay suggested that this was not credible  but  the  Appellant  said
    that she only spoke from the heart and did not intend to mislead.  When
    asked about her criminal trial in that respect, she stated that she had
    learned from her mistakes and it was not her intention to mislead.  She
    stated that at the time of her offending, she felt young, inexperienced
    and na�ve and the offences were about a lack of  maturity  rather  than
    her age.

21. The Appellant could not remember exactly when her relationship started,
    at some point between 2014 and 2015 and she was  not  involved  in  any
    criminal activity for a long time before the start of her relationship.
    When referred to her conviction for crimes continuing  up  until  2016,
    the Appellant stated that she could not remember the exact dates, there
    were efforts to trace a conspiracy over  a  long  period  of  time  and
    involving other  people  but  she  had  not  been  involved  after  her
    relationship had started. The Appellant stated  that  she  regrets  her
    offending, does not deny it and has learned from her mistakes.  It  was
    not her intention to commit crime at the time and she did not  consider
    the consequences of her actions.

22. The Appellant has been in prison for some time and has  no  connections
    in Poland, such that she cannot work or  support  herself.  She  states
    that her Polish is not as good as it was before she  hasn't  spoken  it
    for a long time. She accepted that she had worked as an interpreter but
    could remember for  how  long,  that  she  has  lost  fluency  and  her
    interpreting  role  was  mainly  on   technical   terms   for   medical
    appointments rather than conversational. The Appellant  does  not  know
    whether she would have any access to services employment in  Poland  as
    she has not been there for a long time.  The  Appellant's  partner  and
    daughter have never been to Poland, she doesn't  know  the  job  market
    there and she will also need to adjust  on  release  from  prison.  The
    couple don't know what they would do if the Appellant was deported  and
    they had not thought of a scenario of  them  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom with her in Poland, the Appellant stated that  she  didn't  see
    why she shouldn't have a chance to be in the United  Kingdom  with  her
    daughter.

23. As to employment  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Appellant  could  not
    remember her highest earnings, stated that it was only  suspicion  that
    she worked for short periods and overall stated that she has had enough
    time to think about the past and only wants  to  think  of  the  future
    without reflecting on what has already gone. The Appellant  again  said
    that when she offended she had no family and no child,  her  priorities
    are different now, she has learned from  her  mistakes  and  would  not
    jeopardise her daughter.

24. I asked the Appellant's supplementary questions.  The  Appellant  could
    not remember when she arrived in the United Kingdom other than  it  was
    in 2004, maybe May. She worked as an interpreter but could not remember
    her working pattern, with some weeks being full-time  and  some  months
    full-time. The Appellant could not remember when she last worked  other
    than it was sometime between 2014 and 2016.

25. I asked the Appellant what it was that made  her  stop  offending.  She
    stated that previously she only had herself to worry about and once you
    have a partner there was a different priority. Previously she had  less
    worries and less responsibility. The offending stopped when she changed
    her mind set, referring to considering the consequences  and  what  you
    are doing more when you meet a person  that  you  love.  The  Appellant
    stated that she stopped offending after her  relationship  started  but
    before her daughter was born. As a new parent in prison  the  Appellant
    has undertaken a life skills course, which covers parenting, as well as
    others. This included the enough is enough course. There is no  ongoing
    contact with social services.

The Appellant's partner's evidence

26. In his  written  statement  signed  and  dated  7  November  2019,  the
    Appellant's partner stated that he met the Appellant in early 2014  and
    they started dating in March that year.  The Appellant was working full-
    time as an interpreter at that time.  In July 2014, the Appellant  told
    her partner that she was being  investigated  for  sham  marriages  and
    assured him that she had nothing to do with anything like that anymore.

27. The Appellant and her partner moved in together in June/July  2015  and
    their daughter was born in September 2015.  After  that  and  with  the
    stress of the  criminal  proceedings,  the  relationship  suffered  and
    became  volatile  with  more  arguments.   During  one  argument,   the
    Appellant's partner thought she was  going  to  hit  him,  he  went  to
    restrain her and dropped her onto the sofa.   Neither  intended  to  be
    violent but read each other wrong in the heat of  the  moment  and  the
    police were called.  After that they learned to control their responses
    and if things escalated, the Appellant's partner would leave and  spend
    the  night  elsewhere.   The  Appellant's  partner  had   a   difficult
    relationship with her mother who lived with them and on  two  or  three
    occasions she called the police accusing him of attacking the Appellant
    and locking her in a room and other lies.

28. On one occasion, the Appellant's partner heard  shouting  and  saw  the
    Appellant being attacked by her mother  (with  their  daughter  in  the
    room), so he pulled her free and was then attacked by  the  Appellant's
    mother, who he removed from the house.  The police  were  called  again
    who told the adults to be cautious given there was a young child at the
    property.

29. The Appellant and her partner moved to a new property in November 2016,
    following which there was a significant argument as the Appellant would
    not let her partner in the property  and  when  he  went  to  give  his
    daughter a kiss and a cuddle, he thought the Appellant had thumped  him
    on the back of the shoulder.  Only afterwards did he  realise  that  he
    had been stabbed, although she did not realise that  is  what  she  had
    done.   This  incident  is  described  as  a  turning  point   in   the
    relationship with agreement to change so this would never happen again.
     The couple decided to stay together make major changes  to  deal  with
    tensions between them.

30.  As  in  the  Appellant's  written  statement,  her  partner  describes
    involvement with social services, him undertaking  a  parenting  course
    and the Appellant simply not  being  able  to  do  so  before  she  was
    imprisoned.

31. The Appellant's partner made peace with the Appellant's mother and they
    have supported his daughter since.

32. The Appellant's partner describes his daughter  being  distressed  when
    the Appellant was imprisoned, initial difficulties  with  contact  with
    her in prison and then regular visits and contact when  permitted.  The
    Appellant's partner describes his life being turned upside down and the
    lack of support from the Appellant, together with him needing to  cease
    employment for childcare and because of  adverse  effects  on  his  own
    mental health. He is suffering from depression and has been  prescribed
    medication for this.

33. The Appellant's partner was born in the  United  Kingdom,  all  of  his
    family are here, including his father, brother and two sisters,  living
    locally and with whom he has regular contact. The  Appellant's  partner
    also has two older daughters and a granddaughter (who attends the  same
    nursery as the Appellant's daughter). The Appellant's partner would not
    be able to relocate to Poland, away from his family, where he would  be
    isolated and where he doesn't speak the language (which he doesn't know
    if he could now learn) and where he would be unable to find employment.
    If the Appellant  were  returned  to  Poland,  her  partner  would  not
    financially be able to keep up regular visits to see her.

34. The Appellant's partner is  confident  that  the  Appellant  would  not
    commit any further offences, stating that what she did was  years  ago,
    in completely different circumstances when she wasn't in a relationship
    and didn't have a child. He says it is not an excuse but at  that  time
    she had nothing to lose and hadn't thought through the consequences  of
    what she was doing.

35. The Appellant's  partner  attended  the  oral  hearing,  confirmed  his
    details, adopted his  written  statement  and  gave  oral  evidence  in
    English.  He also described the additional difficulties of  maintaining
    contact with the Appellant during Covid-19, with his daughter not being
    able to understand why they couldn't see the Appellant. The Appellant's
    daughter has settled into school well this  year,  making  friends  but
    wants her mum to be involved. The Appellant's partner has started  work
    again.

36. In cross examination, the Appellant's partner stated that  he  did  not
    know what he and his daughter would do if the Appellant is deported  to
    Poland because he does not understand what the  situation  there  would
    be, whether there would be access to employment and education and where
    they would be removed from friends and family in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The Appellant's partner stated that he was old enough to be able to get
    on with it and adapt, but it would be difficult for his daughter to  be
    taken away from everything  that  she  knows.  He  has  not  considered
    whether there would be any immigration difficulties in relocation.

37. I asked the Appellant's partner supplementary questions. He stated that
    he met the Appellant around July 2014 and knew of the criminal offences
    after the Appellant had had a visit from the Home Office and  she  told
    him about it. The Appellant's partner knew about her involvement in the
    past, but she had stopped offending probably a year or two before  they
    were together and before she was pregnant. He believes  that  this  was
    because the Appellant wanted to settle  down  and  have  a  child.  The
    Appellant's partner stated that the last contact the  family  had  with
    social services was about three years ago, not long after the Appellant
    was imprisoned.

38. In re-examination the Appellant's partner stated that they had complied
    with social services  requests,  had  already  undertaken  a  parenting
    course and made  significant  improvements  in  the  relationship  even
    before the Appellant was imprisoned.

Other written evidence

39. The Appellant's mother made a written statement,  signed  and  dated  7
    November 2019. She states that she has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 16 April 2004 and since arrival has worked until she  retired  in
    March 2015. The Appellant and her daughter are the only family that she
    has in the United Kingdom and as she is  progressively  suffering  from
    ill health, she is hoping that the Appellant will be  able  to  support
    her on her  release  from  prison.  The  Appellant's  mother  has  been
    actively involved in the upbringing of her  granddaughter  and  she  is
    concerned that if the Appellant is deported, it  is  her  granddaughter
    who will be punished most.

40. The Appellant relies upon a  Family  Impact  Assessment  from  Laurence
    Chester, a qualified Social Worker dated 13 October 2019.   The  report
    was prepared following a visit with  the  Appellant,  her  partner  and
    their daughter at the prison  and  by  reference  to  relevant  written
    materials.  In relation to domestic violence, the report refers to both
    adults saying that they have completed  parenting  courses,  understand
    how children can be hurt by domestic violence and that they are sure it
    would not  happen  again.  In  relation  to  the  Appellant's  criminal
    offending, it is recorded that the Appellant said it  was  the  biggest
    mistake of her life and that she had already changed by  the  time  her
    daughter was born.

41. The report records both adults suffering from  mental  health  problems
    and difficulties caused by the separation from imprisonment.

42. The Social Work report finds that this is a loving  close-knit  family,
    with the impact  of  the  Appellant's  imprisonment  mitigated  by  the
    support of the wider family and that if the  Appellant  were  deported,
    her daughter is likely to experience even  more  significant  emotional
    distress due to a significant sense of loss. Evidence is referred to as
    to the adverse impact on a child of  separation  from  a  parent,  with
    significant emotional developmental harm.  The  author  notes  that  it
    would also be emotionally harmful to remove the child to live in Poland
    with her family given the separation from her wider  family  and  given
    that the Appellant's partner has no knowledge of life in Poland and  no
    means of support, it was reasonable to be  concerned  that  the  family
    would face a life of destitution, with no social family connections and
    no access to financial support or housing from the state.

43. In conclusion, the author considers that  the  Appellant's  deportation
    would be unduly harsh on both her and her  daughter,  with  a  profound
    adverse impact on the child's emotional well-being; together  with  the
    concern about further deterioration of the mental health of the adults.
    There are concerns as to access to  education,  healthcare  and  public
    services for the Appellant's partner  and  daughter  in  Poland,  which
    would represent significant obstacles  to  the  family  being  able  to
    establish a life there. There is further reference  to  domestic  abuse
    and the adults presenting as  sincere  in  their  commitment  never  to
    subject their daughter to  the  impact  of  witnessing  domestic  abuse
    again.

44. The Appellant's bundle includes a letter from Choice for  Change  dated
    28 May 2019, confirming that the Appellant has attended 25  counselling
    sessions between July 2018 and January 2019 during which she  processed
    separation and related issues about her relationship with her  partner,
    understanding parenting and learned to be  more  reflective  about  her
    responses and accepted challenges to her established thinking patterns.

45. The Appellant's bundle contains a number of documents about  education,
    courses and employment, before and during the Appellant's imprisonment.
     At the hearing the Appellant also handed in two documents from prison,
    including a certificate of achievement and details as a mentor. I  have
    taken all of these into account in my decision,  returning  below  more
    detail to the evidence of employment that is available.



Closing submissions

46. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Lindsay relied on the two  reasons  for
    refusal letters, subject to accepting that if it  was  found  that  the
    Appellant had acquired  permanent  residence  and  also  had  10  years
    residence in the United Kingdom,  that  imperative  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security could not be met on the facts of  this  case.
    However, it was submitted that the Appellant has not  established  that
    she had acquired permanent residence or completed 10 years residence in
    accordance with the EEA Regulations.

47. The evidence before the Upper Tribunal does not  demonstrate  that  the
    Appellant has 5 years of continuous residence  in  the  United  Kingdom
    exercising treaty rights here. The evidence that is available from HMRC
    shows only that she has worked for at least some part of the years that
    she has spent in the United Kingdom. The highest earnings recorded when
    the year 2006/07 which totalled �4423.66, a figure low enough that they
    may have only been accrued for a short period of work. The  Appellant's
    lowest earnings were in 2011/12, there are no details of start and  end
    dates of employment and whether or not employment was part-time or full-
    time. Given the low level of earnings in multiple years,  the  Tribunal
    cannot be confident that the Appellant was  in  genuine  and  effective
    employment during this period.  It  was  submitted  overall,  that  the
    burden is on the Appellant to establish continuous employment  and  she
    has simply failed to do so on the documentary  evidence  and  her  oral
    evidence was unclear, only referring to not wanting  to  dwell  on  the
    past.

48. In the absence of establishing permanent residence, the Appellant  also
    cannot show 10 years continuous residence in the United Kingdom because
    permanent residence is a prerequisite for  this.  The  Respondent  also
    questioned the Appellant's social and  cultural  integration  into  the
    United Kingdom in any event given the nature, extent  and  duration  of
    her criminal offending which would not meet this threshold.

49. In the circumstances, the Respondent submitted that the  Appellant  was
    entitled  only  to  the  lowest  level  of  protection  under  the  EEA
    Regulations, that of public policy or public security.

50. Mr Lindsay submitted that the Appellant was not a credible witness. She
    was someone who had a long and significant  history  of  dishonesty  on
    immigration matters and had committed  significant  criminal  offences.
    There was a long course of offending, with  two  separate  conspiracies
    running between 2009 and 2016, a seven year period of criminality.  The
    Appellant went through her first trial  protesting  her  innocence  and
    even during her  OASys  assessment  in  2018,  sought  to  deny  and/or
    minimise responsibility for her criminal offending. That  approach  has
    been maintained even in evidence before the Upper Tribunal.

51. The Appellant stated in her written statement that she was not involved
    in criminal activity for some time  before  her  relationship  started;
    which was clearly not true and she changed her evidence on  this  point
    in response to questions.

52. The Respondent does not take any issue with the  Appellant's  partner's
    credibility, the submissions focusing only on the Appellant.

53. As to whether the Appellant poses a threat to the fundamental interests
    of society and the United Kingdom, it is noted that in  the  sentencing
    remarks,  the  Appellant's  offending  struck  at  the  heart  of   the
    immigration system. The Respondent submits that the risk of reoffending
    is higher than the conclusion suggests in the OASys  report,  which  is
    based  on  statistical  calculations  and   static   factors,   without
    considering that the Appellant committed the crimes for financial  gain
    and where there was no evidence of any improved financial  security  on
    release to reduce the risk of reoffending for the same reasons. It  was
    also submitted that even a low risk of reoffending had to  be  balanced
    against the nature of the offending and the very serious risk  of  harm
    if a further similar offence was committed. An  additional  matter  not
    relevant to  the  statistical  assessment  is  also  the  reference  to
    previous incidents of domestic violence, which would also be a criminal
    matter even  in  the  absence  of  charge  or  conviction.  Mr  Lindsay
    submitted that notwithstanding the courses undertaken by the  Appellant
    in prison, there  are  real  reasons  for  concern  that  the  risk  of
    reoffending was at least as high, if not higher than  set  out  in  the
    OASys report.

54. As to the final proportionality assessment, there has to be  a  balance
    between the circumstances of the Appellant and her  family  as  against
    the level of seriousness of the threat of reoffending and in this  case
    it is sufficiently high to outweigh the family's interests.

55. The social work report sets out the likely adverse impact on  a  child,
    which is sadly the normal consequences of deportation and in this  case
    it is open to the family to choose whether  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom without the Appellant or relocate to Poland. There is no reason
    why  the  Appellant  cannot  work  and  support  visits  there  and  no
    immigration  difficulties  have  been  identified  for  the  family  to
    relocate to Poland. The  burden  is  on  the  Appellant  to  prove  the
    assertions that there would  not  be  adequate  access  to  employment,
    healthcare or education for any of the family, but there is a  lack  of
    evidence of  any  such  difficulties  and  the  Social  Worker  is  not
    qualified to comment on likely conditions on return to Poland.  It  was
    submitted that the Appellant has not seriously  turned  her  mind  what
    would happen return to Poland which undermines the bare assertions that
    she has made about what would happen on return. Aspects of  the  Social
    Work report do not reflect reality, in part been based  on  assumptions
    that a young child with primary attachments could not reasonably locate
    to another country where this case the family has a choice.

56. In relation to domestic violence, the  Social  Worker  states  that  he
    found that the adults were sincere, but appears to accept what  he  has
    been told uncritically, without reference to any the documents, without
    reference to the Appellant's history  of  dishonesty  and  without  any
    further questions being asked. There is no apparent resolution  of  the
    conflict in the evidence.

57. The Social Worker also strays outside of his  role  and  competence  by
    concluding that the impact of deportation  would  be  unduly  harsh  on
    family members, which for present purposes is a legal test.

58. In conclusion,  the  Respondent  submits  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed under the EEA Regulations. Finally,  the  Appellant  has  not
    directly relied on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights
    in the alternative but in any event it was submitted that it would  not
    be unduly harsh on  the  Appellant's  partner  or  daughter  either  to
    relocate to Poland or to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
    Appellant. Given the Appellant's length of sentence, she would  in  any
    event need to show very compelling circumstances  over  and  above  the
    exceptions to deportation to outweigh the significant  public  interest
    in her deportation. The same submissions as has  previously  been  made
    were relied upon, that there  were  no  very  compelling  circumstances
    given the strength of public interest in this case and a legitimate aim
    which goes beyond reoffending but also clearly includes the maintenance
    of effective immigration controls.

59. On behalf of the Appellant, Ms Reid relied on her skeleton argument and
    reiterated the primary submission that the appellant had  acquired  not
    only permanent residence but also 10 years continuous lawful  residence
    in the United Kingdom and in those circumstances it was  accepted  that
    there was insufficient justification for deportation imperative  public
    policy or public security grounds.

60. The Appellant relied on  the  documentary  evidence  of  her  work  and
    residence in the United Kingdom, with the documents painting a  picture
    not of sporadic bookings as an interpreter but a person  whose  working
    days fluctuated with a different level of bookings. The  Appellant  has
    accepted that this employment was not sustainable in the long term  and
    has taken steps  to  look  for  different  employment  in  the  future.
    However,  her  work  as  an  interpreter  was  genuine  and   effective
    employment, with fluctuating work and some health problems with periods
    where the Appellant was unable to work for this reason.

61. The Appellant's first employment was from 17 September 2004 in a casino
    and five years from that date  takes  her  to  September  2009.  It  is
    accepted that there were no P60 documents past the  year  ending  April
    2009 but the HMRC records show some employment in the tax years 2009/10
    and 2010/11, albeit the latter at a very low level.  It  was  submitted
    that even low levels of earnings  can  still  however  be  genuine  and
    effective employment.  It was accepted on behalf of the Appellant  that
    there was only limited documentary evidence of employment available.

62. Ms Reid submitted that  even  if  the  Appellant  had  not  established
    permanent residence or 10 years continuous  lawful  residence  and  was
    only entitled to the basic level of protection, the Respondent has  not
    shown that her deportation would be justified in particular, it has not
    been established that the Appellant's  conduct  represents  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  public  security.  The
    Appellant has acknowledged that she has made significant past mistakes,
    but in reality all of her criminality has been around  one  aspect  and
    there has been no further offending. The OASys assessment is  that  the
    Appellant is a low risk of reoffending and a low risk of  serious  harm
    and the Appellant has taken steps to  improve  her  qualifications  and
    employment prospects  and  therefore  her  financial  circumstances  on
    release from prison. Specifically, the Appellant has started  a  degree
    course with the Open University, she  has  been  given  a  position  of
    responsibility in prison and has given oral evidence  about  employment
    prospects as a social worker on release.  The  Appellant's  partner  is
    supportive of her, is in employment and  can  support  the  family.  In
    addition, there is compelling evidence of the effect on  the  Appellant
    of responsibility  for  her  daughter,  a  significant  factor  against
    reoffending. There is documentary evidence  of  courses  undertaken  in
    prison, including counselling to address the Appellant's behaviours and
    to lead to improvements in her relationship.

63. The Appellant and her partner have both given written and oral evidence
    about following advice, engaging with social services and reducing  the
    risk of any further domestic violence incidents. The  OASys  assessment
    that the Appellant poses a medium risk of harm to a known adult  and  a
    known child should be seen in that context.

64. The Appellant relies on the Social Work report on the adverse impact on
    the Appellant's daughter if she were to be  deported  to  Poland,  with
    particular reference to the evidence of wider family  relationships  in
    the United Kingdom and the establishment of their daughter here. In all
    the circumstances it is submitted that given the  nature  of  offending
    and the family circumstances and United  Kingdom,  deportation  is  not
    proportionate.

65. In essence, the same points are relied upon in relation to Article 8 of
    the European Convention Human Rights, albeit it is  accepted  that  the
    EEA Regulations offer a high level of protection than these provisions.

Findings and reasons

Level of protection under the EEA Regulations

66. The first issue to determine is what level of protection the  Appellant
    benefits  from,  determined  by  whether  she  has  acquired  permanent
    residence in the United Kingdom by five years' continuous residence  in
    accordance with the EEA Regulations, and if so, whether in addition she
    has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period in excess  of
    10 years.

67. As acknowledged on behalf of the Appellant by Ms Reid, there is limited
    documentary evidence as to the Appellant's  employment  in  the  United
    Kingdom (and no schedule of this was produced  which  would  have  been
    helpful) and this lack of evidence is not assisted by  any  written  or
    oral evidence by the Appellant who claims to have  little  recollection
    of dates or specific information  and  when  asked  specifically  about
    straightforward employment matters, repeatedly stated that she did  not
    wish to dwell  on  the  past  and  only  looked  to  the  future.   The
    Appellant's evidence even on this factual matter was vague, lacking  in
    any useful detail and was far from comprehensive, amounting  in  places
    to little more than bare assertion.  The burden is on the Appellant  to
    establish she has acquired permanent residence, and  if  so,  10  years
    continuous residence.  For the reasons set out below,  I  do  not  find
    that she  has  discharged  this  burden  to  establish  even  permanent
    residence.

68. There is no evidence before the Tribunal of when the Appellant came  to
    the United Kingdom other than her statement that  it  was  sometime  in
    2004.  There is no evidence of  any  study  at  anytime  prior  to  her
    imprisonment and no specific  evidence  of  any  job-seeking;  although
    there is documentary evidence of an amount  of  �471.26  of  jobseekers
    allowance for the period to 31 May 2007 and  an  unknown  amount  in  a
    period to 13 June  2008;  both  of  which  are  inconsistent  with  the
    Appellant's claim in her written statement to  have  been  continuously
    employed since her arrival.

69. The Appellant's claim is that she has  been  continuously  employed  in
    genuine and effective employment since arrival in the  United  Kingdom,
    save for short, unspecified periods of ill-health  and  her  period  of
    maternity leave (the dates for which have not been given but it can  be
    inferred that this was likely to be from mid to late 2015 and into 2016
    given her daughter was born in September 2015).  The  Appellant  states
    that she never went more than a few days without a shift.  As confirmed
    at the oral hearing, the specific period relied  upon  was  five  years
    from September 2004 (first employment) to September 2009 and  no  other
    different period was specified by the Appellant as  one  in  which  she
    claimed five years' continuous residence in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations.

70. The first evidence of the Appellant being in the United Kingdom and  in
    employment is a contract of employment with Stanley Casinos  Ltd  dated
    17 September 2004, with a leaving date of 7 November 2004  (shown  from
    the P45) and from the Appellant's tax calculation for the year 2004/05,
    her total earnings were  �1676  from  this  employment.   There  is  no
    evidence of any employment or other activity as a qualified person from
    8 November 2004 to June 2005 and the documents  available  relating  to
    the tax year 2004/05 shows that the employment at the  casino  was  the
    only employment during this period.

71. The next evidence of  employment  is  a  contract  of  employment  with
    Southampton City PCT showing  a  start-date  for  part-time  employment
    (with reference to the bank system rather than any  specific  hours  or
    number of hours) of 10 June 2005 (although a separate  letter  confirms
    employment with Access to Communication from 2 June 2005).   There  are
    various references of employment with Access to  Communication,  Wessex
    Translation and Southampton PCT which all appear to refer to  the  same
    work as an interpreter mainly in the NHS, with Access to  Communication
    being referred to  as  a  department  within  Southampton  PCT  on  the
    payslips.  The Appellant states that this employment was  between  2006
    and 2010, initially as a PAYE employee and  later  on  a  self-employed
    basis (although the specific periods in  each  capacity  has  not  been
    stated).  There are a number of interpreter booking  forms  on  various
    dates in 2006 and 2 bookings in May 2007 as supporting evidence of this
    employment and some blank travel claim forms from 2007.

72. The Appellant's P60's have been submitted for the  tax  years  2005/06,
    2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 which show earnings from Southampton  City
    PCT consistent with the amounts  set  out  by  the  Respondent  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter (and set out  in  paragraph  8  above).   In
    addition, payslips have been provided for various amounts ranging  from
    �5.75 to �441.58 for months between September 2005 and September  2009;
    albeit some dates and amounts have been omitted from  copies  provided.
    The monthly payslips that are available and on  which  a  date  can  be
    identified show earnings as follows:

|2009          |                       |


73. The Appellant has not  given  any  evidence  on  whether  payslips  are
    missing because they are unavailable or whether  the  missing  payslips
    are because there were no earnings in those months.  It seems from  the
    HMRC records at least in the earlier years that at least some  payslips
    are simply missing.  There are significant gaps in the payslip evidence
    between the end of  2005  and  April  2006;  August  to  October  2006;
    May/June 2008; and then between September 2008 and May 2009; with  only
    very low earnings from June to September 2009.  The payslips  that  are
    available show that the Appellant was not working any  set  or  regular
    number of hours as the level  of  remuneration  differed  significantly
    from month to month.  The relatively low level of monthly earnings even
    in the highest paid months does not support  the  Appellant's  evidence
    that some weeks and months she was working full-time.

74. The only other evidence available in relation to any income or earnings
    are bank statements for the Appellant dating from  2011  onwards  which
    show  receipt  of  state  pension,  pension  credit,  one  payment   of
    Employment and Support Allowance and earnings from Pro Force  Kent  Ltd
    (with a name as a reference which is not the Appellant's name or one of
    her known alias') and from Blue Arrow. Save for a P45  in  2012,  there
    are no contracts of employment,  payslips,  P60's,  or  self-employment
    records or any other  documentary  evidence  of  work  for  this  later
    period.  The sentencing remarks  for  the  Appellant  do  however  show
    proceeds from her criminal offending of at least �29,000,  although  it
    is unclear from precisely what period, it is inferred  that  money  was
    received from this from late 2009 onwards  when  the  first  conspiracy
    began.

75. On the basis of the  evidence  that  is  available,  I  find  that  the
    Appellant was employed on  a  full-time  basis  between  September  and
    November 2004 (her first employment with the casino)  and  irregularly,
    on a part-time (or bank/zero hours basis) as an interpreter  from  June
    2005 and on the balance of probabilities up to April or at best  August
    2008.  There is evidence of some earnings between  June  and  September
    2009 but only at a very low level, the  last  payslip  being  only  for
    �5.75 for the month  of  September  2009.   There  is  no  evidence  to
    establish any employment  or  other  activity  as  a  qualified  person
    between early November 2004 and June 2005, or  between  September  2008
    and May 2009.

76. The question for the purposes of establishing  permanent  residence  is
    whether the Appellant was a qualified person (as defined in  regulation
    6 of the EEA Regulations) during this period such that she was residing
    in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations.   The
    Appellant  specifically  relies  on  being  a  worker  (as  defined  in
    regulation 4 of the EEA  Regulations)  and  whilst  there  are  limited
    references to  studying  and  work-seeking,  there  is  little  if  any
    evidence of the same and no specification of dates  or  the  period  in
    which the Appellant was said to be doing either.

77. In certain specified circumstances, set out in Regulation 6(2)  of  the
    EEA Regulations, a person who is no longer working must continue to  be
    treated as a worker but there  was  no  submission  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that she satisfied any of these  requirements  to  cover  the
    gaps in employment identified above.  In relation in particular to  the
    gap after 7 November 2004 to early June 2005; there is nothing  in  the
    evidence before me on which  it  could  be  found  that  the  Appellant
    continued to be a worker during this period.  There is no evidence, for
    example, of the Appellant being unable to work because  of  illness  or
    accident; she had not previously been employed for at least a year  and
    there is no evidence that she was recorded as unemployed  to  undertake
    vocational training or that she was actively seeking employment.

78. As to the  later  part  of  the  five  year  period  relied  upon,  the
    Respondent submitted that the Tribunal could not be confident given the
    low level of earnings that there was genuine and effective employment.

79. The concept of a worker is a broad  one  in  community  law,  with  the
    leading authorities on  it  being  D  M  Levin  v  Staatsecretaris  van
    Justititie, C-53/81 and Lawrie-Blum v Land  Baden-Wurttemberg,  C-66/85
    (as relied upon in numerous cases since, which are not all necessary to
    cite here).  In summary, to  be  a  worker,  the  person  must  perform
    services of some economic value to the employer; the services  must  be
    'genuine and effective' and the services must be more than 'marginal or
    ancillary'.  This can include part-time and low-paid work; and duration
    and regularity of work are relevant factors.

80. I have taken into account all of  the  evidence  available  as  to  the
    Appellant's economic activity within this broad concept;  including  in
    her favour that she had earnings from the  same  employer  (whether  as
    Southampton PCT or Access  to  Communication  or  Wessex  Translations)
    between June 2005 and of September 2009 (albeit  not  on  a  continuous
    monthly basis and at varying levels); but also that these earnings were
    irregular, with no set hours or even number of hours  and  towards  the
    end of the period, earnings were at very low levels indicating that the
    activity was marginal and ancillary rather than genuine and  effective.
    There was no evidence at all  as  to  the  Appellant's  actual  working
    pattern (if any) or wider  circumstances,  particularly  in  the  later
    years in this period as to how she was supporting herself on such  low,
    limited and irregular income.

81. Whilst I find that the Appellant had periods of employment during  this
    five year period from September 2004 to September 2009, I do  not  find
    that she has established continuous employment during this  time  given
    the significant gaps in the evidence, both documentary evidence and  in
    the Appellant's own written and oral evidence.  The gaps are either not
    explained at all or at best covered by reference to unspecified periods
    of illness or jobseeking (although the claims for JSA appear to overlap
    with periods of employment in any event).

82. The Appellant was asked specifically about her  employment  during  the
    relevant period and I explained the relevance of such evidence  to  her
    claim to have acquired permanent residence but she  was  unable  and/or
    unwilling to give any  further  details.   Counsel  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant went no further in submissions than  to  simply  assert  that
    there was a  sufficient  period  of  continuous  employment  which  was
    genuine and  effect  and  by  reference  to  the  documents  listed  in
    paragraph 14 of her skeleton argument (to which I have already referred
    to in detail above);  whilst  acknowledging  the  lack  of  documentary
    evidence and that these documents did not cover the entire period.

83. On the basis of the evidence set out above, I find that  the  Appellant
    was a worker and resided in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the
    EEA Regulations from September to early November  2004  and  then  from
    June 2005 to April or at best August 2008.  There is no evidence of any
    activity as a worker (or otherwise  as  a  qualified  person)  after  7
    November 2004 to early June 2005 (and nothing to suggest that she would
    continue to be treated as a worker during this time) and after, at  the
    latest August 2008, there is no evidence of any earnings on any regular
    basis and/or above a very low level, such that I do not find that there
    was genuine and effective employment which was more  than  marginal  or
    ancillary after this time.  On these findings, the  Appellant  has  not
    established a continuous period of five  years  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom in  accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations,  as  a  worker  or
    otherwise as a qualified person.

84. As above,  the  Appellant  relied  on  the  initial  five  year  period
    following  her  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom/following  her  first
    employment in September 2004 for the purposes of establishing permanent
    residence and it was not suggested that  any  other  five  year  period
    established this.  In any event, the  evidence  of  employment  or  any
    other activity for later years after September 2009 is even more sparse
    and could not on any view show continuous residence  for  a  five  year
    period in accordance with the EEA Regulations; particularly given  that
    the Appellant was from late 2009 receiving substantial  sums  of  money
    from criminal activity and it can be inferred  was  supporting  herself
    primarily from these means.  For these reasons, the Appellant  has  not
    established that she has acquired permanent  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations.

85. In the absence of establishing permanent residence, the  Appellant  can
    not establish ten years' continuous  lawful  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom in accordance with the EEA Regulations as this is  a  necessary
    pre-requisite.  In  any  event,  for  the  reasons  already  given  the
    Appellant  could  not  on  the  evidence  establish  this.   In   these
    circumstances, the Appellant is entitled only to the  lowest  level  of
    protection against deportation in the EEA Regulations, that  of  public
    policy or public security.

Present, genuine and sufficiently serious threat

86. The Respondent can only deport the Appellant on the grounds  of  public
    policy or public security in accordance with Regulation 23 of  the  EEA
    Regulations.  In accordance with those  provisions  set  out  above,  I
    consider first the personal conduct of this Appellant and  whether  her
    personal conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests in society.  Although
    the Appellant's conviction or criminal history does not itself  justify
    a decision to deport, that is an appropriate place to start.

87. The Appellant's criminal history is set out above, which  included  two
    separate conspiracies in relation to sham marriages, the first  between
    30 March 2011 and 13 February 2014 and the second  between  5  November
    2009 and 31 August 2016.  The sentencing remarks in  relation  to  both
    include the following:

      "... As I have said and your counsel accept, these offences  are  very
      serious because they strike at the heart of  our  immigration  system,
      our immigration controls, and you and Asante were both  major  players
      in the Ghanian conspiracy and you in the Asian conspiracy also.

      You both, you and Asante,  made  a  lot  of  money  out  of  it.   The
      conspiracies were well  organised,  well  planned,  sophisticated  and
      carried out, it would seem, purely for commercial gain  and  for  that
      type of offence there has to be a significant deterrent element in the
      sentence.  There  are  problems  with  immigration  controls  in  many
      countries  and  we  are  no  exception  and  they  cause  the   public
      considerable concern, considerable and justifiable concern. ..."

88. The Appellant was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for the  first
    conspiracy, an additional  five  years'  imprisonment  related  to  the
    proceeds of crime from it; and six years' imprisonment for  the  second
    conspiracy; all to run concurrently.  The length of  sentences  imposed
    reflects the very serious nature of the  offences  and  the  sentencing
    remarks reiterate that the Appellant was part of two lengthy  and  well
    planned conspiracies with nothing to suggest that  she  played  only  a
    minor part in them, she was a major player.

89. An OASys assessment was completed on 27 March 2018  (although  dated  2
    July 2019, this appears  to  be  the  printing  date  and  nothing  has
    apparently been updated since the assessment was first completed).   At
    the time of this  assessment,  the  Appellant  continued  to  deny  any
    criminal activity or involvement in the conspiracy and  maintained  the
    defence that was previously rejected that  she  had  documents  in  her
    possession  only  from  working  as  a  translator.   The  report  also
    concludes  that  the  Appellant  does  not  recognise  the  impact  and
    consequences of her offending on the individual  victims  or  on  wider
    society; although she does state that  she  would  never  commit  crime
    again because of the negative impact it has had on her and her  family.
    The were no specific issues identified as linked to offending.

90. Overall, the OASys report assesses the Appellant as posing a  low  risk
    of reoffending and a low risk of serious harm  to  the  public  in  the
    community; with a medium risk of serious harm to children and  a  known
    adult.  The latter is specifically by reference  to  domestic  violence
    with her partner and the risk to her own child.  The  OASys  assessment
    refers to child protection conference minutes dated  19  February  2018
    (following a conference on 13 February 2018) detailing that  there  was
    previously a  Child  Protection  Plan  in  place  for  the  Appellant's
    daughter due to her being at risk of serious harm  following  incidents
    of domestic violence, including  the  Appellant  stabbing  her  partner
    whilst he was holding their daughter.   That  was  downgraded  at  this
    conference to the Appellant's daughter being a Child  in  Need  because
    there were no immediate safeguarding concerns whilst the Appellant  was
    in custody.  The report however states  that  Childrens  Services  will
    need to reassess the situation prior to the  Appellant's  release  from
    prison and the Social Worker is to notify them  prior  to  the  release
    date.  It is recorded that the Appellant had refused to engage  in  any
    work with social services in relation to domestic violence and she  did
    not wish to discuss any aspect of this with the  author  of  the  OASys
    report.

91. There are therefore two distinct potential  risks  from  the  Appellant
    which are identified in the OASys report and need to be considered.   I
    deal first with  the  criminal  offences  committed  and  any  risk  of
    reoffending of that nature.

92. The Appellant has  given  very  little  evidence  as  to  her  criminal
    offending, in terms of what led to it or any detail of her involvement,
    with continuing denial of any wrongdoing as recently as early 2018.  In
    her evidence before the Tribunal, she states that she acknowledges  the
    offences and regrets them but  gives  little  detail  of  this  and  no
    insight into the seriousness or impact of her offending.

93. The Appellant has repeatedly stated in evidence that  at  the  time  of
    offending she was young and/or immature, had no responsibility, was not
    in a relationship nor did she have a child and  did  not  consider  the
    consequences of her actions.  The Appellant was however  29  years  old
    when the offending began (and much older by the time it stopped 7 years
    later), had moved to the United Kingdom some five years previously  and
    been in employment here such that it is difficult to  accept  that  she
    was simply young or immature as a reason for two lengthy, well  planned
    criminal conspiracies.

94. In her written and oral evidence the Appellant  initially  stated  that
    her criminal offending ceased  a  long  time  before  her  relationship
    started (in 2014 or 2015) and the only reason repeatedly given for  not
    reoffending  was  that  she  now  had  a  partner  and  a  child,  with
    responsibility and as such her  outlook  and  priorities  had  changed.
    However, in oral evidence  the  Appellant  stated  that  her  offending
    stopped when she began her relationship but  before  her  daughter  was
    born.  The Appellant's partner  also  stated  that  the  Appellant  had
    ceased criminal activity before their relationship started.

95. In addition to the difficulties with the inconsistent evidence  of  the
    witnesses on this point; all of their evidence was wholly  inconsistent
    with the Appellant's conviction for the  second  conspiracy  which  was
    between 5 November 2009 and 31 August 2016; continuing  not  only  long
    after the relationship started in 2014 but also for almost  year  after
    the Appellant's daughter was born in September 2015.  I do  not  accept
    as credible the Appellant's evidence (or her partner's  evidence)  that
    criminal activity ceased before her relationship started and/or  before
    her daughter was born as this is directly contrary to the facts of  her
    conviction.  For these reasons I also  do  not  accept  or  attach  any
    significant weight to the  Appellant's  evidence  that  she  would  not
    reoffend again because of her changed circumstances with her family  as
    she continued to offend for a significant period even after  the  birth
    of her daughter.  The Appellant relies on little else as a reason as to
    why she does not pose a risk  of  reoffending,  although  I  take  into
    account that she  has  undertaken  further  education  to  improve  her
    employment prospects on release from custody and  has  undertaken  some
    courses in prison (although these seem to be primarily focused  on  her
    family circumstances which I address below).

96. In relation to the assessment that the Appellant poses a medium risk of
    harm to her partner and her child, the evidence before the Tribunal  on
    this is relatively sparse, as it was before the  OASys  report  author.
    There is no evidence of any criminal charge or proceedings.   There  is
    no evidence at all from Social Services, nor any update to the position
    as  recorded  in  the  OASys  assessment.   The  Appellant's  partner's
    evidence was that there had been no  further  involvement  with  social
    services, the last involvement being about three years ago; but this is
    directly contrary to the record of a child protection conference taking
    place in February 2018 and a specific  plan  for  reassessment  of  the
    situation prior to the Appellant's release.  I am  not  satisfied  that
    there is no ongoing social services involvement  or  at  least  planned
    assessment in the future, the  latest  evidence  available  before  the
    Tribunal is that the Appellant's daughter is still classed as  a  Child
    in Need and further assessment is expected.

97. The Appellant and her partner both accept that there were incidents  of
    domestic violence in the past and both claim to  have  undertaken  work
    via specific courses and generally reflecting on their relationship  to
    prevent this happening again in the future; about which there  is  some
    evidence of counselling  at  least.   Neither  the  Appellant  nor  her
    partner address in any detail in their evidence the  stabbing  incident
    and there is no explanation as to why there were no criminal charges in
    relation to this.  It is also of concern that  the  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and her partner was that they did not now how  the  situation
    reached this point and the Appellant  did  not  even  realise  she  had
    stabbed her  partner  whilst  he  was  holding  their  young  daughter.
    Without identification of what actually happened or how, even  now,  it
    is difficult to find that even with some work and time  for  reflection
    the risk of a future similar incident has  been  significantly  reduced
    and that appears to be the view  of  Childrens  Services  that  further
    assessment will be required before release from custody.

98. The social work report refers to past  domestic  violence,  but  in  no
    detail and with no assessment of future risk of  this  happening  again
    and simply concludes, without  reasons,  that  the  Appellant  and  her
    partner are sincere when they say it won't happen again.  I attach very
    little weight to this conclusion in the absence of any analysis of  the
    history of events, cause,  work  undertaken  to  address  them  or  any
    detailed assessment of future risk based on the same; and in  light  of
    the  adverse  credibility  findings  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    evidence.

99. Overall, I have no reason to depart from the OASys assessment that  the
    Appellant poses a medium risk  of  serious  harm  to  her  partner  and
    daughter and that the Appellant's daughter  remains  a  Child  in  Need
    about whom there are  continuing  concerns  from  social  services  who
    intend to reassess the situation prior to the Appellant's release  from
    custody; and I attach significant weight to it.

100. When assessing future risk, I have also taken into account paragraph  3
    of Schedule 1 to the EEA Regulations as to the  significant  length  of
    the  Appellant's  custodial  sentence  for  two  convictions  (and  the
    associated criminal property sentence) and paragraph 5 as to  the  lack
    of substantial evidence of not posing a threat.  I also note  that  the
    Appellant's criminal offences are directly covered by  paragraph  6  of
    Schedule 1 given that they are  for  conspiracy  in  relation  to  sham
    marriages to facilitate unlawful entry to and residence in  the  United
    Kingdom, which as in the sentencing remarks, which are  of  significant
    and particular concern.

101. For all these reasons, on both accounts,  I  find  that  the  Appellant
    does pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of  society  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    specifically those set out in paragraph 7(a), (c), (e), (f), (g),   and
    (i) of Schedule 1 to the EEA Regulations.

Proportionality

102. The final issue to consider under the EEA Regulations  is  whether  the
    Appellant's deportation would be  proportionate  bearing  in  mind  the
    specific factors set out above in Regulation 23 and Schedule 1  of  the
    EEA Regulations.  I find it is having considered the following  matters
    and for the following reasons.

103. There is no dispute that the Appellant is in a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with her partner and their daughter, now aged  five;  both
    of whom are British citizens  and  who  have  their  own  wider  family
    members in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant's partner  has  continued
    to support the  Appellant  through  her  criminal  proceedings,  during
    custody and throughout these deportation proceedings.  The social  work
    report also endorses the relationship between the  family  members  and
    the regular contact with the Appellant in custody  (albeit  subject  to
    recent restrictions caused by Covid-19).

104. Despite the risks posed to the Appellant's daughter  by  the  Appellant
    set out above, I accept the evidence of the Appellant's partner  as  to
    the relationship and adverse impact on his daughter of the  Appellant's
    imprisonment and the evidence in the social work report to  the  effect
    that the  Appellant's  daughter  will  be  adversely  affected  if  the
    Appellant were to be deported and she were  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom with her father; which even in light of the  domestic  violence
    issues and risk is in accordance with the evidence and general position
    that children are adversely affected by the deportation  of  a  parent.
    It is suggested that in addition to the  harm  already  caused  by  the
    imprisonment of her mother, the Appellant's daughter  would  experience
    even more significant emotional distress and  a  significant  sense  of
    loss if the Appellant were deported.  The author refers to the  adverse
    of impact from imprisonment being mitigated by support from  her  wider
    family in the United Kingdom, but no comment is made as to whether this
    would mitigate the impact of deportation in any way.

105. The social work report goes on  to  state  that  deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh whether or not the Appellant's partner and  daughter  stay
    in the United Kingdom or relocate to Poland which unnecessarily  strays
    into the legal language of section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 and is  therefore  of  little  assistance  in  this
    appeal, which is focused on the EEA Regulations and in the  absence  of
    the correct test being referred to for unduly harsh in any event.

106. Further, I do  not  accept  or  give  any  significant  weight  to  the
    conclusions in the social work report as to  the  likely  situation  in
    Poland if the family relocated given that  the  social  worker  has  no
    particular experience or expertise in country conditions in Poland  and
    cites no sources or reasons for his  conclusions  that  go  so  far  as
    saying the family would face destitution there.   There  is  simply  no
    basis for this, even if it came from the interview with  the  Appellant
    and her partner and there is no evidence before the Tribunal to support
    such a conclusion.

107. It is usually the case that it is accepted to be in the best  interests
    of a child to remain with both parents in the same country;  albeit  in
    this case the position is more complicated because of the risk  to  the
    Appellant's child posed by her own mother and detriment already  caused
    to her by past domestic violence and  imprisonment.   The  social  work
    report offers little assistance by way of expert  evidence  to  balance
    this given that it lacks  any  analysis  of  risk  to  the  Appellant's
    daughter or of the issue of domestic violence.   However,  on  balance,
    based on all the evidence in the round I accept in this case that it is
    in the Appellant's  daughter's  best  interests  to  remain  with  both
    parents (albeit acknowledged that this  is  a  matter  which  Childrens
    Services are to assess  further)  and  in  all  the  circumstances,  on
    balance in her best interests to remain with them in the United Kingdom
    given her British citizenship and wider family relationships here.  The
    Appellant's daughter is however in good health, not at a critical stage
    of education and relatively young such that  there  are  no  particular
    reasons why she could not adjust and integrate with the support of  her
    mother, or parents together in Poland.  It would be a matter of  choice
    for the family if the Appellant were to be deported as to whether  they
    accompany her to Poland or not.

108. The Appellant is a 40 year old female who is in  good  health  and  who
    claims to have lived in the United Kingdom since 2004; having spent the
    first 24 years of her life in  Poland.   The  Appellant  speaks  Polish
    which although she says is not as fluent as previously, it  is  notable
    that she worked for many years (even if irregularly)  as  a  translator
    and I find that she remains fluent as well as being fluent in  English.
    The  Appellant  has  education  and  qualifications  as  well  as  work
    experience which would enable her to obtain employment and there  is  a
    lack of any evidence at all as to the current job market in Poland; nor
    in relation to access to accommodation, services or support there.   On
    the evidence before me, there is nothing to suggest that the  Appellant
    would  not  be  able  to  re-establish  herself  in  Poland,  obtaining
    appropriate accommodation and employment and be  able  to  reintegrate.
    As such, there is also nothing to suggest that she would not  similarly
    be able to support her family in Poland, or support them  and  keep  in
    contact with them (via modern means of communication as well as visits)
    in the United Kingdom from there.

109. I accept that it would be likely be difficult and  disruptive  for  the
    Appellant's partner and daughter to relocate to Poland with  her;  with
    some language difficulties and adjustment required; but, similar to the
    Appellant, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest any  immigration
    difficulties with relocation, or  any  difficulty  for  the  family  in
    obtaining accommodation, employment, education  or  other  services  in
    Poland.

110. The Appellant  has  undertaken  some  work  towards  rehabilitation  in
    prison in the United Kingdom and there is nothing to suggest  that  the
    Appellant could not pursue any further rehabilitation work in Poland.

111. The Appellant's mother is in the United Kingdom and I accept  that  she
    has no contact with any other family  in  Poland.   At  least  to  some
    extent the Appellant is  socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the
    United Kingdom given her length of residence and employment  here,  but
    against that must be balanced her criminal offending over a significant
    period of time between 2009 and 2016 and that she has  been  in  prison
    since November 2017 which undermines her level of integration here.

112.  In  all  of  the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  Respondent   has
    established that there are grounds of public  policy  and  security  to
    justify the Appellant's deportation from the United Kingdom; which is a
    proportionate decision  having  taken  into  account  the  genuine  and
    present risk she poses to the fundamental interests of society  and  to
    her own family; even taking into account her length  of  residence  and
    family in the United Kingdom,  including  the  best  interests  of  her
    daughter.  I dismiss the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights

113. The Appellant relies in the alternative  on  her  deportation  being  a
    breach of Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
    although no detailed submissions were made on  this,  by  reference  to
    section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  or
    otherwise in light of the acceptance that  the  EEA  Regulations  offer
    greater protection and therefore if the Appellant fails on that  basis,
    she is not likely to succeed on human rights grounds.

114. The Appellant's length of sentence is such that it  would  only  be  if
    there are very compelling circumstances over and above  the  exceptions
    to deportation in section 117C  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002  that  the  very  significant  public   interest   in
    deportation could be outweighed.  No further circumstances  or  matters
    have been identified in addition to those  matters  already  identified
    above in the context of the EEA Regulations and I find that  there  are
    none.  As accepted on behalf of the Appellant, having not succeeded  in
    successfully challenging her deportation under the EEA Regulations, for
    essentially  the  same  reasons,  her  deportation  would  not   be   a
    disproportionate interference with her right to respect for private and
    family life.
