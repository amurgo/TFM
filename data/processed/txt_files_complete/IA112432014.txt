Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. For the purposes of clarity throughout this decision, the parties  are
      referred to as they  were  referred  to  at  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      hearing such that Mr Jankee is referred to as the  Appellant  and  the
      Secretary of State for the Home  Department  is  referred  to  as  the
      Respondent. In this case both the Appellant and  the  Respondent  have
      sought to appeal the decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Pygott, who
      allowed the Appellant's appeal against curtailment of his leave, in  a
      decision promulgated on the 16th March 2015.
Background

   2. The Appellant is a citizen of  Mauritius  who  was  born  on  the  1st
      February 1980. He initially entered the UK  on  the  4th  April  2004,
      having been granted entry clearance as a student  on  the  17th  March
      2004 which was valid until the 30th June 2005.  He  was  then  granted
      further extension of leave until the 31st March 2009, on the basis  of
      him being a student. On the 9th September 2008 he married Miss  Bhavna
      Bhoobdasur and in March 2009 it appears that he was then granted Leave
      to Remain as the dependent spouse of Miss Bhoobdasur, who was a Tier 4
      (General) Student Migrant. He was subsequently granted  further  Leave
      to Remain as her dependent until the 30th April 2014. However, on  the
      8th May 2013 the Respondent was notified that  the  Appellant  was  no
      longer dependent of Miss Bhoobdasur  as  they  were  no  longer  in  a
      spousal relationship so that his leave was curtailed. On the 23rd  May
      2013, the Appellant was charged with assault against  Miss  Bhoobdasur
      and pleaded guilty  to  battery,  when  he  was  given  a  conditional
      discharge of 12 months, together with an order to pay costs of �85 and
      a victim surcharge of �15.


   3. The Appellant appealed against the decision of the Respondent  on  the
      17th February 2014 to curtail  his  Leave  to  Remain  in  the  United
      Kingdom as the dependent spouse of  a  points  based  migrant  and  to
      remove him from the UK by way of directions under Section  47  of  the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006,  under  the  Immigration
      Rules and on Human Rights grounds relying on Article 8 of the ECHR.



   4. The case was originally  listed  for  hearing  before  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal on the  30th  September  2014,  but  was  adjourned  and  the
      Appellant was granted Leave to amend his Grounds of Appeal to  include
      that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration Rules, specifically paragraph 276A (1) because he had been
      in the UK lawfully from more than 10 years. On the 30th September 2013
      by Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Owens ordered that  "the  Tribunal
      has granted permission to  amend  the  grounds  to  include  that  the
      decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules   and
      specifically paragraph 276A (1)."



   5. Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Pygott  at  [39]  found  specifically
      that "I am compelled to conclude that, as a grant of an  extension  of
      leave on the grounds of 10 years  continuous  lawful  residence  is  a
      matter falling within the exercise of  discretion  by  the  Respondent
      under paragraph 276 A2 of the Immigration Rules, it is not open for me
      to exercise my discretion in relation to that issue."



   6.  Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Pygott dismissed the appeal  on  the
      grounds that it was not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules
      paragraph 232 (ii), dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules
      in respect of Appendix FM and paragraph 276  ADE  and  also  on  Human
      Rights grounds in reliance upon Article 8 of the ECHR outside  of  the
      Rules, but allowed the appeal to the limited extent that the  decision
      was not in accordance with the law and it remained for the  Respondent
      to consider the exercise of her discretion under paragraph 276 A2.


   7. The Respondent appealed against that decision on the 18th March  2015,
      and in the Grounds of Appeal it is argued that the First-Tier Tribunal
      Judge materially misdirected herself in law and it was argued  by  the
      Respondent that the Appellant had not applied for indefinite Leave  to
      Remain and therefore the provisions of paragraph 276  A1  and  276  A2
      were not open to him and that following the Upper Tribunal case of  MU
      (statement  of  additional  grounds";  long   residence;   discretion)
      Bangladesh [2010] UKUT 442 (IAC) that "an application cannot  be  made
      under the long residence rule for only limited Leave  to  Remain.  Two
      years leave may be granted under paragraph 276A1-4 but only to  people
      who have applied for indefinite leave and who are ineligible  for  it,
      solely because their knowledge of English or of life in the UK is  not
      good enough". The Respondent further sought to rely upon the Court  of
      Appeal case of case of R (on the application of Weiss) v Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 803, in arguing that  an
      application for indefinite Leave to Remain  had  to  be  made  on  the
      prescribed forms, which the Appellant had not done in this case.


   8. The Respondent further sought to argue that  the  only  way  in  which
      paragraph 276 A-D were available to an Appellant is  where  they  were
      not eligible for indefinite Leave to Remain  on  the  sole  ground  of
      English language,  which  was  not  the  present  case  and  that  the
      Presenting Officer had relied upon a criminal  offence  going  to  the
      Appellant's character, such that the circumstances of this  case  were
      far removed from that envisaged by the Upper Tribunal in the  case  of
      MU.



   9. The Appellant also sought to appeal with grounds of application  dated
      the 24th March 2015, in which it was argued that the Judge should have
      found that the requirements of paragraph 276 B (i) (a) were  satisfied
      and gone on to consider the factors set out in paragraph 276  B  (ii).
      It is argued that the failure to consider the substantive  grounds  at
      paragraph 276 B (ii) stemmed from the Judge's misconception  that  the
      applicable rules conferred a discretion on the decision maker,  It  is
      argued that paragraph 276 A1 with reference to paragraph 276B does not
      confer a discretion and that the discretion appears in  paragraph  276
      A2 relating to the period of leave to be granted once the requirements
      of the substantive Rules are satisfied. It is argued that the decision
      of  the  Judge  that  it  remained  for  the  Respondent  to  consider
      exercising her discretion under paragraph 276  A2  was  erroneous  and
      that she should have decided herself as to whether or not the  grounds
      of paragraph 276B (ii) were met.


  10. Permission to appeal in this case was granted by  First-Tier  Tribunal
      Judge Nicholson on the 12th May 2015.  He  noted  that  there  was  an
      application by the Respondent for permission to appeal.  He  does  not
      appear to have noticed that in fact there was also an application  for
      permission to appeal  by  the  Appellant,  such  that  although  Judge
      Nicholson has dealt with the application for permission to  appeal  by
      the Respondent, he has  not  dealt  with  the  cross  application  for
      permission to  appeal  by  the  Appellant.  Judge  of  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal Nicholson granted permission to appeal on the  point  related
      to limited leave and as to whether or not following the case of MU, an
      application could be made  for  under  the  long  residence  rule  for
      limited Leave to Remain as opposed to indefinite Leave to  Remain  and
      as to whether or not paragraph 322 (1c) (iv) applied. He  pointed  out
      that the case of MU had been partially  overturned  by  the  Court  of
      Appeal in the case of AQ (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the  Home
      Department [2011] EWCA Civ 833, although not on that point.



  11. To the extent that it is necessary to do so, given that Judge  of  the
      First-Tier Tribunal Nicholson does not appear to have  considered  the
      Appellant's  application  for  permission  to   appeal,   given   that
      permission to appeal  was  granted  in  respect  of  the  Respondent's
      application, I consider that it is in the  interest  of  justice  that
      permission is also granted to the Appellant in respect of  the  cross-
      appeal, and that I deal with all  of  the  matters  relevant  to  this
      appeal at the same time. It would  be  wholly  unjust  to  refuse  the
      Appellant permission to raise the arguments that he wishes to raise in
      respect of the decision, given  that  it  appears  that  the  original
      application by him for permission to  appeal  was  overlooked.  It  is
      clearly in the interest of justice that all of the arguments are dealt
      with, in order to be able to determine whether  or  not  there  was  a
      material error of law in the decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Pygott. It was not argued before me that  I  did  not  have  power  to
      consider such arguments when Judge Nicholson had  not  considered  the
      Appellant's Grounds of Appeal.



  12. In her oral submissions before me, Miss  Brocklesby-Weller  sought  to
      argue that the Appellant was entitled to raise paragraph 276 B in  his
      Section 120 notice, but that he was not  entitled  to  argue  that  he
      satisfied the requirements of paragraph 276  A1  in  his  Section  120
      notice. She relied upon the case of MU in that regard. She agreed that
      time spent awaiting for  the  appeal  decision  can  count  as  lawful
      residence for the purposes of calculating the 10 year period,  as  the
      Appellant still during that time had Section 3C leave. She argued that
      if the Appellant had applied under paragraph 276B for indefinite Leave
      to Remain on the ground of long residence in the  United  Kingdom,  he
      would have fallen foul of the provision of paragraph 276  B  (iii)  in
      that the Appellant did fall for refusal under the general grounds  for
      refusal under paragraph 322 (1C) (iv) in that he had,  within  the  24
      months prior to the date on which the application  was  decided,  been
      convicted or admitted an offence for which  he  had  received  a  non-
      custodial sentence or other out-of-court disposal that was recorded on
      his criminal record. She argued that  he  would  therefore  have  been
      refused under paragraph 322 (1C) had he applied for  indefinite  Leave
      to Remain on the basis of his long residence.
  13. Miss Brocklesby-Weller sought to argue that the decision in  the  case
      of MU  (statement  of  additional  grounds-long  residence-discretion)
      Bangladesh [2010] UKUT 442 (IAC), that "an application cannot be  made
      under the long residence rule for only limited Leave  to  Remain.  Two
      years leave may be granted under paragraph 276A1-4, but only to people
      who applied for indefinite leave and who are ineligible for it, solely
      because their knowledge of English or of life in the UK  is  not  good
      enough". However she did concede that the provisions of paragraph  276
      A1 had changed since the decision in MU, such that it  was  no  longer
      directly on point, but she did still seek to rely upon the same and in
      particular upon [9] of the  decision  in  which  it  was  stated  that
      "although Rule 276 A1 refers to 'a person seeking an extension of stay
      on the ground of long residence', that does not mean that  people  can
      apply for a limited Leave to Remain  solely  on  the  ground  of  long
      residence. Applications under the long residency rules, paragraphs 276
      A-D, are for indefinite leave. Paragraph 276 A1-4 had been  introduced
      as a halfway house, to accommodate applicants who would otherwise fall
      for refusal because of paragraph 276 B  (iii).  The  Appellant  cannot
      therefore avoid the 'public interest proviso' by stating that he  only
      wants to remain in the United Kingdom for two years at the most".


  14. The old wording of paragraph 276 A1 is set out at [7] of the  decision
      and it previously read "276 A1. The requirement to be met by a  person
      seeking an extension of stay on the ground of long  residence  in  the
      United Kingdom is that the applicant meets  all  the  requirements  of
      paragraph  276B  of  these  Rules,  except  the  requirement  to  have
      sufficient knowledge of the English language and sufficient  knowledge
      about life in the United Kingdom contained in paragraph 276B (iii)".



  15. Miss Brocklesby-Weller  drew  my  attention  to  the  new  wording  of
      paragraph 276 A1, which read "276 A1. The requirement to be met  by  a
      person seeking an extension of stay on the grounds of  long  residence
      in the United Kingdom is that the applicant meets each of requirements
      in paragraph 276B (i)-(ii) and (v)." This paragraph is headed  in  the
      Rules "Requirements for an extension of stay on  the  ground  of  long
      residence in the United Kingdom". She argued  that  the  Judge  should
      simply have found that the Appellant did not meet the requirements  of
      paragraph 276 B because  of  his  conviction,  and  that  he  was  not
      entitled to consider the application under 276 A1 following  the  case
      of MU, and should have dismissed the Appellant's application  on  that
      basis.



  16.  Ms  Gasparro  argued  that  the  Judge  should  have  determined  the
      application under paragraph 276B (ii) and that she should  not  simply
      have found that this was a matter of discretion that should  still  be
      exercised by the Secretary of State.  She  argued  the  Appellant  was
      entitled to apply under paragraph 276 A1, given its  new  wording  and
      that there were now two caveats, rather than one as previously at  the
      time of MU, and that it was therefore now envisaged that people  could
      apply on the basis of paragraph 276 A1 applying on  the  basis  of  an
      extension of stay for grounds of long residence. She argued  that  the
      Appellant had specifically sought to amend his Grounds  of  Appeal  to
      argue reliance upon paragraph 276 A1, rather than 276B  and  that  the
      Judge did have jurisdiction to consider this point.  She  argued  that
      the Respondent had not either  when  the  Appellant  had  applied  for
      permission to amend his Grounds of Appeal or at  the  original  appeal
      hearing before First-Tier Tribunal Judge Pygott sought to  argue  that
      the Judge could not rely upon paragraph 276 A1. She  argued  that  the
      Judge  had  materially  erred  in  not  considering  the   Appellant's
      application based upon his long residence under paragraph  276  A1  as
      sought, and should not have remitted the case back to the Secretary of
      State for the exercise of her discretion in that regard.

My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  17. Although reliance is placed by the Secretary of State upon the case of
      R (on the application advice)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2010] EWCA Civ 803, as authority for the proposition  that
      the Secretary of State for the Home Department was entitled to require
      an individual to make a formal application under the Immigration Rules
      rule 276 B for indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
      notwithstanding that both an Immigration Judge and  the  Secretary  of
      State had indicated that such application was likely to be successful,
      that case was simply dealing with whether or not it  was  unreasonable
      and  unlawful  to  require  a  formal  application  to  be   made   in
      circumstances where the Judge and Respondent  at  the  appeal  hearing
      indicated that such an application was likely be successful,  and  did
      not involve a case where there had been a submission  in  response  to
      Section 120 notice that  the  Appellant  was  entitled  to  either  an
      extension of his leave or indefinite Leave to Remain on the  basis  of
      long residence.  The  situation  of  this  Appellant,  Mr  Jankee,  is
      entirely  different  in  that  the  original  Refusal  Notice  by  the
      Respondent on the 17th February 2014, and "one-stop  warning-statement
      of additional grounds" required the Appellant to state any reasons why
      he should be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom under  Section  120
      of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


  18. It was stated by the Upper Tribunal in the case of Jaff  (section  120
      notice; statement of "additional grounds") [2012] UKUT  396  that  the
      legislative scheme provided no particular form in which a statement of
      additional grounds must be set out, but at a minimum must set  out  to
      some level of particularity the ground relied upon by the Appellant as
      a foundation for remaining in the United Kingdom. Here, in response to
      the Section 120 notice the Appellant had specifically sought and  been
      granted leave to amend his Grounds of Appeal to include the submission
      that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration Rules specifically paragraph 276A (1) because he had  been
      in the UK lawfully  for  more  than  10  years.  In  that  regard  the
      Appellant had fully complied with the requirement in Jaff to  set  out
      the ground relied upon, both in substance and in form, he having given
      both the Rule relied upon and the reasons why  it  was  said  that  he
      satisfied that Rule. Indeed, Miss Brocklesby-Weller on behalf  of  the
      Respondent did not in fact seek to argue that the Appellant could  not
      have applied for indefinite Leave to Remain by means  of  his  Section
      120 notice under paragraph 276 B, her argument was that following  the
      case of MU, the Appellant was not able to apply by means of a  Section
      120 notice under the long residence rule for  only  limited  Leave  to
      Remain under paragraph 261A, following the case of  MU  (statement  of
      additional grounds-long residence-discretion) Bangladesh  [2010]  UKUT
      442 (IAC).


  19. However, the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  the  case  of  MU  was
      based upon the old wording of paragraph  276  A1  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. The old wording read:



      "276 A1. The requirements to be met by a person seeking  an  extension
      of stay on the grounds of long residence in the United Kingdom is that
      the applicant meets all of the requirement of paragraph 276 B  of  the
      Rules, except the requirement to  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  the
      English language and sufficient knowledge about  life  in  the  United
      Kingdom contained in paragraph 276 B (iii)". It was on this basis that
      Senior Immigration Judge McKee sitting in the Upper Tribunal found  at
      [9] that people could not apply for a limited Leave to Remain  on  the
      grounds of  long  residence  and  that  applications  under  the  long
      residence rule were for  indefinite  leave.  He  found  that  the  old
      paragraph  276  A1-4  had  been  introduced  as  a  halfway  house  to
      accommodate applicants who would otherwise fall for refusal because of
      paragraph 276B (iii) and that an Appellant could not thereby avoid the
      "public interest proviso" by asserting that he wanted to remain in the
      United Kingdom for two years at the most.


  20. However, the wording of paragraph 276 A1 has since changed, such  that
      the wording now and as at the date of the decision before Judge of the
      First-tier Tribunal Pygott on the 12th December 2014 read:
      "276 A1. The requirement to be met by a person seeking  the  extension
      of stay on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom  if  the
      applicant meets each of the requirements of  paragraph  276B  (i)-(ii)
      and (v) under this paragraph."


  21.  An applicant under paragraph 276 A1 now would not have  to  meet  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  276  B  (iii)  or  (iv).   Whereas   senior
      Immigration Judge McKee was of the opinion that the  previous  wording
      of paragraph 276 A1  was  simply  a  method  as  a  halfway  house  to
      accommodate applicants who would otherwise fall  for  refusal  on  the
      basis of their English language or knowledge about life in the UK, the
      new wording of paragraph 276 A1 specifically allows for someone to  be
      granted an extension of stay on ground of long residence, even if they
      would otherwise fall for refusal under the general grounds for refusal
      had they applied for indefinite Leave to Remain under  paragraph  276B
      (iii). Further, given that paragraph  276  A1  is  under  the  heading
      "Requirements for an extension of stay on ground of long residence  in
      the United Kingdom" and  actually  refers  to  a  person  "seeking  an
      extension of stay  on  the  ground  of  long  residence"  rather  than
      applying for indefinite Leave to Remain under 276 B,  I  find  that  a
      person can now under paragraph 276 A1 seek an  extension  of  stay  on
      grounds of long residence, in  circumstances  where  they  would  have
      otherwise fallen for refusal under the  general  grounds  for  refusal
      under 276B (iii).


  22. Paragraph  276A04  states  that  "where  a  person  who  has  made  an
      application for indefinite Leave to Remain under this  part  does  not
      meet the requirements for indefinite Leave to Remain but falls  to  be
      granted limited Leave to Remain under this part on the basis  of  long
      residence of private life in the UK outside of the Rules on Article  8
      grounds:
   a)  the Secretary of State will treat  that  application  for  indefinite
      leave to remain as an application for limited leave to remain;"


  23. The fact that there is a separate provision for a person who does  not
      meet the requirements of  paragraph  276B  to  be  considered  by  the
      Respondent under  paragraph  276  A1,  does  not  preclude  an  actual
      application being made under paragraph 276 A1. The fact that there  is
      in this regard  reinforces  the  point  that  an  application  for  an
      extension of stay on ground of long residence in  the  United  Kingdom
      can be made. Otherwise the wording of paragraph 276A1 would be otiose.
      The case of MU clearly does not apply to the new wording of the  Rule.
      I therefore find that the Appellant  was  entitled  to  argue  in  his
      response to the  Section  120  notice  that  he  was  entitled  to  an
      extension of stay on the grounds of long residence.


  24. In determining whether or not the Appellant met the  requirements  for
      the extension of his stay on the grounds  of  long  residence  in  the
      United Kingdom under paragraph 276 A1, the Appellant simply needed  to
      meet, as at the date of the First-Tier Tribunal Judge's decision,  the
      requirements in paragraph 276B (i)-(ii) and (v). The fact  that  under
      paragraph 276 A2, an extension of stay on the ground of long residence
      in the United Kingdom may be granted for a period  not  exceeding  two
      years, such that the  Respondent  under  paragraph  276  A2  has  some
      element of discretion, does not mean that the provisions of  paragraph
      276 A1 and the conditions therein that an applicant has  to  meet  the
      requirements of paragraph 276B (i)-(ii) and (v) are discretionary. The
      matter having been properly raised by the Appellant within  his  reply
      to the Section 120 notice, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pygott  should
      have gone on to consider whether or not the Appellant did satisfy  the
      provisions in paragraph 276 A1, in terms of meeting  the  requirements
      in paragraph 276B (i)-(ii) and (v). She should not simply have allowed
      the appeal to the limited extent of finding that the decision made was
      not in accordance with the law and  should  not  have  found  that  it
      remained for the Respondent  to  consider  exercising  her  discretion
      under paragraph 276 A2.


  25. The Judge materially erred at [39] when finding that "on reflection, I
      am compelled to conclude that, as the grant of an extension  of  leave
      on the grounds of 10 years continuous lawful  residence  is  a  matter
      within the exercise of discretion by the  Respondent  under  paragraph
      276 A2 of the Immigration Rules. It is not open to me to  exercise  my
      discretion in  relation  to  that  issue."  She  should  have  herself
      considered the issue as to whether or not the Appellant  was  entitled
      to an extension of leave on the basis of 10  years  continuous  lawful
      residence in the UK having regard to paragraph 276  A1  and  paragraph
      276 B (i)-(ii) and (v). Had this been established, then she could have
      found that the Appellant having satisfied that Rule  was  entitled  to
      leave under paragraph 276 A2, but at that point  it  would  then  have
      been for the Respondent to have exercised her  discretion  as  to  the
      period  of  any  such  leave,  had  the  entitlement  to  leave   been
      established.


  26. The First-Tier Tribunal Judge Pygott having materially erred  in  this
      regard, I set aside her decision to allow the appeal on the basis that
      the decision made was not in accordance  with  the  Law  and  that  it
      remained for the Respondent to consider  exercising  discretion  under
      paragraph 276 A2.



  27. Both legal representatives before me, indicated that if I were to find
      a material error in the First-Tier Tribunal Judge's decision  in  this
      regard, it would be appropriate to remit the case back to  the  First-
      Tier Tribunal for consideration as to whether or not the Appellant did
      meet the requirements of paragraph 276 A1 in light of the factors  set
      out in paragraph 276B (i)-(ii) and (v). I therefore allow  the  appeal
      on the basis that there was a material error of law, and set aside the
      decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Pygott and remit the  case  back
      to the First-Tier Tribunal for consideration of the appeal in  respect
      of this issue. It is appropriate that this matter be considered by the
      First-Tier Tribunal, given that no consideration  has  been  given  to
      this issue by the First-Tier Tribunal, and given that there would be a
      substantial amount of fact-finding  required  in  order  to  determine
      whether or not in fact the Appellant did meet the requirements for  an
      extension of leave on the basis of long residence.
