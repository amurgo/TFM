               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Md Chowdhury, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge P
S Aujla of the First-tier Tribunal in a decision dated 5 April 2019 who
dismissed the appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the European Convention
on Human Rights.  Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge
Pickup in a decision dated 25 June 2019.

2.   At the hearing, Ms Fijiwala accepted that there has been a material
error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal due to procedural
unfairness. This is because the appellant provided medical evidence that
his adjournment request should have been granted as he was indisposed and
could not attend the hearing. I agree that denial of the adjournment
request by the appellant lead to a material error of law as he was denied a
fair hearing.

3.   I therefore direct that the appeal be remitted to the First-tier
Tribunal for a fresh hearing before any Judge other than Judge Aujla.  No
findings of facts are to be preserved and there should be a de novo
hearing.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to that limited extent

No anonymity direction is made.
No fee award is made
