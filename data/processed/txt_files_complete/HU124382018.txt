Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N Nnamani, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms R Bassi, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal, born on 28 September 1979. He has
      been given permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Wylie dismissing his appeal  against  the  respondent's
      decision to refuse his application for entry clearance.

   2. The appellant applied for entry clearance to settle in the UK  as  the
      adult dependant relative of his mother,  the  widow  of  an  ex-Gurkha
      soldier. The respondent considered that the appellant did not meet the
      requirements of paragraph EC-DR.1.1 of Appendix FM of the  immigration
      rules and that the Home Office policy in  Annex  K,  IDI  Chapter  15,
      section 2A 13.2 did not apply to adult children of  ex-Ghurka  widows.
      The respondent went on to consider Article 8 of the ECHR but concluded
      that there was no established family life between  the  appellant  and
      his mother and that, in any event, any  family  life  that  did  exist
      could continue in Nepal. The application was refused on 27 April 2018.

   3. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was  heard
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie on 29 April 2019. The  judge  noted
      the evidence that the appellant was the fifth born of seven  children,
      of whom the eldest sister was British and lived in the UK,  two  other
      older sisters and a younger sister were married and lived  with  their
      families in Pokhara, an older brother was married and lived  with  his
      family in Beni, Nepal, and a younger brother was married  and  working
      in Korea. The appellant was living on his own in the  family  home  in
      Myagdi village in Nepal. His parents went to live in Hong Kong in 1997
      with their eldest daughter and the appellant, aged  17  at  the  time,
      remained in Nepal with his two younger siblings who were aged  16  and
      14. His father died on 3 October 2001 and his mother remained in  Hong
      Kong where she had settled status. His mother applied  for  settlement
      to the UK and returned to Nepal during the application  process,  then
      returned to Hong Kong and then moved to the UK with her daughter on  7
      July 2012. Contrary to a reference in the refusal letter the appellant
      had never lived and worked in Kuwait but used to work  in  restaurants
      in Pokhara and Kathmandu. He did not currently work and could not find
      employment and he  was  supported  financially  by  the  sponsor,  his
      mother, who sent him about �200 or �300 a  month  and  also  sometimes
      gave money to friends to give to him. His mother had  visited  him  in
      Nepal about three times since being in the  UK,  the  most  recent  in
      2017.  The  appellant  claimed  to  be  financially  and   emotionally
      dependent upon his mother.

   4. The judge noted that the appellant had  not  lived  with  his  parents
      since they went to live in Hong Kong, apart from a period  in  2011/12
      when the sponsor was in Nepal pursuing her application for  settlement
      in the UK. Whilst the sponsor claimed that that period was a year, the
      judge noted that the dates in her passport  showed  that  she  was  in
      Nepal from 20 September 2011 until December 2011 and travelled to  the
      UK from Hong Kong  in  July  2012.   The  judge  did  not  accept  the
      appellant's claim that he had no contact with his brother in  Beni  as
      the sponsor's evidence was that the appellant went there  every  month
      to collect provisions, as it was the nearest town to the family  home.
      The judge considered the sponsor's claim to have visited the appellant
      on the last occasion in 2017, but also noted the evidence that she was
      unwell during  that  visit  and  was  treated  in  Pokhara  where  her
      daughters lived, rather than a hospital  nearer  to  the  family  home
      where the appellant lived. The judge noted that the  remittances  paid
      by the sponsor to the appellant between November 2015 and  March  2019
      were sent to a recipient in Pokhara rather than Myagdi and also  noted
      that the sponsor's evidence of the  purpose  of  the  remittances  was
      confused and inconsistent.

   5. The judge noted that there was no  evidence  of  financial  dependency
      before 2015 and in the years when the sponsor was in Hong Kong and the
      appellant was in Nepal. There was no evidence  of  the  claimed  daily
      contact. The judge concluded that the appellant had lived more or less
      independently since 1997 and, whilst there may well be  a  close  link
      between the appellant and the sponsor, they could not be said to enjoy
      family life together. The judge considered that  the  sponsor  enjoyed
      family life with her daughter who was living in the UK  with  her  but
      not with the appellant. Accordingly she concluded that Article  8  was
      not engaged. The judge went on to make findings  in  the  alternative,
      finding that the appellant was  not  emotionally  dependent  upon  the
      sponsor, that he had lived apart from his mother for many years,  that
      he had failed to meet most of the provisions of the guidance and  that
      the historic wrong did not outweigh  the  other  factors  she  had  to
      consider. The judge  accordingly  found  that  the  refusal  of  entry
      clearance was proportionate and she dismissed the appeal.

   6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by the appellant
      on the grounds that the judge had failed to apply  the  principles  in
      Ghising & Ors (Ghurkhas/BOCs : historic wrong; weight) (Nepal)  [2013]
      UKUT 567 when considering proportionality where Article 8 was engaged;
      and that the judge had failed properly to consider  all  the  evidence
      and to make properly reasoned findings in regard to  family  life  and
      had failed to consider the evidence of real and committed  support  in
      line with Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]
      EWCA Civ 31 and Rai v Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi  [2017]  EWCA
      Civ 320.

   7. Permission was granted on 5 August 2019.



Appeal Hearing

   8. Ms Nnamani clarified that  the  main  challenge  was  to  the  judge's
      assessment of family life. She submitted that the judge had failed  to
      consider the appellant's relationship with his mother in line with the
      principles in Kugathas, as considered in Ghising and Rai. The  judge's
      findings were inconsistent, as she found that there was  a  close  tie
      between the appellant and sponsor but then concluded that there was no
      family life. The judge failed to grapple with the evidence of real and
      committed financial or other support. The judge therefore erred in her
      assessment of family life. If it was accepted  that  family  life  had
      been established, the second ground relating to  proportionality  fell
      away as the appeal had to be allowed.

   9. Ms Bassi accepted that the appeal should be allowed if  it  was  found
      that family life had  been  established.  However,  she  defended  the
      judge's assessment of family life. She submitted that  the  judge  had
      taken account of the relevant case law and was entitled to  find  that
      the appellant had been leading an independent life since 1997 and that
      there was no family life.

  10. Ms Nnamani, in response, submitted that the judge ought to have sought
      clarification on points which led to her findings on family life, such
      as the fact that the medical evidence showing the sponsor's  treatment
      in Pokhara  could  be  explained  by  the  appellant's  village  being
      isolated and lacking the relevant treatment.  There  was  evidence  of
      frequent telephone contact. The appellant  had  produced  evidence  of
      financial support going back to 2015 and it was  unreasonable  of  the
      judge to expect evidence going further back.



Consideration and findings

  11. The focus of this challenge is on the  judge's  assessment  of  family
      life, since the parties agree that in the event it was  accepted  that
      family life had been established  so  as  to  engage  Article  8,  the
      decision to refuse entry clearance would be disproportionate.

  12. I do not agree with Ms Nnamani, however, that the judge erred  in  law
      in her approach to, and assessment of family life. Neither do I  agree
      with her submission that the judge failed to apply the  principles  in
      Kugathas, Ghising and Rai. As those cases made clear, and as the judge
      confirmed at [35], the assessment of family  life  was  fact-sensitive
      and depended upon the facts of the individual  case.  The  judge  gave
      full and detailed consideration to the facts of the  case  which  were
      plainly very different to the circumstances in Rai.

  13. At [39] of the judgment in Rai the Court of Appeal identified the real
      issue in Article 8(1) as: "whether, as a matter of fact, the appellant
      had demonstrated that he had a family life with his parents, which had
      existed at the time of their departure to settle in the United Kingdom
      and had endured beyond it, notwithstanding  their  having  left  Nepal
      when they did." In  the  appellant's  case  the  judge  considered  as
      relevant the fact that the appellant had lived apart from his  parents
      since 1997 and that the only time he claimed to have  lived  with  his
      mother since that time was for the three months when she  returned  to
      Nepal from Hong Kong for the purpose of awaiting the processing of her
      visa application for the UK.  The  judge  was  perfectly  entitled  to
      consider  that  that  was  a  significant  factor  in  assessing   the
      appellant's overall dependence upon his mother.

  14. Likewise the judge was entitled  to  take  account  of  other  matters
      arising from the evidence, such  as  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
      mother received her medical treatment in Pokhara, where her  daughters
      lived, that the beneficiaries of the remittances  was  an  address  in
      Pokhara rather than the  family  home  where  it  was  said  that  the
      appellant was residing, that the sponsor's evidence about the  purpose
      of one of the remittances was inconsistent and that  the  evidence  of
      telephone calls and messaging was unclear and indeterminate. The judge
      was not required to put each and every concern to the sponsor but  was
      entitled to draw the conclusions  that  she  did  from  the  evidence.
      Having given full and detailed consideration to all the evidence, both
      documentary and oral, and having properly considered  the  nature  and
      extent of the support given by the sponsor to the appellant, the judge
      was fully and properly entitled  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  the
      appellant had, aside from some evidence of financial support from  his
      mother, been living more or less independently since 1997.  The  judge
      considered that conclusion in the light of the findings in Ghising and
      properly concluded that the evidence did not  demonstrate  that  there
      was family life between the appellant his mother. I do not agree  with
      Ms Nnamani that the judge's  reference  to  a  close  link  and  close
      relationship between the appellant and the sponsor is contradictory to
      his finding that they did not enjoy family  life.  The  judge  clearly
      explained the difference between the two findings and there is nothing
      contradictory in her conclusions in that regard.

  15. For all of these reasons I find no merit in the appellant's grounds of
      challenge. The grounds are essentially a disagreement with the judge's
      decision and I fail to see why permission was  granted  in  the  first
      place. The judge's decision took account  of  all  the  evidence,  was
      fully and cogently reasoned and was entirely and properly open to  her
      on the evidence before her.

  16. Accordingly I find no errors of law in the judge's decision. I  uphold
      the decision.



DECISION

  17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
