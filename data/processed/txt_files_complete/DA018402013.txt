                       Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.         This appeal comes before me following my decision to set aside
      the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge A W Khan promulgated on
      23 December 2013 allowing the appeal against deportation. Reasons  for
      finding an  error  of  law  in  that  decision  were  set  out  in  my
      determination   dated 25 February 2014 and an extract  which  provides
      the findings and conclusions  is  attached  as  an  annexure  to  this
      determination.

   2.       The appellant is a Ukrainian national born on 27 September 1964.
      He arrived here as a visitor on 18 June  1993,  made  an  unsuccessful
      asylum application and appeal, followed  by  an  application  for  ILR
      under the regularisation scheme for overstayers, which was granted  on
      10 February 2003.

   3.       On 11 July 2002 he was fined �350,  ordered  to  pay  costs  and
      disqualified from driving for 18 months for driving  a  motor  vehicle
      with excess alcohol. On 8 August 2002 he was again convicted of  drink
      driving and fined �500 and disqualified from driving for 3  years.  On
      15 December 2003 he received another  conviction  for  driving  whilst
      disqualified and with no insurance which resulted  in  a  ban  for  12
      months and a three month curfew order. In April 2012, at Harrow  Crown
      Court, he was convicted of possessing a firearm and ammunition without
      a certificate. On 14 June 2012 he  was  sentenced  to  five  years  in
      prison.

   4.       On 28 August 2013 the  respondent  signed  a  deportation  order
      under s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007.  The  appellant  lodged  an
      appeal which was heard and  allowed  by  a  panel  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal chaired by Judge A W Khan; it is that decision that has  been
      set aside.

The hearing

   5.       The resumed hearing came before me on 31  March  2014.  I  heard
      oral evidence from  the  appellant's  mother,  brother  and  from  the
      appellant, in that order. All made use of the Russian interpreter; the
      appellant gave part of his testimony in English.

   6.        A  bundle  for  the  appellant  was  served  just  before   the
      commencement of the hearing although the directions were  for  further
      evidence to be served no later than seven working days  prior  to  the
      hearing. I was told that one of the witnesses  had  not  attended  the
      offices of the representatives until March 28. Quite why that affected
      the submission of the remaining documents is unclear  however,  so  as
      not to penalise the appellant, I admitted the  bundle  and  Mr  Walker
      confirmed he was not placed in any difficulties as a result.

   7.       The first witness was the  appellant's  mother,  Iryna  Zownaruk
      (elsewhere stated to be Zhovnaruk: I 5) . She confirmed  the  contents
      of her statement and was tendered for cross examination. I should note
      here that she was in a wheelchair.

   8.       In response to Mr Walker's questions, the  witness  stated  that
      when the appellant's relationship with his partner ended in  2009,  he
      moved in with her. He had argued with his wife who  had  been  unhappy
      because he looked after her. She said he  had  been  her  carer  since
      then. It was put to her that according to her witness  statement,  her
      grand daughter, Oksana, had been her carer  since  2004.  She  agreed,
      stating that Oksana took care of all her paperwork.

   9.       The witness confirmed that the appellant was not in contact with
      his daughters. She stated that since the appellant had been in prison,
      she had a carer who came in for an hour in the morning and an hour  in
      the evening. Additionally, her daughter and grand daughter  came  from
      time to time but she lived alone. Her husband was in a care home.  She
      lived in a two bedroom council flat; she had been residing  there  for
      the last 25 years.  That completed cross examination. There was no re-
      examination.

  10.       In response to my questions, the witness  confirmed  she  had  a
      private carer whom Oksana had selected. I  asked  why  she  could  not
      employ a private male carer if the females looking after her found  it
      difficult to lift her and undertake heavy work. She said that she  did
      want a male carer to assist her with intimate tasks such  as  washing.
      When it was pointed out she had her daughter and  grand  daughter  for
      that, she replied they did not see her every day. On average, they saw
      her 2-3 times a week. The rest of the time she was alone. Her daughter
      was a deaf  mute  and  her  son's  behaviour  was  unpredictable.  The
      appellant, however, used to take her out in his car.

  11.       The witness confirmed that her flat had  been  modified  to  her
      needs. She also said she could move from the wheelchair to the toilet.
      She said she was last in the Ukraine 2-3 years ago. She had  travelled
      with a companion from the Ukrainian club. She  had  many  friends  and
      acquaintances there. When it was pointed out to her that  the  medical
      report stated she had been there last year, she denied it and said the
      report was mistaken. She thought her visit before last  was  in  2010-
      2011.

  12.       Mr Walker had a question arising. He asked the witness  how  she
      had travelled and she replied she had gone by coach. However, she  did
      not think she would be able to do so now.
  13.       Ms Javed asked the  witness  which  son  she  had  described  as
      unpredictable. She replied she  had  been  referring  to  Roman.  That
      completed the oral evidence of this witness.

  14.       I then heard oral evidence from Roman Jovnarouk, the appellant's
      brother. He adopted his witness statement and was tendered  for  cross
      examination.

  15.       In response to Mr Walker's questions, the witness confirmed that
      the appellant had been living with their mother between 2009 and 2011.
      He did not know where the appellant had been living  before  that.  He
      said he had a difficult life and had to sleep  rough  and  beg  so  he
      could not keep track of what the appellant did.

  16.       The witness stated he had been in the UK since 1992 and had  not
      returned to the Ukraine. His mother had; he thought her last visit was
      last year but he was not good at remembering dates. He said  he  could
      not provide information about her previous visits as he  had  spent  a
      lot of time in hospitals and had been a beggar. However he recalled he
      had a brother, the appellant, who had helped him with his children. He
      said it would be difficult  if  the  appellant  was  deported  as  his
      parents would suffer.  His children were working and so had  not  come
      to the hearing. His son had attended a  previous  hearing.  They  were
      both born in the Ukraine but had never left the UK since their arrival
      here. One of his sons had visited the appellant in prison;  the  other
      had not but had taken  the  appellant's  mother  to  visit  him.  That
      completed cross examination. There was no re-examination.

  17.       The witness told me that he saw his mother when he could. He had
      spent the weekend with her. He did that from  time  to  time  and  she
      supported him. He had not known about the appellant's  three  previous
      convictions. The appellant had helped him through difficult times.  He
      did not want to elaborate on the nature of his difficulties  but  said
      that his wife had died in 2000.

  18.       When asked by Mr Walker whether he helped  his  mother  when  he
      stayed with her. The witness replied that he was the  one  who  needed
      help as he had back problems. He said his niece, Oksana, looked  after
      her and was  her  official  carer  but  there  was  no  one  like  the
      appellant. Oksana helped his mother with her paperwork. He had no idea
      if she was paid a carer's allowance. Ms Javed had no questions arising
      and that completed this witness' evidence.

  19.       I then heard evidence from the appellant. He confirmed his  date
      of birth and the contents of his statement. In  cross  examination  he
      stated that he stopped living with his partner at the end of 2009.  He
      had lived with her until then.  He  had  been  to  Ukraine  2-3  times
      excluding business trips; in all he had been there not  more  than  10
      times. He had various business  projects  in  marketing,  finance  and
      media. He had tried to set up a newspaper and had organised consulting
      seminars but his business ventures were  unsuccessful.  The  appellant
      was asked to explain why the evidence at his asylum  hearing  in  1999
      indicated that he had not been living with his partner at  that  time.
      He explained that they argued a lot  and  would  often  separate.  The
      arguments were over the time he spent looking  after  his  mother.  He
      stated he had never married his partner. They had met in Ukraine.  She
      had a daughter whom the appellant adopted and then they had a daughter
      together.

  20.       The appellant was asked whether his problems with alcohol  abuse
      which resulted in two drink driving offences had  contributed  to  the
      problems with his wife. The appellant said he did not have any  issues
      with alcohol and did not drink for most of his life. He  said  he  had
      had Hepatitis C but was cured after a year of treatment. The cause was
      unknown. He confirmed he lived with his mother from the  end  of  2009
      until  February  2011  when  he  obtained  accommodation  from  social
      services. He said he had suffered badly from depression as a result of
      the medication he had been given for Hepatitis. He had been unable  to
      help his mother whilst he was depressed. In 2011 when nearing the  end
      of his treatment, he turned to alcohol for help. He had been diagnosed
      with Hepatitis in 2009 or 2010. He said the reference to 2008  in  his
      witness statement was a mistake. He stated that he had still been with
      his partner at that time and  his  business  problems  and  debts  had
      caused arguments with his partner. He blamed the interpreter  for  the
      reference to being divorced in his statement. He  said  he  had  never
      married. His company closed down in 2009 and he sold it in  2010.  His
      separation from his partner had caused his depression in 2009. He last
      saw his children at the end of 2009 or early 2010. He had not tried to
      establish any contact with them whilst he was in prison.  He  received
      some information about them through their godmother.

  21.       The appellant said that his mother had visited Ukraine.  So  had
      his ex-partner.

  22.       He could not see anyone being his mother's  carer  although  the
      family members helped "bit by bit". She did not go out much and no one
      lived with her. He had lived with her for over two years and  he  knew
      that she needed to live with someone. She needed help with cooking. He
      used to take her out for shopping. His siblings  did  not  spend  time
      with her. He had a special connection with her and it was a  difficult
      time for her. He said he did not want to excuse his behaviour  but  he
      had driven without insurance because it had been raining and he needed
      to take his children to school. Since that  time  he  had  always  had
      insurance.  That  completed  cross  examination.  There  was  no   re-
      examination.

  23.       In response to my questions, the appellant said that his adopted
      daughter was 27 and his biological daughter was 23.  He  said  he  was
      from the west of Ukraine. Neither party had any questions arising  and
      that completed the oral evidence.

  24.       The appellant then sought to submit further documentary evidence
      which I refused to admit at this stage  in  the  proceedings.  I  then
      reserved my determination which I now give.

Findings, conclusions and the law

  25.       When reaching my conclusions, I  have  taken  into  account  the
      written and oral documentary evidence and the submissions made by  the
      parties.  I have assessed the evidence as a whole and  have  also  had
      regard to the law and the judgment of MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
      1192 which was included in the appellant's bundle but not referred  to
      in submissions. I bear in mind that it is for the appellant  to  show,
      on the balance of probabilities, that he meets the requirements of the
      Immigration Rules.

  26.       The relevant rules are set out below:


      363. The circumstances in which a person is liable to deportation
include:
      (i) where the Secretary of State deems the person's deportation to  be
      conducive to the public good; .............


      This applies as the deportation order was made under section 32(4)  of
      the UK Borders Act 2007. The appellant is a foreign criminal  and  the
      Secretary of State is therefore obliged to make  a  deportation  order
      under section 32(5), subject to s.33.

  27.       The appellant relies on private and family life  established  in
      the UK:

      398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary to
      the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention,
      and
      (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
      public good because they have been convicted of an offence for which
      they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4
      years;
      ................................
      the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider whether
      paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it will only be in
      exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will
      be outweighed by other factors.


  28.       As he does not have  a  subsisting  parental  relationship  with
      either his adopted or biological adult daughters or  with  a  partner,
      paragraph 399 does not apply. Paragraph 399A does not apply either, as
      the appellant has not spent twenty years living in  the  UK  excluding
      the period of his sentence and he is not under 25 years of age.

  29.       Therefore the parties' submissions focused on whether there were
      exceptional or compelling circumstances  which  would  mean  that  the
      public interest was outweighed by other factors. The factors relied on
      by Ms Javed were the appellant's  relationship  with  his  mother  and
      father which were said to go beyond those of normal  family  ties  and
      would be severed by his deportation and on the strong bond he had with
      other family members. She also argued  that  the  appellant  had  been
      given the minimum sentence in respect of the index  offence,  that  he
      had not used the gun for illegal means  and  that  it  was  not  clear
      whether the appellant's depression and ill health had been taken  into
      account by the sentencing judge.  Although Ms Javed did not argue that
      his long residence in the UK was an exceptional circumstance,  I  have
      considered that as a factor in his favour.  Ms  Javed  also  submitted
      that the appellant's business ties with the Ukraine had ended in 2008.

  30.       I have considered the appellant's  skeleton  argument  dated  28
      March 2014 but have to say that it  is  of  little  assistance  as  it
      focuses on why there was no error of law in the determination  of  the
      First-tier  Tribunal.  That  is  not  relevant  at  this  stage,  that
      determination having already been set aside. There is  no  attempt  to
      engage with the issues at  hand;  why  the  appellant  should  not  be
      deported. Indeed, it appears that the same skeleton argument used  for
      the earlier hearing and dated 24 February,  has  been  reproduced  and
      given a more recent date.

  31.       The appellant has been convicted of a serious crime for which he
      received a five year sentence. Ms Javed referred  me  to  the  judge's
      sentencing  remarks  and  sought   to   make   arguments   about   the
      circumstances of the  conviction  and  possible  shortcomings  in  the
      evidence which led to the conviction. None of that is relevant at this
      stage. I must proceed on the  basis  that  the  appellant  was  fairly
      convicted; there being no challenge to the conviction or sentence,  it
      is difficult to see how Ms Javed can now argue that all  the  relevant
      evidence may not have been before the trial judge.
  32.       Ms Javed also argued that  the  appellant  had  been  given  the
      minimum sentence however I note that the judge did have  a  discretion
      to reduce the sentence if he were to  find  exceptional  circumstances
      relating to the offence or the offender (paragraph D at G4).  He  took
      into account the  mitigation  put  forward  that  the  gun  was  never
      intended for any illegal purpose (paragraph F) but discounted  it  and
      found there were no exceptional  circumstances  (G6)  which  justified
      reduction of the  sentence.  If  those  matters  did  not  assist  the
      appellant in his attempts at mitigation then, I fail to see  how  they
      can be used to assist him now.

  33.       Having received a sentence of five  years,  the  presumption  is
      that the public interest demands the  appellant's  deportation  unless
      there are compelling circumstances which would outweigh it.

  34.       To that end, I have  considered  the  submissions  made  on  the
      appellant's behalf. There is medical  evidence  to  confirm  that  his
      mother (aged 79) has various health problems brought about by diabetes
      (an ulcerated heel), hypertension and constipation.  The  report  from
      the Royal Free confirms that she has had two strokes; in 1996 and 2001
      and a report from North Middlesex University Hospital confirms she has
      a pacemaker.  She attended the hearing and I accept she is confined to
      a wheelchair due to spinal decompression ten years ago.  I accept that
      her poor health causes her hardship and that she would be much happier
      if the appellant was living  with  her.  However,  I  also  note  that
      according to Haringey Social Services, Mrs Zownaruk's needs are  being
      met by her family and that her grand daughter is her carer.  She  also
      appears to have regular visits by district nurses. A  hospital  report
      issued on 22 March 2013 states that she visited the Ukraine last  year
      although she maintains  the  visit  was  a  few  years  ago  when  she
      travelled by coach. An August 2013 hospital report  confirms  she  has
      private  carers,  that  she  "mobilises  with   wheelchair"   and   is
      independent in "transfers".

  35.       The case as presented was that the appellant was the only person
      who could properly care for Mrs Zownaruk but  the  evidence  does  not
      support that claim. Contrary to the appellant's evidence that he lived
      with her for well over two years, it would appear he moved in with her
      at the end of 2009, only because his  relationship  with  his  partner
      broke down and not because of his mother's needs,  and  that  he  then
      moved out in February 2011.  That does not suggest that she needed  24
      hour care as Ms Javed submitted. I also note that the appellant  moved
      to Willesden; his mother lives quite a distance away, in  Wood  Green.
      The appellant himself admitted that he  was  no  help  to  his  mother
      whilst he was suffering from depression; according  to  his  evidence,
      which varied to  some  extent,  this  started  in  2008  or  2009  and
      continued at least until his arrest for the  most  recent  offence  in
      September 2012. The three medical certificates issued (all  duplicated
      in the bundle) are all dated 2011. Plainly someone was caring for  his
      mother throughout this time. The appellant's initial witness statement
      confirmed that his sister,  Natalia,  was  caring  for  their  mother.
      Indeed she attended the hearing and appeared  to  be  responsible  for
      wheeling her mother in and around the  hearing  room.  Other  evidence
      indicates Natalia's daughter, Oksana, has taken over  as  the  primary
      carer. Whilst Mrs Zownaruk maintained she was alone most of the  time,
      her son, Roman, gave evidence that he would stay with her from time to
      time. Had she been in need of additional care or been unable to manage
      with the care that she received, I do  not  accept  that  she  or  her
      relatives would have led Social Services to believe that all her needs
      were being met. For all these  reasons,  whilst  I  fully  accept  Mrs
      Zownaruk would prefer it if the appellant remained in the UK, I do not
      accept that the quality of the care available to her would be inferior
      without him.

  36.       It was submitted by Ms Javed that the ties between the appellant
      and  his  parents  went  beyond  those  of   a   normal   parent-child
      relationship. I do not  accept  this.  The  care  of  elderly  parents
      inevitably poses various difficulties but this is part of  the  ageing
      process and the circumstances of the appellant's elderly  parents  are
      not exceptional, nor do they support  the  claim  that  the  ties  are
      something more than what would be expected between an  elderly  parent
      and adult child. It was argued that the appellant's removal would mean
      that ties between him and his parents would be severed as  his  father
      is in a care home and his mother can no longer travel. If that is  the
      case, it is unfortunately, a consequence of deportation. I would note,
      however, that I have not seen any medical evidence to confirm that Mrs
      Zownaruk is unable to travel and note that she has been to Ukraine  at
      least twice since her confinement to a wheelchair.   No  evidence  has
      been put forward as to why the appellant's siblings would not be  able
      to travel to visit  him  if  they  so  wished.  In  any  event,  their
      relationship does not appear to  be  close.  The  appellant's  written
      evidence was that he did not have much contact  with  his  sister  and
      indeed he says nothing about needing or wanting to be with  either  of
      them or about having a close  relationship  with  them.  His  brother,
      Roman, gave evidence  claiming  that  the  appellant  had  helped  him
      through difficult times  however  he  did  not  even  know  where  the
      appellant used to live  and  was  not  aware  of  his  three  previous
      convictions. He himself admitted in evidence that as he  had  his  own
      problems he did not keep track of the appellant's life. There  was  is
      no evidence before me of how often they would see each other, of  time
      spent together or activities shared.
  37.       Little is known about the appellant's private life in the UK. It
      seems he tried to set up various businesses linked to the Ukraine  but
      these did not succeed. There is no evidence of any employment  he  has
      ever undertaken in this country (other than  two  P60s  for  1996  and
      1997) or of any contributions he has made to  society.  There  are  no
      supporting statements from friends or neighbours.  The  appellant  has
      never been married and his relationship with his former  partner  (who
      joined him from Ukraine with her daughter and his after the expiry  of
      his visit visa) does not appear to have lasted  very  long;  there  is
      contradictory evidence as to whether they separated in  2009  or  much
      earlier, prior to 2000 (according to the determination dated  8  March
      2000). The appellant  maintained  there  had  been  many  separations.
      Whatever the date of the final separation, it remains  the  case  that
      the appellant has no contact with her or with his adopted daughter  or
      biological daughter. Both are in their twenties. It is said that he is
      a committed Christian but no evidence from his Church  is  before  me.
      There is, in fact, very little to show for the years he has spent here
      and nothing to show any ties formed in this country.

  38.       The appellant maintained he had not had any issues with  alcohol
      but plainly he did given the two convictions  for  drink  driving.  He
      said he turned to alcohol in the wake of his depression when  he  fell
      ill with Hepatitis but that was in 2010/2011 and does not address  the
      situation in 2002. I accept that he has, however,  sought  to  address
      the problem whilst he has been in prison. Different  reasons  are  put
      forward for his depression; it is  said  it  was  brought  on  by  his
      domestic problems or by his business failures, debts or the medication
      he received for the treatment of Hepatitis C.  That no longer  appears
      to be an issue; the appellant is now well. In any  event,  it  is  not
      suggested that he would be unable to obtain treatment  for  depression
      in Ukraine.

  39.       I have taken note of the Prison Release Plan for  the  appellant
      and the Prison case notes. I see that he has behaved  well  whilst  in
      prison and has been helping other prisoners in various ways. That goes
      to his credit but does not come anywhere close to being an exceptional
      circumstance. One would expect  good  behaviour  from  someone  facing
      deportation and under close scrutiny.

  40.       It was argued that the appellant has no ties to the Ukraine. The
      appellant came here as an  adult.  Although  he  has  been  away  from
      Ukraine for many years, he still retains  ties  in  the  form  of  the
      religion, culture and language. He has visited several times,  as  has
      his mother, and he has also had business dealings with Ukraine in  the
      past. He may not have relatives but it would not be impossible to  re-
      adjust to life there.  His mother's evidence was  that  she  had  many
      friends there. They may be able to help him find his feet.

  41.       It was clarified in MF (which appears in part in the appellant's
      first bundle and in whole in the second) that the scales  are  heavily
      weighted in favour of deportation and something very compelling, which
      will be exceptional, is required to outweigh the  public  interest  in
      removal (paragraphs 42 and 46). I have carefully  considered  all  the
      factors that have been put forward on behalf  of  the  appellant,  his
      long residence here and the presence of his family, but find that they
      do not amount to very compelling circumstances such as would  outweigh
      the public interest in his deportation.

Decision

  42.       The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity order

  43.       The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  order  and
      there was no request for one to the Upper Tribunal.

ANNEX:

Findings and Conclusions

13.   I reach the conclusion that the panel made errors  of  law  such  that
      the decision has to be remade.

14.   I see nothing in the panel's proportionality assessment which  can  be
      described as an adequate consideration of the  public  interest  apart
      from  a  brief  reference  to  it  in  the  final  paragraph  of   the
      determination which gives the appearance of being an afterthought. The
      assessment of the evidence focuses  on  the  factors  argued  for  the
      appellant; there is no reference to the factors  put  forward  by  the
      Secretary of State. A balancing exercise should be exactly that;  this
      assessment gives the impression of being very one sided.

15.   The weight to be given to the public interest in  the  deportation  of
      foreign criminals is substantial following the switch  from  executive
      to legislative policy as recognised by the courts and set out  in  the
      authorities  Mr  Wilding  referred  to.  There  is  nothing  in   this
      determination which acknowledges that importance or which engages with
      it. A throwaway  line  in  the  concluding  paragraph,  made  after  a
      decision on proportionality is already reached (see paragraph  23)  is
      wholly inadequate.

16.   I agree with Mr Wilding that the panel had no  business  to  re-assess
      the circumstances  of  the  offence.  These  facts  had  already  been
      considered by the sentencing  judge  who  found  that  they  were  not
      exceptional and did not merit a reduction  in  sentence.  The  panel's
      belief that the judge had no discretion in sentencing is  contradicted
      by the remarks of Judge Price himself (at Annex G).

17.   Contrary to what the panel stated, this conviction was not a one  off.
      The appellant had several previous convictions, although I accept they
      did not involve firearms but his persistent abuse of the legal  system
      and the breach of orders issued by the courts do not reflect  well  on
      his character and should have formed part of the assessment.

18.   It is said that he has addressed his alcohol  problem  whilst  he  has
      been in prison. No explanation is provided, however, for  why  he  did
      not do so when he was repeatedly convicted of drink driving  offences.
      It may be that being the subject  of  a  deportation  order  may  have
      focused his mind but good behaviour  at  a  time  when  one  is  under
      intense scrutiny pending an appeal does not carry the same  weight  as
      behaviour at other times.

19.   The panel does not explain why having family here rather  than  abroad
      is an exceptional circumstance.  The  Tribunal  regularly  hears  from
      appellants who make that claim. Further, having an elderly  mother  is
      to be expected at the appellant's age. It appears that his sister  has
      taken over her care and indeed in his witness statement the  appellant
      also refers to other relatives who assist. In those  circumstances  it
      is unclear why the panel found a dependency on the appellant  such  as
      to  engage  Article  8.  Although  it  is  now  maintained  that   the
      appellant's sister is disabled and unable to provide proper care, this
      was not mentioned in the  appellant's  witness  statement  or  at  the
      hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

20.   The panel accepts that the appellant had forgotten he had  a  gun  and
      that he had behaved "bizarrely" waving it around in the street when he
      was drunk. The appellant's own description of what happened that night
      is contained in his witness statement and appears  to  contradict  the
      claim of being so drunk that he did not know what he was doing.

21.   There is an attempt by the Tribunal to minimise the crime; it is  said
      that the appellant did not know the gun would be illegal here, that it
      was legal in the Ukraine, that he only intended to use it  for  target
      practice and that he had forgotten he had it.  None of  those  factors
      detract from the fact that the appellant had a loaded gun in a  public
      area, that great harm could have  resulted  and  that  the  sentencing
      judge who considered those matters did not find them to be exceptional
      or to mitigate the offence.

Decision

22.   The First-tier Tribunal made errors of law. I set the decision  aside.
      It shall be re-made by the Upper Tribunal  at  a  future  date  to  be
      arranged.
