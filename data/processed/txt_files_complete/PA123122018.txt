                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Allen, Counsel, instructed by Polpitiya and Co
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst the respondent is the appellant in these proceedings before me,
    I hereafter refer to the parties using terminology used in the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant in the First-tier Tribunal will hereafter
    be referred to as "the appellant" in these proceedings, and the
    respondent will be referred to as "the respondent".


 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on June 13, 2013 on a spouse
    visa following a successful appeal to the Tribunal. She returned to
    Pakistan on October 8, 2013 but when she returned on October 29, 2013,
    she was refused entry because her relationship was no longer
    subsisting. Her appeal against this decision was refused on June 20,
    2014. She initially claimed asylum on October 23, 2015 but she withdrew
    this application on November 25, 2015.

 3. On November 9, 2015 she made a notification under the Destitute
    Domestic Violence Concession and was granted limited leave to remain
    until February 11, 2016. A subsequent application for indefinite leave
    to remain on the grounds she was a victim of domestic violence was
    refused on September 29, 2016 and following a request for
    administrative review the decision was upheld on November 11, 2016.

 4. The appellant applied for asylum on March 17, 2017 but the respondent
    refused her application on October 9, 2018 under paragraphs 336 and
    339M/339F HC 395.

 5. Th appellant appealed this decision on October 23, 2018 under section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Her appeal
    came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Housego on January 4, 2019
    and in a decision promulgated on January 30, 2019 her appeal was
    allowed on protection, article 3 and article 8 ECHR grounds.

 6. The respondent appealed this decision February 5, 2019 and on March 7,
    2019 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Landes granted permission to
    appeal finding it arguable the Judge erred by failing to:

      a) Engage with a number of points made in the decision letter.
      b) Deal with the fact the appellant had previously given oral evidence
         to Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parkes (June 2014) who had
         found the appellant would have support from family members and that
         article 3 would not be breached if the appellant were returned (See
         paragraph 18 of the FTT Judge's decision).
      c) Explain why he departed from Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
         Parkes' starting point.

 7. The appellant provided what was purported to be a Rule 24 response on
    the morning of the hearing in which she argued:


      a) The Judge did have regard to the previous decision of Judge Parkes
         as the Judge referred to it in his decision but in any event that
         decision was not binding on the FTT Judge as 4 ï¿½ years had passed
         since that decision was handed down and there was new evidence
         before the Tribunal.
      b) The FTT Judge had considered all the evidence including the content
         of the decision letter and gave reasons for his findings at
         paragraphs 65-72 of his decision.

 8. Pursuant to Rule 14(1) of  the  Tribunal  Procedures  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (the UT Procedure Rules) I make  an  order  prohibiting  the
    disclosure  or  publication  of  specified  documents  or   information
    relating to the proceedings or of any matter likely to lead members  of
    the public to identify any person whom  the  Upper  Tribunal  considers
    should not be identified.  The effect of such an  anonymity  order  may
    therefore be to prohibit anyone not merely the parties in the case from
    disclosing  relevant  information.   Breach  of  this  order   may   be
    punishable as a contempt of court.

    SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr Avery submitted there were conflicting written and  oral  statements
    given by appellant relating to her true situation.  There  had  been  a
    previous appeal before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Parkes  and
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Housego did not engage with the issues
    in any detail but instead engaged in  generalities.  Findings  of  fact
    were intermixed with a recording of the evidence and he  submitted  the
    Judge gave inadequate findings and failed to demonstrate any engagement
    with the previous findings of Judge Parkes.  There  were  a  number  of
    issues raised in the decision letter which the Judge failed to address.
    He submitted the decision should be set aside and remade.

10. Ms Allen adopted her Rule 24 response and argued the Judge  did  engage
    with the previous decision  of  Judge  Parkes  but  that  the  previous
    decision was an entry clearance application and Judge Parkes  was  only
    concerned  with  whether  she  had  any  family  members  to  turn  to.
    Paragraphs 10-12 of Judge Parkes' decision set out the  evidence  given
    and she submitted  there  was  nothing  contradictory  in  the  current
    evidence.

11. Ms Allen submitted the Judge was now concerned  with  different  issues
    and had to apply SM (lone women-ostracism) CG [2016] UKUT 67 (IAC). The
    issue was whether she would be at risk as  a  single  woman  whose  two
    marriages had failed which was different to the issue Judge Parkes  had
    to decide.

12. The Judge considered the documents at paragraphs  65  and  67  and  the
    issue of return was dealt with at  paragraph  73.  The  Judge  set  out
    respondent's  position  and  the  finding  at  paragraph  67  was   not
    challenged. There was nothing wrong with the Judge intermixing findings
    and various factual statements as long as the Judge  made  findings  on
    that evidence.

    FINDINGS

13. Mr Avery has challenged the decision:

      a) The format of the Judge's decision.

      b) A failure to engage with the evidence.

      c) A failure to take Judge Parkes' decision as the starting point.

14. The appellant had originally been granted leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom as a spouse on June 13, 2013 but when her marriage  broke  down
    her leave was curtailed and she  appealed  that  decision  to  the  FTT
    Tribunal under article 3 and 8 ECHR albeit when the appeal came  before
    Judge Parkes, her representatives  did  not  pursue  the  appeal  under
    article 3 as it was accepted the facts  did  not  reach  the  necessary
    threshold.

15. The evidence given to Judge Parkes was that the appellant had no family
    to turn to in Pakistan, but the Judge concluded at  paragraph  27  that
    she would be supported in  Pakistan  by  either  her  UK  relatives  or
    distant relatives, even if they did not include her brother or uncle.

16. The appeal, considered by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Housego  on
    January 4, 2019 centred on membership  of  a  particular  social  group
    namely women in Pakistan being members of a social group. Reliance  was
    placed on the country guidance decision of SM.

17. The respondent had not accepted her claim that she had been the subject
    of domestic violence from her first husband or forced into marrying her
    second husband. Weight on the second finding was placed on the evidence
    placed before Judge Parkes.

18. Reading paragraphs 52 to 64 of the  Judge's  decision  it  appears  the
    Judge accepted everything that was advanced on her behalf.  Mr  Avery's
    submission is that in doing so the Judge failed to make any findings on
    the content of the decision letter even though it had been recorded  at
    paragraph 65 that the document had been considered carefully. Mr  Avery
    argued that paragraphs 52 to 64 were not "facts  found"  but  simply  a
    stating of the appellant's own case. There was no engagement  with  the
    decision letter. His argument has merit.

19. Thereafter, between paragraphs 65 and 72 the Judge  set  out  what  are
    described as "reasons for the findings of fact" but with the  exception
    of a reference in paragraph 72 to the  decision  letter  there  was  no
    other engagement with the content of the decision letter especially  in
    relation to her second marriage.

20. The Judge's conclusions from paragraph  73  are  based  on  the  flawed
    findings and, whilst they may ultimately be open to a Judge,  I  accept
    Mr Avery's submission that by  failing  to  engage  with  the  decision
    letter or explain  why  she  rejected  those  submissions,  the  actual
    conclusions/findings were flawed.

21. This case is all  about  credibility  and  findings  of  fact  will  be
    required on all the evidence.

22. In the circumstances, I find there has been an error in law and I remit
    this matter back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  heard  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Housego under section 12(1)
    of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.



    NOTICE OF DECISION

23. There is an error in law.  I set aside the original decision and  remit
    the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal under section 12(1)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.


Signed                              Date 15/04/2019
