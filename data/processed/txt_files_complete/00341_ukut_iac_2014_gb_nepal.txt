It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier Tribunal  judgments
to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case. This leads to  judgments
becoming overly long and confused and is not  a  proportionate  approach  to
deciding cases. It  is,  however,  necessary  for  judges  to  identify  and
resolve key conflicts in the evidence and explain in clear and  brief  terms
their reasons, so that the parties can  understand  why  they  have  won  or
lost.


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Reynolds of Counsel instructed by Reemans
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr R Hopkin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against a decision of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Eban
    determined and promulgated on 7 April 2014, whereby the judge found  in
    favour of the appellant, Ganga Budhathoki, and held that the  appellant
    fell within regulation 7(1)(c) of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 and the Secretary of State was wrong to refuse a
    residence card.  The reasons for refusal are set  out  in  a  statutory
    letter of refusal and reasons for refusal, both dated 22 April 2013.

 2. The appeal is brought by the Secretary of State on simple grounds based
    on a failure by the judge to give adequate reasons,  in  particular,  a
    failure to give reasons in paragraphs 12 and 14 of  the  Determination,
    to which paragraphs we shall return.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted on 15 May 2014  on  the  basis  of  an
    arguable failure to give reasons and a failure to consider whether  the
    EEA sponsor in this case  was  a  qualified  person  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom.

The Determination and Reasons

 4. It is necessary to set out  some  of  the  salient  paragraphs  of  the
    Determination and Reasons to see this appeal in its full context:-

         "The Respondent's Case


         6.   The basis for the decision was that  the  respondent  was  not
             satisfied that the appellant was genuinely  dependent  on  the
             EEA sponsor.


         7.   At the hearing Ms Malhotra submitted that when  the  appellant
             had applied for a visit visa to come to the UK she  relied  on
             the fact that she had extensive  valuable  property  in  Nepal
             which would encourage her to return.


         The Appellant's Claim


         8.   The appellant claims she meets the criteria laid down  in  the
             EEA Regulations.


         Evidence


         9.   I heard the appellant, her son and his wife, the EEA  sponsor,
             give evidence.  They all told me that they now  live  together
             as a family unit.  Following  the  death  of  the  appellant's
             husband in February 2006 the appellant continued  to  live  in
             her home in Nepal but had no income.  The appellant's son  and
             the EEA sponsor supported the appellant financially and I  was
             referred to evidence of money transfers dating  back  to  2007
             when the appellant was in  Nepal  and  her  son  and  the  EEA
             sponsor were in the UK.


         10.  The appellant came to the UK as a visitor on three  occasions.
             After the first two she returned home, but during her stay she
             made the application the subject of this appeal.
         11.  The witnesses' evidence was that the  appellant  continues  to
             own a house and land in Nepal but this does  not  provide  her
             with an income.


         My Findings of Fact


         12.  I have considered the respondent's concerns about the evidence
             provided by the appellant.  On the basis of  the  appellant's,
             her son's and the  EEA  sponsor's  evidence  as  well  as  the
             documents provided I make the following findings:-


             1.   The EEA sponsor is an EEA national.
             2.   The appellant is a non-EEA national.
             3.   Mr Pradip Budhathoki is the appellant's son.
             4.   Mr Pradip Budhathoki is married to the EEA sponsor.
             5.   The appellant, Mr Pradip Budhathoki and the  EEA  sponsor
                  live together as a family in the same house.
             6.   Mr Pradip  Budhathoki  and  the  EEA  sponsor  have  been
                  sending financial support to the appellant since at  least
                  2007.
             7.   The appellant has no income other than what she  receives
                  from Mr Pradip Budhathoki and the EEA sponsor.


         Discussion


         [The First-tier Tribunal judge referred to the  decision  in  Reyes
         (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314 (IAC) and set out  paragraph
         19 from that decision.]


         14.  Dependency is a question of fact.  Looking at all the evidence
             in the round, I  find  that  notwithstanding  the  appellant's
             ownership of a house  and  land  in  Nepal,  the  EEA  sponsor
             provides the appellant with material support and she has  done
             so for many years.  I find on balance that  the  appellant  is
             dependent on the  EEA  sponsor  and  that  the  dependency  is
             genuine and not contrived.


         15.  I find that the appellant falls within Regulation 7(1)(c)."


Analysis

 5. In his submissions for the Secretary of State,  Mr  Hopkin  took  issue
    with sub-paragraphs (1), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of paragraph 12  of  the
    Determination and Reasons.  He submitted that there was  a  failure  by
    the judge to explain (a) what evidence she relied  on  in  relation  to
    those findings of fact; and (b) to give any reasons as to why  she  had
    reached such findings.

 6. He further submitted that it  was  necessary  for  the  judge  to  have
    elucidated in relation to each sub-paragraph the evidence  and  reasons
    behind each finding because these matters were (a)  controversial;  and
    (b) it was  necessary  to  do  so  in  order  that  the  parties  could
    understand, and be in no doubt as to, why those findings  of  fact  had
    been made.

 7. In making such submissions Mr Hopkin relied on the recent authority  of
    MK (duty to give  reasons)  Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT  00641  (IAC)  which
    referred to the well-known authority of Tanveer Ahmed [2002] Imm AR 318
    and various other authorities  about  the  duty  to  give  reasons,  in
    particular R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Khan [1983] QB  790
    and Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies [2000] 1  All  ER  373.  In  the
    succinct phrase of Henry LJ, "Transparency should be the  watch  word".
    Parties should be in no doubt why they have won or lost:

             "The judge must explain why he has reached his decision.   The
             question is always what is required of the judge to do so; and
             that will differ from case to case. Transparency should be the
             watch word".

 8. Mr Reynolds, for the appellant, submitted that the  judge  had  made  a
    "concise and precise determination"  of  the  evidence,  made  findings
    which were appropriate and justified and which could  be  explained  by
    the evidence that was before the Secretary  of  State  and  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. He relied in particular on a copy of the  passport
    of the EEA national and the fact that the EEA sponsor and  her  husband
    were in a relationship and exercising Treaty rights and  evidence  that
    the EEA sponsor worked as a nurse in a  fertility  clinic.  He  further
    relied on a copy of the marriage certificate between them and the  fact
    that the judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor,  her  husband  and
    the appellant. He submitted that the judge had plainly come to  a  view
    that their evidence was to be believed as to dependency and that  there
    was therefore no need for the sort of analysis that MK required as  set
    out in the head note, which reads:

         "Where a Tribunal finds oral evidence to be implausible, incredible
         or unreliable, or a document to be worth no weight  whatsoever,  it
         is necessary to say so in the determination and for  such  findings
         to be supported by reasons.  The bare statement that a witness  was
         not believed or that a document afforded no weight is  unlikely  to
         satisfy the requirements to give reasons."

 9. Mr Reynolds submitted that no such issue arose in this case  and  that,
    therefore, the decision and the reasons given for it by the judge  were
    satisfactory.

10. We find both Counsel partially right in their submissions and partially
    wrong.  We were unimpressed by Mr Hopkin's submissions in  relation  to
    sub-paragraphs (1), (4) and (5) of paragraph 12. It is plain that there
    was material before the Secretary of State and the Tribunal  justifying
    those fairly prosaic findings.  In our view, no real difficulty  arises
    in the losing party understanding why the determination was as  it  was
    on those particular issues, as Mr Reynolds  demonstrated.  Mr  Reynolds
    for the appellant was, however, in difficulties  in  relation  to  sub-
    paragraphs (6) and  (7)  of  paragraph  12  of  the  Determination  and
    Reasons. He was also in difficulty in relation to paragraph 14  of  the
    Determination and Reasons, where the judge found  that  notwithstanding
    the appellant's ownership of a house and land in Nepal, the EEA sponsor
    provided the appellant with  material  support  and  "on  balance"  the
    appellant was dependent.

11. These difficulties stemmed from paragraph 7 of  the  Determination  and
    Reasons quoted above which presented Mr Reynolds  with  an  insuperable
    problem.  It is clear that a significant issue at  the  hearing  relied
    upon by the Secretary of State was that the appellant had applied for a
    visa to come to the United Kingdom on the basis that she had "extensive
    valuable property in Nepal which would encourage her to  return".   The
    Tribunal raised this with Mr Reynolds who said that he was  present  at
    the original hearing and from his recollection the  evidence  that  the
    property was in a dilapidated state was not the subject  of  challenge.
    Regrettably, Mr Reynolds was wrong about this.  He should have  checked
    the First-Tier Tribunal record (which was  in  the  bundle  before  us)
    before telling the  Upper  Tribunal  something  which  was  misleading.
    Fortunately, we took the precaution of examining the First-Tier  record
    from which it was clear that the state of the property in Nepal  (which
    the appellant asserted with one  breath  was  "valuable"  and  when  it
    suited  her  she  asserted   it   was   "dilapidated")   was,   indeed,
    controversial  and  was  challenged   at   the   hearing.    In   these
    circumstances, it is difficult to understand on what  basis  the  judge
    concluded that "notwithstanding the appellant's ownership  of  a  house
    and land in Nepal" there was dependency. No reasons are given for  that
    finding. No reasons are given as to what resolution of the conflict  in
    the evidence and submissions about the state or condition or  value  or
    extent of the property in Nepal is given.  In our judgement, it is fair
    to say that a losing party reading this  decision  would  be  none  the
    wiser as to why the decision had been reached as it had, or as  to  the
    reasoning of the judge on this key controversial issue.  The  Secretary
    of State would be in doubt as to why she had lost.  The decision is not
    "transparent". In particular, the reasoning  behind  paragraphs  12(6),
    12(7) and 14 is not clear.

Further matters

12. There are two further matters which we add  into  this  analysis.   The
    first is that it is apparent from the financial  records  that  despite
    the assertion that there were monthly payments by the  EEA  sponsor  to
    the appellant, there would appear to  be  a  significant  gap  from  14
    November 2009 when �150 was sent to Nepal  until  15  March  2011  when
    �148.10 was sent, a period of one year and four months.  That gap is on
    the face of it significant, but is unexplained in  the  judgment.   The
    second issue is the legal context of the decision.  The judge  set  out
    paragraph 19 of Reyes as to the meaning of dependency for EEA purposes.
     It is necessary to quote a part of that judgment:

         "19.     From the above [case  law],  we  glean  four  key  things.
             First, the test  of  dependency  is  a  purely  factual  test.
             Second, the court envisages that questions of dependency  must
             not be reduced to a bare calculation of  financial  dependency
             but  should  be  construed  broadly  to  involve  a   holistic
             examination of  a  number  of  factors,  including  financial,
             physical and social conditions, so  as  to  establish  whether
             there is dependence that is genuine.  The essential focus  has
             to be on the nature  of  the  relationship  concerned  and  on
             whether it is one characterised by a situation  of  dependence
             based on an examination  of  all  the  factual  circumstances,
             bearing in mind the underlying objective  of  maintaining  the
             unity of the family.  It seems to us that the need for a wide-
             ranging fact-specific approach is indeed enjoined by the Court
             of Appeal in SM (India) ..."

13. What is absent it seems  to  us  from  Judge  Eban's  judgment  is  any
    indication that  she  carried  out  a  fact-specific  analysis  of  the
    evidence or any explanation as to why she concluded in the  appellant's
    favour as to dependency on a sponsor in the UK in circumstances  which,
    on their face, were puzzling, viz. where (a) the  appellant  had  lived
    separately in Nepal from the EEA sponsor and her son for many years and
    (b) she had property in Nepal which she asserted was "valuable".

Caveat

14. We are not for a moment suggesting that judgments have to set  out  the
    entire interstices of the evidence presented or  analyse  every  nuance
    between the parties. Far from it.   Indeed, we  should  make  it  clear
    that it is generally unnecessary, unhelpful and  unhealthy  for  First-
    tier Tribunal judgments to seek  to  rehearse  every  detail  or  issue
    raised in the case.  This leads to judgments becoming overly  long  and
    confused.  Further, it is not  a  proportionate  approach  to  deciding
    cases.   It is, however, necessary for First-tier  Tribunal  judges  to
    identify and resolve the key conflicts in the evidence and  explain  in
    clear and brief terms their reasons for  preferring  one  case  to  the
    other so that the parties can understand why they have won or lost.

Conclusion

15. For those reasons we uphold the appeal,  set  aside  the  decision  and
    remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision in the
    light of this judgment.
