                                  Between:

                          LEELA SANKAR NARAYANASAMI

                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born on 8 January 1975. He  appeals
    against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Suffield-Thompson,
    dated 19 July 2019, dismissing his appeal against the refusal of  leave
    to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman on 28
    October 2019. It was accepted in the initial Rule 24 response that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in failing to apply Chikwamba, but
    that the error law was not material.

 3. In response to further directions from the Upper Tribunal, indicating a
    remote hearing, the Respondent accepted, on  10  July  2020,  that  the
    error of law  was  material.  It  was  accepted  the  judge  found  the
    relationship between the Appellant and  Sponsor  was  genuine  and  the
    financial requirements were met.

 4. The Respondent stated: "Given the change in  circumstances  since  this
    appeal began, i.e.  the  appellant  and  sponsor's  son  gaining  entry
    clearance because of his exceptional circumstances  in  India  and  the
    impact on family life along with the sponsor's employment  this  appeal
    is not resisted."

Conclusions and reasons

 5. Given the Respondent's concession, I find that the First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law. I set aside the decision of 19 July 2019 and  remake  it.
    The Appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
