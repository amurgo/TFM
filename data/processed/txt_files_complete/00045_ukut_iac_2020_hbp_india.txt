               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Akinbolu, Counsel, instructed by Montecristo
LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer

(1) In its application  to  a  "qualifying  child"  within  the  meaning  of
section 117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  section
117C(5) imposes the same two requirements  as  are  specified  in  paragraph
399(a)(ii) of the Immigration Rules; namely, that it would be  unduly  harsh
for the child to leave the United Kingdom and for the child to remain.

(2)  In  both  section  117C(5)  and  paragraph  399(a)(ii),  what  judicial
decision-makers are being required to assess is a  hypothetical  question  -
whether going or staying 'would' be unduly harsh. They are not  being  asked
to undertake a predictive factual analysis as to whether such a child  would
in fact go or stay.

(3) Nationality (in the form of British citizenship) is  a  relevant  factor
when assessing whether the 'unduly harsh' requirements  of  section  117C(5)
are met. However, it is not necessarily a weighty  factor;  all  depends  on
the facts.

(4) The possession of British citizenship by a child with whom a person  (P)
has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship does not mean that  P  is
exempted from the 'unduly harsh' requirements. Even though the child may  be
British, it has to be unduly harsh both for him or her to leave  with  P  or
to stay without P; not just harsh. Thus, some substantial interference  with
the rights and expectations  that  come  with  being  British  is  possible,
without the position becoming one of undue harshness to the child.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is a decision to whose writing each member of the panel has
contributed.

2.   A citizen of India aged 37, the appellant has permission to challenge
the decision of Judge Welsh of the First-tier Tribunal sent on 30 April
2019 dismissing his appeal against the decisions made by the respondent on
4 December 2018 to make a deportation order and on 6 December 2018 to
refuse his human rights claim.

3.   The appellant came to the UK in 2008 with entry clearance as a spouse.
 In November 2013 he was granted indefinite leave to remain.  He is a
foreign criminal by virtue of the fact that on 26 January 2016 he was
convicted of three counts of conspiring to
conceal/disguise/convert/transfer/remove criminal property and one count of
proceeds of crime money laundering - failure to disclose in regulated
sector. On 20 February 2017 he was sentenced to three years and six months'
imprisonment.  In his sentencing remarks, the judge noted that: "[m]oney
laundering is integral to the serious criminality: in this case drug
dealing."  The appellant's wife, who also originates from India, came to
the UK in 2006 as a student.  She and the appellant have a son born in
April 2013.  On 6 January 2016 she and her son were naturalised as British
citizens.  As an infant the child suffered from macrocephaly and
thoracolumbar scoliosis.

4.   The judge found the appellant and his wife to be credible and reliable
witnesses.

5.   The judge noted the legal requirements applicable to the appellant's
case as being those set out in section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration
and Asylum Act 2002 and the broadly corresponding provisions of the
Immigration Rules at paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A.

6.   Section 117C, headed, "Article 8: additional considerations in cases
involving foreign criminals", provides:

         "(1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a  foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3) In the case of a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4) Exception 1 applies where-

         (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most  of
         C's life,

         (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United  Kingdom,
         and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles  to  C's  integration
         into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

         (5) Exception 2 applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are  to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted."


7.   The relevant immigration rules are paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A.

8.   Paragraph 398 is as follows:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

         (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or

         (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law, the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

9.   Paragraph 399 of the Rules applies where paragraph 398 (b)  or  (c)  is
engaged, if -
         "(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

         (i) the child is a British Citizen; or

         (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the  7
         years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration  decision;
         and in either case

         (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in  the  country
         to which the person is to be deported; and

         (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  remain  in  the  UK
         without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and

         (i)  the  relationship  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
         (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status  was
         not precarious; and

         (ii) it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to  live  in  the
         country  to  which  the  person  is  to  be  deported,  because  of
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those   described   in
         paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

         (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the UK
         without the person who is to be deported."

10.  Paragraph 399A provides:
         "This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -

         (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
         his life; and

         (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."


11.  With reference to section 117C(3)-(5), the judge noted that, as the
appellant had not lawfully been in the UK for most of his life, he could
not meet Exception 1.  The judge then turned to Exception 2, noting that
the appellant's representative before her (Mr Malik) had conceded that if
the requirements of Exception 2 are not met, the appeal must fail because
on the facts of the case there were not "very compelling circumstances".
In relation to Exception 2, the judge concluded that it would not be unduly
harsh for the appellant's wife either to relocate to India or (if she
chose) to remain in the UK with her son if the appellant were deported.  As
regards the appellant's child, the judge found that even though it is in
his best interests to be with both parents in the UK, it would not be
unduly harsh for the child to relocate to India nor unduly harsh for him to
remain in the UK.

12.  The appellant's grounds have two main components, it being submitted
(1) that the judge applied an unduly stringent approach to the public
interest, as evidenced by his reference in paragraph 48 to there being "a
strong public interest in the Appellant's removal"; and (2) that the
judge's treatment of the best interests of the child failed to take into
account in assessing the 'unduly harsh' requirements that the son was a
British citizen.  In relation to ground (1), it was submitted that the
Supreme Court in Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60 had made clear, that whilst
great weight ought to be applied to the public interest in deportation,
that weight was not a fixity. In relation to ground (2), it was highlighted
that the judge accepted that: the appellant and his wife would not be able
to afford a private education for their son on return to India, which would
mean he would be taught in Gujarati, which he does not speak; that the son
suffers from infantile scoliosis and requires yearly checkups; and that the
child's school and friendship networks are "sources of happiness and
stability" for the child that would be fractured by the move.  It was
argued that at no point in this assessment did the judge treat "the British
child's best interests as a primary consideration".

13.  Both parties produced skeleton arguments, but it is convenient to
refer to these by reference to the oral submissions.

14.  At the hearing, Ms Akinbolu reiterated the point made in her skeleton
argument as regards ground (1) that the public interest was not a fixity
and that factors such as the risk of reoffending, the length of the
sentence and the conduct since the offence committed were also relevant to
that assessment.  She said that the judge made no reference to the low risk
of reoffending presented by the appellant.

15.  As regards ground (2), Ms Akinbolu submitted that the judge had failed
to take into account that for the child to relocate to India would entail
the loss of his rights as a British citizen, including his right to a
British education and to grow up knowing what it means to be British and to
establish social connections with other British citizen children in his
formative years.  Ms Akinbolu accepted that the judge had said at paragraph
33 that she had taken the fact that the child was a British citizen into
account, but in fact she had compartmentalised her consideration so as to
ignore it.  Although it was not foreshadowed in the grounds upon which
permission to appeal had been granted, Ms Akinbolu asserted that it was
also relevant, drawing on the Zambrano (Zambrano (Ruiz Zambrano v Office
national de l'emploi (Case C-34/09) [2012] QB 265) line of cases, in
particular CS (Case C-304/14,Secretary of State for the Home Department v
CS), that the loss of a child's rights were not justifiable by reference to
something done by the father.  The "compelled to leave" criterion set out
in Zambrano was relevant when looking at the second limb relating to
whether it was unduly harsh on the child to stay without his father.  The
CJEU in cases such as CS had emphasised the need for there to be "genuine
enjoyment of the substance of the rights and benefits attaching to Union
citizenship".  Indeed what it said was stronger than that.

16.  Ms Akinbolu's skeleton argument outlined that the judge's finding that
it would not be unduly harsh for the child to relocate to India paid no
attention to his British citizenship.  Given his mother's unequivocal
statement that she would have to go with her husband should he be deported,
a statement supported by the medical evidence of her ongoing depression,
that finding was material.

17.  Ms Akinbolu was asked by the bench what significance, if any, should
be attached to the child's possession of Indian nationality or at least his
Indian heritage.  Ms Akinbolu submitted that the child would always have
access to India but in this case the cost of facilitating this would be
that his father was deported.  Given his youth, the child can only access
enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to British citizenship
via his parents.  The child was actually enjoying the rights and benefits
of his British nationality and to compel him to leave with his father and
mother would be to visit on him the sins of his father, contrary to
ZH(Tanzania) [2011] 2 AC 166 and Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 34. It would be unduly
harsh.

18.  Ms Akinbolu accepted that it could be harsher to compel a child to
leave if in the country of destination the child had no citizenship rights,
but that did not mean compulsion was not unduly harsh in this case.
Exception 2 did not require a consideration of compulsion.  There was also
a difference between the two limbs of the 'unduly harsh' test.  When
looking at the effect on the child were he or she not to stay, one has to
consider the loss of the rights of British citizenship and Union
citizenship that that entails.  In reply to a question from the bench as to
whether in her view it made any difference when considering the 'unduly
harsh' issue that a British child was (at one end of the spectrum) very
young or (at the other end of the spectrum), nearly 18, she agreed that the
age of the child and how long he or she had lived in the UK required fact-
sensitive treatment.  The lack of opportunity for a very young child to
continue to be able to enjoy the rights and benefits of British citizenship
could be very material.

19.  Mr Lindsay submitted that the appellant's ground (1) was unmeritorious
because the fact that the public interest in deportation is strong is
uncontentious.  It includes a concept of deterrence as well as public
confidence in the system.

20.  As regards ground (2), Mr Lindsay recalled that the respondent's rule
24 response acknowledged that there was an error of form on the part of the
judge in not explicitly considering the relevance of the child's British
nationality in the section of the determination dealing with the question
of whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to relocate to India, but
this error was not material to the outcome of the decision and the
appellant's appeal should be rejected accordingly.  Read as a whole, the
judge's findings were sustainable.  There is a sound finding that the child
can stay in the UK without his father and thus the issue of going to India
is not relevant.  There was a proper consideration of the child's best
interests and also of whether the appellant's deportation would cause undue
hardship.  It is a safe inference that the judge had in mind the relevance
of the child being British throughout her assessment. The respondent's
skeleton argument had stated that "the unduly harsh assessment is in
substance a best interests assessment" and that the respondent's position
as set out in the refusal decision was that the child's status as a British
citizen will not be altered in the event of relocation to India.

21.  In response to the question the bench had asked Ms Akinbolu about
whether it made any difference when considering the 'unduly harsh' issue
that the British child was very young or nearly 18, Mr Lindsay agreed it
was fact-sensitive but it could not be right to equate mere opportunity to
grow up as British with rights accrued by, say, living in the UK for
seventeen years.  In the appellant's case, it was obvious what were the
relevant rights and benefits being enjoyed on the one hand and on the other
hand those standing to be enjoyed potentially.  "Potential cannot be
stronger than the actual enjoyment of a right".  There was no requirement
for the judge to set out what the rights and benefits were comparatively.

22.  Mr Lindsay said that the fact that the child in question has a dual
heritage was relevant because it cannot be assumed that life abroad is
inferior to life here.  There was no evidence before the Tribunal that dual
nationality was not permitted and hence there was nothing for the judge to
consider under this rubric.

23.  Mr Lindsay emphasised the point that there was an unchallenged finding
that it would not be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK.  Hence
any error on the part of the judge in relation to this issue was not
material because the requirements set out in paragraph 399(ii) (a)-(b) are
conjunctive.

24.  By reference to the Zambrano line of cases, including Dereci (Dereci v
Bundesministerium f�r Inneres (Case C-256/11) [2012] All ER (EC) 373 and
CS, Mr Lindsay submitted that 'compelled to leave' was clearly a high
threshold.  As was clear from Secretary of State for the Home Department v
VM (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 255 at [57] and [64] in particular, a case
could not succeed unless there was a compulsion to leave the jurisdiction.
In the appellant's case, indications of compulsion were clearly lacking.
The judge considered the medical evidence relating to both the child and
the mother and was entitled to conclude that there would be no shortfall in
the child's care should the family be split.  There was no "entire
dependency" on the relevant parent - the appellant.

25.  Ms Akinbolu submitted that VM should be distinguished because the
starting point in that case was that the exceptions did not apply.  So the
only issue was whether there were exceptional circumstances outside the
Rules.  She queried whether Mr Lindsay's contention that actual enjoyment
always outweighed potential enjoyment of the rights and benefits of
nationality could be right.  It was clear from the British naturalisation
criteria that the Secretary of State accepts that British citizenship is
more than mere birth in the country (in the case of a child born here) but
comprises a set of values.  Applicants have to prove knowledge and
understanding of these values.

Recent case law

26.  We refer to a number of key decisions below. Since we heard this case,
there have been further cases of relevance, in particular: (on the 'unduly
harsh' issues in the context of deportation) Secretary of State for the
Home Department v KF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 2051 (22 November 2019) and
CI(Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 2027, 22 November 2019; (on the public interest
issue) Akinyemi v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019]
EWCA Civ 2098 (04 December 2019); and (on the Zambrano issues) Patel
(Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)
Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) v Shah (Appellant)
[2019] UKSC 59. We did not consider it necessary to ask the parties to
provide further submissions as to the significance of any of these cases
because each reached conclusions broadly in line with pre-existing
authority.




OUR ASSESSMENT

General

27.  Before proceeding to assessment of the appellant's particular case, it
will assist to address the underlying issue which led to this case being
made the subject of a Presidential panel, namely the (British) citizenship
of the child. Unlike another case heard by the same panel on this issue,
this case is an in-country case.

28.  Because this case concerns a person liable to deportation, section
117B(6) of the 2002 Act (which contains a provision relating to a parent of
British citizen child) is inapplicable. However, the British citizenship of
the child of a person liable to deportation is still relevant in the
section 117C(5) context  because what it concerns is the issue of whether
the effect of such a person's deportation on a 'qualifying child' would be
unduly harsh.  Section 117D(1)  provides that:

         "'qualifying child' means a person who is under the age of 18 and
         who-
         a) is a British citizen; or
         b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven
            years or more".

29.  Parliament has thus chosen to make a British citizen child a
"qualifying child" for the purposes of Part 5A, irrespective of his or her
length of residence in the UK. Both section 117B(6), which applies to a
parent who is not liable to deportation,  and section 117C(5), which
applies to a parent who is liable to deportation, reflect this. In both
instances, the relevant provision cannot benefit parents of a child who is
neither a British citizen nor has a continuous period of seven years'
residence. However, the test of "unduly harsh" in section117C(5) is a
stricter one than the test of reasonableness in section 117B(6): see KO
(Nigeria) at [23].

30.  Also involved are the somewhat differently formulated provisions of
paragraph 399 (ii)) which has two express limbs, one ((a)) concerned with
whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to "live in the country to
which the person is to be deported"; the other ((b)) concerned with whether
"it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without the
person who is to be deported".

31.  In its application to a "qualifying child" within the meaning of
section 117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, section
117C(5) imposes the same two requirements as are specified in paragraph
399(a)(ii) of the Immigration Rules; namely, that it would be unduly harsh
for the child to leave the United Kingdom and for the child to remain. To
read section 117C(5) as being concerned only with one requirement -  either
whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to leave or whether it would
be unduly harsh for the child to remain - would be to contemplate unduly
harsh effects arising even when there was a viable alternative available
that was not unduly harsh - going or staying whichever was the case. We are
not aware of this particular aspect of the 'unduly harsh' requirements
having been expressly addressed in previous analyses essayed by the higher
courts or Upper Tribunal, but what has been said strongly implies that the
two provisions apply the same requirements. In KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53,
Lord Carnwath stated at [5] that: "[i]t is unnecessary to refer in detail
to the Changes to the Immigration Rules made at the same time (paragraphs
398-399), since it is not argued that any differences are material to the
issues before us. It is to be noted however that the question whether "the
effect" of C's deportation would be "unduly harsh" (section 117C(5)) is
broken down into two parts in paragraph 399". In [20]-[21] of CI (Nigeria)
[2019] EWCA Civ 2027, 22 November 2019,  Leggatt LJ states at [20]:
"Paragraphs 398-399A ... are in very similar terms to section 117C(3)-(6)
of the 2002 Act."

32.  We also consider salient that in both section 117C(5) and paragraph
399(a)(ii), what judicial decision-makers are being required to assess is a
hypothetical question - whether going or staying 'would' be unduly harsh.
They are not being asked to undertake a predictive factual analysis as to
whether such a child would in fact go or stay.

Nationality

33.  In SSHD v Al-Jedda [2013] UKSC 62 at [12], Lord Wilson endorsed the
well-known aphorism of Warren CJ in Perez v Brownell, 356 US 44, 64 (1958)
that the right to nationality was "nothing less than the right to have
rights". In international law, nationality is defined as the legal
relationship or 'legal bond' between the national and his or her state. It
is 'the juridical expression of the fact that an individual upon whom it is
conferred...is in fact more closely connected with the population of the
State conferring nationality than with that of any other State'. (Nottebohm
Case (Liechtenstein v Guatemala): Second Phase, ICJ, 6 April 1955, ICJ
Reports, p.4,23; General List, No.18). It gives rise to rights and duties
on the part of both sides of this relationship.

34.  As regards the substantive contents of these rights and duties, there
is no definitive statement, although there is broad agreement (we draw here
on the summary given by Alice Edwards in Nationality and Statelessness
under International Law, C.U.P 2014 (eds Alice Edwards and Laura van Waas))
that from the perspective of the national, possessing the nationality of a
particular state is generally associated with being granted entitlements to
a range of rights, in particular, rights to (re-) admission and to take up
residence,  consular assistance when abroad, to run for elections,
participate in public life and to vote, and the right to economic, social
and cultural advancement. Correspondingly, from the perspective of the
state, it is generally seen to owe certain duties to its nationals, in
particular the right of diplomatic protection and the duty of (re)admission
and residence. Nationals may be required to perform specific civic duties,
including the obligation to defend the state against enemies (military
service) and to pay taxes and can be liable for certain criminal offences,
wherever committed.

35.  The absence of any agreed content to substantive rights and duties
attaching to nationality undoubtedly reflects the strong recognition that
it is largely for states to determine the precise contents of the rights
and benefits they afford to their nationals. The UNHCR Handbook on
Protection of Stateless Persons under the 1954 Convention relating to the
Status of Stateless Persons (Geneva, 2014), which was referred to by the
Supreme Court in Pham (Appellant) v SSHD (Respondent) [2015] UKSC 19 at
[24], notes at paragraph 53:

         "Where States grant a legal status to certain groups of people over
         whom  they  consider  to  have  jurisdiction  on  the  basis  of  a
         nationality link rather than a form of  residence,  then  a  person
         belonging to this category will be a "national" for the purposes of
         the 1954 Convention. Generally, at a minimum, such status  will  be
         associated with the right of entry, re-entry and residence  in  the
         State's territory but there may be situations where, for historical
         reasons, entry is only permitted to  a  non-metropolitan  territory
         belonging to  a  State.  The  fact  that  different  categories  of
         nationality within a State have different  rights  associated  with
         them does not  prevent  their  holders  from  being  treated  as  a
         "national" for the purposes of Article 1(1). Nor does the fact that
         in some countries the rights associated with nationality are  fewer
         than those enjoyed by nationals of  other  States  or  indeed  fall
         short of those required in  terms  of  international  human  rights
         obligations. Although the issue  of  diminished  rights  may  raise
         issues  regarding  the  effectiveness  of   the   nationality   and
         violations of international human rights obligations, this  is  not
         pertinent to the application of the stateless person definition  in
         the 1954 Convention."

36.  The footnote to this passage observes that: "[h]istorically, there
does not appear to have been any requirement under international law for
nationality to have a specific content in terms of rights of individuals,
as opposed to it creating certain inter-State obligations."

37.  Consonant with this learning, we know from case law on the
'nationality'  element of the  definition of 'refugee' in Article 1A(2) of
the 1951 Refugee Convention that just because a state denies basic rights
and benefits to its nationals - and for example fails in the process to
protect them against persecution - does not mean they cease to be its
nationals; that underlines how contingent are the actual contents of such
rights and duties on what is the situation in the particular state at the
relevant time.

38.  To summarise the general position in international law, the rights
that nationals possess are not rights to a particular quality of enjoyment
of those rights. As noted by Edwards (ibid), "[e]ven though the above-
mentioned substantive rights are usually associated with the holding of
nationality, the lack of access to or enjoyment of these rights does not
change the nationality status of the individual under international law,
nor ordinarily under municipal law." Edwards notes further that:

         "The only possible exception may be the case where a  state  denies
         an individual of the right to re-enter and reside in its  territory
         (considered as the essence of nationality as  a  matter  of  public
         international  law),  which  could  be  interpreted  as   a   state
         effectively denying that the individual is its  national.  However,
         this could only be determined on the individual case  at  hand  and
         considering all the relevant facts."

Children and nationality

39.  At the same time it is also clear that, by virtue of their minority,
children are not in a position to exercise some of the rights and benefits
ordinarily associated with nationality for so long as they are children.
This is a feature highlighted by a leading expert on children and
nationality, Jacqueline Bhaba[1], in her article on "The importance of
nationality for children", Institute on Statelessness and Exclusion, 2017:

         "Many of  these  rights  and  obligations  are  not  applicable  to
         nationals under 18 years of age: children cannot vote, they  cannot
         stand for public office, they cannot serve on  juries,  and,  as  a
         matter  of  international  law,  they  cannot   be   compelled   to
         participate in active combat."

40.  However, she goes on to emphasise that "these exclusions do not negate
the importance of nationality for children." She then notes the following
examples:

         "First, even a very young child, like an adult, will need proof of
         nationality to qualify for safe and legal border crossing. Second,
         more age specifically, though primary education is supposed to be
         free and universally available to all children irrespective of
         nationality, comparable international mandates do not apply to
         other, equally critical, educational opportunities, a deficit with
         consequential implications. Compared to their non-national
         peers, children who are citizens generally have privileged access
         to early childhood development and preschool opportunities, as well
         as to post primary education, college scholarships and other
         educational facilities. The same enhanced access for citizen
         children also applies to health care, to social welfare protections
         and to other critical economic and social rights facilities."


We will have cause to qualify how such examples apply in the UK context:
see below paragraph 44.
British citizenship and British citizen children
41.  In this case we are concerned throughout with British nationality in
the form of British citizenship only, not with any other type of British
nationality.[2] The rights and benefits of British citizenship are in large
measure a matter of statute. Whether or not a constitutional right (a point
on which Lord Hoffman (at [43]) and Lord Mance [at [151] differed in R
(Bancoult) v Foreign Secretary (No 2)), the right of abode is clearly one
of the most important components of British citizenship. However, as Lord
Hope observed in ZH (Tanzania) at [41], "there is much more to British
citizenship than the status it gives to the children in immigration law ...
[i]t carries with it a host of other benefits and advantages ... [which]
ought never to be left out of account." In the same case, Lady Hale
emphasised at [32] that "the fact of belonging to a country fundamentally
affects the manner of exercise of a child's family and private life, during
childhood and well beyond."

42.  In R (on the application of Johnson) (Appellant) v SSHD (Respondent)
[2016] UKSC 56, Lady Hale observed at [2] that "[t]here are many benefits
to being a British citizen, among them the right to vote, the right to live
and to work here without needing permission to do so, and everything that
comes along with those rights".

43.  Insofar as the position of British citizen children is concerned, the
Home Office publication of July 2019, MN1 Registration as a British citizen-
 A guide about the registration of children under 18, states at p.5 that:
         "Becoming a British citizen is a significant life event. Apart from
         allowing a child to apply for a British citizen  passport,  British
         citizenship gives them the opportunity to participate more fully in
         the life of their local community as they grow up."
44.  This is not to say, however, that access to a significant number of
rights and benefits in the UK are confined to British citizens. For
example, foreign nationals who are settled or have limited leave in the UK
also enjoy privileged access to educational opportunities (in this respect,
Jacqueline Bhaba's summary quoted at paragraph 40 above does not fit well
with the UK context). Nevertheless, whilst UK law also accords a
significant number of rights and benefits to persons who have lawful
status, they are lesser than those enjoyed by British citizens, As noted by
Jay, J in The Project for the Registration of Children As British Citizens
& Ors, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department [2019] EWHC 3536 (Admin) at [16]:
         "The advantages of British  citizenship  cannot  be  considered  in
         abstract. The position of British citizens falls to  be  contrasted
         with those who have limited or indefinite leave  to  remain  (there
         are also important practical differences between these  species  of
         leave), into which categories the  majority  but  not  all  of  the
         children entitled to be registered will no  doubt  fall.  A  person
         with leave to remain as opposed to the right of abode cannot  enter
         and/or remain in the UK without let or  hindrance:  by  definition,
         she requires leave, and this permission may require examination  by
         immigration officers at a port of entry  or  at  Lunar  House.  The
         status may lapse; it may be cancelled; and individuals holding such
         leave  are  liable  to  be  deported  on  conducive  grounds  under
         s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971."
45.  Although, at time of writing, we are aware that  matters  look  set  to
    change, presently possession of British citizenship also  carries  with
    it possession of citizenship of the Union under EU law. We say no  more
    about this here, given the conclusions we set out below  in  paragraphs
    79-80.

The relevance of the British citizenship of children in the context of
Article 8


46.  It is necessary to consider the relevance of the British citizenship
of children in the context of Article 8. In ZH (Tanzania) Lady Hale, in
analysing the relevance of the best interests of the child as a primary
consideration, observed at paras 30 and 32 that:
         "30. Although nationality is not a "trump card" it is of particular
         importance in assessing the best interests of any child. The  UNCRC
         recognises the right of every child to be registered and acquire  a
         nationality (Article 7) and to preserve her identity, including her
         nationality (Article 8). In Wan, the Federal  Court  of  Australia,
         pointed out at para 30 that, when considering  the  possibility  of
         the children accompanying their father to China, the  tribunal  had
         not considered any  of  the  following  matters,  which  the  Court
         clearly regarded as important:
         "(a) the fact that the children, as citizens of Australia, would be
         deprived  of  the  country  of  their  own   and   their   mother's
         citizenship,  'and  of  its  protection  and   support,   socially,
         culturally and medically, and in many other ways evoked by, but not
         confined to, the broad concept of lifestyle' (Vaitaiki  v  Minister
         for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1998] FCA  5,  (1998)  150  ALR
         608, 614);
         (b)  the  resultant  social  and  linguistic  disruption  of  their
         childhood as well as the loss of their homeland;
         (c) the loss of educational opportunities available to the children
         in Australia; and
         (d) their resultant isolation from the normal contacts of  children
         with their mother and their mother's family."
         ...
         32. Nor should the intrinsic importance of  citizenship  be  played
         down. As citizens these children have rights which they will not be
         able to exercise if they move to another country.  They  will  lose
         the advantages of growing  up  and  being  educated  in  their  own
         country, their own culture and their own language. They  will  have
         lost all this when they come back as adults.  [Emphasis  added]  As
         Jacqueline Bhaba (in  'The  "Mere  Fortuity  of  Birth"?  Children,
         Mothers, Borders and the Meaning of Citizenship', in Migrations and
         Mobilities: Citizenship, Borders and Gender (2009), edited by Seyla
         Benhabib and Judith Resnik, at p 193) has put it:
             'In short, the fact of belonging to  a  country  fundamentally
             affects the manner of exercise of a child's family and private
             life,  during  childhood  and  well  beyond.   Yet   children,
             particularly young children, are often considered parcels that
             are easily movable  across  borders  with  their  parents  and
             without particular cost to the children.'"
47.  In Zoumbas, Lord Hodge, having identified as one of seven legal
principles to govern best interests of the child assessment in immigration
cases that:
         "(3) Although the best interests of a child can  be  outweighed  by
         the  cumulative  effect   of   other   considerations,   no   other
         consideration can be treated as inherently more significant; ..."
    went on to state that:
         "12. Mr Lindsay [a  different  Mr  Lindsay]  for  Mr  Zoumbas  also
         founded on a statement in the judgment of Lord Kerr  of  Tonaghmore
         in ZH (Tanzania) at para 46 in support of the proposition that what
         is determined to be in a child's best interests should  customarily
         dictate  the  outcome  of  cases   and   that   it   will   require
         considerations of substantial moment to permit a different  result.
         In our view, it is important to note that Lord  Kerr's  formulation
         spoke of dictating the outcome of cases "such as the  present"  and
         that in ZH (Tanzania) the court was dealing with children who  were
         British citizens. In that case the  children  by  virtue  of  their
         nationality had significant benefits, including a  right  of  abode
         and rights to future education  and  healthcare  in  this  country,
         which the children in this case, as citizens  of  the  Republic  of
         Congo, do not. The benefits of British citizenship are an important
         factor in assessing whether it is reasonable to expect a child with
         such citizenship to live in another country. Moreover in H(H)  Lord
         Kerr explained (at para 145) that what he was seeking  to  say  was
         that no factor should be given greater weight than the interests of
         a child. See the third principle above." [Emphasis added]
48.  In the context of cases involving deportation of foreign criminals,
the relevance of British citizenship when considering the best interests of
the child was briefly discussed in NA(Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 66, Jackson
LK observing at [34], with reference to CT (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488,
that:
         "34. The best interests of children certainly carry  great  weight,
         as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian
         Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 at [145]. Nevertheless, it
         is  a  consequence  of  criminal  conduct  that  offenders  may  be
         separated from their children for many years, contrary to the  best
         interests of those children. The  desirability  of  children  being
         with both parents is a commonplace of  family  life.  That  is  not
         usually a sufficiently compelling circumstance to outweigh the high
         public interest in deporting  foreign  criminals.  As  Rafferty  LJ
         observed in Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  v  CT
         (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:
             "Neither the British nationality of the respondent's  children
             nor their likely separation from their father for a long  time
             are  exceptional  circumstances  which  outweigh  the   public
             interest in his deportation.""

49.  Turning to consider Article 8 jurisprudence generally, it is clear
that nationality (in the form of British citizenship) is a relevant
consideration both in the deportation/removal and the immigration context.
Thus, in ZH (Tanzania) Lady Hale at [17] made reference to the
identification by the Strasbourg Court of relevant factors to be taken into
consideration in cases concerned with the expulsion of long-settled non-
nationals who had committed criminal offences. She noted that the relevant
factors which had first been enunciated in Boultif v Switzerland (2001) 33
EHRR 50 (numbers inserted) were:
         "[i] the nature and seriousness of the  offence  committed  by  the
         applicant;
         [ii] the length of the applicant's stay in the country  from  which
         he or she is to be expelled;
         [iii] the time elapsed since the  offence  was  committed  and  the
         applicant's conduct during that period;
         [iv] the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
         [v] the applicant's family situation, such as  the  length  of  the
         marriage, and other  factors  expressing  the  effectiveness  of  a
         couple's family life;
         [vi] whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when  he
         or she entered into a family relationship;
         [vii] whether there are children of the marriage, and if so,  their
         age; and
         [viii] the seriousness of the  difficulties  which  the  spouse  is
         likely to encounter in the country to which the appellant is to  be
         expelled." [Emphasis added]
50.  She further noted that this list of factors was approved and expanded
upon in Uner v The Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 421.

51.  At [180] Lady Hale noted that "[f]actors (i), (iii), and (vi)
identified in Boultif and U?ner are not relevant when it comes to ordinary
immigration cases, although the equivalent of (vi) for a spouse is whether
family life was established knowing of the precariousness of the
immigration situation."

52.  Taking stock of the relevant Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article 8, we
derive that (i) Article 8 cannot be considered to impose on a State a
general obligation to respect immigrants' choice of the country of their
matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory;
(ii) a relevant factor that must be taken into account is the nationalities
of the various persons concerned; and (iii) in order to establish the scope
of the State's obligations, the facts of the case must be considered. In
relation to (ii), we cannot find any support in this jurisprudence for
extending this to include a principle that having a British citizen child
furnishes powerful reasons for finding that the effect of the deportation
of a parent on the child would be unduly harsh. What weight is to be given
appears to citizenship be left as a matter for each Contracting State's
"margin of appreciation". As regards (iii), we would observe that in this
regard the Strasbourg jurisprudence reflects our own initial observations
on the significance of nationality at the level of abstract principle, in
particular that the rights and benefits that attach to nationality will
depend heavily on the particular circumstances.

53.  Applying the above analysis to the specific context of the unduly
harsh requirements, the principal conclusions we draw from our foregoing
analysis are twofold.

54.  First, because the unduly harsh requirements are derivable from
Article 8 jurisprudence, nationality (in the form of British citizenship)
is a relevant factor when assessing whether the 'unduly harsh' requirements
of section 117C(5) are met. However, it is not necessarily a weighty
factor; all depends on the facts.

55.  Second, in respect of the issue of whether it would be unduly harsh
for a British citizen child to remain in the UK without one of his parents,
it seems to us integral to the framework set out in section 117C of the Act
and paragraph 399(a)(ii) of the Rules that the possession of British
citizenship by a child with whom a person (P) has a genuine and subsisting
parental relationship does not mean that P is exempted from the unduly
harsh requirements. Even though the child may be British, it has to be
unduly harsh both for him or her to leave with P or to stay without P; not
just harsh. Thus, some substantial interference with the rights and
expectations that come with being British is possible, without the position
becoming one of undue harshness to the child.




The judge's treatment of the appellant's case

56.  Like the respondent, the judge concluded that the appellant did not
meet the requirements of paragraph 399A.  Whilst it is not entirely clear
that the appellant agreed in substance that he did not meet the
requirements of subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 399A, it is
incontrovertible that he could not show, as required by sub-paragraph (a),
that he had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life.

57.  The appellant concedes that he is not able to show that there are very
compelling circumstances over and above those set out in paragraphs 399A
and 399.

58.  Accordingly, the appellant's case hinges entirely on whether he can
show that the judge materially erred in law in concluding that he did not
meet the requirements of paragraph 399(a)(ii) (a)-(b) of the Immigration
Rules and section 117C(5)  of the 2002 Act.

The public interest issues

59.  It is the appellant's contention in ground (1) that the judge's
assessment of the unduly harsh requirements of paragraph 399 was vitiated
by applying more stringent consideration of the public interest than the
statute specifies or requires. This contention focuses on the judge's final
paragraph under the subheading "Decision":

"48. In my view there is a strong public interest in the Appellant's
removal and the effect of his deportation will not be unduly harsh on
either his child or his wife, nor do the particulars of his private and
family life amount to very compelling circumstances. I therefore conclude
that the Respondent's decision being maintained is a proportionate
interference with the right to respect for his family and private life and
lawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998."

60.  It is submitted that the reference to "strong public interest" implies
that the judge has erroneously balanced the question of whether or not the
appellant's deportation is unduly harsh against a 'strong public interest'
for his deportation.  Reference is made to the dictum of Lord Carnwath in
KO (Nigeria) [2016] UKSC 53 at [23] that: "[w]hat section 117C(5) does not
require in my view ... is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the
parent's offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the
section itself by reference to length of sentence."  The judge, the grounds
assert, "appear to have admitted the actual length of the sentence (as
opposed to the placement of the sentence in the section 117C thresholds) in
her consideration of the public interest".  As thus formulated, ground (1)
appear to subdivide into two parts, it being argued that the judge (i)
wrongly allowed public interest considerations to intrude into her unduly
harsh assessment; and (ii) overstated the strength of the public interest.

61.  We do not accept that the judge's use of the term 'strong public
interest' somehow intruded into her unduly harsh assessment.  In the first
place, the judge specifically reminded herself in paragraph 19 that in KO
(Nigeria) (in her words) "[t]he court stated that the assessment does not
involve consideration of the wider public interest factors; it is solely an
evaluation of the consequences and impact of deportation on the child or
the partner."  Second, in her ensuing assessment of the unduly harsh
issues, there is no reference whatsoever to any public interest factors.
Third, in paragraph 48 the judge's formulation makes clear that the issue
of whether deportation would be unduly harsh and the public interest issue
are distinct.

62.  Nor do we accept the contention that the judge overstated the public
interest.  At paragraphs 15 - 17, she correctly set out that the relevant
provisions of the Rules and the Act providing that deportation of foreign
criminals is in the public interest and that the public interest requires
the deportation of the appellant unless either Exceptions 1 or 2 of section
117C((4)-(5) apply. We consider that in referring at the end of her summary
to 'strong public interest' the judge was doing no more than highlighting
that she had given due weight to the strength of the public interest in the
deportation of foreign criminals. That is entirely consistent with the
approach of the Tribunal and higher courts: see e.g. R (Agyarko) v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11 at [57] and Lord
Reed in Hesham Ali when he stated at [164] that  "I do not have trouble
with the suggestion that there may generally be a strong public interest in
the deportation of foreign criminals."

63.  Ms Akinbolu has sought to bolster her submissions on ground (1), by
emphasising that the public interest is not a fixity. She has correctly
sourced this proposition to what was said by Lord Kerr in Hesham Ali at
[64]. Since we heard this case the Senior President of Tribunals has noted
this proposition in Akinyemi v The Secretary of State for the Home
Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2098 (04 December 2019 at [49] -[50]:
         "49. Although Lord Kerr JSC differs from the majority in some of
         his reasoning, he comes to the same conclusion in his judgment, a
         conclusion which is not doubted by anyone else. At [164] he says:
             "The strength of the public interest in favour of deportation
             must depend on such matters as the nature and seriousness of
             the crime, the risk of re-offending, and the success of
             rehabilitation, etc. These factors are relevant to an
             assessment of the extent to which deportation of a particular
             individual will further the legitimate aim of preventing crime
             and disorder, and thus, as pointed out by Lord Reed at para
             26, inform the strength of the public interest in deportation.
             I do not have trouble with the suggestion that there may
             generally be a strong public interest in the deportation of
             foreign criminals but a claim that this has a fixed quality,
             in the sense that its importance is unchanging whatever the
             circumstances, seems to me to be plainly wrong in principle,
             and contrary to ECtHR jurisprudence.""


    He continues at [165]:


            "It is important for the decision-maker to scrutinise the
            elements of public interest in deportation relied upon in an
            individual case, and the extent to which these factors are
            rationally connected to the legitimate aim of preventing crime
            and disorder. That exercise should be undertaken before the
            decision-maker weighs the public interest in deportation
            against the countervailing factors relating to the individual's
            private or family life, and reaching a conclusion on whether
            the interference is proportionate."

64.  However, the guidance given in Hesham Ali (as reconfirmed in Akinyemi)
cannot avail the appellant since it was expressly accepted by Miss Akinbolu
that he could not succeed on the basis of "very compelling circumstances'
over and above those set out in paragraphs 399 and 399A: see above
paragraph 57. The analysis conducted of the public interest in Hesham Ali
was in the context of cases where it was argued that there were very
compelling circumstances: see [36]-[38].  In any event, the asserted low
risk of re-offending, cited by Ms Akinbolu (see paragraph 14 above) cannot
on the facts of this case rationally cause the strength of the public
interest to be reduced to any material extent.

The unduly harsh issues

65.  As Ms Akinbolu candidly observed, she was in some difficulty in
advancing the second ground in as much as the original written grounds were
confined to the public interest issue and the renewed grounds were
concerned principally with the issue of whether it was unduly harsh for the
child to move to India. On the other hand, there are paragraphs that
clearly identify a challenge to the judge's other finding (that it would
not be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without his father:
e.g. the final sentence of paragraph 16) and on a fair reading we consider
that the appellant's challenge was clearly intended to cover both
scenarios.  We therefore read the alleged "failing to adequately consider
the British child's rights in line with section 55 of the Borders,
Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and in light of the findings of fact
made" to apply to both limbs of the "unduly harsh" requirements.  We read
likewise the submission at paragraph 17 that "[t]he judge was required to
consider the appellant's British child's best interests as a primary
consideration, when assessing if it would, or would not, be unduly harsh to
deport his father."  In addition, we note that the appellant in his human
rights application had identified as significant the reference in his
representations of 8 May 2017 to the fact that his son was a British
citizen. Further, the respondent's refusal decision of  September 2018 on
the human rights claim had stated that whilst it was accepted that the son
was a British citizen, it was not accepted that this had any significance
because "[a]lthough he is a British citizen his nationality will not change
as a result of him moving to India as he will be able to return to the UK
at his own leisure" (p. 3) and that it would not be unduly harsh for him to
remain in the UK even though the appellant was deported because he would be
able to continue attending school and accessing NHS treatment for his
illness (p. 4) and that his mother, was  "a British citizen and as such
would be accustomed to the British way of life and the benefits it has to
offer her" (p. 5).

66.  Accordingly we are satisfied that the appellant's grounds constitute
in relation to the child a challenge in effect to both limbs of the 'unduly
harsh' requirements.


The 'unduly harsh' requirements of the Rules as applied to a 'qualifying
child'

67.  It is necessary to consider the 'unduly harsh' requirements in two
parts, dealing firstly with the 399(a)(ii)(a) limb, which focuses on
whether "it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the country to
which the person is to be deported". As explained earlier we consider s.
117C(5) to impose the same requirements.

Unduly harsh for the child to live in [India]

68.  The respondent accepted in her rule 24 response that the judge's
treatment of the 'unduly harsh' requirements is flawed by virtue of the
fact that in the paragraphs addressing the issue of the child's relocation
to India at paragraphs 34 - 43, "there is no explicit reference to the
child's British nationality nor any recognition that this may be a relevant
consideration".  However, it was submitted that this error was not
material. Mr Lindsay reiterated the same position.

 69. Like the respondent, we do not consider fatal the mere lack of mention
by the judge of the child's British nationality in the context of assessing
whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in India, since at
paragraph 33 she had identified this as a relevant factor in the context of
her best interests of the child assessment which she stated was her
"starting point". The judge had referred to the British citizenship of the
child as one of four factors that led her to conclude that it was "in [the
child's] best interests to be with both parents and to remain in the UK".
At paragraph 33 she wrote:

"My starting point is that I find that it is in his best interests to be
with both parents and to remain in the UK.  I reach this conclusion based
on the following evidence:

(1)  the psychological assessment, prepared by Mr O'Doherty, dated 5 March
2019.  He concluded this is where the best interests of the child lie,
having reviewed the child's school reports and interviewed and observed the
family together;

(2)  I have reviewed the school reports within the Appellant's bundle,
which demonstrate that the child is doing well at school and is happy;

(3)  it was clear from the witness statements of the Appellant and Mrs
Patel, as well as from their oral evidence, that their main concern is for
the well-being of their son and that they put their own interests second to
his;

(4)  the child is a British citizen and so entitled to the rights and
privileges that come with that status."

70.  That terminology indicated that she saw her starting point as
something to be fed into the remainder of her assessment.

71.  Further, although the judge did not refer to the child's British
citizenship when assessing the issue of whether it would be unduly harsh to
expect him to leave the UK, she was clearly cognisant of the relative
advantages and disadvantages that flowed from that status and clearly
understood that if the child departed he would not enjoy the rights and
benefits he does presently.  She did not, as the respondent did, seek to
rely on the somewhat formalistic point that "his nationality will not
change as a result of him moving to India as he will be able to return to
the UK at his own leisure". She considered the child's circumstances
substantively. She specifically addressed the issue of education at
paragraphs 38 to 41, taking into account, inter alia, that the appellant
and his wife would not be able to afford a private education for their son
on return to India, which would mean he would be taught in Gujarati, which
he does not speak. She also addressed the issue of medical treatment at
paragraphs 42 and 43, taking into account that that the son suffers from
infantile scoliosis and requires yearly check-ups. She also took into
account that the child's school and friendship networks are "sources of
happiness and stability" for the child that would be fractured by the move.
 It was within the range of reasonable responses for her to conclude that
the disadvantages and hardships involved were not unduly harsh. We remind
ourselves that the higher courts have confirmed many times that the
threshold denoted by the 'unduly harsh' criterion is a high one: see KO
(Nigeria) at [23] ("One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond
what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation
a parent").

72.  The grounds raise no challenge to the judge's finding that the wife
could relocate without it being unduly harsh nor to the judge's finding
that it would not be unduly harsh for her to remain in the UK without her
partner. Hence paragraph 399(b) (ii) and (iii) are not engaged.

73.  We turn to consider the second limb of paragraph 399((a)(ii), namely
whether "it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without
the person who is to be deported".

Unduly harsh for child to remain in the UK without the [father]

74.  The judge's treatment of the second limb of the 'unduly harsh' test
was considerably shorter and was effectively confined to the issue of
whether the appellant's wife, notwithstanding the adverse effect of the
appellant's absence on her mental health, would remain in the UK and be
able to care for the child.  Whilst there is no reference in this context
to the significance of the child's British citizenship, it is clearly part
of the background accepted by the judge that in the UK the child is
actually enjoying the rights and benefits of British nationality and that
these would not be threatened or diminished by his father's departure.  We
do not understand Ms Akinbolu to suggest otherwise; see above paragraph 13.

75.  Further, as we observed at paragraph 55 above, in respect of the issue
of whether it would be unduly harsh for a British citizen child to remain
in the UK without one of his parents, it seems to us integral to the
framework set out in section 117C of the Act and paragraph 399(a)(ii) of
the Rules that just because a child has British citizenship does not mean
that P is exempted from the "unduly harsh" requirements. Even though the
child may be British, it has to be unduly harsh for him or her to leave
with P or stay without P; not just harsh. To reiterate, some substantial
interference with the rights and expectations that come with being British
is possible, without the position becoming one of undue harshness to the
child.

76.  As already noted,  the  grounds  raise  no  challenge  to  the  judge's
    findings that it would not be unduly harsh for the appellant's wife  to
    remain in the UK. Nor do the grounds raise any challenge to the judge's
    assessment of the ability of the appellant's wife to care for the child
    in the UK.  In the context of the child remaining in the  UK  with  his
    mother, it is plain that the child is in the UK enjoying  in  substance
    the rights and benefits of British citizenship. Hence  any  failure  to
    address the child's British nationality in this  limb  of  the  'unduly
    harsh' test could not amount to a legal error since it is a premise  of
    any such  assessment  that  the  child  is  enjoying  such  rights  and
    benefits.

77.  Given that  the  requirements  of  para  399(a)(ii)  (a)  and  (b)  are
    conjunctive, even if we were to have identified an error of law on  the
    part of the judge in relation to para 399(a)(ii)(a), that  error  would
    not have been material.

78.  In arriving at the above conclusion we  have  taken  into  account  the
    post-KO(Nigeria) decisions of the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State
    for the Home Department v PG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ  1213  (11  July
    2019) and Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  KF  (Nigeria)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 2051 (22 November 2019. In  the  former  there  were  6
    British citizen children involved (see [5]). In the latter,  there  was
    one British citizen child (see [3]). In the latter, Baker, LJ (with the
    Senior President of Tribunals in agreement) endorsed the position taken
    in PG (Jamaica) and stated at [30]-[31]  that:
         "Furthermore, and with respect to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
         [who had allowed the appeal], I consider that his conclusion on the
         evidence about the respondent's family that his  deportation  would
         be unduly harsh is unsustainable in the light  of  Lord  Carnwath's
         analysis of the proper interpretation of Exception 2 in  s.117C(5),
         namely that:
             "One is looking for a degree of harshness  going  beyond  what
             would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
             deportation of a parent."
         Looking at the facts as found by the First-tier Tribunal  that  led
         to the conclusion that family would suffer adverse consequences  as
         a result of the deportation, and in particular the consequences for
         the respondent's son separated from his father, it is difficult  to
         identify anything which distinguishes this case  from  other  cases
         where a family is separated. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  found
         that the respondent's son would be deprived  of  his  father  at  a
         crucial time in his life. His view that "there is no substitute for
         the emotional and developmental benefits for a three-year-old child
         that are associated with being brought up by  both  parents  during
         its formative  years"  is  indisputable.  But  those  benefits  are
         enjoyed by all three-year-old children in the care of both parents.
         The judge observed that it was a "fact that  being  deprived  of  a
         parent is something a child is likely to find  traumatic  and  that
         will potentially have long-lasting adverse  consequences  for  that
         child" and that he was entitled to take  judicial  notice  of  that
         fact. But the "fact" of which he was taking  "judicial  notice"  is
         likely to arise in every case  where  a  child  is  deprived  of  a
         parent. All children should, where possible, be brought up  with  a
         close relationship with both parents. All children  deprived  of  a
         parent's company during their formative years will be  at  risk  of
         suffering harm. Given the changes to  the  law  introduced  by  the
         amendments to 2002 Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, it  is
         necessary to look for consequences characterised  by  a  degree  of
         harshness over and beyond what every child would experience in such
         circumstances."
      1. For those lawyers, like my Lord and myself,  who  have  spent  many
         years  practising  in  the  family  jurisdiction,  this  is  not  a
         comfortable interpretation to apply. But that  is  what  Parliament
         has decided, and it is important to bear in mind  the  observations
         of Hickinbottom LJ in PG (Jamaica) at paragraph 46:
            "When a parent is deported, one can only have great sympathy for
            the entirely innocent children involved. Even  in  circumstances
            in which they can remain in the United Kingdom  with  the  other
            parent, they will inevitably be distressed. However, in  section
            117C(5) of the 2002 Act, Parliament  has  made  clear  its  will
            that, for foreign offenders who are sentenced  to  one  to  four
            years, only where the consequences for the children are  'unduly
            harsh'  will  deportation  be  constrained.  That  is   entirely
            consistent with Article 8 of ECHR. It is important that decision-
            makers and, when the decisions  are  challenged,  tribunals  and
            courts honour that expression of Parliamentary will."

79.  We appreciate that in these cases their lordships  were  not  asked  to
    consider the specific issue of the significance  of  a  relevant  child
    possessing British citizenship (and this remains one of the reasons why
    we have seen fit to address this issue discretely). However, especially
    given the reference made in KF (Nigeria) to PG (Jamaica (which in  turn
    refers to NA (Pakistan), we are confident  that  their  lordships  were
    mindful, in reaching their conclusions, of the fact that  the  children
    involved possessed British citizenship and what significance was to  be
    attached to that.

The Zambrano issue

80.  In concluding that the appellant's grounds fail to identify any legal
error in the judge's finding that it would not be unduly harsh for the
child to remain in the UK without the appellant, we have recorded Ms
Akinbolu's attempt to raise a Zambrano point. We consider it is not a point
we need address because it was not raised in any shape or form in the
grounds.

81.  In any event, we record our agreement with Mr Lindsay that the
relevant facts in the appellant's case are on all fours with VM (Jamaica).
We do not understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Patel (Appellant)
v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) Secretary of
State for the Home Department (Respondent) v Shah (Appellant) [2019] UKSC
59 to take a significantly different view of the need for a high threshold
even in Zambrano cases concerning children: see in particular [30] of
Patel.

82.  For the above reasons, we conclude that the judge  did  not  materially
    err in law and her decision to dismiss the appeal should stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
