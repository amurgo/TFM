                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision of First-
        tier Tribunal Judge Lal, promulgated on 20 June 2018,  who  allowed
        the appeal against the respondent's decision to deport Mr Chromiak,
        a national of Poland, from the United Kingdom.
     2.  The  anonymity  direction  made  by  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  is
        dismissed, there being no reason for such an order  being  made  on
        the facts of this matter in which Mr Chromiak's name is already  in
        the public domain through his criminal proceedings.
     3. There was no attendance by  Mr  Chromiak  at  the  hearing  or  any
        representative on his behalf. Before  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Mr
        Chromiak was represented by counsel with  oral  evidence  from  his
        father. This Tribunal is satisfied there has been proper service of
        the notice of hearing specifying  the  date,  time,  and  venue  of
        today's proceedings at Mr Chromiak's nominated address for service.
        There has been no explanation for  the  absence  of  any  party  or
        individual. It  is  considered  appropriate  in  the  interests  of
        justice and the  overriding  objectives,  with  the  focus  on  the
        question of fairness, for the Upper Tribunal  to  proceed  to  hear
        this matter in Mr Chromiak's absence. It is noted that Mr  Chromiak
        was removed from the United Kingdom on 11 May 2018 with no evidence
        of any application being made  to  facilitate  his  entry  for  the
        purposes of attending these proceedings.



Background


     4. Mr Chromiak is a citizen of Poland born  on  10  August  1990.  The
        Judge notes it was disputed in the case  whether  Mr  Chromiak  had
        acquired a right of permanent residence and whether his deportation
        could be justified on the basis of 'serious grounds'  by  reference
        to the wording of the EEA Regulations.
     5. The Judge sets out findings of fact from [13] in which it is  found
        Mr Chromiak entered the United Kingdom in 2009. The Judge notes the
        first conviction was 13 November 2013 and the presence of  an  HMRC
        document going back to 2013 suggested employment  for  at  least  5
        years. The Tribunal accepted the account provided by Mr  Chromiak's
        father that prior to a Galleon  Hotel  job  his  son  was  probably
        working cash in hand in the catering trade. The  Judge  accepts  Mr
        Chromiak had been exercising treaty rights in  the  United  Kingdom
        for in excess of 5 years was  therefore  entitled  to  a  right  of
        permanent residence and the  second  level  of  protection  against
        removal.
     6. The Judge notes at [15] what is said to be 13  convictions  for  27
        offences of which nearly 30 offences are for the theft of  a  pedal
        cycle, but found  there  was  no  credible  evidence  to  show  the
        appellant posed a serious risk  on  grounds  of  public  policy  or
        public security, finding the vast majority of the offences  were  a
        series of petty thefts disposed of in the  Magistrates  Court  with
        the root cause being alcohol and illicit substance misuse.
     7. At [16 - 17] the Judge finds:


             16.  There was no evidence to suggest that the Appellant poses
                  such a current risk  and  following  Arraz,  the  Tribunal
                  notes that the burden is  on  the  Respondent  to  justify
                  deportation. The Respondent has failed to do so other than
                  noting the effect of the  offences  committed  in  general
                  terms on UK society. There was no such evidence to suggest
                  a serious risk to anyone else at the present  time  or  as
                  the Refusal letter implies a poor social attitude  towards
                  the public and wider community. There was no  evidence  to
                  suggest a propensity to reoffend other than  the  fact  of
                  having convictions.


             17.  On the contrary the evidence that the Tribunal  did  have
                  before  it  was  that  the  Appellant  appeared  genuinely
                  shocked that it had come to  this  and  the  Tribunal  was
                  satisfied that the father's recollection having spoken  to
                  the Appellant was credible and  that  he  had  shown  some
                  insight  into  the  circumstances   which   led   to   his
                  convictions. The Tribunal was satisfied that he has a good
                  prospect of accessing work with his father in the latter's
                  business as a gas fitter as well as accommodation provided
                  by his father. These  are  both  protective  factors  that
                  would mitigate against any risk previously identified when
                  living by himself in Maidenhead.


     8. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was
        granted by another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal who stated  the
        Judge arguably erred in respect  of  the  HMRC  evidence  and  that
        relating to Mr Chromiak's lawful employment and  that,  whilst  the
        individual offending is at the lower end of the criminal  spectrum,
        its volume is such that could be regarded as a serious problem.



Error of law


     9. The Secretary of States grounds set  out  Mr  Chromiak's  offending
        history in the following terms:


                   . On 4 November 2009 Mr Chromiak received a sentence of 6
                     months imprisonment, suspended for 12  months  for  the
                     possession of a knife blade/sharp pointed article in  a
                     public place. He was also charged costs and received an
                     unpaid work requirement of  100  hours.  He  failed  to
                     comply with the unpaid work requirement,  therefore  14
                     hours was added.
                   . On 25 October 2010 Mr Chromiak failed to  surrender  to
                     custody at the appointed time for which he  received  a
                     12-month conditional discharge. On 23 December 2010  Mr
                     Chromiak was found to have committed a further  offence
                     during the operational period of a suspended sentence.
                   . On 22 November  2012  Mr  Chromiak  was  cautioned  for
                     possession of a controlled drug - Class B.
                   . On 11 March  2013  Mr  Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     resisting or obstructing a constable and for the breach
                     of the earlier  conditional  discharge.  He  was  fined
                     �100, ordered to pay �360 costs and a victim surcharge.
                   . On 2  April  2013  Mr  Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     resisting or obstructing a constable and  was  remanded
                     on  unconditional  bail,  he  received  a   supervision
                     requirement, community order,  a  four-year  antisocial
                     behaviour order  and  was  required  to  pay  a  victim
                     surcharge.
                   . On 18 April 2013 and 19  April  2013  Mr  Chromiak  was
                     found guilty of 11 counts  of  theft  of  a  cycle  and
                     breach of conditional discharge for which he received a
                     community order and an antisocial behaviour order.
                   . On 26 November 2013 Mr Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     resisting or obstructing a constable for which  he  was
                     fined and ordered to pay costs and victim surcharge.
                   . On 1 October 2016  Mr  Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     shoplifting and failing to surrender to custody at  the
                     appointed  time.  He  was  fined,   detained   at   the
                     courthouse and charged a victim surcharge.
                   . On 4 December 2017 Mr  Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     theft of a cycle; going equipped for theft of  a  motor
                     vehicle and possession of a controlled drug - Class  B.
                     He received an 18-month prison sentence  suspended  for
                     12 months; an unpaid work requirement; ordered  to  pay
                     costs and victim surcharge and forfeiture.
                   . On 30 January 2018 Mr  Chromiak  was  found  guilty  of
                     failing to comply with the community requirements of  a
                     suspended sentence and was  imprisoned  for  17  weeks,
                     unserved from the original sentence of 4 December 2017.


    10. There is arguably  clear  evidence  that  Mr  Chromiak's  offending
        history is more involved than may  be  suggested  at  [15]  of  the
        decision under challenge.
    11. Ground one of the Secretary of States challenge asserts  the  Judge
        failed to have regard to a material matter. The grounds submit  the
        evidence from HMRC considered by  the  Judge  only  resulted  in  a
        finding to 'suggest employment' rather  than  the  Judge  making  a
        clear finding that there had  been  employment.  The  Secretary  of
        State argues the Judge erred in failing to make  a  finding  as  to
        when in 2013 the suggested employment commenced which  is  material
        to assessing whether the requisite 5 years exercising treaty rights
        have been established. There is arguable merit in this ground which
        is also supported by the reliance of the Judge on the testimony  of
        Mr Chromiak's father that his son was  probably  working  'cash  in
        hand' in the catering trade during the  requisite  period.  Such  a
        statement does not demonstrate legal employment in accordance  with
        the terms of the Directive sufficient to establish the exercise  of
        treaty rights. Mr Chromiak  was sent to prison on 30  January  2018
        after which he passed  into  immigration  detention  prior  to  his
        removal back to Poland. The relevant 5-year period would  therefore
        have to be from the  30  January  2013  to  29  January  2018.  The
        skeleton argument prepared by the  appellant's  representative  for
        the hearing before the First-Tier Tribunal states: "13. In order to
        evidence that he has PR, the Appellant needs to show  that  he  was
        resident in the UK from 20 March 2013 given  that  the  deportation
        order is dated 20 March 2018. HMRC records show that the  Appellant
        was in receipt of ESA from 30 April  2013  to  4  July  2013  (HMRC
        record; A's bundle, p.35). In order to qualify for  ESA,  he  would
        have needed to show that he was habitually resident in the  UK.  It
        can therefore reasonably be inferred that he was resident in the UK
        on or before 20 March 2013. The skeleton argument  then  refers  to
        employment on various occasions until 20 December 2017.  It was not
        submitted in this document that there was  sufficient  evidence  of
        the lawful exercise of treaty rights for the requisite period. Even
        though Mr Chromiak's physical presence in the  United  Kingdom  was
        made out for  the  5-year  period  it  was  not  made  out  he  was
        exercising treaty rights during that time, which is  the  important
        element needed to establish a right of permanent residence.
    12. I find the Secretary of State has made out his case that the  Judge
        has erred in law  in  failing  to  provide  adequate  analysis  and
        reasoning in support of the  finding  Mr  Chromiak  was  exercising
        treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  period  of  5  years
        sufficient to entitle him to a right of permanent residence.
    13. Consideration has been given to a point in  the  skeleton  argument
        that Mr Chromiak completed 5 years as the family member  of  an  EU
        national, but there is no finding that either parent was exercising
        treaty rights themselves and Mr Chromiak was 19 in 2009  and  could
        not have completed 5 years in the UK before turning 21.
    14. I find the Judge has erred in law  in  a  manner  material  to  the
        decision to allow the appeal. The Judge was clearly concerned  that
        the higher test of 'serious grounds' was  the  relevant  test  when
        this is not arguably made out on the  evidence.  I  set  aside  the
        decision of the First-Tier Tribunal. The factual findings  relating
        to Mr Chromiak's nationality, criminality, and immigration  history
        are preserved findings.
    15. The directions issued for an error of law  hearing  make  it  clear
        that any further evidence to be relied upon should be  lodged  with
        the Upper Tribunal. Direction [4] states: "there is  a  presumption
        that, in the event of the Tribunal deciding that  the  decision  of
        the FfT is to be set aside as erroneous in law, the remaking of the
        decision would take place at the same hearing. Fresh decision  will
        normally be based on the evidence before the FtT  and  any  further
        evidence submitted,  together  with  the  parties'  arguments.  The
        parties must be prepared accordingly in every case."
    16. The appellants  nationality  is  not  disputed  and  therefore  any
        decision to remove him from the United  Kingdom  must  be  made  in
        accordance with the EEA Regulations 2016.
    17. The starting point is to establish the level of protection  against
        removal that Mr Chromiak is entitled to. In light of the issues set
        out above and concern that part of the period of employment when Mr
        Chromiak is said to have been exercising treaty rights has not been
        shown to be lawful through payment of cash in  hand  suggesting  an
        attempt to avoid declaring such income to HMRC and to pay  tax  and
        National  Insurance  due  upon  the  same  (supported  by  lack  of
        reference to the same in the documents from HMCR), and in light  of
        the failure to establish  that  Mr  Chromiak  has  exercise  treaty
        rights for the requisite 5 years, I find he has failed to establish
        an entitlement to a right of  permanent  residence  in  the  United
        Kingdom. The level of protection shall therefore  be  that  at  the
        lower end of the scale namely whether deportation is  justified  on
        the basis Mr Chromiak poses a threat to  public  policy  or  public
        security  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  that   the   decision   is
        proportionate.
    18. The Judge relied upon  the  decision  in  Arraz  (EEA  Regulations)
        [2017] UKUT 00294 which found that the burden  of  proving  that  a
        person  represents  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  threat
        affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society  under
        Regulation 21(5)(c) of the EEA Regulations rests on  the  Secretary
        of State  and  that  the  standard  of  proof  is  the  balance  of
        probabilities.
    19. The Secretary of State relies upon Mr Chromiak's offending  history
        is set out above. The 2016 regulations, schedule  1,  paragraph  3,
        state that where an  EEA  national/family  member  has  received  a
        custodial sentence or is a  persistent  offender,  the  longer  the
        sentence, or the more numerous the  convictions,  the  greater  the
        likelihood that the  individual's  continued  presence  in  the  UK
        represents a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
        affecting the fundamental interests of society.
    20. I find that in  addition  to  the  main  offences  giving  rise  to
        criminal sanction the ancillary convictions of  failing  to  comply
        with  community  orders  and  unpaid  work  requirements  does,  as
        submitted by the Secretary of State, demonstrate a lack of  respect
        for the law, a failure to accept responsibility or a willingness to
        make amends for his crimes. If, as identified by the Judge  alcohol
        and/or drugs are the root of the offending behaviour  there  is  no
        evidence either of remorse or that Mr Chromiak has taken any  steps
        towards rehabilitation to deal with these issues. The situation  at
        date of hearing therefore appears to be the same as that  that  was
        present during the time Mr Chromiak committed the  offences,  which
        gives rise to a clear indication of a real risk of reoffending.
    21. There is also arguable merit in the submission that the finding  by
        the Judge that Mr Chromiak  appeared  genuinely  shocked  that  his
        behaviour had led  to  his  deportation  from  the  United  Kingdom
        illustrated a lack of insight into what he was doing.
    22. It is important that any decision takes into account  the  question
        of the proportionality of the proposed action, but there is  little
        evidence available to demonstrate that Mr Chromiak's deportation is
        not a proportionate reaction. There is no evidence that since being
        returned to Poland efforts at rehabilitation have been made  or  to
        show the facilities to enable successful rehabilitation  would  not
        be available in Poland if Mr Chromiak sought to  make  use  of  the
        same.
    23. It is not made out on the evidence that Mr Chromiak  is  integrated
        into life in the United Kingdom,  his  extensive  criminal  history
        suggesting that he is not; see paragraph 4 (a), (b) and (c) of  the
        Schedule to the Regulations.  Paragraph 7(h)  of  the  Schedule  is
        also pertinent to any argument as it provides  something  that  may
        combat the continued offending and persistent offending illustrated
        above.
    24.  The public policy ground  for  removal  is  an  exception  to  the
        fundamental principle of the free exercise of  EU  rights  and,  as
        such, has to be construed restrictively.
    25. I find the Secretary of State has discharged the  burden  of  proof
        upon her to the required standard to show there is a real  risk  of
        reoffending sufficient to establish a  threat  to  the  fundamental
        principles of the United Kingdom and that removal of the  appellant
        has been shown to be proportionate on the facts of this matter.
    26. Accordingly, I substitute a decision to dismiss the appeal.


Decision

    27. The First-tier Judge materially erred  in  law.  I  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision  as  follows.
        This appeal is dismissed.

   Anonymity.


    28. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
