Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms H Cosgrove, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran, born on 16 September 1989.

 2. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated  17  November  2016,  refusing  the
         appellant's protection claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT, filed on 23  November
         2016 (which are only generic).

    iii) The determination by  FtT  Judge  Bart-Stewart,  promulgated  on  4
         August 2017, dismissing the appellant's appeal.

     iv) The appellant's 3 grounds of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission made to the FtT, dated 21 August 2017.

      v) The refusal of permission by FtT Judge Adio, dated 7 November 2017.

     vi) The appellant's application for permission made to the UT, dated  5
         December 2017, on the same grounds.

    vii) The grant of permission by UTJ Plimmer, dated 9 January 2018.

 3. Having heard the submissions, I reserved my decision.

 4. Grounds 1 and 2 are selective disagreement on matters of fact.  They do
    not tackle the reasoning in the decision as a whole, and do not  amount
    to a case that it should be set aside for error  on  a  point  of  law.
    Further, these grounds are not of  much  strength,  even  within  these
    limitations.

 5. Ground 1 does not show that the appellant  was  unreasonably  asked  to
    speculate, or that the judge's reasons in turn  are  speculative.   The
    appellant's  evidence  was  that  he  was  little   known   among   the
    congregation and had not been seen on the day, and so  it  was  unclear
    why he might be warned not to go home or why his home would be  raided.
    The judge adequately explained why she found the raid unlikely.  It was
    obvious that the appellant's account did not explain how the  Ettela'at
    might have known to remove the back of his television to find a  bible.
    As Mrs  O'Brien  submitted,  that  was  not  an  expectation  that  the
    appellant should see into the minds of the authorities.

 6. Ground 2 does not show any unfairness in the  judge  finding  that  the
    appellant gave a weak account of his engagement in church  services  in
    the UK or in how these were interpreted.  A judge must make up her mind
    on the evidence placed before her.  That does not  require  an  ongoing
    dialogue about points of concern.  The passage of  evidence  quoted  in
    the ground does not make the matter any clearer.  The appellant was not
    taken unfairly by surprise, and he does not suggest  that  he  has  any
    better explanation to provide.

 7. The submissions by Ms Cosgrove focused  on  ground  3.  Representatives
    agreed that it is of a different nature and, if  made  out,  would  not
    lead to a fresh hearing but to a remaking of the decision  by  the  UT,
    based on the evidence which had been before the FtT and on submissions.

 8. The proposition in the skeleton argument in the FtT is that  paragraphs
    457, 464 and  467  of  AB  and  others  (internet  activity-  state  of
    evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 257 "clearly places the appellant at greater
    risk in Iran".   As  stated  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,
    countering paragraph 38 of the FtT's  decision,  it  is  not  that  the
    Iranian authorities monitor the Facebook of every Iranian, but that  on
    return there is a "pinch point" where the appellant's internet activity
    is likely to come to the fore.

 9. Ms Cosgrove pointed to the evidence  of  many  Facebook  pages  in  the
    appellant's own name, all of an evangelical nature.  She accepted  that
    as this was his own Facebook account, he could delete it, but she  said
    that he was likely to be asked and could in principle not  be  expected
    to lie.

10. The proposition that the appellant qualifies for protection by a  false
    claim  to  Christian  conversion  posted  on   Facebook   has   several
    weaknesses.

11. The appellant may at any time delete his Facebook account.  Having been
    found to have set it up in bad faith, there is no reason to think  that
    he would not take that elementary precaution before return.

12. The respondent's decision at  �54  considers  the  appellant's  account
    based on illegal exit from Iran, although the  truth  of  that  is  not
    explicitly conceded, and finds, based  on  country  guidance,  no  risk
    arising.  The appellant did not focus in the FtT on obtaining a finding
    about his exit.  He did not try to show that the only course  available
    to him is return on a travel document  marking  him  out  as  a  failed
    asylum seeker.  It would have been for him  to  do  so.   There  is  no
    presumption of enforced return.

13. Refusal to return voluntarily, where that course is available, does not
    contribute to a claim for protection: see e.g. Macdonald's  Immigration
    Law and Practice, 9th ed., �12.24, citing AA v SSHD, LK v  SSHD  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 401, [2006] NLJR 681, [2007] 1 WLR 3134.  Put another way,  "A
    person cannot rely on their own failings (as  where  they  do  not  co-
    operate in securing valid travel documentation) to obtain international
    protection": Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice, 9th ed., �12.28,
    citing HF v SSHD (Iraq) [2013] EWCA Civ 1276.

14. If not marked out on return as a failed asylum seeker, it is not likely
    the Iranian authorities would ask the  appellant  for  details  of  his
    history in the UK.

15. There is a general principle of not being expected to  lie,  by  making
    false claims of political allegiance, or denying religious  convictions
    or sexual identity.  However, the appellant cited  no  authority  which
    would entitle him to a presumption that if asked, he would volunteer to
    his  national  authorities,  against  his  own  interests,  details  of
    activities he undertook in bad faith.  The proposition appears to be  a
    considerable stretching of the case law.

16. There would be no sensible reason to find as a fact that the  appellant
    would volunteer such information.

17. Somewhat similar arguments in cases of activities at low level  and  in
    bad faith were rejected by the UT and by the Court of Appeal in SSH and
    HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC)
    (see the headnote, and �23, 29-30, and 34) and in AS (Iran) [2017  EWCA
    Civ 1539 (�32-33).

18. Ground 3 does not show that the FtT's resolution of this issue involved
    the making of an error on a point of law.

19. If remaking on this issue was required, then for the above reasons  the
    appeal would again have been dismissed.

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
