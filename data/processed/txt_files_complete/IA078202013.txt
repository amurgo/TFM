                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal, in light of the decisions in AS (Afghanistan)  v  SSHD
         [2013] EWCA Civ 1469 and Patel & others  v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72,
         raised issues in  relation  reliance  upon  paragraph  298  of  the
         Immigration Rules by way of supplemental grounds in a s. 120 notice
         in the case of a minor who had reached her majority in  the  course
         of the proceedings.

      2. I made directions on 7 October 2014 that the  appellant  must  file
         and serve by 4 November 2014 detailed submissions as to the  nature
         and effect of raising paragraph 298 in  her  statement  of  grounds
         served pursuant to s.  120  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act, 2002.  (The respondent was to file and serve sequential
         detailed submissions by way of response.)

      3. The appellant failed to comply with the directions in  time  or  at
         all.

      4. The appellant's representatives took it upon themselves  to  assure
         the respondent that they would serve a  belated  submission  by  19
         January 2015.  They failed to do so.

      5. The appellant's  representatives  notified  the  Tribunal  and  the
         respondent on 8 May 2015 that they were without instructions.  (The
         panel was not aware of this at the hearing on  12  May  2015  until
         notified of the fact by Mr Wilding.)

      6. Neither the appellant nor her representatives attended  on  12  May
         2015. We are satisfied that the appellant was properly served  with
         a notice of hearing on 20 April 2015 by first  class  post  at  the
         address provided by her to the Tribunal.

      7. The appellant did not pursue her appeal to the Tribunal.

DECISION

The Judge made no error on a point of law and the original determination  of
the appeal shall stand.



                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                                 13 May 2015
