Representation:
For the appellant:     The appellant's cousin Mr Jon Mohammed Shahabi
For the respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Gan Nesar,  date  of  birth  1.1.67,  is  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Lobo, who dismissed  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent,  dated  2.10.13,  to  refuse   his   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    19.6.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.7.14. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted permission  to  appeal
    on 15.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lobo should be set aside.

 6. This is a peculiar case. Although the appellant was represented  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, he is no  longer  represented  except  by  his
    cousin, Mr Shahabi. I note  from  �2  of  the  determination  that  the
    appellant failed to comply with the asylum claim  process.  He  entered
    the UK in 2002 but absconded on 31.7.03. He failed to attend an  asylum
    interview arranged for 8.8.08. He claimed that he  never  received  the
    notice of decision and subsequently made a fresh claim on 2.10.13.

 7. Quite how the appellant came to make that fresh claim is something of a
    mystery. According to Mr Shahabi,  the  appellant  has  not  spoken  or
    opened his eyes for some 11 years.  The  papers  before  me  contain  a
    number of witness statements, but one for the appellant dated  27.2.14.
    It is not signed and I  do  not  know  how  he  could  have  made  this
    statement. As I understand it, Mr Shahabi purports  to  speak  for  the
    appellant. How he can do that when the appellant has not  spoken,  even
    to Mr Shahabi for 11 years is rather puzzling and ultimately  not  very
    credible. At �19  of  the  witness  statement  it  is  claimed  on  the
    appellant's behalf, and I put it that  way  deliberately,  that  he  is
    suffering from a number of health problems as  a  result  of  abuse  he
    suffered in Afghanistan. "I do not like to speak to anyone or socialise
    with anyone. I just keep myself secluded from everyone as a  result  of
    the abuse I have suffered."

 8. Mr Shahabi's short recent witness statement, dated 27.2.14,  states  at
    �7 that the appellant resides with him and at �8 that, "He  is  a  very
    reserved person who keeps himself to himself. He is unable to socialise
    with anyone and finds it difficult to be around people as a  result  of
    the abuse he has suffered over the years when he was  in  Afghanistan."
    This  statement,  remarkably  similar  to  that  purported  be  of  the
    appellant as  cited  above,  offers  no  substantial  support  for  the
    appellant's case.

 9. At the First-tier Tribunal, shortly prior to the  appeal  hearing,  the
    appellant allegedly fainted on two occasions and was taken by ambulance
    to hospital accompanied by Mr Shahabi. Counsel Ms Praisoody  sought  an
    adjournment of the hearing. However, it transpired that  the  appellant
    had not been intending to give any  evidence,  though  Mr  Shahabi  was
    proposing to do so on  the  appellant's  behalf.  I  doubt,  given  the
    content of his witness statements that Mr Shahabi  could  have  offered
    much relevant to the appellant's claim.

10. Judge Lobo took account of the fact that there had  been  two  previous
    adjournments for the purpose of obtaining medical evidence  as  to  the
    appellant's condition, but no  such  report  had  ever  been  produced.
    Apparently, it was decided by or on behalf of the appellant that it was
    too expensive. That remains the case, there is no medical evidence.  In
    the circumstances, the judge  considered  that  as  the  appellant  was
    represented and the appellant was not going to give evidence, and  that
    Mr Shahabi's evidence was of apparently marginal relevance, that  there
    was no purpose in the adjournment application and decided  to  continue
    with the appeal hearing. At 8 the  judge  has  set  out  his  carefully
    detailed reasons for refusing the adjournment application.

11. In passing I note that I have  seen  the  examination  notes  from  the
    hospital receiving the appellant following his fainting spells  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal. It seems that he did  not  speak  to  the  medical
    staff there either. It was found that he has high  blood  pressure.  Mr
    Shahabi produced a bag of antibiotics and other medicines but the  fact
    remains that there is no medical explanation for the  appellant's  mute
    and unseeing behaviour.

12. At the hearing before me, the appellant came in with  eyes  closed  and
    proceeded to cough, spit, and  throw  up  on  the  floor.  I  adjourned
    briefly for Mr Shahabi to take him out to  see  if  he  needed  medical
    treatment. They returned a few minutes later and although the appellant
    continued his fits of coughing, Mr Shahabi did not seek an adjournment.
    He had little to say about the appellant or his condition or indeed the
    grounds of appeal. I am at a loss to know how the grounds  came  to  be
    drafted, given the appellant's either refusal or inability to speak  or
    open his eyes. Mr Shahabi assured me that he had  been  like  this  for
    some 11 years. I have to say that like Judge Lobo (�8(e)), and  in  the
    absence of medical evidence, I very much suspected that  the  appellant
    was feigning in an attempt to obstruct the  resolution  of  the  appeal
    process. Whether that is right or not, may not matter as it appears  to
    have had no bearing on the judge's treatment of  the  appellant's  case
    and assessment of the evidence.

13. The grounds of appeal complain first that the judge wrongly refused  to
    adjourn the hearing held on 19.6.14, but  decided  to  proceed  in  the
    absence of the appellant and his cousin Mr Shahabi.  Second,  that  the
    decision does not show the "requirement of anxious scrutiny."

14. In refusing permission to appeal,  Judge  Kelly  suggest  that  it  was
    impossible to see how a fair-minded  observer,  appraised  of  all  the
    circumstances, could reasonably have concluded  that  justice  had  not
    been done. "The fact that the hearing of  the  appeal  had  been  twice
    previously adjourned - in order to obtain a medical  report  which  the
    appellant had ultimately concluded he could not afford - was  certainly
    a factor which informed the Tribunal's decision to proceed in spite  of
    him being ill on the day in question [paragraph 6].  Nevertheless,  the
    decisive factor for the tribuna - as it would no doubt  have  been  for
    the hypothetical fair-minded observer - was the fact that not only  was
    the appellant represented at the hearing, but also the fact that it had
    not in any event been his intention to give evidence [paragraph 7]. The
    application thus fails to disclose an arguable  error  of  law  on  the
    ground that justice was not seen to be done."

15. In granting permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Goldstein  found  that  the
    grounds "raise an arguable challenge to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's
    decision to refuse  the  appellant's  adjournment  request  and  as  to
    whether  in  the  circumstances  it  deprived  the  appellant  of   the
    opportunity of a fair hearing."

16. The overriding objective is  to  secure  that  proceedings  before  the
    Tribunal are handled as fairly, quickly and efficiently as possible  in
    the interests of the parties to the proceedings and in the wider public
    interest.

17. In R(on the application of AM (Cameroon) v AIT [2007] EWCA Civ 131, the
    Court of Appeal held that unfair decisions  on  interlocutory  matters,
    such as adjournments or the admission of evidence, can amount to errors
    of law.  Such decisions will have to be grounds for arguing  that  they
    display gross procedural unfairness or a  complete  denial  of  natural
    justice.  In the instant case the Court of Appeal thought that was  the
    case because the judge  refused  to  adjourn  when  the  appellant  was
    medically unfit to give evidence; because he listed the case for a  day
    when counsel was not available; and because he refused  permission  for
    evidence to be taken on the phone.

18. In Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC) it was  held
    that if a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
    decision could, in principle, be erroneous in law in several  respects:
    these  include  a  failure  to   take   into   account   all   material
    considerations;  permitting  immaterial  considerations   to   intrude;
    denying the party concerned  a  fair  hearing;  failing  to  apply  the
    correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most cases  the
    question will be whether the refusal deprived the affected party of his
    right to a fair hearing.

19. Where an adjournment refusal is challenged on fairness grounds,  it  is
    important to recognise that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not
    whether the First-tier Tribunal acted reasonably. Rather, the  test  to
    be applied is that of fairness; to determine whether  there  was  there
    any deprivation of the affected party's right to a fair hearing.  Given
    that the appellant was not going to give evidence, was represented, and
    that such evidence as Mr Shahiba might give  (considering  his  witness
    statement) was of marginal relevance, I find  that  the  appellant  has
    failed to demonstrate that there was any deprivation to the right of  a
    fair hearing. I fail to see what would  have  been  different  had  the
    appellant and Mr Shahiba not left the appeal hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Everything that could have been said was advanced by the
    appellant's legal representative.

20. In the light of the matters set out above and for the reasons given,  I
    find that the judge  gave  proper  and  careful  consideration  to  the
    adjournment request and that the refusal did  not  in  fact  amount  to
    procedural unfairness to the appellant.

Conclusion & Decision:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus no fee award can be made.
