                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer from the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Mailer
    sitting at Hatton Cross on 19 January 2018) allowing  on  human  rights
    grounds the claimant's appeal against the refusal of entry clearance as
    a family visitor.  The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that anonymity is required  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 21 May 2018, First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly granted  permission  to
    appeal for the following  reasons:  "For  the  reasons  stated  in  the
    grounds, it was arguably perverse for the Tribunal to hold that refusal
    of the adult  appellant's  application  for  entry  clearance  for  the
    purpose of making a short visit to her father  in  the  United  Kingdom
    engaged the potential operation of  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,  or  that  it  was
    disproportionate to the legitimate  aim  of  maintaining  the  economic
    wellbeing  of  the  country  through  the  consistent  application   of
    immigration controls."

Relevant Background

 3. The claimant is a national of Zimbabwe, whose date of birth is  [  b  ]
    1993.  Her father, [F.C.], was born in Zimbabwe on  [  ~  ]  1971.   He
    entered the UK on 24 March 2012  in  order  to  claim  asylum,  as  was
    accepted by the Presenting Officer at the outset of the hearing in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He was granted asylum as a political  refugee  on
    12 December 2012.

 4. On 19 December 2016 the Entry Clearance Officer gave  his  reasons  for
    refusing the claimant's  application  to  visit  her  father,  who  was
    suffering from a severe mental illness.  He was not satisfied that  she
    was genuinely seeking entry clearance for the purpose claimed  and  for
    the period stated by her.  With regard  to  her  Article  8  claim,  he
    stated that there was nothing to prevent her father from meeting her in
    a third country.

 5. Although the claimant did not have  formal  legal  representation,  her
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal evinced considerable legal
    knowledge, including familiarity with many of the relevant decisions in
    this field of the Law, including Singh [2015] EWCA  Civ  630  and  Kaur
    (Visit visas: Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT  00487.  She  pleaded  that  the
    decision interfered disproportionately  with  her  family  and  private
    life, as well as the private and family lives of her Uncle  Hansen  and
    her father.  Her relationships with her father  and  uncle  were  "more
    than emotional ties" considering that her uncle was her father's Carer,
    and her father loved her passionately, as described in  Kugathas.   She
    had submitted abundant evidence to show that she  depended  financially
    on her father and uncle.  Her visit was going to help  her  uncle,  who
    was over-stretched, tired and always busy from  working  full-time  and
    also caring for her father.  Her visit was going to give  her  uncle  a
    break.  Her father felt lonely and isolated in the UK, and so her visit
    was also going to provide relief and  therapy  for  him.  Her  father's
    mental illness made her case exceptional.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before Judge Mailer, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    represented by a Home Office Presenting Officer.   The  Judge  received
    oral evidence from  the  claimant's  father  and  uncle,  and  he  also
    considered a large volume of documentary evidence, much of it  directed
    to establishing the nature, extent and severity  of  the  father's  ill
    health.

 7. In his subsequent decision, the Judge  set  out  the  claimant's  case,
    including a summary of the evidence given by the father and  uncle,  in
    paragraphs [8]-[45].  At  paragraphs  [49]-[65],  the  Judge  gave  his
    reasons for finding that questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test should be
    answered in favour of the claimant.   He  found  the  evidence  of  the
    father and uncle  to  be  credible.   He  found  that  the  father  was
    substantially disabled and was in receipt of disability allowances.  He
    was in regular and constant communication with the claimant,  his  only
    daughter, and she also regularly spoke to  him.   The  claimant  had  a
    strong connection with her father, and her visit to the UK was in order
    to strengthen his mental well-being: he could see her face-to-face  and
    tell her stories that happened around the  place  he  lived.   He  felt
    lonely, and her short visit would boost his morale.  She had  a  strong
    bond with both her father and her uncle.   Her  father  was  unable  to
    visit her, owing to the medication that he took.

 8. At paragraph [54], the Judge posed the question as to whether there was
    family life for the purposes of the appeal.  After referring to  number
    of authorities, the Judge held, at paragraph [61], that there  must  be
    more than the normal emotional ties between adult relatives for  family
    life to exist for the purposes of Article 8.  The Judge continued:

         62.  I am satisfied that the evidence produced of the  relationship
             between  the  appellant  and  father  is  one  between   adult
             relatives which  does  disclose  a  substantial  component  of
             dependency.   The appellant's father was strongly  emotionally
             dependent  on  his  daughter  whilst  in  an  institution   in
             Zimbabwe.  He subsequently left Zimbabwe and obtained  refugee
             status in the UK.  He has substantial mental health  problems,
             for  which  he  receives  treatment.   This  makes   it   very
             difficult,  if  not  impossible  for  him  to  travel  as  the
             medication he takes causes him to be dizzy and unwell.

         63.      I am also satisfied that there  has  been  consistent  and
             substantial communication between the appellant and her father
             since he left, and this continues to this day.  She  has  been
             supported by him financially in Zimbabwe.  He has paid for her
             accountancy tuition fees as well as supporting her in her day-
             to-day living costs.

         64.      I find that there is mutual dependency  and  support  that
             has existed and will continue to exist between them.

         65.      I accordingly find that Article 8 is engaged on the  basis
         of family life in this case.

 9. The Judge then went on to consider the other Razgar questions,  and  he
    found that the requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules were met.
     He was satisfied that she intended to visit  her  father  only  for  a
    short period, and that if the claimant was in  the  unlikely  event  to
    refuse to return to Zimbabwe, her uncle  would  undertake  measures  to
    ensure that she complied with the conditions of her stay in the UK.  He
    was also satisfied, from the evidence produced, that the  claimant  had
    the means to pay for her return air fare.  Although  it  was  suggested
    that she could meet her father  outside  the  UK,  he  found  that  his
    current condition, exacerbated by his medication, prevented  that.   He
    became dizzy when  travelling.   "Further,  it  is  important  for  the
    appellant to observe for herself the way that her father lives on a day-
    to-day basis in the UK, including his treatment."

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing before me to determine whether an  error  law  was  made
    out, Mr Clarke developed Ground 1 of the appeal, but  abandoned  Ground
    2.

11. Ground 1 was that the Judge had erred in finding  family  life  in  the
    light of the case law - in particular Kugathas -v- SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ
    31 and ECO (Sierra Leone) -v- Kopoi [2017] EWCA  Civ  1511,  which  the
    Judge had cited at paragraph [56]  of  his  decision.   In  particular,
    reliance was placed on the following passage in Kugathas  at  paragraph
    [20]: "... Neither blood  ties  nor  the  concern  and  affection  that
    ordinarily go  with  them,  are,  by  themselves  put  together  in  my
    judgment, enough to constitute family life.   Most  of  us  have  close
    relations of whom we are extremely fond and whom we visit, or who visit
    us from time to time; but none of us would say on those  grounds  alone
    that we share a family life with them in any sense  capable  of  coming
    within the meaning and purpose of Article 8."

12. As the claimant had not seen her father since 2011, the Judge erred  in
    finding that there was a substantial component of dependency.   On  the
    contrary, there was no family  life  for  the  purposes  of  Article  8
    between the claimant and her father.

13. Mr Clarke developed Ground 1 by reference to PT (Sri Lanka)  -v-  Entry
    Clearance Officer, Chennai [2016]  EWCA  Civ  612  and  Rai  -v-  Entry
    Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.

14. The facts of Rai were that the appellant was born in Nepal on 1 January
    1986, and his father entered the UK with ILR  on  26  June  2010.   His
    mother followed his father to the UK with ILR on 17 February 2012.   On
    2 October 2012 the appellant, then 26  years  old,  applied  for  entry
    clearance to settle in the UK as his father's dependant.

15. Giving the leading judgment of the Court, Lindblom LJ held at [39] that
    the real issue under Article 8(1) was, "whether, as a matter  of  fact,
    the appellant had demonstrated that he  had  a  family  life  with  his
    parents, which had existed at the time of their departure to settle  in
    the UK and had endured beyond it,  notwithstanding  their  having  left
    Nepal when they did." At paragraph [42], Lindblom  LJ  reiterated  that
    the critical question was whether family life between the appellant and
    his parents had subsisted at the time when they left Nepal to settle in
    the UK, "and was still subsisting at the time of the  Upper  Tribunal's
    decision."

16. Mr Clarke submitted that, by parity of reasoning, the critical question
    here was whether  the  family  life  which  had  undoubtedly  subsisted
    between the claimant and her father prior to his departure  to  the  UK
    was still subsisting at the time of the First-tier Tribunal's decision.



17. He submitted that the Judge had not engaged with the  fact  that  there
    was an obvious gap in the evidence of dependency for the period between
    2012 and 2014/2015.   The  father's  evidence  was  that  he  had  been
    supporting his daughter for the past three years: see paragraph [23] of
    the decision.  So, on the face of it, there was no financial dependency
    between 2012 and 2014/15.

18. On the issue of emotional dependency, he submitted that  the  postcards
    from 2016, and the three pages of emails (which were undated and  which
    featured routine exchanges) did not support the proposition that at the
    relevant time there were more than normal emotional  ties  between  the
    claimant and her father.  There was  thus  a  paucity  of  evidence  of
    ongoing dependency.

19. In response, the claimant's uncle elaborated on his  brother's  history
    by way of an explanation for  the  apparent  gap  in  the  evidence  of
    continuous financial dependency.  His brother had entered the UK  on  a
    visit visa which he had  sponsored.  His  brother  had  obtained  entry
    clearance as a family visitor after a successful appeal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal which he had supported. His brother had claimed asylum on
    arrival as a result of the persecution he had received as a teacher  in
    the run up to an election. He had had been detained  under  the  Mental
    Health Act four times since arriving here in 2012, and he had  been  in
    hospital for "most of the time."  As a result, he, and not his brother,
    had mainly been supporting the claimant financially -  as  his  brother
    could not make remittances from hospital.  His  brother  was  currently
    detained under the Mental Health Act, and he was attending the  hearing
    today with a Carer assigned by the hospital.

20. Mr Chikowere produced a schedule issue to him by Western Union, setting
    out their record of the remittances which he had personally made to the
    claimant.  He acknowledged that there was a  two  year  gap  between  a
    single payment made by him to her in 2012 and the next payment made  by
    him to her in 2014.  However, he had also sent money through people who
    were travelling to Zimbabwe.  Also, he had sent money to their  sister,
    Margaret, with whom the claimant was  living  in  the  family  home  in
    Zimbabwe until April 2014, when Margaret died.

21. After hearing from Mr Clarke and the claimant's uncle, I ruled that  an
    error of law was made out under Ground 1, as developed by Mr Clarke  in
    oral argument.  I gave my reasons for so finding in short form, and  my
    extended reasons are set out below.

22. Mr Clarke invited me to proceed to re-make the decision on the evidence
    that was before the First-tier  Tribunal.    However,  he  subsequently
    agreed that this was  an  appropriate  case  for  the  remaking  to  be
    adjourned so  as  to  enable  the  claimant's  uncle  to  present  more
    comprehensive evidence of the remittances which he said that he and his
    brother had made to the claimant and/or their sister Margaret from 2012
    onwards.





The Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

23. The significance, for present purposes, of  the  cluster  of  Court  of
    Appeal decisions in 2017 on visit visa cases is  that  the  requirement
    for the Kugathas dependency criteria to be met is no less rigorous in a
    visit visa appeal than it is in an appeal against the refusal of  entry
    clearance for the purposes of settlement.  I refer to the decisions  of
    the Court of Appeal in Kopoi [2017] EWCA Civ 1511, Abis [2017] EWCA Civ
    1393 and Onuorah [2017] EWCA Civ 1757.

24. In Onuorah, the Court of Appeal held that Kugathas  remains  good  law,
    and that it applies to visit visa cases just as much as it  applies  in
    settlement cases.  Giving the leading judgment of the Court,  Singh  LJ
    at  paragraph  [35]  said  that  there  were  two   reasons   for   not
    distinguishing the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in Kugathas in
    a visit visa case:

         First, as a matter of principle,  the  question  whether  there  is
         "family life" for the purpose of Article 8  is  a  logically  prior
         question and cannot depend on the purpose for which an  application
         for entry clearance  is  made.   Secondly,  the  shortness  of  the
         proposed visit is, if anything, an indication  that  a  refusal  of
         leave to enter  did  not  involve  any  want  of  respect  for  the
         Respondent's family life for the purpose of Article 8: see Kopoi at
         para. 30 (Sales LJ) which I have quoted above.

25. In Kopoi, Sales LJ said at paragraph [30] as follows:

         A three week visit would not involve a significant contribution  to
         family life in the sense in which that term is used in  Article  8.
         Of course, it would often be nice for family members to meet up and
         visit in this way.  But a  short  visit  of  this  kind  would  not
         establish a relationship between any of the  individuals  concerned
         of support going beyond normal emotional ties, even if there were a
         positive obligation under Article 8 (which there is not) to allow a
         person to enter the UK to try to develop a "family life" which does
         not currently exist.

26. The corollary of this is that what might be termed 'the  Rai  question'
    is just as pertinent in a visit visa appeal  as  it  is  in  an  appeal
    against the refusal of entry clearance for the purposes of settlement.

27. The Judge did not give adequate  reasons,  having  regard  to  the  Rai
    question,  for  finding  in  paragraph  [64]  that  there  was   mutual
    dependency and support that had existed and which  continued  to  exist
    between parent and daughter.

28. He gave adequate reasons for finding that there was  mutual  dependency
    and support when they were living  together  under  the  same  roof  in
    Zimbabwe, and also when  the  father  was  admitted  to  a  psychiatric
    hospital in Harare in 2011.   However,  he  did  not  engage  with  the
    potential ramifications of the  father  becoming  a  dependant  of  his
    brother in the UK, while the claimant remained in the  family  home  in
    Zimbabwe; or with the paucity of evidence relating to the status of the
    relationship between father and daughter from the time of his departure
    to the UK in March 2012 and the point at which he said he  had  started
    to support her financially, which was for the last three years prior to
    the date of the hearing.

29. The upshot is that the Judge did not give adequate reasons for  finding
    that the family life which parent and daughter shared in  Zimbabwe  had
    been continuously subsisting since March 2012 - through a  continuation
    of a relationship of mutual dependency and support -  in  circumstances
    where they had been living separate lives in different  countries,  and
    they had not seen each other.

The Hearing to Remake the Decision

30. For the purposes of the remaking of the decision, the claimant's  uncle
    filed a large number of exhibits, which were in part  directed  at  the
    gap in the evidence of financial dependency for the period between 2012
    and 2014/2015 identified by Mr Clarke.

31. On the topic of the claimant's father's state of health, Rose Scott  of
    the Lambeth Home Treatment Team at South London and Maudsley NHS  Trust
    confirmed in a  letter  dated  10  September  2018  that  he  had  been
    experiencing  significant  mental  health  difficulties  requiring  in-
    patient admission.  At present, he was working with  the  Lambeth  Home
    Treatment Team.  Ms Scott went on to give a breakdown of  all  his  in-
    patient admissions between his first one on 17  January  2013  and  his
    last admission on 23 July 2018, which ran until 20 August 2018.

32. It was apparent from her breakdown that that the first  six  in-patient
    admissions were all clustered in 2013, whereas the last five admissions
    were all clustered in 2018, with the first in 2018 being from 15  March
    2018 to 29 March 2018.

33. The claimant's uncle also directed my attention  to  another  enclosure
    (E17) which showed that in August 2016 he  had  consulted  the  NHS  by
    email because his brother was becoming obsessed with his  daughter  and
    he kept on asking him when he was going  to  see  her.   Sometimes,  he
    would ask him more than five times a day.  He asked whether there  were
    any services, such as therapy or something, that  would  help  to  calm
    down his anxieties about his daughter in Zimbabwe.  He did not want him
    to relapse as he had been sectioned four times in one year  (2013)  and
    he did not want this to happen again.

34. The claimant's father was also in  attendance,  and  both  he  and  the
    claimant's uncle were briefly  questioned  by  Mr  Walker.   They  also
    answered questions for clarification purposes from me.

35. Mr Walker produced a Home Office minute dated 13  December  2012  which
    explained why the claimant's father had been  granted  asylum,  despite
    there being a number of credibility concerns regarding his claim.  Part
    of his claim, as set out in his asylum interview, was that he had  been
    hospitalised in Harare Psychiatric Hospital  for  two  months  at  some
    stage after 5 December 2011, which was when he said he had been  beaten
    with sticks by five men wearing Zanu-PF t-shirts.

36. The claimant's father confirmed what his brother had  said  earlier  to
    me, which was that he was only in  the  psychiatric  hospital  for  two
    weeks.  At the time of his admission to the hospital, he was living  on
    his own with the claimant.  He had  made  arrangements  later  for  his
    sister Margaret to move into the family home with  his  daughter.  This
    was when he was leaving for the UK.

37. The claimant's uncle drew my attention to E3, which  was  an  affidavit
    sworn by the claimant's father in Harare on 28 February 2012.  In  this
    affidavit, he said he was residing at Cotswold  Secondary  School.   He
    authorised his daughter, who resided at  Glen-Lorah  B  in  Harare,  to
    obtain the following items, namely a  sofa,  fridge,  television,  five
    goats and three cows, and to  sell  them  to  obtain  cash  for  "daily
    living".

38. The claimant's uncle explained that, after Margaret died in  2014,  the
    claimant was not left on her own.  This was because he had arranged for
    tenants to move  into  the  family  home  in  Harare.   They  were  not
    relatives, but they provided the claimant with companionship.

39. In his closing submissions on  behalf  of  the  respondent,  Mr  Walker
    submitted that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given  in
    the refusal letter.  He submitted that the Entry Clearance Officer  had
    expressed  justifiable  concern  about  whether  the  claimant  had   a
    sufficient incentive to return to Zimbabwe, particularly as the  stress
    of her going back might aggravate her father's symptoms of mental  ill-
    health.

40. In reply, the claimant's uncle said that the claimant had  consistently
    maintained that there were more  than  normal  emotional  ties  between
    herself and her father, so her case was distinguishable  on  the  facts
    from the cases of Kopoi and Onuorah.  He also relied on the decision of
    Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  O'Ryan  in  appeal  number  HU/07083/2016
    promulgated on 23 May 2018.  In that case, the Judge found that  Abbasi
    [2015] UKUT 00463 supported the conclusion of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge that the denial of entry to a Zimbabwean  mother  to  attend  the
    wedding of her daughter in the UK was  an  interference  of  sufficient
    gravity to engage Article  8  because  the  wedding  was  a  once-in-a-
    lifetime event, and it could not be repeated.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

41. I did not formally preserve Judge Mailer's findings that  the  claimant
    met the requirements of the Rules, including the requirement  that  she
    should be a genuine visitor, who intended to return to Zimbabwe after a
    short visit  of  two  weeks'  duration.   However,  Judge  Mailer  gave
    adequate reasons for finding that all the relevant requirements of  the
    Rules were met, and permission to appeal was not sought  on  the  basis
    that the Judge had erred in finding that the  claimant  was  a  genuine
    visitor.

42. I accept that one issue under the Rules was raised by way of appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal, which was the sustainability of the Judge's finding
    on funding.  The sponsor was reliant on benefits, and the cost  of  the
    trip was estimated to be around  �650.   Accordingly,  it  was  argued,
    Judge Mailer erred in finding that the claimant would not be  a  burden
    on the taxpayer, as the taxpayer would be indirectly funding her  visit
    through the sponsor's disability benefits.

43. The claimant's father can spend his disability benefits as  he  wishes.
    He is in the fortunate position of being looked after by  his  brother,
    who cares for him and provides him with board and lodging.  So  he  has
    disposable income to cover the costs of the claimant's trip.

44. The core issue in this appeal is whether  Questions  1  and  2  of  the
    Razgar test should be answered in the claimant's favour.  It  is  clear
    from the authorities that it cannot be answered in her  favour  on  the
    ground that the refusal interferes with her private life  or  with  her
    father's private life: see inter  alia  Abbas  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1393.
    There has to be a significant interference with family life.

45. In E1 there is a schedule  of  the  remittances  which  the  claimant's
    father has made to the claimant since  his  arrival  in  the  UK.   The
    schedule shows regular remittances of  generally  modest  sums  to  the
    claimant from 2 January 2013 through to 20 June 2018.   There  is  also
    one transfer in 2012 of just over �20 which was made on 14 June 2012.

46. E2 contains a schedule issued by Western Union in respect  of  payments
    made by the claimant's uncle to the claimant.  The  first  payment  was
    made on 17 May 2012 of just over �13, and the next payment was made  on
    12 April 2014 amounting  to  just  over  �75.   The  payments  continue
    through to 10 January 2018.  Insofar as it is material, there are fewer
    payments from the uncle, but some of the payments are much larger  than
    those from the father.  For example, the claimant's  uncle  transferred
    to the claimant the sum of �330 on 14 March 2017.

47. I find that the claimant has  shown  that  she  has  been  continuously
    financially supported as a student in Zimbabwe since the  time  of  her
    father's departure to the UK, and that her father has been  a  material
    contributor to that funding as well as her uncle.

48. The fact that the claimant's father has been regularly remitting  money
    to the claimant from February 2013 onwards tends  to  substantiate  the
    claim that he has been in regular contact with her  since  arriving  in
    the UK, albeit that tangible evidence of  communication  by  telephone,
    Whatsapp, Facebook, email or postcards is scant, and it does not  begin
    before 2016.

49. The disclosed exchanges between father and daughter show that they  are
    very fond of each other, but they do not show that either  of  them  is
    emotionally dependent upon the other.

50. Having assessed the evidence in the round, I am unable  to  answer  the
    Rai question in the claimant's favour. It is arguable that  the  nature
    of her father's condition is  such  that  his  desire  to  see  her  is
    particularly intense. But what is missing is the  required  element  of
    continuing emotional dependency. Realistically, I do not consider  that
    it can be said that he has been emotionally dependent on  his  daughter
    since March  2012,  or  that  she  has  been  continuously  emotionally
    dependent on him. There is also no evidence that  either  of  them  has
    recently become emotionally dependent on the other, following a  period
    of non-dependency. The Kugathas criteria are thus not met. Another  way
    of putting it is that, after  all  this  time  spent  living  apart  on
    separate continents, it cannot be said that father and daughter enjoy a
    family life which engages Article 8 ECHR.

51. The discussion in Onuorah illuminates a possible alternative  basis  on
    which family life could be said to be engaged. At [46] Singh LJ said he
    had no reason to doubt the correctness of Abbasi "on  its  facts",  but
    said it had no bearing on the present context, which  was  governed  by
    the principle in Kugathas.

52. Since Singh LJ went on to hold that he was bound by the decision of the
    Court of Appeal in Abbas that Article 8 in its private life aspect  was
    not engaged in a visit visa case, logically the decision in Abbasi  can
    only have been correct on its facts if it  engaged  Article  8  in  its
    family life aspect. Nonetheless, as Singh LJ indicated, Abbasi was  not
    a case in which the Kugathas criteria were satisfied.  Instead,  as  he
    held at [45], it concerned "matters relating to death, burial, mourning
    and associated rites".

53. As I am reminded by the  co-sponsor's  production  of  my  decision  in
    Onuorah which was overturned by the Court of Appeal, I addressed Abbasi
    in some depth to support my finding that on the current  state  of  the
    law the claimant did not require to have an "established"  family  life
    with the sponsor and  his  family  in  the  UK.  This  is  the  logical
    consequence  of  Abbasi,  in  which  the  claimants  did  not  have  an
    established family life with anyone in the UK,  but  simply  wished  to
    visit their grandfather's grave and to mourn  his  passing  with  other
    relatives. But the clear decision of the Court of Appeal in Onuorah was
    that I was wrong to hold, by parity of  reasoning,  that  the  claimant
    could succeed in her appeal without having an established  family  life
    with the brother she was seeking to visit. Thus, it is not open  to  me
    to hold that Article 8 in its family life aspect  is  engaged  in  this
    appeal because  of  the  compassionate  circumstances  surrounding  the
    proposed visit.

54. Accordingly, while the claimant has shown that the refusal was wrong in
    substance - and she can rely on this fact in any future application for
    a visit visa which she may choose to make - she has not shown that  the
    decision was unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
