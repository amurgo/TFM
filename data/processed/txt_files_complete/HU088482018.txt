                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge L S L Mensah, promulgated  on  10th  October  2018,  following  a
    hearing at Bradford on 6th September 2018.  In the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  23rd
    November 1982.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 29th March 2018,  refusing  his  application  for  permission  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of his private and family life rights.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that he is  in  a  relationship
    with his wife, whom he met in 2014, and whom he  married  when  he  was
    illegally in this country, a fact of which both of them were aware.  He
    is now with their child from her.  He cannot return  back  to  Pakistan
    because there are insurmountable obstacles for his partner and for  his
    child.  This is despite the fact that his wife is of Pakistani  origin,
    and has family in both countries, and has been in  the  UK  only  since
    2009.  He states that his children would have a better education in the
    UK.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge was faced, as a  preliminary  issue,  with  the  question  of
    whether the Appellant had exercised deception  in  taking  his  English
    language test, given the information from the ETS, which  was  provided
    as a result of "Project Faï¿½ade", a criminal enquiry into abuse  of  the
    TOEIC, at the Universal Training Centre,  in  Watford.   The  Appellant
    denied using a proxy test taker.   His  solicitors  demanded  that  the
    Respondent produced a voice  recording.   The  Respondent  was  put  on
    proof.  They provided a voice recording.  The Appellant  accepted  that
    it was not his voice on the recording.  He continues to assert that  he
    took the test.  The judge concluded that a proxy test taker was  indeed
    used and  that,  "I  completely  reject  the  Appellant's  explanation"
    (paragraph 17).

 5. Second, the judge then turned to the Article 8  claim.   It  was  noted
    that  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  both  admitted  entering  into  a
    relationship at a time when the Appellant  was  illegally  in  the  UK.
    Both knew that that was the case.  There was a strong  public  interest
    in removing the Appellant in the light of his conduct given the need to
    maintain effective immigration control.  Moreover, the Sponsor did  not
    meet the minimum financial requirements.  There  was  a  strong  public
    interest in removing the Appellant.  It was accepted that the child was
    British through his mother.  However, he was currently  1  year  and  5
    months old.

 6. The Appellant's wife gave evidence that  the  Appellant  plays  a  very
    active role in the lives of all the children  of  the  family,  two  of
    which are from his wife's previous husband.  The judge concluded that,

         "There is a paucity of evidence as to why it would be  unreasonable
         for any of the children to live with the Appellant and  his  family
         in Pakistan and neither the Appellant or his Islamic  wife  provide
         anything  other  than  bare  and  vague  assertions  regarding  the
         reasonableness of the family relocating" (paragraph 19).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge  erred  in  failing  to
    make any reasoned finding as to the  application  of  Section  117B(6).
    The Tribunal's approach to the welfare of the Appellant's children  was
    also legally flawed.  The judge proceeded to determine the issue of the
    Appellant using a proxy to take his TOEIC test, in the context  of  his
    assessment of the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

 9. Second, it is well-established that a  person  who  is  not  liable  to
    deportation, does not become subject to the public  interest  requiring
    that person's removal, where there is a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with a qualifying child.  The judge  does  not  deal  with
    this issue with reference to the  legislation  (see  Section  117B(6)).
    The decision of the judge with regards to Article 8, particularly  with
    reference to the Appellant's child, who is a British citizen,  and  its
    effect on the Appellant  being  removed  from  the  UK,  had  not  been
    properly evaluated.

10. On 6th November 2018 permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 6th March  2019,  Mr  Malik,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, relied upon the recent Tribunal decision of JG
    (s.117B(6)): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  72,  which
    stands for the  proposition  that  Section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act
    requires a court or  a  Tribunal  to  hypothesize  that  the  child  in
    question would leave the United Kingdom, even if this is not likely  to
    be the case, and ask whether it would be reasonable to expect the child
    to do so.  In that case, summitted Mr Malik, the Appellant was found to
    be dishonest.  The Tribunal therefore held that, "public confidence  in
    the  Respondent's  system  of  immigration  control  is  likely  to  be
    adversely affected if this Appellant  were  to  be  absolved  from  the
    requirement to obtain valid entry  clearance"  (paragraph  86).   This,
    however, was not the case here, submitted Mr Malik.  In this case,  the
    Secretary of State was not maintaining that it would be reasonable  for
    this British citizen child  to  go  with  the  Appellant  to  Pakistan.
    Unlike in JG, this case involved a British citizen child.

12. Second, in this case the Appellant was interviewed about the taking  of
    the ETS exams (see pages 35 to 39 of the Appellant's bundle), following
    which the Secretary of State accepted (see page 39) that the  Appellant
    was credible.  The Appellant gave his answers in English.   There  were
    no concerns about  his  credibility  in  relation  to  the  test.   Two
    conclusions follow from this, submitted Mr Malik.  First, that  if  the
    Secretary of State maintains  that  the  Appellant  is  credible  then,
    secondly, it is not possible for the Tribunal to say  that  he  is  not
    credible.

13. For her part, Mrs Petersen submitted that  the  grounds  that  are  now
    being argued were not raised before the Secretary of state.  The  judge
    had accepted (at paragraph 17) that  the  Appellant  could  provide  no
    explanation for the fact that the voice recording  that  was  presented
    was not his voice, and yet the Appellant continued to maintain that  he
    had sat the test.  If he spoke fluent English before  the  judge,  this
    was a year after his having sat the test.  It did not mean that he  had
    actually taken the ETS test in person himself.

14. Second, as far as Article 8 was concerned, Mrs Petersen submitted  that
    she would have to accept that a British citizen child existed  in  this
    case and that the decision in JG meant that the starting point was that
    one had to hypothesize on the basis that the child  in  question  would
    leave the United Kingdom, even if this was not going to be the case.

15. In reply, Mr Malik submitted that even if Mrs  Petersen  was  right  in
    what she said, the Appellant still succeeded under Article 8, and  this
    was because Mrs Petersen accepts  that  this  would  meet  the  natural
    consequence of the  decision  in  JG,  which  holds  that  one  has  to
    hypothesize on the basis that the child would in fact  leave  with  the
    parent.  Second, even if it is accepted that at paragraph 17 the  judge
    observed that the voice on the recording was not that of the Appellant,
    consideration had to be given to the case of MA (ETS -  TOEIC  testing)
    [2016] UKUT 450,  because  that  too  was  the  case  where  the  voice
    recording was not that of the Appellant, and yet the Upper Tribunal had
    held that, "the question of  whether  a  person  engaged  in  fraud  in
    procuring a  TOEIC  English  language  proficiency  qualification  will
    invariably be intrinsically fact-sensitive", so that on that basis this
    appeal should be allowed.

Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.

17. First, this is a case where the Appellant maintained that  he  had  not
    used a proxy test taker.  He put the Respondent Secretary of  State  to
    proof and demanded that the  voice  recording  be  produced.   A  voice
    recording was produced.  It did not turn out to be  the  voice  of  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant continued to maintain that he  did  take  the
    test nevertheless.  The judge held that, "I  find  the  Respondent  has
    proven a proxy  test  taker  was  used  and  I  completely  reject  the
    Appellant's explanation" (paragraph 17).  However, this is a case where
    the Respondent had accepted, following the Appellant's interview,  that
    there were no concerns about the Appellant's credibility in relation to
    the taking of his test (see page 29 of the Appellant's bundle).

18. Second, there was the issue of the Appellant's reason  for  dishonesty.
    In Majumdel and Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167, the Court  of  Appeal  held
    (at paragraph 69) that

         "In considering an allegation of dishonesty  the  relevant  factors
         included the following: what the person accused had  to  gain  from
         being dishonest; what he had to  lose;  what  is  known  about  his
         character; the cultural environment in which he operated;  how  the
         individual accused of dishonesty performed under cross-examination,
         and whether the Tribunal's  assessment  of  that  person's  English
         language proficiency is commensurate with his or her TOEIC  scores;
         and whether his or her academic achievements are such that  it  was
         unnecessary or illogical for them to have cheated.   There  was  no
         criticism in this court by Mr Covats of that approach".

19. Third, however, the Tribunal below failed to follow this approach.  The
    result of that  was  that  there  was  no  consideration  of  what  the
    Appellant had to gain from being dishonest, what was  known  about  his
    character and cultural environment, whether the judge's  assessment  of
    the Appellant's English language proficiency was commensurate with  his
    TOEIC scores, and whether the  Appellant's  academic  achievements  are
    such that it was unnecessary or illogical for him to have cheated.

20. Fourth, the judge's failure to engage with these factors meant that  he
    overlooked  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  did  not  use  the   TOEIC
    certificate to support any application  for  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.  There was, accordingly, no reason for the Appellant to
    cheat  in  the  light  of  his  academic  achievements   and   language
    proficiency.  Furthermore, there  was  nothing  about  the  Appellant's
    character or environment  that  was  adverse  to  his  interests.   His
    English language ability was not put in doubt in the evidence  that  he
    gave before judge.

21. For all these reasons, the judge erred in law.

Remaking the Decision

22. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.

23. This is a case where the voice recording was not determinative  of  the
    appeal.  In fact, it was accepted by the Secretary of  State  that  the
    Appellant's credibility in relation to the taking of the test  was  not
    in doubt.  In MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT  450,  the  Tribunal
    observed (at paragraph  10)  that,  "underpinning  the  issues  is  the
    Appellant's acceptance that the voice  contained  in  the  computerised
    voice files which are said to have been generated by his TOEIC speaking
    test is not his .....".  The Appellant, of course, in this appeal  also
    maintains that the voice on the recording was  not  his.   In  MA,  the
    Upper Tribunal gave guidance that, "the question of  whether  a  person
    engaged in fraud in procuring  a  TOEIC  English  language  proficiency
    qualification will invariably be intrinsically fact-sensitive".

24. This being so, I am satisfied that as a question of fact the  Appellant
    has not cheated.  That then, leaves open the question  as  to  how  the
    assessment in relation  to  Article  8  falls  to  be  determined.   Ms
    Petersen is in agreement with Mr Malik that the effect of JG is that if
    the Appellant is removed then this requires the court  or  Tribunal  to
    hypothesize that the child in question would leave the United  Kingdom,
    and I find that this would indeed be the case, and that it would not be
    reasonable to expect the child to do so in this case because it is  not
    in the best interests  of  the  two  children  that  the  Appellant  be
    separated from his wife and children, and it would be  unreasonable  to
    expect the two British children to leave the UK.

25. A third child was born on 13th April 2017.  The evidence  is  that  the
    Appellant plays a very active role in the lives of the three  children.
    The balance of consideration falls in favour of the Appellant.
