                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The claimant is a citizen of the Republic  of  Cyprus  born  on  15th
       October 1959. He arrived in the UK on 14th October 1991. On 13th July
       1993 he was granted leave to remain as a spouse,  and  on  28th  July
       1994 he was granted indefinite leave to remain as a  spouse.  On  the
       1st May 2004 Cyprus became a member of the EU.

    2.  The  claimant  was  convicted  of  fraudulent  use  of   a   vehicle
       licence/trade licence/registration document and fined  ï¿½100  on  28th
       January 2004. He was convicted on 7th December and 21st April 2008 of
       conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on  the  importation
       of class A controlled drugs, and on 27th June 2008 he  was  sentenced
       to 16 years imprisonment.  The  claimant  was  in  custody  and  then
       immigration detention for 7 years and 8 months from December 2006  to
       August 2014.

    3. On 29th January 2013 the claimant was served with notice of liability
       to deportation. On 10th May 2013 he was served with a  decision  that
       s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied.  On  28th  May  2014  the
       Secretary of State made a decision to make a deportation order  under
       the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. This decision  accepted  that
       the claimant had a permanent right of residence, and  that  he  could
       only be deported if there were imperative grounds of public security.
       His appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Devittie  in  a
       determination promulgated on the 24th October 2015.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun on the
       basis that it was arguable that the First-tier judge had erred in law
       in not considering that the test  of  imperative  grounds  of  public
       security might be met even if there was no risk of re-offending given
       the seriousness of the claimant's conviction, in accordance with R  v
       Bouchereau [1977] EUECJ R -30/77.

    5. The matter  came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submission on Error of Law by the Secretary of State

    6. Mr Kandola argued firstly, in summary, that the  First-tier  Tribunal
       had erred in law as it had accepted the concession of  the  Secretary
       of State that imperative grounds of public security applied  in  this
       case, when in fact if the law was correctly applied this test did not
       apply to the claimant, see SSHD v MG [2014] EU ECJ C-400/12.  It  was
       clear that the claimant's residence had been broken by his period  of
       imprisonment so he was not integrated.

    7. Secondly it was contended, in summary, for  the  Secretary  of  State
       that in any case there was a failure to consider that the fact of the
       claimant's very serious conviction and the findings within the  OASys
       report about his role and connections  indicated  that  there  was  a
       serious risk of harm if the claimant reoffended, so even if the  risk
       of re-offending was assessed as low  he  could  be  said  to  pose  a
       present and sufficiently serious threat to public policy. This  could
       not be characterised as an ordinary risk of reoffending, as  is  done
       at paragraph 10 of the  decision,  which  diminishes  the  claimant's
       criminality.

    8. Thirdly, if the above errors were made out it  became  relevant  that
       the proportionality assessment at paragraph 11 of  the  decision  was
       also unlawfully conducted as the matters mentioned were all  arguably
       not accurately stated: the claimant should not been  seen  simply  as
       someone who had lived in the UK for 23 years; he should not  be  seen
       as someone  who  was  integrated;  caring  for  his  wife  would  not
       necessarily be a factor which would prevent offending behaviour;  the
       claimant would not find it difficult to relocate to Cyprus as he  and
       his wife had family there;  and  although  his  wife  was  a  British
       citizen that was not a factor as she was free to return  to  the  UK.



Conclusions

    9. It is not arguable that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by
       accepting the concession of the Secretary of State  in  the  decision
       letter setting out the reasons for finding that the claimant met  the
       test for qualifying for  the  highest  level  of  protection  against
       deportation: namely that  he  could  only  be  deport  on  imperative
       grounds of public security.

   10. The  decision  letter  clearly  reaches  this  conclusion  taking  an
       approach which follows the law set out in SSHD v MG. The guidance  in
       this case states that: "Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must be
       interpreted  as  meaning  that  a  period  of  imprisonment  is,   in
       principle, capable both of interrupting the continuity of the  period
       of residence for the purposes of that provision and of affecting  the
       decision regarding the grant of the enhanced protection provided  for
       thereunder, even where the  person  concerned  resided  in  the  host
       Member State for the 10 years prior  to  imprisonment.  However,  the
       fact that that person resided in the host Member  State  for  the  10
       years prior to imprisonment may be taken into consideration  as  part
       of the overall assessment required in order to determine whether  the
       integrating links previously forged with the host Member  State  have
       been broken." The decision letter correctly indicates at paragraph 18
       that ten years residence prior  to  the  index  conviction  does  not
       automatically qualify the claimant for this  protection.  It  plainly
       looks at the relevant issues in determining whether the claimant does
       have  this  protection,  as  outlined  in   Land   Baden   Wurtemberg
       vTsakouridis [2011] CMLR 11 C-145/09, which were  summarised  in  the
       letter as the "integration test".

   11. The concession of the Secretary  of  State  that  this  claimant  had
       sufficient integration to acquire the imperative level of  protection
       was one which was in compliance with the law, and  was  open  to  the
       Secretary of State to make. It clearly could not amount to  an  error
       of law by the First-tier Tribunal in taking this  as  their  starting
       point.

   12. It is also clear that it was open to the First-tier Tribunal to  rely
       upon the assessment of risk by the probation  service  in  the  OASys
       Report, which was when all matters were considered that the  claimant
       was a low risk of reconviction (4%) and a low risk of harm. The First-
       tier Tribunal set out the full sentencing remarks of the judge in the
       criminal matter at paragraph  2  of  the  decision  and  an  entirely
       accurate summary of the OASys Report at paragraph 7.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal then considered all the evidence and reached its conclusions
       regarding the issues of harm and re-offending  risk,  including  with
       proper reference to the evidence of the claimant  and  his  wife,  at
       paragraphs 10(i)-(iv). The reference to  the  claimant  in  any  case
       posing no more than an "ordinary risk to society" refers back to what
       is said at paragraph 9 of  the  decision,  which  in  turn  sets  out
       guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in  MG  and  VC  Ireland  [2006]
       UKAIT, whereby the Upper Tribunal expressed the opinion that  whether
       or not imperative grounds must amount to suspicion of  commission  of
       terrorist offences it clearly needed more than the ordinary  risk  to
       society arising from  the  commission  of  offences  by  a  convicted
       criminal.

   13. The Secretary of State did not argue before the  First-tier  Tribunal
       that the claimant could pose an imperative risk  to  public  security
       because R v Bouchereau meant that the fact of his original conviction
       absent any future risk of criminal behaviour met this test. What  was
       said in R v Bouchereau was  clearly  addressing  the  lower  test  of
       whether a claimant could pose a  present,  genuine  and  sufficiently
       serious threat affecting a fundamental interest  of  society.  It  is
       also a case from 1977; the issue of whether  a  claimant  might  meet
       this test by having a past serious conviction has been  revisited  by
       the EUECJ in more recent decisions which clarify that a risk  of  new
       conduct threatening public security is required to justify  expulsion
       in accordance with EU law: see for instance  Nazli  &  Ors  (External
       Relations) [2000] EUECJ C-340/97 at paragraph 61 where it  is  stated
       about a Turkish national who has the protection of the EU Association
       Agreement but who has been convicted in the  trafficking  of  heroin:
       "Accordingly,  a  Turkish  national  can  be  denied,  by  means   of
       expulsion, the rights which he derives directly from Decision No 1/80
       only if that  measure  is  justified  because  his  personal  conduct
       indicates a specific  risk  of  new  and  serious  prejudice  to  the
       requirements of public policy". This was also the approach  taken  by
       the Court of Appeal in SSHD v FV (Italy) [2012] EWCA Civ 1199,  where
       the claimant had been convicted of a  serious  manslaughter  with  an
       assortment of previous less serious convictions.

   14. As the First-tier Tribunal had properly and lawfully  concluded  that
       the claimant did not pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
       threat to public policy, at  paragraph  10(v),  let  alone  that  his
       deportation was required on imperative  grounds  relating  to  public
       security, there was no need, in accordance with Regulation  21(5)  of
       the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 for there  to  have  been  any
       discussion of proportionality, so there can be clearly be no material
       error of law at paragraph 11 of the decision. In any case the factors
       indentified are all clearly relevant  ones  to  proportionality,  and
       there is no misdirection or law or irrationality in the assessment.

  Decision:
    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.
    2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the  appeal  of  the
       claimant is upheld.
