The rights of entry and of residence of parents of EU national children
derived by the ECJ in Chen are a matter of EU free movement law. National
courts are therefore obliged to recognise them, and national legislation
cannot reduce them.




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1.   This is an appeal by the ECO (Dubai) from a  decision  of  IJ  Grant
      promulgated on 23 March 2010 when he allowed M's  appeal  against  the
      ECO's refusal of entry clearance that would permit her  to  travel  to
      the United Kingdom along with her daughter C born 8 May 1999 who is  a
      French national. At the same time as he  allowed  M's  appeal  against
      this decision, he dismissed other appeals that will be the subject  of
      separate judgments but need to be mentioned in setting the  background
      to the issues in this case. Following previous  directions  issued  in
      this case the parties will be referred to by initial.

   2.   M is the unmarried partner of a British citizen P who is employed by
      a professional services firm based in London and is presently assigned
      to that firm's office in Dubai. At some time in the past  M  had  been
      living in the United Kingdom and had remained beyond a period of leave
      since 2005. It seems the couple met in the UK and  started  cohabiting
      as man and wife in February 2008.

   3.   From April 2009 M, P, and C lived together  in  Dubai.  M  was  also
      employed by the same firm in their Dubai office.  The couple  intended
      to get married but were not free to marry  as  P  was  a  party  to  a
      marriage  that  had  not  at  that  stage  been  terminated.   Divorce
      proceedings had been instituted.

   4.   M was required to undergo a compulsory medical  test  in  connection
      with a residence permit in Dubai. On or about 14 July 2009 she learned
      that she was  diagnosed  positive  for  HIV.  This  has  had  dramatic
      implications for her continued residence in Dubai. Under local law  it
      was mandatory to refuse a visa, and she was at risk of  detention  and
      removal. The household consisting of P, C and M decided to  return  to
      the UK  where  they  could  live  together,  M  could  obtain  medical
      treatment and C could pursue her  education  at  the  Lycee  Francaise
      London. The family unit are self sufficient through P's  earnings  and
      are all covered by private health insurance.

   5.    M accordingly made a number of applications for entry clearance  or
      equivalent documentation relevant to family members of  EU  nationals,
      namely:-

           i. on 25 August 2009 for an EC for admission  as  a  fianc�e  of
              someone settled in the UK;
          ii. on 25 August for entry as the accompanying primary  carer  of
              her self sufficient child;
         iii. on 27 August 2009 for an EC as an accompanying relative of  a
              self sufficient EEA national child;
          iv. on 27 August for an EEA family permit to accompany  her  self
              sufficient child C and as the unmarried partner  of returning
               UK national P.


          Each was refused on the basis that M did not comply with  all  the
requirements of
       the Immigration Rules. Notices of appeal  were  lodged  against  each
      decision on 23
        September 2009.

   6.    In the light of her precarious situation in Dubai,  M  and  C  felt
      compelled to return to Cote D'Ivoire of which M is  a  national  on  4
      September 2009, pending resolution of her challenge to  the  refusals.
      She subsequently provided evidence to the ECO of her status as primary
      carer of C. P has remained in Dubai for the  time  being  pending  the
      outcome of those challenges.

   7.    M and P first sought to challenge the refusals by a judicial review
      application CO/9395/2009 where shortly after issue she sought  interim
      relief requiring M's admission to the UK. This relief was refused  and
      the  judicial  review   was   subsequently   adjourned   pending   the
      determination of appeals against the various  decisions  to  the  then
      AIT.

   8.    The appeals were heard at Taylor House on the 11 March 2010, by  IJ
      Grant sitting as a judge of the First tier  Tribunal  Immigration  and
      Asylum Chamber, as the AIT had been abolished on 14 February 2010.  He
      decided as follows:

           i. The fianc�e entry clearance application was dismissed because
              at the date of the decision P was still married to his former
              wife and  although  in  August  2009  it  was  reasonable  to
              anticipate that P would be free to  marry  within  6  months,
              this  had  not  transpired  and  as  of  March  2010  it  was
              anticipated that his degree absolute would be promulgated  in
              April 2009.
          ii. The application for an EEA family permit was refused  because
              although the IJ found that P had been supplying  professional
              services to and within the EEA,  the  couple  had  not  lived
              together as man and wife in another EEA state other than  the
              UK and so could not comply with Regulation 9  (2)(a)  of  the
              EEA Regulations 2006 SI 2006 1003 (the Regulations).
         iii. The application for an EEA permit as a family member  of  her
              daughter C failed because  M  was  not  a  dependent  of  her
              daughter within the meaning of Regulation 7 (1)(a)   and  was
              not residing with C in another EEA state before entry to  the
              UK as required by Regulation 8 (2)(a) of the Regulations.

   9.       However on the findings of fact he made, the  IJ  was  satisfied
      that the principle determined by the ECJ in the case of  Chen  v  SSHD
      [20005] INLR 1 applied to this case. He concluded at [18]:

             "Applying the judgment of the ECJ to the situation before me I
             find that the decision to deny the appellant's  daughter  aged
             10 an EEA Family Permit as the accompanying  non-EEA  national
             mother of an EEA self  sufficient  child  had  the  effect  of
             denying the daughter her right as an EEA national to  exercise
             freedom of movement within the EEA. I find that the  appellant
             was at the date of the  decision  the  primary  carer  of  her
             daughter, a fact which was subsequently ratified by the  court
             order of December 2009."


  10.  The Home Office Presenting Officer who appeared for the ECO  at  this
      appeal argued that whatever the entitlements generated by the decision
      of Chen the Immigration Rules applied to regulate entry, in this  case
      paragraph 257C and that rule was in turn subject to mandatory  refusal
      of the application for non disclosure of her previous overstay in  the
      UK pursuant to paragraph 320 (7A).  M therefore failed to comply  with
      the Immigration Rules that were applicable to her because she did  not
      comply with the  provisions  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations.  The  IJ
      concluded at [19] and [20] that if there was an EU right of  entry  it
      could not be restricted by general  requirements  of  the  Immigration
      Rules.

  11. No directions were issued to give effect to the successful  appeal.  M
      sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  Immigration  and
      Asylum Chamber in respect of the  decisions  where  the  appeals  were
      dismissed. The ECO also sought permission to appeal to  UTIAC  in  the
      present case.

  12. M's legal representatives were concerned at the apparent delay in  the
      permission to appeal applications being determined, and the failure of
      the ECO to grant entry clearance to permit M and C to travel  together
      to London where they would be joined by P. A further  application  for
      judicial review  was  lodged  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  Administrative
      Appeals  Chambers  and  the  solicitors  sought   transfer   of   that
      application together with the proceedings stayed in the Administrative
      Court to the UTIAC for determination alongside  the  pending  appeals.
      The second application for judicial review served only  to  complicate
      the determination of this appeal and I am satisfied that there was  no
      jurisdiction to issue it in the Upper Tribunal and  it  has  now  been
      remitted to the Administrative Court pending the determination of this
      appeal.

      Case Management of the appeals

  13. A direction was given by me that the applications  for  permission  to
      appeal be placed before an SIJ promptly. On 23 April  2010  SIJ  McKee
      granted permission to appeal in each case.

  14. Following further requests for the judicial review proceedings  to  be
      heard in the  UTIAC  and  interim  relief  granted,  the  papers  were
      referred to me and I directed that there be a case management  hearing
      on 25 May 2010. SIJ Spencer on the 14 May 2010 set out a timetable for
      the parties to comment on the grounds  of  appeal  in  the  respective
      cases and for a reply to those responses lodged so the Tribunal  could
      identify what the real issues in the case were, whether  there  was  a
      material error of law in  any  of  the  appeals  and  if  so  how  the
      consequent appeals would be determined.

  15. The grounds stated that as the appellant came within neither  the  EEA
      Regulations nor the Immigration Rules  the  appeal  should  have  been
      dismissed and the decision should be reversed. The material  parts  of
      the ECO's grounds for application for  permission  to  appeal  are  as
      follows:

         "In  taking  this  approach  the  Immigration  Judge  has   clearly
         misdirected himself. As the case law  of  Chen  doesn't  in  itself
         infer a right upon the  appellant  to  leave  to  enter.   For  the
         appellant to succeed as an accompanying non EA national  mother  of
         an EEA self-sufficient child she must come within  either  the  EEA
         Regulations or the Immigration  Rules."

                   (emphasis supplied).


  16.   M's  representatives  responded  to  these  grounds   with   further
      representations to the effect that M did have a right of  entry  under
      EU law and that the  rest  of  the  grounds  were  based  on  a  false
      predicate. Since this contention had  been  the  clear  basis  of  the
      application, appeal and judicial review and had been  the  subject  of
      extensive communication s made to this Tribunal, the  ECO  Dubai,  the
      Treasury Solicitors and the Home Office Presenting Officers' Unit,  it
      was surprising that the ECO's grounds  should  summarily  dispute  the
      point without further explanation. Hitherto no one had suggested  that
      there were no EU rights engaged but  merely  that  the  mechanism  for
      giving effect to them was through the Immigration Rules.


  17.  The directions issued on the 15 May 2010 were designed  to  give  the
      ECO an opportunity to expand on  the  assertion  in  the  grounds  and
      address M's response to it. It was disappointing to  find  that  there
      had been no written response to these observations made on  behalf  of
      the ECO Dubai before the case management hearing that I  conducted  on
      the 25 May 2010.  It was entirely unclear to me why  it  was  asserted
      that there was no EU law right of entry on the facts found by the IJ.

  18.  At the case management hearing, it was not disputed by Mr Deller HOPO
      that if there was a directly effective Treaty right for M to  come  to
      the UK with C, then the absence of provision to this effect in the EEA
      Regulations was nothing to the point. I pointed  out  that  under  s.2
      European Communities Act 1972 the Tribunal is required to apply EU law
      where it applies, and both FtT IAC  and  UTIAC  have  jurisdiction  to
      allow appeals where the decision is not in accordance with the law.

  19.  It was accepted by Mr Deller that no EU grounds of public policy were
      relied on to restrict or defeat any EU right of  entry  that  M  might
      have. Accordingly the question of whether the IJ had made  a  material
      error of law enabling the UT to remake this decision  turned  entirely
      on the accuracy of the assertion of the words  I  have  emphasised  in
      italics in the grounds. Mr Deller was unable to assist why in  law  or
      fact here was no such right of entry.

  20. Under Rule 7 (2)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  2008  as
      amended, where a party has failed to  comply  with  a  direction,  the
      Tribunal may take such action short of striking out that party's  case
      as it considers just.

  21.  I directed that written submissions should be  made  by  the  ECO  by
      4.00pm 2 June to which a reply should be received by 4.00pm 4 June. It
      was contemplated in those directions that the UT would  determine  the
      appeal on the papers in the light of the representations  received.  I
      made these directions under the Tribunal's case management powers  for
      the  following reasons:

           i. The case concerned the need for medical treatment for M,  the
              possibility of resumption of cohabitation between M and P and
              the educational and social  welfare  of  the  child  C.   The
              dispute between  the  parties  had  been  out-standing  since
              August 2009 and the subject matter merited expedition.
          ii. The central issue in the  appeal  had  never  been  made  the
              subject of legal submissions on behalf of the ECO in the  AIT
              or either IAC and remained obscure  at  the  case  management
              hearing.
         iii. There had been a failure  by  the  ECO  to  comply  with  the
              directions issued on the 14 May 2010 designed  to  facilitate
              case management of  the  issues,  and  that  was  a  relevant
              consideration in how to conduct the hearing.
          iv. Despite the copious legal submissions made by M's  solicitors
              and correspondence with the Treasury Solicitors, no  decision
              had been taken to instruct counsel to appear for the  ECO  in
              the appeal by the date of the case management hearing.
           v. An appeal on a pure point of law could be readily  determined
              without the need for a further oral hearing in the  light  of
              the guidance given by the ECJ in the case of Chen and such  a
              determination could be more readily and speedily made without
              the need for the listing of a further oral hearing.

  22.    On 2 June 2010  in due time the Tribunal received by fax  a  letter
      from Mr Deller          setting out the ECO's contentions:

         "This letter serves as the response  to  directions  given  by  the
         President at a for mention hearing of  this  and  three  associated
         appeals on Tuesday 25 May.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  to
         state whether it  was  accepted,  following  the  judgment  of  the
         European Court of Justice  in  Chen  &  Others  (Free  Movement  of
         Persons) [2004] ECJ C-200/02, that the non-EEA primary carer of  an
         EEA minor exercising a treaty right was held to be exercising  such
         a right deriving from the Treaty of Rome.  The  Tribunal  indicated
         its view that this was plainly the effect of paragraph 42-47 of the
         judgment and expresses the opinion that the ECO's  appeal  in  this
         case could be disposed of without a hearing unless good reason  was
         shown why not.


         The view of the ECO is that the effect of the judgment in  Chen  is
         not that a treaty right to enter  is  conferred  upon  the  non-EEA
         primary carer of a  self-sufficient  EEA  child  exercising  treaty
         rights. Reliance is place upon para 25  of  the  Court  of  Appeals
         Judgment in W (China) and Another v  the SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ  1494
         which it is submitted is binding on the Tribunal - see also para  9
         of Liu and Others v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1275.  In  this  regard  -
         with regard to the issues in this case:


             "Equally, however, neither parent has any  personal  right  of
             entry or abode here.  Their claim is  made  in  the  right  of
             their child:  her rights, they contend, can only be  exercised
             if they are able to exercise them with and for her.  In  point
             of fact this is undoubtedly the case. "


         The ECO (via the SSHD) notes the Tribunal's comments about para 42-
         47 and particularly 46 of Chen,  but  maintains  that  the  non-EEA
         primary carer must meet the requirements set out in the Immigration
         rules at para 257C.  The UT is respectfully invited to consider the
         language chosen by the Court of Justice when it ruled on the  right
         of residents derived from the Treaty for the  self-sufficient  EEC-
         national child. This right is rendered effective by the presence of
         a parent/primary carer but the Court of Justice does not  speak  in
         terms of that primary carer function carrying with  it  an  express
         right to reside.  In the circumstances the ECO seeks a  substantive
         hearing of appeal [   ] in due course  at  which  further  argument
         will be made pursuant to the grounds of challenge."


  23. Detailed representations were made in response to this letter  on  3rd
      June 2010.  Whilst the Tribunal was  considering  the  matter  in  the
      light of these representations, on the 17 June it  received  a  letter
      dated 15 June from the Treasury  Solicitors  indicating  that  it  now
      sought to instruct counsel to attend at the  future  hearing  of  this
      appeal. There was an  exchange  of  correspondence  in  which  the  UT
      pointed out that it was going to decide  whether  there  had  been  an
      error of law by the IJ that would make  an  appeal  and  further  oral
      hearing necessary; the previous directions and representations of  the
      HOPO were referred to. In response the Treasury  Solicitors  indicated
      that they would await the outcome of the determination on the issue.


   The provisions of EU law


  24. The case of Chen concerned whether the non-national parents of a minor
      child who was an Irish citizen were entitled to reside in  the  UK  in
      order to make the child's right of residence practical and  effective.




  25. The ECJ rejected a submission by Mrs Chen that  she  was  entitled  to
      reside as a dependant family member of   the  holder  of  a  right  of
      residence applying Article 10  of  Regulation  (EEC)  no.  1612/68  or
      Directive 90/360 as she was not dependent on her minor child (see para
      43 and 44 of the judgment).  The Court then continued:


         "45. On the other hand a refusal to allow  the  parent,  whether  a
         national of a member state or a national of a  non-member  country,
         who is the carer of a child to whom Article  18  EC  and  Directive
         90/364 grant a right of residence, to reside with that child in the
         host member state, would deprive the child's right of residence  of
         any useful effect.  It is clear that enjoyment of a young child  of
         a right of residence necessarily implies that the child is entitled
         to be accompanied by the person who is his, or her,  primary  carer
         and accordingly that the carer must be in a position to reside with
         the child in the  host  member  state  for  the  duration  of  such
         residence (see mutatis mutandis,  in  relation  to  Article  12  of
         Regulation (EEC) no. 1612/68 Baumbast & R  v  SSHD  case  C-413/99)
         [2002] ECR 1-7091[2003] INLR1 para 71-75 ).


         46. For that reason alone,  where,  as  in  the  main  proceedings,
         Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 grant a right to reside  for  an
         indefinite period in the host member state to a young minor who  is
         a national of another member state, those same provisions  allow  a
         parent who is that minor's primary carer to reside with  the  child
         in the host member state.


         47.  The answer to be given to the national court must,  therefore,
         be that in circumstances  like  those  of   the  main  proceedings,
         Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 confer upon a young minor who is
         a national of a member state, is covered  by  appropriate  sickness
         insurance and is in the care of a parent who  is  a  third  country
         national having sufficient resources for that minor not to become a
         burden on the public finances of the host member state, a right  to
         reside  for  an  indefinite  period  in  that   state.    In   such
         circumstances that the same provisions allow a parent who  is  that
         minor's primary carer to reside with the child in the  host  member
         state."

  26. In Chen itself the questions posed to the Court of Justice concerned a
      right of residence as at  the  material  time  all  the  parties  were
      resident in the UK.  However, Article 18.1 covers both  the  right  to
      reside freely within the territory of a member state and the right  to
      move to it.  In both cases "subject to the limitations and  conditions
      laid down in this Treaty and  by  the  measures  adopted  to  give  it
      effect.


  27. Since Chen the measures adopted to give effect to Article  18  include
      EP and Council Directive  2004/38/EC the material provisions of  which
      read as follows:

        "Article 1: Subject


        This Directive lays down:
             a) The conditions governing the exercise  of  their  right  of
                free movement in residents  within  the  territory  of  the
                member states by union citizens and their family members;
             b) The right of permanent residence in the  territory  of  the
                member states for union citizens and their family members;
             c) The limits placed on the rights set out in (a) and  (b)  on
                grounds  of  public  policy,  public  security,  or  public
                health.


            Article 5: Rights of Entry

             1. Without prejudice to the  provisions  on  travel  documents
                applicable to national border controls, member states shall
                grant union citizens leave to enter their territory with  a
                valid identity card or  passport  and  shall  grant  family
                members who are not nationals of a member  state  leave  to
                enter their territory with a valid passport.  No entry visa
                or equivalent formality may be imposed on union citizens.


             2. Family members who are not  nationals  of  a  member  state
                shall only be required to have an entry visa in  accordance
                with Regulation EC No. 539/2001 or where appropriate,  with
                national  law.   But  the  purposes   of   this   directive
                possession of a valid residence card referred to in Article
                10  shall  exempt  such  family  members  from   the   visa
                requirement. Member states shall grant such  persons  every
                facility to obtain the necessary visas.  Such  visas  shall
                be issued free of charge as soon as  possible  and  on  the
                basis of an accelerated procedure.  ...
             4.  Where a Union citizen or a family member who is not a
               national of a member state, does not have the necessary
               travel documents or, if required, the necessary visas the
               member state concerned shall, before turning them back, give
               such persons every reasonable opportunity to obtain the
               necessary documents or have them brought to them within a
               reasonable period of time or to corroborate or prove by
               other means that they are covered by t he right of free
               movement and residence. ...
            Article 6: Right of Residence for up to 3 months

             1. Union citizens shall have the right  of  residence  on  the
                territory of another member state for a  period  of  up  to
                three months without  any  conditions  or  any  formalities
                other than the requirement to hold a valid identify card or
                passport.
             2. The provisions to paragraph 1 shall also  apply  to  family
                members in possession of  a  valid  passport  who  are  not
                nationals of a member state, accompanying  or  joining  the
                Union citizen.


   The case of W (China)


  28.  In the case of W (China) the Court of Appeal had to consider  whether
      the AIT had been correct to conclude that on the facts  of  that  case
      there was no right of residence under Art 18 and Directive 360/90.

  29.  Having quoted the relevant legislative provisions applicable  at  the
      time Buxton LJ  giving the leading judgment of the Court  observed  as
      follows:
         "4. The right of movement and residence of a citizen of the  EU  is
         therefore subject to two  pre-conditions:  (i)  cover  by  sickness
         insurance  in  respect  of  all  risks  in  the  host  state;  (ii)
         possession of resources sufficient to avoid becoming  a  burden  on
         the social assistance system of the host state. Those  are  logical
         requirements for the exercise of the right under article 18. The EU
         citizen does not need to rely on article 18  in  order  to  install
         himself in another Member  State  unless  he  is  not  an  economic
         operator, assumed to contribute to the economy of the  host  state.
         If he is in that position, he will have a right  of  entry  in  any
         event either under Article 39 as a worker; or under Article 43 as a
         self-employed  person;  or  under  Article  49  as  a  provider  of
         services. Those who do not make that contribution, the  Article  18
         cases, are thus reasonably required to  establish  that  they  will
         nonetheless not be a burden on the host state.
         5.  Directive 90/364 is drafted with an adult citizen in mind,  and
         those covered by article 1.2, as dependents of the EU citizen,  are
         the typical dependents  of  an  adult.  In  Chen  the  ECJ  had  by
         jurisprudence to expand that regime to accommodate the case  of  an
         infant EU citizen who could  not  assert  her  rights  without  the
         presence  and  assistance  of  people  who,  far  from  being   her
         dependents, were,  as  it  was  put  in  argument  before  us,  her
         custodians. That case  also  concerned  a  child  born  to  Chinese
         parents in territory to which the Republic of Ireland extended  the
         jus soli, and therefore a citizen of the EU. Her mother  sought  to
         establish herself in the United Kingdom on the basis of  being  the
         custodian of the child. An important difference  between  Chen  and
         our case was that it was not argued in Chen that  the  presence  of
         the mother in the United Kingdom was otherwise unlawful.
        6. The ECJ recognised that the mother could not take  advantage  of
        article  1.2  of       Directive  90/364  because  she  was  not  a
        dependent of her child. The court however  held, at its �45, that:
             "A refusal to allow the parent, whether a national of a member
             state or a national of a non-member country, who is the  carer
             of a child to whom art 18EC and Directive 90/364 grant a right
             of residence, to reside with that child  in  the  host  member
             state would deprive the child's  right  of  residence  of  any
             useful effect. It is clear that enjoyment by a young child  of
             a right of residence necessarily implies  that  the  child  is
             entitled to be accompanied by the person who  is  his  or  her
             primary carer."
         That meant that the mother could enter in  that  capacity  and  for
         that  purpose  but,  as  the  court  also  held,  subject  to   the
         Directive's regime for the protection of the  host  state.  In  the
         specific case of Chen, therefore, the Court regarded it as relevant
         that the child had both health insurance and sufficient  resources,
         provided by her mother, not to become a burden on the host state.
        7.    The  ECJ  did  not  deal  specifically   with   whether   the
        accompanying carer or carers   needed to have    health  insurance,
        or sufficient resources so that they themselves,  as    opposed  to
        the child, did not become a burden on the host state.  However,  in
        both     those cases I with respect find compelling  the  treatment
        of the IAT at �� 14 and 16 of  its Determination:
             "As the Court pointed out in Chen, the accompanying parent  in
             circumstances like this is not claiming under  the  provisions
             of Article 1 of Directive 90/364 because  the  parent  is  not
             dependent upon  the  child.  It  therefore  follows  that  the
             Directive's requirements in respect of  medical  insurance  do
             not apply precisely to the accompanying parents. But, as  Chen
             establishes, the residence of the accompanying parents in  the
             Member State is simply a consequence of the child's right. And
             the  child's  right  is  a  right  to  reside  only  in   such
             circumstances  as  will  not  place  on  the  Member  State  a
             financial burden arising out of his residence. When the person
             exercising the right of residence is an adult, this result  is
             secured by the requirement that accompanying dependent  family
             members also have medical insurance. We think it inconceivable
             that a similar  requirement  does  not  apply  to  the  family
             members who accompany under the Chen  principle  and  are  not
             dependent on the person exercising the right of residence.  If
             it were otherwise, the exercise  of  the  right  of  residence
             would in fact impose a financial burden on the Member State.
         The next requirement we consider is that  of  sufficient  resources
         generally. Again, so far as Chen was concerned, there was no  doubt
         that the parents had sufficient resources for  themselves  and  for
         the child. The Court expresses the requirement in terms again based
         on Directive 90.364 that the accompanying parents have  "sufficient
         resources for that minor not to  become  a  burden  on  the  public
         finances of the host Member State". Again, it is not entirely clear
         whether the resources have to be sufficient to maintain  the  minor
         only or sufficient for the carer as well. We would apply  the  same
         reasoning as we have applied to medical insurance.  Article  90/364
         requires that the resources be sufficient for the person exercising
         the right of residence and all the  accompanying  dependent  family
         members; it is inconceivable that accompanying family  members  who
         are not dependent should not need to be properly supported; and, if
         they were not, the residence of the child would in practice  impose
         a burden on the public finances of the Member State because of  the
         parent's needs".
        8. I conclude therefore that the IAT was correct in holding that in
           order to fulfil the requirements of Directive 90/364 all of Q, W
           and  X  had  to  demonstrate  (i)  the  possession  of  sickness
           insurance; and (ii) sufficient resources  to  avoid  becoming  a
           burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom.  I
           consider in turn whether those requirements are indeed fulfilled
           in this case."
  30. Thus, it is clear in that case where there  was  no  health  assurance
      available to the parties, and so on the facts the first condition  for
      the existence of any entitlement was not made out for the child or the
      parents to achieve residence under EU law.


  31. As to the second, there was an issue as to whether W the carer  had  a
      right to work that could be the source of sufficient support  for  the
      child Q.  Buxton LJ continued at  [16] and said this:

         "As interpreted by the ECJ in Chen, the Article 18 right of  Q  and
         the associated  right  of  her  custodians  can  only  be  lawfully
         asserted under the strictly limited conditions imposed by Directive
         90/364. Those conditions  are  pre-conditions  not  merely  to  the
         exercise but also more fundamentally to the existence of the  right
         in any particular case: article  18  stating  in  terms  that  "the
         right" to move  and  reside  is  subject  to  the  limitations  and
         conditions  laid  down  in,  e.g.,  Directive  90/364.  The   right
         accordingly does not exist  if  Q  does  not  have  access  to  the
         relevant resources. There is no suggestion that  under  Article  18
         the host state is obliged to take positive steps to make  resources
         available to an entering EU citizen: Mr  Gill  understandably  drew
         back from any suggestion that the state would be obliged to provide
         support for  a  custodian  without  resources  in  the  shape,  for
         instance, of disablement benefit. By the same token, the  state  is
         not obliged to adjust its domestic law in order to  make  available
         to the EU citizen resources that would not otherwise  be  available
         to him, so that he can fulfil the pre-condition to the existence in
         his case of the article 18 right: the  right  which  has  to  exist
         before he can require the state  to  adjust  its  domestic  law  in
         deference to it."

            (emphasis supplied)

  32. Sedley LJ concurring in the result said:

         "Neither Directive 90/364 nor  the  Immigration  Rules  provide  in
         terms for the situation which is before the court. They provide for
         derivative  rights,  on  specified  conditions,  for  spouses   and
         dependent relatives of EU nationals; but since the  applicants  are
         in neither of these classes in relation to their daughter,  neither
         source of law applies to them. Equally, however, neither parent has
         any personal right of entry or abode here. Their claim is  made  in
         right of their  child:  her  rights,  they  contend,  can  only  be
         exercised if they are able to exercise them with and  for  her.  In
         point of fact, this is undoubtedly the case. But in  point  of  law
         the child's own right, which is the right given by Art.  18  EC  to
         reside here and not any of the separate Treaty rights to work here,
         is itself qualified by a  dual  requirement:  self-sufficiency  and
         health insurance."

  33.  The case of Liu merely affirms the decision in W (China) in the  face
      of an attempt to distinguish it. It is perfectly right to  note  these
      decisions of the Court of Appeal are binding on the UTIAC. It has  not
      been suggested that they have been doubted by subsequent decisions  of
      the ECJ or superior court in the UK.

Does M have an EU right in this case?

  34.  The ECO's argument in the submissions of 2 June 2010 focuses  on  the
      words used     by  Sedley LJ in his concurring judgment:


         "It is submitted that because his Lordship  observed  that  neither
         parent has a personal right of entry or abode  here,  there  is  no
         right of entry to the UK in EU law at all".


      In my judgement  that  is  no  answer  to  M's  contentions.  And  the
      submission fails to engage with what the Court of Appeal  was  stating
      to be the law.


  35.  In the present case, C has a right of entry simply by virtue  of  her
      EU nationality. On arrival she can enter for 3 months irrespective  of
      health insurance or other  issues  relevant  to  a  longer  stay  (see
      Article 6 of the Citizens  Directive.)   In  fact,   as  she  will  be
      joining the household of a British citizen with well  paid  employment
      and has BUPA health insurance she could  demonstrate  both  conditions
      that the child in Chen could not, as does her mother  M. It has  never
      been suggested that C did not have a right of  entry  in  the  present
      case.  It is equally clear as the IJ found that C's right of residence
      in EU law is dependent on her mother being admitted to the UK  as  her
      mother is her primary carer. Thus the issue  that  led  to  the  claim
      being rejected in W (China) does not arise in the  present  case.  The
      child is self sufficient and has a right of entry.

  36.   Those being the relevant facts, it is necessary  to  decide  whether
      the ECJ or  the CA   has considered whether a person in  the  position
      of M has a right of entry under EU law deriving from  her   child's  C
      right to have her rights of entry made effective.

  37.  The ECJ in Chen says in terms at  [46]  that  Art  18  and  the  then
      applicable Directive   890/364) allow a parent  who  is  that  minor's
      primary career to reside with the child in the host Member  State.  If
      it those provisions that allow the parent's  residence  it  is  not  a
      discretion to permit residence to be found  in  national  law  or  the
      Immigration  Rules.  The  reference  to  "allow"  is  a  reference  an
      entitlement to do so if the conditions are met. The  Court  made  this
      clear in the preceding paragraph [45] where it said it is  clear  that
      enjoyment by a young child of a right of residence necessarily implies
      that the child is entitled to be accompanied by the person who is  his
      or her primary carer. A child's  entitlement  cannot  be  defeated  by
      discretionary provisions of purely national law.

  38. Buxton LJ in W (China) commented on what this meant when  he  said  at
      [6] that the mother could enter in that capacity and for that  purpose
      but subject to the Directive's regime for the protection of  the  host
      state.   The Directive provides for a public policy derogation from EU
      rights that it is common ground are not in play here.  If  it  is  the
      Directive that conditions the ability to enter and reside  it  is  not
      the Immigration Rules.  In my judgment Buxton LJ was equally clear  in
      using the language of rights if the qualifying conditions were met  by
      the accompanying parent  in  the  passages  at  [16]  that  have  been
      emphasised in paragraph [30] of this determination.

  39.   There is nothing in Sedley LJ's concurring remarks that alters  this
      in any way (even if they other members of the court had  adopted  them
      which they did not). It is perfectly true that the right  given  to  a
      person who meets the qualifying conditions is  not  a  personal  right
      spelt out in the Treaty or the Directives but a  right  deriving  from
      the right  of  the  EU  citizen.   There  is  nothing  novel  in  that
      observation: similar derivative rights were engaged in the cases of C-
      413/99 Baumbast and R. A derivative right is no less a  right  if  the
      conditions for existence are made out.

  40. Whereas in W China the conditions for the existence of the right  were
      not made out, on the IJ's findings in  the  present  case  they  were.
      Accordingly it is apparent as a matter of law  that  having  satisfied
      the factual conditions for its existence M enjoys a  derivative  right
      of entry to make C's right of entry effective. This is a  right  given
      by EU law. It is a directly effective right, that exists independently
      of the terms of the EEA Regulations and the Immigration Rules that  in
      any event must be interpreted compatibly  with  EU  law  where  it  is
      possible to do so.

Conclusions

  41.  In my judgment, the IJ was right as a matter  of  law  to  reach  the
      conclusions he did as to M's EU right of residence on the basis of the
      facts he found proved in the appeal.  Accordingly this is a case where
      the ECO's appeal must be dismissed because there was no material error
      of law enabling the UT to remake the decision.


  42.  For ease of  reference  I  shall  refer  to  my  conclusions  in  the
      associated appeals that will be decided separately:

           i. I have decided that  the  fianc�  appeal  must  be  dismissed
              because the material time for assessment of the facts was the
              date of the ECO decision. At that time  P  was  not  free  to
              marry, and it could not be accurately predicted that he would
              be free to marry within the six months given to  the  parties
              to marry in such cases.  It was speculation when he would  be
              free to marry that the IJ should not have engaged in or  been
              invited to.
          ii. M's appeal against the refusal of an EEA family permit on the
              basis of being a dependant member of  C's  family  should  be
              dismissed for the  same  reason  as  the  similar  claim  was
              dismissed in the case of Chen.  M is not dependent on  C;  it
              is the other way around.  I note however  that  this  outcome
              has nothing to do with the requirement for  M  and  C  to  be
              residing together in another EU state prior to  admission  to
              the UK.  In the light of the learning summarised by the Court
              of Appeal in its decision in Pedro v Secretary of  State  for
              Work and Pensions [2009] EWCA Civ 1358 14  December  2009  it
              appears that there is no such requirement under the  Citizens
              Directive. However this Tribunal is concerned  with  deciding
              appeals in individual cases and not with claims to amend  the
              Rules that is the subject of the  adjourned  judicial  review
              application that M is at liberty to restore if so advised.
         iii.  M's appeal against the refusal of an EU family permit raises
              further considerations as to the scope of  the  principle  in
              Carpenter and the application of the case law on the Citizens
              Directive. It is not suitable for  summary  determination  on
              the papers and is adjourned for a full hearing in due course.
              Whether M would wish to proceed with this appeal  if  she  is
              admitted pursuant to the decision in the present  case  is  a
              matter for her. It is now clear that P is free to  marry  her
              as his decree absolute terminating his previous marriage  was
              pronounced on 19 April 2010.

  43.  The fact that there are issues outstanding in another appeal  do  not
      prevent M's admission to the UK now pursuant to the decision of the UT
      in the present one. On the IJs findings M has had a derivative EC  law
      right that has not been recognised since August 2009.  The  fact  that
      EC rights are engaged as well as the interests of  the  child  C,  the
      enjoyment of family life between P and M and C and the anxious  health
      concerns of M make this a case where prompt decision making  from  all
      public authorities is required.


  44.  The IJ made no directions  to  give  effect  to  the  appeal.  In  my
      judgment, it is necessary to do so in the  light  of  the  unfortunate
      history of this case. I direct that M be granted the appropriate entry
      document promptly following promulgation of this  decision.  The  case
      requires priority for the reasons set out above.

  45.  Although for the purpose of enabling her to board  a  flight  to  the
      United Kingdom with C it makes little  material  difference  what  the
      document issued by the UK authorities is called, it should be  an  EEA
      family permit. This is a decision based on an EU law right  under  the
      Treaty and the Directive, the appropriate document is that referred to
      in national law for such purposes namely an EEA family  permit  issued
      under EU Rules. Its issue is  not  subject  to  the  discretionary  or
      mandatory grounds for refusal under paragraph 320  Immigration  Rules.
      An EU right can only be negated or restricted by EU grounds of  public
      policy that are not engaged here.

  46.  The IJ's decision to allow the appeal stands. I direct  that  an  EEA
      family permit be issued promptly on promulgation of this decision.



   The ECO's appeal is dismissed.
