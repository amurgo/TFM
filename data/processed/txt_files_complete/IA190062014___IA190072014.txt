                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of Judge  S  J  Pacey  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 14th November 2014.

 2. The Appellants are Nigerian citizens born 12th December 1978  and  12th
    January 1986 respectively.  On 15th  March  2014  the  first  Appellant
    applied for leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4  Student,  and  the
    second Appellant applied as his dependant.

 3. The applications were refused on 7th April 2014.  The first Appellant's
    application was refused with  reference  to  paragraph  245ZX(d)  which
    requires that he be awarded a minimum of 10 points  with  reference  to
    Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.  In giving reasons for refusal the
    Respondent contended that the first Appellant needed to  show  that  he
    had funds of �1,600  for  a  consecutive  28  day  period.   The  first
    Appellant had submitted a Santander bank statement  showing  a  closing
    balance on 17th March 2014, but the Respondent stated that funds  could
    not be taken into account after the  application  date  of  15th  March
    2014.  The Respondent's case was that  the  Appellant  needed  to  show
    evidence of funds for 28 days from 16th February  2014  to  15th  March
    2014, but on 16th February 2014 the bank statement showed a balance  of
    only �760.50.  Therefore the first Appellant had not demonstrated  that
    he had held the required level of funds for 28 consecutive days.

 4. The second  Appellant's  application  was  refused  with  reference  to
    paragraph 319C(b) because the first Appellant's  application  had  been
    refused.

 5. The Appellants appealed to the FtT requesting an oral hearing which was
    scheduled to take place on 30th October 2014.  However on 29th  October
    2014 the Appellants' solicitors faxed the Tribunal to indicate that the
    Appellants no  longer  required  an  oral  hearing  and  would  not  be
    attending, and written submissions dated 9th September 2014 were lodged
    with the Tribunal.

 6. The FtT considered those written submissions, together with submissions
    made on behalf of the Respondent and found that the first Appellant had
    not demonstrated that he held the required funds of �1,600 for a 28 day
    period from 16th February 2014 to 15th March 2014.   He  was  therefore
    not entitled to be  awarded  10  points  for  maintenance  pursuant  to
    paragraph 245ZX(d) and his appeal was dismissed under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Because the first Appellant's appeal was  dismissed  under  the
    rules, so was the second Appellant's appeal.

 7. The FtT considered Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention  on  Human
    Rights and concluded that there would be no breach of Article 8 if  the
    Appellants were removed from the UK, and  therefore  the  appeals  were
    dismissed on human rights grounds.

 8. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,
    relying upon three grounds which may be summarised as follows.

 9. Firstly it was contended that the FtT had erred in concluding that  the
    first Appellant had not supplied evidence  showing  that  he  held  the
    necessary funds for a 28 period.  It was contended that  there  was  no
    provision to prohibit a bank statement being dated after  the  date  of
    application.

10. Secondly it was contended that the FtT erred in failing  to  take  into
    account the bank statement on the basis  that  the  application  was  a
    points-based application,  and  section  85A(4A)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  allowed  the  Tribunal  to  consider
    evidence adduced by an Appellant only if it was submitted in support of
    and at the time of making the relevant application.  It  was  contended
    that this did not apply  because  in  this  case  in  addition  to  the
    decision to refuse to vary leave to remain, there  was  a  decision  to
    remove the Appellants, and the prohibition on considering evidence  not
    submitted with the application therefore did not apply.

11. Thirdly it was contended that the FtT had erred in considering  Article
    8 by relying upon Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC
    720.

12. Permission to appeal was refused by Judge Kamara of the FtT  who  found
    that the grounds amounted to no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings of the FtT, and the FtT had made findings properly open to  it
    on the evidence and the decision disclosed no arguable error of law.

13. The Appellants submitted a renewed application for permission to appeal
    which was considered by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Norton-Taylor  who
    considered grounds 2 and 3 to be unarguable and refused  permission  to
    appeal.

14. In relation to the first ground permission to appeal was granted on the
    basis  that  the  bank  statement  dated  17th  March  2015,   although
    postdating the making of the application, was before the Respondent  at
    the time that the application was decided. It  was  therefore  arguable
    that the bank statement should have been considered by the FtT, and  if
    that statement had been considered, it arguably  could  have  satisfied
    the maintenance requirement under Appendix C.

15. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    dated 14th May 2015 pursuant to  rule  24  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 submitting that the FtT had not erred,  and
    that paragraph 1A(a) of Appendix C specifies  that  an  applicant  must
    have the funds specified in the relevant part of Appendix C at the date
    of the application.

16. The Tribunal issued directions making  provision  for  there  to  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether  the  FtT  decision
    contained an error of law such that it should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

17. Mr Ahmed relied upon the Ground of Appeal  upon  which  permission  had
    been granted, and indicated that he had no further oral submissions  to
    make on that issue.

18. Mr Ahmed then proceeded to make further submissions, explaining that he
    had just had a conference with the first Appellant, who  had  told  him
    that the deposit of funds into the Santander account was in  fact  made
    over a weekend, but that the deposit did not show until  17th  February
    2014 which was a Monday.  It therefore appeared, if this  was  correct,
    that the funds in excess of �1,600 had been in the bank  account  prior
    to 17th February 2014.  Mr Ahmed pointed out that this information  had
    not been before the FtT, and then submitted  to  the  Tribunal  and  Mr
    Mills, the Supreme Court decision Mandalia [2015] UKSC 59 and indicated
    that there was also a fairness issue to be considered.

19. There had been no skeleton argument submitted raising these issues, and
    therefore both the Tribunal and Mr Mills were  taken  by  surprise.   I
    enquired of Mr Ahmed whether he was seeking  permission  to  amend  the
    Grounds of Appeal and he indicated that he was.  Mr Ahmed  pointed  out
    that the Secretary of State had never contacted the Appellant to  point
    out that he had only held the necessary funds for 27 days, and the  FtT
    had not considered evidential flexibility and fairness.

20. Mr Mills objected to the application to amend the  grounds,  which  was
    made verbally and not in writing.  Mr Mills contended  that  permission
    had been granted for the Upper Tribunal to  consider  one  ground,  and
    that was the only ground which should be considered.

21. I refused Mr Ahmed's application to raise new issues at the hearing.  I
    could see no merit in the point made by the first Appellant to Mr Ahmed
    that he had submitted funds into his Santander account over  a  weekend
    but they had not been credited until Monday 17th February 2014.  It was
    not a point that had been made to  the  Secretary  of  State  when  the
    application for leave to remain was made.  It was not a point that  was
    made in the  written  submissions  to  the  FtT.   There  had  been  no
    application for permission to appeal on this ground either to  the  FtT
    or the Upper Tribunal.  No skeleton argument had been submitted.

22. Even if the funds had been submitted over a weekend, it would not  have
    assisted the first Appellant, as it was accepted that he had  made  his
    application on 15th March 2014, and he would have still needed to  show
    that he had �1,600 in his account for 28 days which would include  16th
    February.

23. With reference to fairness and evidential flexibility, these again were
    not issues that were raised either in the application to the  Secretary
    of State, or before the FtT.  There was no application  for  permission
    to appeal on these  issues,  made  either  to  the  FtT  or  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I did not  see  merit  in  the  point,  and  noted  that  in
    Mandalia, the Supreme Court were dealing with an application made prior
    to the introduction of paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules, and it
    was not suggested in this case, that  a  document  in  a  sequence  was
    missing.

24. For the above reasons, I refused the application to amend  the  Grounds
    of Appeal so that the above issues could be considered.

25. I then heard submissions from Mr Mills in relation to  the  one  ground
    upon which permission had been granted.  Mr Mills  submitted  that  the
    judge granting permission to appeal had  misunderstood  the  provisions
    contained  within  Appendix  C.   The  FtT  had  dismissed  the   first
    Appellant's appeal because he had not proved that he held the  required
    funds for 28 days prior to the date of application.  The bank statement
    dated 17th March 2015 did not assist the Appellant, as the date of  the
    bank statement postdated the application, and  what  was  relevant  was
    that the Appellant had not proved that he had available �1,600  at  the
    date of application, and had done so for 28 consecutive days.   It  was
    for this reason that the FtT had dismissed the appeal, and the decision
    of the FtT disclosed no error of law.

26. At the conclusion of submissions I reserved my decision.

My Findings and Conclusions

27. I find the FtT did not materially err in law for the following reasons.

28. It is common ground between the parties that the application for  leave
    to remain was made on 15th March 2014, and  that  the  first  Appellant
    needed to show that he had funds of �1,600.

29. I set out below paragraph 1A(a) and (c) of Appendix C;

         1A   In all cases where an applicant is required to  obtain  points
             under Appendix C, the applicant  must  meet  the  requirements
             listed below:
             (a)  The applicant  must  have  the  funds  specified  in  the
                  relevant  part  of  Appendix  C  at  the   date   of   the
                  application;
             (c)  if the applicant is applying as  a  Tier  4  Migrant  the
                  applicant must have had the funds referred to in (a) above
                  for a consecutive 28 day period of time.

30. The first Appellant needed to show that he had �1,600 available at 15th
    March which was the date of application, and that those funds had  been
    available for 28 consecutive days, from  16th  February  2014  to  15th
    March 2014.

31. The first Appellant's Santander account shows  that  on  10th  February
    2014 he had funds of �760.50.  The next entry is  dated  17th  February
    2014 and shows a deposit of �1,000 giving a total of �1,760.50.

32. The FtT was therefore correct to find in paragraph 8  of  the  decision
    that the 28 day period ran from 16th February 2014 to 15th March  2014,
    and the necessary level of funds (a minimum of �1,600) was not shown in
    the bank  account  until  17th  February  2014.   Therefore  the  first
    Appellant had not satisfied the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    and could not rely upon holding funds for a consecutive 28  day  period
    which ended on a date after he had submitted his application.

33. The FtT committed no error of law in dismissing the Appellants' appeals
    under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.  The appeals are dismissed.



Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
