                                 KOYES AHMED
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr N McCluskey, instructed by Schneider Goldstein,
                 Immigration Consultants, London

For the Respondent:  Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Doyle, promulgated on 23 February 2017.

 2. The respondent did not accept that the appellant is gay, but the  judge
    did.

 3. The judge was not assisted by the fact  that  the  decision  letter  is
    framed on the view that the appellant is  not  gay,  and  so  does  not
    consider the potential consequences if his is gay;  the  absence  of  a
    presenting officer in the FtT; and the apparent  concentration  of  the
    appellant's efforts on other aspects of  the  case.   However,  it  was
    common ground that the judge did not conduct the required analysis,  as
    explained in HJ and HT [2010] UKSC 31.

 4. Reference may also usefully be made to X,  Y  and  Z  [2014]  QB  1111,
    founded upon in the grounds, and to LC (Albania) [2017] EWCA  Civ  351,
    decided only recently.

 5. The resolution of the case was agreed as follows.  The decision of  the
    FtT is set aside. Its findings of individual fact stand, to the  extent
    that his claim on political grounds is not credible, and that he  is  a
    gay man.

 6. The nature of further fact-finding and analysis required is  such  that
    it is appropriate in terms of section 12(2)(b)(i) of the  2007  Act  to
    remit the case to the FtT for further hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Doyle.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
