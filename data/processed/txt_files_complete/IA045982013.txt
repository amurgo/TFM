                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant   against a determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Boyd)  promulgated  on  15th  July  2013  by  which  he  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  refuse
    him leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 2. The Appellant entered the UK as a student in May 2010 with leave  until
    30th August 2012.  He applied in time for further leave to remain as  a
    student.  His application was refused, purely on financial grounds,  on
    28th January 2013.  He appealed that decision.

 3. The Appellant had elected and paid for his appeal to be dealt  with  on
    the papers.  It was dealt with  and  dismissed  in  April  2013.   That
    decision was however set aside under Rule 60 as the Appellant  had  not
    been notified that the case was to be decided or given the  opportunity
    to adduce evidence.  Thus the matter was placed before Judge Boyd as  a
    paper case in July 2013.

 4. In his determination Judge Boyd noted the Appellant had lodged a bundle
    of documents including bank  statements.   The  Judge  noted  that  the
    Appellant had only lodged copy bank statements in relation to  his  own
    bank account with Lloyds Bank and said that in any event those were not
    produced to the Secretary of State  and  so  did  not  take  them  into
    account.

 5. The Appellant argues that the statements were sent to the Secretary  of
    State and the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was mistaken about which
    documents were submitted.

 6. It is the case that electing to have  his  appeal  dealt  with  on  the
    papers was a bad decision by the Appellant as it is far from clear from
    the file which documents were submitted to who and when.  The Appellant
    says that his bank statement was sent to the Secretary  of  State  with
    his application.  I am satisfied that due to  a  mistake  of  fact  the
    First-tier Tribunal made an error of law.  As the  issue  of  the  bank
    statements and the available finances are central to the appeal  I  set
    aside the determination and redecide it.

 7. Mr Tufan noted that the application indicated that  the  Appellant  had
    the necessary �1600 required by the Immigration Rules but there were no
    copy bank statements  on  the  file  and  the  refusal  refers  to  the
    Appellant having only � 299.  That is the sterling  equivalent  of  the
    lowest balance during the relevant  period  shown  in  the  Appellant's
    father's bank statement.  That document is in the Home Office file  and
    seemingly therefore was the only evidence of finance taken into account
    by the Secretary of State.

 8. I have copy statements from the Appellant's account  with  Lloyds  Bank
    which cover the period in question and which have been authenticated by
    the bank.  Those statements indicate that they were issued  before  the
    Appellant submitted his application (13th August 2012).  They show that
    the Appellant, for the period in question had a balance far  in  excess
    of the required �1,600.

 9. It would appear that for  whatever  reason  those  did  not  reach  the
    decision maker.  However I take into account the Secretary  of  State's
    Evidential Flexibility Policy.

10. The Evidential Flexibility  Policy  is  referred  to  in  the  case  of
    Rodriquez (flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC). The  letter  of
    19th  May  2011  from  Jeremy  Oppenheim  setting  out  the  Evidential
    Flexibility Policy states:-

         "While we are confident PBS is accessible  and  understandable,  we
         also recognise there will always be the potential for human  error.
         UK Border Agency caseowners employ a measure  of  flexibility  when
         considering PBS applications. For  example,  caseowners  operate  a
         system which allows them to contact applicants to  request  further
         documentation or clarification where  appropriate.  In  addition  a
         validation stage is being trialled whereby applicants are contacted
         where mandatory evidence is missing and given  the  opportunity  to
         provide it before the application is rejected. These  policies  aim
         to provide excellent customer service  and  reduce  the  number  of
         applications falling for rejection."

11. The PBS Process Instruction entitled "Evidential Flexibility" published
    on 17th June 2011 sets out in the introduction two significant  changes
    to the original Evidential Flexibility instruction.  Firstly  the  time
    given to applicants to produce additional evidence has  been  increased
    from 3 working days to 7 working days and secondly,  there  is  now  no
    limit on the amount of information  that  can  be  requested  from  the
    applicant. However, requests for information should not be  speculative
    and there must be sufficient reason to believe any  evidence  requested
    exists.

12.  There is also a "Note" printed in bold to  the  effect  that  although
    deadlines are given to customers to respond  to  requests  for  further
    information, if additional information is  received  within  UKBA  (not
    necessarily  by  the  relevant  caseowner)  prior  to  the  case  being
    dispatched this must be taken into  account  by  the  caseworker.  This
    applies even if a refusal decision has been completed but the case  has
    not been dispatched on CID.

13. The procedure to be followed by caseowners is then detailed.  If  there
    is missing evidence or evidence that is not in an acceptable format the
    caseowner must ask himself whether the application  falls  for  refusal
    even if the missing information were provided. If it does not then  the
    caseowner must establish that the evidence  exists  or  that  there  is
    sufficient reason to believe that the information exists.  If  it  does
    then the caseowner must request it from the applicant.

14. It is clear that the evidence existed at the time in the  form  of  the
    Appellant's bank statements and it is also clear that the caseowner did
    not write to  the  Appellant  requesting  it.   Had  she  done  so  the
    Appellant  could  have  forwarded  it.   In  failing  to  request   the
    information the caseowner did not follow the  Policy  as  required  and
    thus the decision is unlawful.

15. I therefore allow the appeal to the extent that it is remitted  to  the
    Secretary of State to make a lawful decision  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules and the Evidential Flexibility Policy.  The  original
    bank statements are now on the Home Office file.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal containing an error of  law,  I
    set it aside and in remaking the appeal allow it to the extent referred
    to above.  I would add that my decision is in no way a criticism of the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The documents were confusing  and  the  Appellant
    could have resolved matters far sooner had he elected and paid  for  an
    oral hearing.
