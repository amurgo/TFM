Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Nicholson, instructed by Migra & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

The effect of paragraph 14 of Appendix J to the Immigration Rules is that
other than where an applicant has contracted weekly hours or is paid an
hourly rate, the appropriate salary for the purposes of paragraph 79 of
Appendix A is an applicant's gross annual salary paid by the sponsor
employer, subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 79(i)-(iii) of
Appendix A.

                            DECISION AND REASONS
                    (Delivered orally on 22 January 2016)

 1. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  28  September  2008  with
    entry clearance conferring leave as a student until  31  October  2011.
    Her leave was subsequently extended, initially as a Tier 1  Post  Study
    Migrant and thereafter as a Tier 4 (General) Student, until 24 February
    2015.  She made an in time application for a further extension  of  her
    leave, on this occasion as a Tier  2  Migrant.   This  application  was
    refused by the Secretary of State in a decision of 16 March 2015 and on
    the same date a decision was made to remove the appellant  pursuant  to
    s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. By paragraph 245HD(f)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  the  appellant  was
    required to obtain 50 points under Appendix A to the Rules.   She  was,
    however, awarded only 30 points thereunder by the Secretary  of  State,
    having been awarded zero points  under  the  category  of  "appropriate
    salary".  The Secretary of State gave  the  following  reasons  for  so
    concluding:

         "The salary included on your Certificate of Sponsorship is  not  at
         or above the appropriate rate  for  the  job,  as  specified  under
         Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

         In line with Appendix  A  with  reference  to  Appendix  J  of  the
         Immigration Rules we have therefore been unable to award points for
         appropriate salary.  The reasons for  this  decision  are  detailed
         below.   Your  Certificate  of   Sponsorship   states   that   your
         prospective employment most closely corresponds to occupation  code
         2126 of the Codes of  Practice  (which  are  also  specified  under
         Appendix J...)

         From 6 April 2013 a new policy on rates of pay for new entrants and
         experienced workers within the Codes of  Practice  was  introduced.
         The minimum acceptable rate of pay for a 39 hour working  week  for
         your prospective employment is  �22,600  per  annum  as  stated  on
         occupation code 2126 under the new entrant appropriate salary rate.



         Your Certificate of Sponsorship states that your  salary  would  be
         �22,600 per annum for a 40 hour week which equates to  �22,035  per
         annum for a 39 hour week.

         As your prospective salary is not at or above the minimum  rate  as
         specified in the Codes of Practice... under the new  entrant  level
         and you do not meet any exemptions as specified in  Appendix  A  of
         the Rules, we do not consider it to be at the appropriate rate  for
         the job."

    It is the lawfulness of this conclusion  that  formed  the  only  issue
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fowell and dismissed in a decision of 10 June 2015,  the
    material paragraphs of which read:

         "5.  In support of her appeal  Ms  Tukhas  has  obtained  from  her
             employer a new contract of employment dated 24 February  2015,
             providing for the same salary but specifying that  she  worked
             39 hours per week (although the hours to  be  worked  are  not
             specified).  The sponsorship licence was amended accordingly.

         6.   Although not expressly stated therefore, the  only  ground  of
             appeal is that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the
             immigration rules.

         7.   It is not sufficient however to satisfy the rules at the  date
             of the appeal.  The appellant needs to satisfy the Tribunal on
             the balance of probabilities that she did so at the  time  she
             made the application.  It is clear from her new evidence  that
             she did not."

 4. In her appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  appellant  asserts  that,
    contrary to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, she did  meet  the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  of  the  date   of   her
    application; it being submitted that the Secretary of  State   took  an
    unlawful approach to the issue of 'appropriate salary' in her  decision
    letter.

 5. Before the Upper Tribunal Mr Walker accepted this to be so and  further
    accepted that the appellant met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules at the relevant date.  We  consider  this  to  be  a  proper  and
    accurate concession for the following reasons.

 6. In our view the interpretation to be given to the Rules is clear.

 7. By  Paragraph  79  to  Appendix  A:  "The  points  to  be  awarded  for
    appropriate salary will be based on the applicant's gross annual salary
    to be paid by the sponsor", subject to specified conditions such as the
    non-inclusion of monies paid as travel and subsistence, which  are  not
    relevant to the instant case.  An applicant  who  has  an  'appropriate
    salary' will be awarded 20 points under Appendix A (Paragraph  76A  and
    Table 11A of Appendix A). No points are to be awarded for  'appropriate
    salary' if the salary referred to in paragraph 79 of Appendix A is less
    than the 'appropriate rate for the job'  as  stated  in  the  Codes  of
    Practice in Appendix J (see Paragraph 79B of Appendix A).

 8. Paragraph 14 of Appendix J reads:

         "Appropriate Salary Rate:

         Where these  Rules  state  that  an  applicant  must  be  paid  the
         appropriate rate for a job as set out in  this  Appendix  the  rate
         will be determined as follows:
         (a)  Where the most appropriate  match  for  the  job  in  question
             appears in Tables 1 to 5 or Table 9, the appropriate  rate  is
             as stated in the relevant Table (in this case the  appropriate
             rate is set out in Table 2 and is �22,600 per  annum  for  the
             relevant employment)...
          (e) The rates stated are per year and are based on the following
             weekly hours:
             (i)  Where the source is the Annual Survey of Hours and
                  Earnings, a 39-hour week; ...
        Where the applicant has contracted  weekly  hours  or  is  paid  an
        hourly rate, the rates must be pro-rated accordingly..."

 9. It is plain that the effect of paragraph 14 of Appendix J is that other
    than where an applicant has contracted  weekly  hours  or  is  paid  an
    hourly rate, the appropriate salary for the purposes of paragraph 79 of
    Appendix A is an applicant's gross annual salary  to  be  paid  by  the
    sponsor employer, subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 79(i)-
    (iii), which do not bear on the instant  case.   This  salary  will  be
    recorded on the Certificate of Sponsorship.

10. The fact that an applicant works in excess of 39 hours per week is only
    relevant if that applicant also has contracted weekly hours or is  paid
    an hourly rate. In these, and only these, circumstances an  applicant's
    gross annual salary is pro-rated for the purposes of  paragraph  79  of
    Appendix A.

11. In the  instant  appeal  the  appellant's  Certificate  of  Sponsorship
    identifies that she will be paid a  gross  annual  salary  of  �22,600.
    There is no admissible evidence before us which supports  a  contention
    that this applicant was contracted to work  weekly  hours  or  paid  an
    hourly rate. Consequently the applicant's appropriate  salary  for  the
    purposes of consideration under paragraph 79 of Appendix  A  is  to  be
    taken as being �22,600 per annum. The "appropriate rate  for  the  job"
    (paragraph 79B to Appendix A) is that set out in Table 2 of  the  Codes
    of Practice in Appendix J to the Rules (code 2126). In the instant case
    that is also �22,600.


12. The appellant is therefore entitled to an award of 20 points under  the
    'appropriate salary' head of Appendix A and accordingly is entitled  to
    50 points under Appendix A - the  Secretary  of  State  having  already
    accepted the appellant's entitlement to 30 points under the Certificate
    of Sponsorship head. Consequently, contrary to both the decision of the
    Secretary of State and the conclusion of the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    appellant meets the requirements of paragraph 245HD of the Rules.


13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to the contrary is  set  aside.
    We re-make the decision allowing the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of  law
capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal and is set aside.

We re-make the decision allowing the appellant's appeal on the  ground  that
the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  not  in  accordance   with   the
Immigration Rules.
