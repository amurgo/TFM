Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Sharif Hyder, legal representative with Simon
Noble Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tom Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, dismissing his appeal against the respondent's  decision
    to set  removal  directions  to  his  country  of  origin,  Bangladesh,
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006, after refusing his application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant.

 2. Before the First-tier Tribunal, Counsel (Ms D  Qureshi)  accepted  that
    the appellant could  not  bring  himself  within  the  Article  8  ECHR
    provisions of the Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended) and  the  appeal
    proceeded, by agreement, only in relation to Article 8 ECHR outside the
    Rules.

 3. The appellant and his wife are citizens of Bangladesh who at  the  date
    of decision had no children.

Adjournment application

 4. At the beginning of the hearing, there was an  application  to  adjourn
    the appeal hearing for 6 weeks,  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant's
    solicitors were recently instructed.  We have been told that there  has
    been a relatively recent  change  of  solicitors.  Mr  Hyder  told  the
    Tribunal that his firm, Simon Noble solicitors, were retained in  March
    2016.  Notice of  acting  was  filed  on  14  April  2016,  along  with
    notification of a change of address for the appellant.

 5. Mr Hyder explained that  Simon  Noble  solicitors  did  not  draft  the
    grounds of appeal, nor did  either  Mr  Hyder  or  his  firm  have  any
    involvement with the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

 6. Mr Wilding opposed the application for an adjournment on the basis that
    the appellant had had ample time to  ensure  that  his  representatives
    were properly instructed, between the grant of permission on 2 February
    2016 and the hearing today, 27 April 2016.

 7. We were not satisfied that this was a proper case for  an  adjournment,
    having regard to the overriding objective.  The appellant has  been  in
    possession of all the material facts throughout  and  his  decision  to
    change representatives close to the hearing date is not a  good  reason
    to adjourn that date.

 8. We refused to adjourn and proceeded to hear the appeal.

Background

 9. The appellant had been in the United Kingdom for less than 5  years  at
    the date of decision, always on a precarious basis, as a  student.   On
    the date of decision, 29 April 2014, the appellant was unmarried.

10. The respondent refused further leave to remain  because  the  appellant
    had not been studying at the educational institution for which  Tier  4
    (General) Student leave to remain had been given in 2010  and  had  not
    sought or received permission to  change  courses.   He  had  therefore
    breached the conditions of his leave to remain and paragraph 322(3) was
    engaged.

First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The First-tier Tribunal  accepted  (generously)  that  the  failure  to
    inform the respondent of the change of course was a genuine mistake and
    that the appellant had available to him a place on an MBA  postgraduate
    course run by the University of Sunderland, subject  to  his  obtaining
    further Tier 4 leave.

12. After the refusal decision, the appellant had married a fellow student,
    also a Bangladeshi citizen, in an Islamic ceremony on 20 May 2014.  She
    became pregnant during 2015 and was due to give  birth  in  mid-January
    2016.  The wife, who was  still  studying  and  managing  her  domestic
    tasks, was a healthy woman having a normal pregnancy.   She  wished  to
    complete her studies in the United Kingdom before the baby's birth: the
    appellant wished to remain here with her and  support  her  during  her
    pregnancy.  The respondent produced evidence that if the Appellant  had
    returned to Bangladesh to make an application for entry clearance, 100%
    of such applications were dealt with within 30 days  and  that  85%  of
    applications would be dealt with within fifteen days.

13. At paragraph 14 of his decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  the
    evidence of the appellant's wife that:

         "Her Tier 4 Student leave is valid until  March  2016  and  so  she
         proposes to have her baby in the United Kingdom and then return  to
         Bangladesh at the end of  March  2016  presumably  subject  to  any
         application by her husband for further student leave.   The  summer
         break for Ms Hira's course has just taken place so she would not be
         able to take time off to return  to  Bangladesh  with  her  husband
         whilst he applies for further leave."

14. The First-tier Tribunal noted the submissions of the Presenting Officer
    in  the  following  terms  at  paragraph  16  after  referring  to  the
    timescales which we have just mentioned:

         "She also referred me to the case of Koussa v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 618 in which  it  was  held
         that requiring a married couple to return to Mauritius in order  to
         make an application for further Tier 4 leave did not amount  to  an
         interference with their right to respect for  family  life  because
         they could enjoy family life together in Mauritius."

15. The First-tier Tribunal noted at [4] that it was not suggested that the
    appellant could bring himself within the Article 8 ECHR  provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules, or that the respondent  had  erred  in  applying
    paragraph 322(3) by reason of his breach of existing  conditions.   The
    Tribunal dismissed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR outside  the  Rules,
    noting that Article 8 should not be used as a shortcut to Tier 4  leave
    in these circumstances and that the appellant's removal  to  Bangladesh
    was not disproportionate, on the facts.  The Judge considered Part V of
    the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended)  and
    considered that the appellant's limited  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom was outweighed by the public interest in  the  maintenance  and
    operation of immigration controls.

16. The appellant appealed.

Permission to appeal

17. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the basis that the  First-
    tier Tribunal had failed to deal with his application within the Rules.
     He contended in his grounds of appeal that the First-tier Tribunal had
    failed to make  proper  credibility  findings;  that  his  reasons  for
    dismissing the appeal under  paragraph  276ADE  were  inadequate;  that
    there was no finding as to the degree of private life  enjoyed  by  the
    appellant; and generally, that the First-tier Tribunal  had  failed  to
    determine all grounds of appeal.  The grounds state, confusingly,  that
    'the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  must  record  the  reasons  for  not
    considering the live ground in fact the main ground of appeal if it  is
    formally abandoned by the appellant'.

18. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam, who
    considered that the First-tier Tribunal had arguably erred  in  law  in
    failing to determine the appeal against the paragraph 322(3) finding of
    breach of conditions under the Immigration Rules.

Rule 24 Reply

19. The respondent submitted a rule 24 Reply. The contents of the Reply are
    generic,  save for the following:

             "...It is submitted that  the  Judge  at  [3]  does  refer  to
             322(3), however it is cler from reading  paragraph  [17]  that
             the appellant wished the appeal to [be] looked at outside  the
             Rules and thus not pursue [the Tier 4 appeal],  therefore  the
             Judge did not err and the appellant has  failed  to  show  how
             this in any event what [sic] materially change the outcome  of
             the decision."

20. The respondent  relied  on  the  guidance  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    rationality, in VV (grounds of  appeal)  Lithuania  [2016]  UKUT  00053
    (IAC), as follows:

             "(1)    An application for permission to appeal on the grounds
             of inadequacy of reasoning in the decision of  the  First-tier
             Tribunal  must  generally  demonstrate  by  reference  to  the
             material and arguments placed before that  Tribunal  that  (a)
             the matter involved a substantial issue between the parties at
             first instance and (b) that the Tribunal either failed to deal
             with that matter at all, or gave reasons on that  point  which
             are so unclear that they may well conceal an error of law.

             (2)    Given that parties are under a duty to help further the
             overriding  objective  and  to  co-operate  with   the   Upper
             Tribunal, those drafting grounds of appeal (a) should  proceed
             on the basis that decisions of the First-tier Tribunal are  to
             be read fairly and as a whole and without excessive  legalism;
             (b) should not seek to argue that a  particular  consideration
             was not taken into account by the Tribunal when it can be seen
             from the decision read fairly and as a whole that it was  (and
             the real disagreement is with the Tribunal's assessment of the
             evidence or the merits); and  (c)  should  not  challenge  the
             adequacy of the  reasons  given  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
             without demonstrating how the principles  in  (1)  above  have
             been breached, by reference to  the  materials  placed  before
             that Tribunal and the important or substantial issues which it
             was asked to determine in that particular case.

             (3)    Where permission to appeal  is  granted,  an  Appellant
             should review whether the  grounds  of  appeal  are  genuinely
             arguable in the light of any response from the  Respondent  to
             the appeal. Whether or not the original grounds  are  pursued,
             it is generally inappropriate to seek to raise new grounds  of
             appeal close to the date of the hearing if, for example,  that
             would cause unfairness  to  a  Respondent  or  result  in  the
             hearing being adjourned."

Upper Tribunal hearing

21. Before the Upper Tribunal, the appellant produced a  witness  statement
    dated 26 April 2016, which consisted of 3 paragraphs only:

             "1. I am the appellant in this matter and the stated  contents
             are within my knowledge and true to the best of my belief.

             2.  I made an application for leave to remain  in  the  United
             Kingdom as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant,  which  was
             refused.  I appealed against that decision and the appeal  was
             heard on 06/02/2016 at Taylor House.  I was present during the
             whole process.  I can confirm that I and  my  lawyer  did  not
             withdraw the grounds of Tier 4 during the appeal process.

             3.  In the above circumstances, I pray to the Honourable Judge
             to allow my appeal and allow me to finish my  studies  in  the
             United Kingdom."

22. That is not supported by any evidence from Ms Qureshi, the  appellant's
    Counsel before the First-tier Tribunal.  When we asked  Mr  Hyder  what
    enquiries had been made as to Ms Qureshi's record of  the  proceedings,
    or her recollection of what occurred, he said that no attempt had  been
    made to contact her. We adjourned the appeal to the afternoon list,  to
    enable Mr Hyder to seek to  contact  Ms  Qureshi,  and  Mr  Wilding  to
    ascertain what records, if any, the Home Office Presenting Officer,  Ms
    Poultney, before the First-tier Tribunal had retained.

23. For  the  appellant,  Mr  Hyder's  contact  with  Ms  Qureshi  elicited
    confirmation that she had  recently  had  a  child  and  was  still  on
    maternity leave.  Unsurprisingly, Counsel stated  that  she  could  not
    immediately recall the case, and that she had returned all  her  papers
    to  her  instructing  solicitors.   She  did  say  that  she   had   no
    recollection of the appeal under the Immigration Rules being withdrawn.
      Her brief and any notes thereon were not before us.

24. For the respondent, Ms Poultney's file note  stated  clearly  that  the
    "sole issue was Art 8 outside the Rules, app conceded  that  the  Rules
    could not be met".

25. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's record of proceedings is  to  the  same
    effect:  at 10.05, the beginning of the hearing, he noted,  'Article  8
    only'. The appellant's submissions are recorded thus:

             "Unfortunate  situation.   Change  college.   Wife   pregnant.
             Given  length  of  time,  just  need  leave.    No   obstacle.
             [illegible] �5k course fees. No family.   [W's]  only  support
             husband.  Ill mother.  Family can't look after.  Visa process.
              Needs support, moral, emotional support - given short period.
               MBA  offer  there,  complete  course  with   qualifications.
             Private life engaged.  Nasim applies.  Paragraph 43.   Only  a
             few months.  Compelling given circumstances.  Didn't'  pursue.
             Only support is husband. Interfere  private/family  life:  not
             proportionate."

Discussion

26. The first question is what occurred before the First-tier  Tribunal  in
    relation to the concession. There is a conflict between the appellant's
    statement, prepared by solicitors who had not spoken to his Counsel  or
    consulted his previous solicitors' file, and the records of proceedings
    kept by the Judge and Home Office Presenting Officer.  The evidence  of
    Ms Qureshi obtained during the hearing really comes to this:   she  had
    recently had a child and did not remember what happened.

27. We are satisfied on the evidence before us, with the  greatest  respect
    to Ms Qureshi (who has more important matters on her mind and no  notes
    of the hearing before her to assist her) that the correct  position  is
    as recorded in the record of proceedings, that the hearing was  limited
    to Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, a concession having been made that
    the appellant could not bring himself  within  the  provisions  of  the
    Rules either as to the Tier 4 application (because of paragraph 322(3))
    or under paragraph 276ADE.

28. To the extent that permission was granted by reason of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's failure to consider  paragraph  322(3)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, it was granted in error since, by consent,  there  was  no  such
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

29. As regards Article 8 ECHR, the appellant by his Counsel conceded at the
    hearing that he could not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE.
    No submissions were made under that paragraph and the only matter under
    consideration was a short period of further leave until the end of  the
    appellant's wife's studies and the birth of their  child.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal did not err in finding that the pregnancy  of  a  healthy
    woman who was newly married was neither exceptional nor did it disclose
    compelling  compassionate  circumstances.    Our   primary   conclusion
    therefore is that the grounds of appeal disclose no material  error  of
    law by the First-tier Tribunal.

Rationality

30. As regards the reasons challenge in the  grounds  of  appeal,  we  have
    reminded ourselves of the standard  set  in  for  irrationality  and/or
    Wednesbury unreasonableness at paragraph 90.2 and 90.3 in the  judgment
    of Lord Justice Brooke in  R (Iran) & Ors v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982.  We do not find  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision is one which no reasonable Judge could  reach;
    we have no difficulty in understanding his reasoning;  and  it  is  not
    against the weight of the evidence.  No proper reason has been advanced
    for interfering with the First-tier Tribunal's reasons.

The Tier 4 application and Article 8 within the Rules

31. For the avoidance of doubt, we consider that even  if  the  appellant's
    challenge to the decision under paragraph 322(3) had  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal it would have failed.  There is no doubt  that  the
    appellant had changed course and done so without permission.  His  Tier
    4 application was lawfully refused  and  he  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for only a short time at the date of decision. He was unmarried
    then and had no pregnant wife.  There was  simply  no  case  under  the
    Rules in relation to the respondent's decision.  The concession,  which
    we find that Ms Qureshi did make on his behalf, was entirely proper.


DECISION

There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction was sought and we  see  no  reason  to  make  such  a
direction.
