                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Claire, Bernard Chill Axtell Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal.   I  shall  refer  to  the
    respondent as the appellant as he was before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    He is a citizen of India and his date of birth is 5 July 1992.

2.   The appellant made an application  to  vary  his  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student. The application was made on 26  September  2014  and
    the Secretary of State refused the application  in  a  decision  of  12
    November 2014  because  the  appellant  the  bank  statements  that  he
    submitted did not establish that he had funds  to  cover  the  required
    consecutive 28 day period.  The appellant appealed the decision of  the
    Secretary of State and his appeal was allowed by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Watt following a hearing on 24 July 2015.   The Secretary
    of State was granted permission by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Frankish on 26 November 2015.

3.      The appellant accepted that he did not have the necessary  funds  in
    his account for the required period. The judge considered his  evidence
    that he was granted a student visa in September 2011 which  was  for  a
    period of three years and that he commenced studying a  BA  in  Honours
    Business and Human Resources Management at the University of Portsmouth
    in September 2011.  The judge accepted  that  the  appellant  had  paid
    �7,500 to complete the first year  of  his  studies  and  that  he  had
    completed that year successfully.  She accepted  that  he  had  paid  a
    further sum of  �10,500 for the second year but had failed four modules
    which led to him having to repeat the second year  of  his  studies  in
    2013 and 2014, and having to pay a further sum of �4,500.

4.   The appellant did not pass all four resits but he was  invited  by  the
    university to complete these and he had to pay an additional sum.   The
    judge accepted that the appellant had in fact paid �26,167  in  tuition
    fees to the University of Portsmouth and the judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant had qualified to continue his studies and that  he  had  paid
    towards his tuition fees for the academic year 2014 and 2015.

5.   It was accepted by the appellant that he did  not  submit  evidence  as
    asserted by the decision maker but  this  was  an  honest  and  genuine
    mistake resulting from personal difficulties which  culminated  in  him
    experiencing problems concentrating.  He accepted that the  maintenance
    funds should have been placed into his bank account but  he  asked  the
    Tribunal  to  exercise  discretion  on  the  basis  of   his   personal
    circumstances.  He had to date spent a considerable amount of money  on
    his education here and he had in fact passed his exams  for  the  first
    and second year of studies.

6.   The judge accepted the appellant's evidence  having  found  him  to  be
    credible and reliable. and concluded at paragraph  13  that  discretion
    under the Immigration Rules should have been  exercised  in  his  case,
    bearing in mind that the appellant has now completed all  his  required
    exams for both the first and second years  and  will  be  entering  the
    third year of his studies in September 2015.

7.   The judge went on to allow the appeal "but  only  to  the  extent  that
    there would be  a reconsideration by the respondent of the  appellant's
    application".  The judge concluded as follows; "the appeal  is  allowed
    under the  Immigration  Rules  to  the  extent  that  there  should  be
    reconsideration by the respondent of the appellant's application".

8.   Mr Claire who represented the appellant before the First-tier  Tribunal
    represented the appellant at the hearing before me and  confirmed  that
    the appellant's case was presented on the basis that the appeal  should
    be allowed on compassionate grounds.

Error of Law

9.   The judge in my view materially erred.  The  judge  said  that  he  was
    allowing the appeal under the Rules but it is quite clear that  if  the
    appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules his  case  was  not
    presented on the basis that he could.  Paragraph 245AA was  not  argued
    by  the  appellant  and  in  any  event,  it  does  not  apply  to  the
    circumstances of his case.   His case was not  advanced  on  the  basis
    that the decision was not in accordance with the law and in  any  event
    the decision was clearly lawful.    If indeed what the  judge  intended
    to do was to allow the appeal under Article  8  however  this  was  not
    argued before the First-tier Tribunal.  No proper assessment  was  made
    under Article 8 in any event.  There was no evidence before  the  judge
    that the appellant has a family life here and he has been  here  for  a
    relatively short period of time, albeit that he is a genuine student.

10.  The decision of the Secretary  of  State  is  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules and it was not established on the evidence before the
    First-tier Tribunal that the decision is not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules or that it  breaches  the  appellant's  rights  under
    Article 8.   The judge does not have jurisdiction to allow  the  appeal
    on compassionate grounds outside of the Rules.

Notice of Decision

11.  The judge materially erred. This appeal cannot on any basis succeed.  I
    set aside the decision of Judge Watt and dismiss the appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8.  I conclude that the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State is in accordance with the law.

12.  No anonymity direction is made.
