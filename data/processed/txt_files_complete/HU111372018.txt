                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malik, promulgated on 24th September 2018, following a hearing at
    Manchester on 13th September 2018.  In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Canada and Mauritius,  and  was  born  in
    1991, and is a female.   She  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent dated 3rd May 2018 refusing her  application  for  leave  to
    remain under Appendix FM on the basis of her family and  private  life,
    in order to join her husband in the UK, Mr [HI], a British citizen, who
    is present and settled in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that she  had  applied  for  an
    extension of leave to remain in the UK, but had been delayed  by  three
    days on account of news from Mauritius, that her grandmother had fallen
    critically ill, which impacted upon her in such  a  way,  as  to  cause
    panic attacks.  The Appellant herself has a history  of  panic  attacks
    and this is borne out by medical evidence.  She had entered the UK on a
    Tier 4 (General) Student visa that was valid until 3rd  November  2015,
    after she had first entered on 1st October 2010.   She  had  then  been
    granted an extension of stay from 2015 onwards until  4th  March  2018.
    She should have made her application for further extension of leave  to
    remain on 3rd March 2018.

 4. However, on 1st March, she heard that her grandmother was very  ill  in
    Mauritius.  That was the date when she was expecting her February  2018
    bank statement to arrive  as  well.   The  news  of  her  grandmother's
    illness caused her great shock.  She went into panic attacks.   By  the
    time she did make her application, which was on 7th March, she was  out
    of time by three days.  She relies upon the  fact  that  she  did  have
    panic attacks (see paragraph 9 of her witness statement).   She  relies
    upon the medical evidence that she has had pre-existing  mental  health
    conditions (see page 78 of the Appellant's bundle).   She  relies  upon
    the specialist opinion in her favour that "she has been diagnosed  with
    panic attacks - which may well have affected her  ability  to  complete
    the application form".

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge had regard to much of the background evidence in  this  case.
    She noted that on 8th November 2015, the Appellant was found to have an
    illegal immigrant in the boot of her car at  Dunkirk,  following  which
    her leave was terminated but then reinstated.  Nevertheless, she was in
    a genuine and subsisting relationship with her partner.  There  was  no
    evidence of insurmountable obstacles upon her return to  either  Canada
    or Mauritius.  After her marriage in the United Kingdom in April  2014,
    she had made an application for leave to remain as  a  spouse  in  July
    2015, which was granted until 4th March 2018.  It was then that she had
    to make a renewal application for further leave.

 6. It is not in dispute that the Appellant's application had been  delayed
    by three days.  That being so, the  judge  had  regarded  to  paragraph
    39(e) (see paragraph 22 of the determination), where the judge sets out
    this provision in full, and highlights the fact that if  "there  was  a
    good  reason  beyond  the   control   of   the   applicant   or   their
    representative" which led to a delay then  this  could  be  overlooked.
    The judge observed  (at  paragraph  23)  that  the  Appellant  received
    information "that her grandmother was  critically  ill  and  that  upon
    being advised of this on 1st March 2018, such was her reaction to  this
    news, she was unable to submit her application by 4th March 2018".  The
    judge is also cognisant of the fact that there was  a  doctor's  letter
    issued in Mauritius on 1st March 2018,  which  was  included  with  the
    application, and this confirmed what was being alleged.

 7. The judge concluded, upon applying the discretionary basis of paragraph
    39(e), that the decision of the Respondent to reject  the  application,
    was not unreasonable, given the importance of the application, and  the
    deadline that the Appellant had to  reach.   The  Appellant  maintained
    that only one item was awaiting receipt by her, and this was eventually
    for February 2018.  Nevertheless, the judge's view was clear  that  the
    Appellant was not "prevented by reasons beyond her control  for  making
    the application before her leave expired" (paragraph 26).

 8. That left the other issues to be determined, and with regard  to  EX.1,
    and insurmountable obstacles, the judge observed that the Appellant was
    a Canadian national, and had lived in Canada  for  a  number  of  years
    raising her family,  and  her  husband  had  also  been  to  Canada  to
    celebrate their marriage, there was no reason why her right  to  family
    life could not be exercised in Canada.  Thereafter  full  consideration
    was given to Article 8 by the judge  but  it  was  concluded  that  the
    Section 117 considerations, with regard to the public interest and  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control,  meant  that  the  appeal
    could not succeed (see paragraphs 31, 32 to 33).

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to  have  regard
    to the Chikwamba principles where the House of Lords held that it would
    be a violation of the Appellant's Article 8 rights to  require  her  to
    leave the UK to make an out of  country  application.   This  had  been
    clarified subsequently by the court in Hayat [2011] UKUT  00444,  which
    refers to the legitimate objectives of immigration control.

11. The grounds also draw attention to the case of Beoku-Betts [2008]  UKHL
    39, which state sthat the rights of  the  Sponsor,  who  is  a  British
    citizen in this case, should also be given due weight, in terms of  his
    claim to a family life with his Appellant wife.  Reference is also made
    to the case of Chen [2015] UKUT 189, which makes it clear that  even  a
    temporary separation between a genuinely  married  couple,  can  engage
    Article 8 considerations.

12. On 31st December 2018, permission to appeal was granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that any  separation,  which  may  be  temporary,
    could arguably engage the principles in Chikwamba.  This may be so even
    if the reasons given by the Appellant  for  the  delay  in  making  her
    application were in fact untrue.



Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 8th March 2018,  Mr  Shwank,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, made the following two submissions, in  clear,
    careful, and attractive ways.

14. First, that there was no good reason for the judge not to  accept  that
    the discretion afforded by paragraph 39(e) was one that  would  lead  a
    reasonable decision maker to accept that the Appellant was justified in
    having her application taken into account if it was only late by  three
    days.

15. Second, that  regardless  of  the  application  of  the  discretion  in
    paragraph 39(e), the decision reached by the judge was disproportionate
    because it breached the Chikwamba principle.  Here, Mr Shwank  drew  my
    attention to the case of Hayat [2011] UKUT 00444, which stated that,

         "The significance of Chikwamba, however, is  to  make  plain  that,
         where the only matter weighing on  the  respondent's  side  of  the
         balance is the public policy of requiring a person to  apply  under
         the Rules from abroad, that legitimate objective  will  usually  be
         outweighed by factors  resting  on  the  appellant's  side  of  the
         balance." (paragraph 23).

16. This was a case,  where  the  Appellant  had  succeeded  considered  Mr
    Shwank, if the application had been made on time.  The  Respondent  was
    simply  requiring  the  Appellant  to  return  to  Canada  to  make  an
    application from  there.   Second,  in  any  event,  even  a  temporary
    separation between the parties, would, under the  principles  in  Chen,
    lead to an interference with family life.

17. For his part, Mr McVeety submitted that,  although  there  had  been  a
    letter earlier, to the effect that the grandmother was critically  ill,
    a subsequent letter on file makes is equally plain  that  she  was  not
    suffering from a terminal illness.  In any event, it was not clear  why
    the Appellant's husband, who was in the UK with her, did not assist  in
    making an application on time, so that it was not late by  three  days.
    The judge had not erred in law.  The only way in which the decision can
    be attacked is if the judge's conclusion is an error of law.  The judge
    concluded that there was no good reason and  that  was  the  conclusion
    that the judge was entitled to come to.

18. Second, the Appellant was only being asked to return to Canada to  make
    an application from there, and this is a country where there  would  be
    no insurmountable obstacles, no hardship, no violation of human rights,
    and the application  of  the  "Chen"  principles  does  not  come  into
    operation, because all the Appellant is being asked to do is to make an
    application in the normal manner, in circumstances where there  are  no
    "exceptional" reasons for her not doing so.

19. In reply, Mr Shwank submitted that the Appellant is not able to make  a
    subsequent application that easily.  What is being overlooked  here  is
    that the Appellant set up a  new  business  in  this  country  on  12th
    September 2018.  She has to wait for the requisite period of  time  for
    her accounts to arrive so that she can provide six months  of  evidence
    to show that she can furnish the necessary �18,600 financial  threshold
    requirement.  In these circumstances, she cannot leave her job  and  go
    to Canada to make an application.  In any event, her life  is  in  this
    country.  Her home is here.  Her friends are here.  She has a job here.
     She is receiving medical treatment in this country.  On  top  of  that
    she is married to a British citizen who is resident  in  this  country.
    This was not a "near miss" case.

20. This case was based upon the Chikwamba principles, and the  issue  here
    was whether the public policy requiring a person  to  apply  under  the
    Rules from abroad, should give weight to the Appellant's  side  of  the
    balance.   It  is  clear  that  the  Appellant's   circumstances   were
    considerable.  They did outweigh the public  policy  in  requiring  the
    Appellant to apply from abroad.  It also  needed  taking  into  account
    that the principle in Beoku-Betts required consideration to be given to
    the Sponsor's rights, as a British citizen,  who  was  living  in  this
    country, and was entitled to have his wife live with him here.

No Error of Law

21. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  I come  to  this  conclusion,  notwithstanding  Mr  Shwank's
    admirable efforts to persuade me otherwise.  This is a  case,  however,
    where the judge, as a fact-finding Tribunal, was entitled  to  come  to
    the conclusions that she did, on the basis of  the  analysis  that  she
    undertook, with full regard to the evidence  as  was  presented  before
    her.  That evidence included the claim  that  the  Appellant,  who  was
    awaiting her February bank statement, had to wait until 1st  March  for
    that statement to arrive, before the application could be made  by  3rd
    March 2018 (so as not to fall foul of the deadline date  of  4th  March
    2018).

22. On 1st March 2018, however, the Appellant  received  notification  from
    Mauritius that her grandmother was critically ill.  The  Appellant  who
    has a history of anxiety and mental health problems, as attested to  by
    supporting expert evidence, was so affected by this that she was unable
    to make this application.  However, the evidence that  appears  in  the
    Appellant's bundle (at page 17) only sees the expert refer to the  fact
    that  this  "may  well  have  affected  her  ability  to  complete  the
    application process".  It also does not account for why the Sponsor did
    not assist in making the application for the Appellant so that it could
    arrive on time.

23. Second, as far as  the  general  Chikwamba  and  Razgar  arguments  are
    concerned, the judge proceeds  to  address  these  from  paragraphs  27
    onwards, and follows the  steps  logically,  taking  into  account  the
    Section 117B considerations, before concluding that:

         "There is nothing to suggest he [the Sponsor] would  be  unable  to
         sponsor the Appellant's application in due course or that the  time
         taken to do  so  would  be  disproportionate.   They  can  maintain
         contact in the interim and  her  husband  can  also  visit  Canada"
         (paragraph 33).

    That conclusion was available to the judge to arrive on  the  facts  of
    this case.  The decision cannot, for this reason be regarded as falling
    into an error of law.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

25. No anonymity direction is made.

26. The appeal is dismissed.
