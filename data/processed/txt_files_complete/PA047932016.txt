Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Parkin of Counsel instructed by David Wyld & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal on 11 October 2016  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal to grant him asylum,  humanitarian  protection  or
    leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant came to the United Kingdom on an unknown date between May
    2011 and September 2012 with Tier 4 (General) Student leave,  but  does
    not appear to have studied.  He made no further attempt  to  regularise
    his stay.  He did however obtain a national insurance card and  an  NHS
    card in the name of Aftab Rafik to which he is not entitled,  Mr  Rafik
    having been previously naturalised in the United Kingdom.

 3. When the deception was  discovered,  the  appellant  was  arrested  for
    having attempted to obtain leave to remain by deception,  detained  and
    served with immigration  notices.   On  17  November  2015  he  claimed
    refugee protection, which the respondent refused.

First-tier Tribunal proceedings

 4. On 12 May 2016, the appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    giving no address where he could be contacted, and  no  email  address.
    The application requested an oral hearing, but  the  appellant  or  his
    representatives did not pay the ï¿½140 fee.

 5. On 13 May 2016, the First-tier Tribunal wrote to David  Wyld  &  Co  at
    their address for service, at 51a Marlborough  Road,  London  E18  1AR,
    pointing out the error and asking for the fee position to be rectified.
     The letter was served on the appellant at his solicitors'  address  as
    well as on the solicitors, there being no home address provided for the
    appellant.  On 27 May 2016, the First-tier Tribunal received  a  credit
    or debit card payment for the correct sum from the solicitors.   It  is
    clear, therefore, that the letter of 13 May 2016 was received  at  that
    address.

 6. On 9 June 2016, the Tribunal served on David Wyld  &  Co,  and  on  the
    appellant, a combined notice  of  pre-hearing  review  and  substantive
    hearing.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  served  both  copies  at  the  51a
    Marlborough Road address, as the appellant still had not  provided  any
    other address for service upon him.  The notice contained both the date
    of the pre-hearing review and the date of the full hearing, should  the
    matter proceed that far.  The notice of hearing included a reply notice
    which the solicitors never returned.

 7. On the same date, 9 June 2016, the  First-tier  Tribunal  also  sent  a
    letter to the  David  Wyld  &  Co  address  of  51a  Marlborough  Road,
    addressed  both  to  the  appellant  and  the  solicitors,  asking  for
    documents  including  a  paginated  and  indexed  bundle  and   witness
    statements of the evidence  to  be  called  at  the  hearing.   Nothing
    happened.

 8. On 27 September 2016, the pre-hearing  review  was  considered  on  the
    papers, and the First-tier Tribunal sent out directions and a  reminder
    of the date of the substantive hearing, again to 51a  Marlborough  Road
    for both the appellant and his solicitors.

 9. On 3 October 2016, the First-tier Tribunal booked  an  interpreter  for
    the hearing.  On 4 October 2016, the First-tier Tribunal  received  the
    respondent's hearing bundle and the next day it was linked to the file,
    ready for the 11 October 2016 hearing. The  appellant's  solicitors  in
    the grounds of appeal say that they received it on 30  September  2016:
    it does not appear that they took any steps to file a bundle  of  their
    own or to check whether there was a hearing listed, and if so, when.

10. On 11 October 2016, the substantive hearing took place  at  the  Hatton
    Cross  hearing  centre,  in  the   absence   of   any   appearance   or
    representation on behalf of  the  appellant.   No  application  for  an
    adjournment was received and no explanation for the appellant's absence
    and that of his solicitors. There was a Home Office Presenting  Officer
    present. At paragraph 12 of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision,
    he recorded that the appellant did not appear, that  no  documents  had
    been filed on his behalf, and that the Tribunal  waited  until  1  p.m.
    before proceeding to determine the appeal.   The  Judge  was  satisfied
    that a notice of hearing had been issued both to the appellant and  his
    solicitors, and dealt with the appeal on the  papers.  The  appeal  was
    dismissed.

Permission to appeal to Upper Tribunal

11. On 7 November 2016, the appellant sought permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, specifying for the first time an  address  for  service
    for himself (196b Francis Road, London E10 6PR), as  well  as  for  his
    solicitors, as required by  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (as amended).  The appeal papers were sent by fax  and  were
    incomplete when received.

12. On 9 November 2016, the Upper Tribunal sent a letter to David Wyld & Co
    solicitors, at the 51a Marlborough Road address, stating that a  repeat
    transmission of the same  document  would  be  acceptable  if  it  were
    received by  5:00pm  on  14  November.   The  repeat  transmission  was
    received on 10 November 2016 and was acknowledged to the  appellant  at
    an address at 196b Francis Road and to David  Wyld  &  Co  at  the  51a
    Marlborough Road address. Again, it is  clear  that  the  letter  of  9
    November was received at 51a Marlborough Road and acted upon.

13. The appellant disputed the Tribunal's finding  that  it  was  satisfied
    that the notice of hearing had been sent and argued that  he  had  been
    deprived of an opportunity to give evidence in his case.  He relied  on
    Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 418 (IAC) but that decision
    is not of assistance here, since Nwaigwe concerned a refusal to adjourn
    following an adjournment application.  The grounds of appeal said this:



         "The appellant's firm instructions are as follows:

             '2.1 He received no prior notification  of  the  date  of  the
                  hearing.
             2.2  His legal representatives received a Respondent's  bundle
                  on 30 September 2016, but this bundle included  no  notice
                  of the date of the hearing.
             2.3  The hearing was in fact heard on 11 October 2016  in  the
                  Appellant's absence'."

14. On 22 November 2016, permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Astle on the basis that it was arguable that the  First-
    tier Tribunal had erred in proceeding in the absence of the  appellant,
    because the Tribunal had not served him with notice of hearing for  the
    11 October 2016.

15. On 25 November 2016, the notice of  hearing  for  today's  hearing  was
    served on the solicitors at 51a Marlborough Road.  It appears that this
    letter also was received by David Wyld & Co without  difficulty,  since
    Counsel has been instructed to  appear  and  represent  the  appellant.
    There was no representative from the solicitors present.

16. On 30 November 2016, the respondent filed a Rule 24 Reply stating  that
    she did not oppose the grant of permission to appeal.   The  respondent
    invited  the  Tribunal  to  determine  the  appeal  at  a  fresh   oral
    continuance hearing and to resolve the issue  of  the  receipt  of  the
    hearing notice.  The Rule 24 response concludes:

         "It is acknowledged in the grounds that the appellant received  the
         respondent's bundle  on  30  September.   What  enquiries  did  the
         representative  do  concerning  the  appeal,  having  received  the
         bundle?"

    That is a good point:  having  received  the  respondent's  bundle  for
    hearing, one would expect that if David Wyld & Co had  not  received  a
    hearing notice they would have sought to confirm  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal the date for which the hearing had been listed.  I have before
    me the Aria history report from the Tribunal's  computer  system  which
    records no such contact by David Wyld & Co or the appellant.  (For  the
    avoidance of doubt  the  Aria  record  covers  both  the  Hatton  Cross
    proceedings and the appeal to the Upper Tribunal).

Upper Tribunal hearing

17. At the beginning of the hearing I observed that David Wyld & Co had not
    provided any witness statement or  corroborative  evidence  to  support
    their contention that the two notices of hearing served on  them  on  9
    June and 27 September 2016, both of which specified the hearing date of
    11 October 2016, were not received at their offices.  I asked Mr Parker
    whether his solicitors had received the notice of the pre-hearing, sent
    on 9 June 2016, which  also  included  the  date  of  hearing  for  the
    substantive hearing,  and he replied that his  instructions  were  that
    the solicitors had been aware of the pre-hearing date,  but  knew  they
    did not need to attend.

18. I pointed out that the 11 October hearing  date  was  set  out  in  the
    notice of hearing for the pre-hearing, and if the  solicitors  received
    that notice, as it appeared they had, then they were on notice  of  the
    date  of  the  substantive  hearing  also.   Mr  Parker  asked  for  an
    opportunity to take instructions, which I permitted. I asked Mr  Parker
    to tell the solicitors that the Tribunal would put  the  case  back  to
    enable a witness to attend from the offices of David Wyld  &  Co,  with
    the file, to clarify what had occurred.

19. After taking instructions, Mr Parker was instructed that the solicitors
    had not received the 9 June correspondence after all, although  it  was
    sent to the same address as all  the  other  correspondence,  and  that
    therefore, they had been unaware of the pre-hearing date,  as  well  as
    the hearing date.  This was contrary to his previous instructions.   Mr
    Parker was instructed that nobody from David Wyld & Co,  whose  offices
    are in East London (E18), would be able to attend the hearing to assist
    the Upper Tribunal in clarifying the sequence of events  and  the  non-
    receipt of the notice (or notices) of hearing.

20. Mr Parker had been  provided  electronically  with  a  brief  statement
    prepared on the morning of the hearing by Mr Adil Shah, the  person  at
    David Wyld & Co who has conduct of this appeal:

         "I, Adil Shah confirm the following in relation to the above  named
         appellant.

         In so far as our records reflect we had no prior notice served onto
         us about the hearing due to take place on 11th October  2016.   The
         first time that we come to be aware of a hearing taking  place  was
         when the decision was served onto our  office  dated  24th  October
         2016.  For any further queries please do not hesitate to contact me
         at the above office.

         Thank you
         Yours faithfully
         Adil Shah
         David Wyld  and  Co  Solicitors"                          [Emphasis
         added]

    That statement, which is all I have to go on, is  equivocal.   It  does
    not explain how the postal service could have failed to deliver not one
    but two letters, and those only the letters containing date of hearing,
    sent by the First-tier Tribunal to the same address at  which  all  the
    other correspondence was successfully received, nor does it explain why
    no action was taken by  David  Wyld  and  Co  when  they  received  the
    respondent's bundle for the hearing on 30 September 2016.

Discussion

21. There is no credible evidence before me to support a finding  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal made any procedural error in  the  service  of  the
    notice of hearing for the 11 October  2016.   The  allegation  of  non-
    receipt of notices of hearing is not supported by  any  evidence  other
    than the equivocal, and late-produced, statement from Mr Shah.

22. Absent the opportunity to see the  correspondence  in  the  solicitors'
    file and to hear from Mr Shah in person,  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    statement he produced on the morning of  the  hearing  is  credible  or
    accurate. In particular, as only David Wyld & Co's address was  on  the
    file as an address for service at the material time, I am not persuaded
    that the format of the grounds, 'it is the appellant's firm instruction
    that ...he received  no  prior  notice  of  the  date  of  hearing'  is
    appropriate.  The notices would have been received by  the  solicitors,
    and only by them.

23. I am not persuaded, absent cogent evidence, that only the 9 June and 27
    September 2016 notices of hearing failed to  reach  the  solicitors  at
    their address for service, 51a Marlborough Road,  which  was  also  the
    appellant's de facto address for service.   Nor do I consider  that  an
    experienced  firm  of  solicitors,  acting  properly,  would  fail   to
    investigate what the position was  when  the  respondent's  bundle  was
    received, or to file with the First-tier  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
    respondent  a  bundle  containing  such  evidence  as  was   in   their
    possession, on which the appellant would later rely.

24. I am satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude, as he did, that the appellant and  his  solicitors  had  been
    properly served with notice of the date of hearing on not one  but  two
    occasions, at the only address for  contact  which  the  appellant  had
    provided for  himself  or  his  representatives,  at  which  all  other
    correspondence was received and acted upon.  There was  no  application
    before the First-tier Tribunal for adjournment and,  having  regard  to
    the overriding objective, the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not err  in
    law in proceeding to consider the appeal on the basis of  the  evidence
    before him and dismiss it.

25. I dismiss the appeal.  I do not consider it necessary to set aside  the
    First-tier decision which will stand.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.
