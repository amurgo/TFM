For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 22 June 2018 of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Grimmett which refused the human rights  appeal  of  the
    appellant.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 25 August 1980.

 3. The appellant came to the UK on 3  September  2006  and  had  leave  to
    remain in various categories until 20 August 2016.  On 10  August  2016
    she made an application for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) as a  Tier
    1 (General) Migrant.  On 9 May 2017 she varied that application to  one
    for ILR on the basis of long residence.

 4. The respondent refused  the  application  for  ILR  on  long  residence
    grounds in a decision dated 20 December 2017.  The  respondent  applied
    paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  This  states  that  an
    application may be refused on the following basis:

         "The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the United Kingdom in light of his conduct  (including  convictions
         which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph   322(1C),   character   or
         associations or the fact that he represents a  threat  to  national
         security;"

 5. The respondent considered that the appellant had been:

         "... deceitful or dishonest in your dealings with HMRC  and/or  UK
         Visas and immigration by failing to  declare  the  true  amount  of
         claimed self-employed earnings  to  HMRC  at  the  time  and/or  by
         falsely representing your self-employed income to obtain  leave  in
         the United Kingdom."

 6. The specific discrepancies in the  declarations  to  HMRC  and  to  the
    respondent were identified as follows.  In a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
    application submitted on 5 April 2011 the appellant stated that her net
    earnings for self-employment for the period 1 December 2010 to 12 March
    2011 amounted to �40,000.08.  Information from HMRC showed that in  the
    tax year  ending  April  2011  her  declared  net  earnings  for  self-
    employment amounted to �4,990.

 7. Also, in a Tier 1 (General) Migrant application submitted on 12th  July
    2013, the appellant stated that her net  earnings  for  self-employment
    for the period 2 July 2012 to 22 June 2013 amounted  to  �25,530.   The
    respondent acknowledged  that  this  period  of  earnings  spanned  two
    separate tax  years.   Nevertheless,  information  received  from  HMRC
    showed that in the tax year ending April 2013 the appellant's  declared
    earnings for self-employment amounted to �830.  In the tax year  ending
    April 2014, her  declared  earnings  for  self-employment  amounted  to
    �1,540.  Accordingly, the combined earnings for the tax years ending in
    April 2013 and April 2014 amounted to �2,370.

 8. The respondent did not  accept  the  appellant's  explanation  for  the
    discrepancies, finding that a registered accountant would not knowingly
    submit a self-assessment tax return on the appellant's behalf declaring
    earnings which were lower than those she had actually earned  and  that
    had been declared to UKBA.

 9. The appellant appealed against the  decision  of  the  respondent.  The
    appeal was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett on  13  June
    2018.

10. In her decision promulgated on 22 June  2018,  the  judge  set  out  in
    paragraphs 4 to 8 the respondent's reasons for refusal. In paragraph 9,
    the First-Tier Tribunal set out the correct legal test where there  was
    an allegation of dishonesty.

11. The judge summarised in paragraphs 11 to 15 the  evidence  provided  by
    the appellant on the difficulties she had been experiencing at the time
    of the alleged discrepant declarations to HMRC and the respondent.  The
    judge  addressed  the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's  child  in
    paragraph 11, finding that they lay in being with the parents, wherever
    that might be.

12. In paragraph 12 the judge recorded the appellant's  evidence  that  she
    had not been able to pay much attention to her tax affairs  because  of
    personal issues from 2010 onwards which had caused her to  suffer  from
    acute depression.  Her mother had passed away in January  2012  at  the
    time that she was completing the 2011 tax return.   Her  first  husband
    divorced her at the same  time  and  she  was  required  to  travel  on
    numerous occasions backwards and forwards  to  Pakistan  to  deal  with
    these matters.  In addition, her former husband  hacked  her  documents
    and she lost financial business documents.

13. In paragraph 13 the judge  noted  the  appellant's  evidence  that  she
    divorced  her  first  husband  and  remarried  in  2013   but   further
    difficulties followed because her new mother-in-law became  ill,  again
    requiring many visits to Pakistan and her mother-in-law died  in  March
    2014.

14. In paragraphs 14 and 15 the judge recorded the appellant's evidence  on
    how the discrepancies had occurred and been corrected.   The  appellant
    maintained that she appointed new accountants at the end of 2015 and it
    was those accountants who noted the discrepancies.  Together with those
    accountants the appellant arranged to pay the correct amount of tax for
    the years in question.  HMRC accepted a back payment of  �15,328.24  in
    August 2016.  The judge also noted in paragraph 15 that  the  appellant
    had set out her explanation for the discrepancies  in  a  questionnaire
    sent to her by the respondent prior to a decision being made on her ILR
    application.

15. The First-tier Tribunal  then  went  on  to  consider  the  appellant's
    explanation of a previous accountant being responsible for the mistakes
    in the earlier tax returns.  The judge's reasoning in paragraphs 16  to
    23 is as follows:

         "16. There is no evidence save the appellant's oral  evidence  that
             it was a previous accountant who prepared the  accounts.   The
             appellant claimed that she was unwell because of  her  various
             personal problems at  that  time  and  did  not  look  at  the
             accounts or deal with them in any  way.   She  must,  however,
             have supplied the accountant with the information necessary to
             prepare accounts.  She says she did not  subsequently  contact
             either the accountant or  his  professional  body  to  make  a
             complaint against him despite the fact that, on her  evidence,
             she had to pay a second accountant to prepare amended accounts
             and the documents show that there was significant interest  of
             over �2,000 to be paid to the Inland Revenue as  a  result  of
             what she says is her previous accountant's error.

         17.   Notwithstanding  her  various  problems  she  says  that  she
             appointed the new accountant by  the  end  of  2015,  that  he
             worked on the previous accounts to be in a position to  advise
             HMRC of the correct figures.   There  was  not,  however,  any
             evidence from that accountant about how he  re-calculated  the
             figures or what information he had that enabled him to  do  so
             nor how he became aware that the previous figures submitted to
             HMRC were incorrect.

         18.  The appellant is  a  very  intelligent  young  woman  who  has
             studied in the UK and worked hard to establish what is  now  a
             successful business.  I do not believe, were the  position  as
             she  claims  namely  that  she  was  subject  to   significant
             negligence on the part of her previous accountants, she  would
             not have taken some action either to bring him to  account  or
             to recover from him the additional costs that she has  had  to
             pay as a result of what she says was his negligence.  There is
             nothing from her to show even that the incorrect  figures  put
             forward to HMRC were prepared  by  accountants.   If,  as  she
             claims, she is no longer in  touch  with  the  accountant  she
             could have obtained information from HMRC as to who lodged the
             returns on her behalf and what, if any,  correspondence  there
             was with the accountant but there is nothing to show that  she
             has used any other, other than her current accountants to deal
             with her tax affairs.

         19.   The  appellant  produced  no  evidence   from   the   current
             accountants to confirm that it was they who noted  the  errors
             in the earlier accounts.   She  has  not  explained  why  they
             should be looking at her old accounts  or  what  led  them  to
             suspect that there were errors in them, bearing in  mind  that
             she claims her previous  accountants  have  not  returned  any
             documents to her.

         20.  It is for the respondent to show  that  there  may  have  been
             fraud perpetrated.  I am satisfied that they have done  so  in
             light of the incorrect information which it  is  accepted  was
             submitted to  the  Inland  Revenue.   The  appellant  has  not
             discharged the burden of then showing an innocent  explanation
             for the differences in the information provided to HMRC and to
             the respondent.  She has provided nothing to show that she had
             an accountant prior to the current one.  She has not shown who
             lodged the tax returns.  If what she says is  true  she  could
             have obtained such information from HMRC but she has failed to
             do so.  She has not shown that  the  accountant  prepared  the
             figures that were submitted to HMRC and she has not shown what
             information she provided to her previous accountants.

         21.  None of the documents that she  would  have  lodged  with  her
             first  accountants  for  the  accounts  to  be  prepared   and
             submitted to the Inland Revenue  have  been  lodged.   She  is
             making no more than a bare assertion that unknown  accountants
             have acted negligently and she must do more than that to  show
             that  the  information  provided  in  her  name  to  HMRC  was
             incorrect information lodged by others without her knowledge.

         22.  The appellant has  failed  to  explain  what  information  she
             provided to her  current  accountants  that  enabled  them  to
             prepare  fresh  calculations  as  she  claims  the   documents
             provided to the first accountant were never returned to her.

         23.  I was satisfied, therefore, that the appeal  must  fail  under
             paragraph 322(5).  I was not satisfied that the appellant  has
             shown that information  was  provided  by  anyone  other  than
             herself to HMRC  prior  to  the  appointment  of  her  current
             accountants.  Her conduct, therefore, means  that  she  should
             not be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom."

16. The First-tier Tribunal went on to dismiss the Article 8 ECHR claim.

17. The appellant appealed against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    but permission was initially refused by the First-tier  Tribunal  in  a
    decision dated  16  August  2018.   She  renewed  her  application  and
    permission was granted by the Upper Tribunal on 16  October  2018.   In
    line with the thrust of the argument put forward in the grounds  before
    the Upper Tribunal at that time, the grant of permission found that  it
    was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to engage with the
    argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that paragraph  322(5)  of
    the immigration rules did not  apply  to  situations  involving  under-
    declared income.

18. Before us, it was accepted that the respondent was entitled to consider
    discrepant financial declarations such as those shown in  the  evidence
    here as matters capable of coming within the  provisions  of  paragraph
    322(5).  Mr Turner conceded, sensibly, that this was the approach taken
    in leading case law, in particular, the reported Upper Tribunal case of
    R (on  the  application  of  Khan)  v  SSHD  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC), a decision of the honourable
    Mr Justice Martin Spencer.  The headnote of that case indicates clearly
    that paragraph 322(5) can be applied in these circumstances, stating:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
         income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
         the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
         draw  an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
         dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR  within  paragraph
         322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an  inference  could  be
         expected  where  there  is  no  plausible   explanation   for   the
         discrepancy."

19. The argument before us, therefore, focused on the  rationality  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings, and, in  particular,  the  weight
    placed in  those  findings  on  the  appellant's  explanation  for  not
    realising the incorrect declarations during the period  2010  to  2016.
    Mr Turner approached these findings in various ways,  maintaining  that
    the judge  had  not  properly  balanced  the  personal  issues  of  the
    appellant against the absence of evidence from the earlier tax  returns
    and the later amendment of payments to HMRC.  He  maintained  that  the
    judge's approach to this  evidence  did  not  follow  the  guidance  in
    paragraph (v) of the headnote of Khan:

         "(v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

20. In our judgment, having set out accurately in paragraphs 11 to  15  the
    appellant's evidence in support of an "innocent explanation",   it  was
    then a matter for the judge to decide the weight to be  given  to  that
    explanation in the context of the evidence as a whole.  The  judge  was
    not required to  accept  the  appellant's  assertion  of  the  previous
    accountants being responsible for the misdeclarations. She was entitled
    to look for the documentation from those earlier declarations  or  from
    the  re-calculation  in  2016  both  of  which,  from  the  appellant's
    evidence, could properly be assumed to exist.  The judge  was  entitled
    to find that the appellant had shown herself to be competent  in  other
    areas of her life, setting up  her  business,  and  that  this  factor,
    together with the absence of evidence about the previous incorrect  tax
    returns and re-calculation in 2016 undermined the claim  that  previous
    accountants were responsible,  not  the  appellant.   Even  though  the
    decision was made prior to Khan being published, the  judge's  approach
    to these parts of the evidence is entirely in line with the guidance in
    paragraph (v) of the headnote.

21. We did not, therefore, find an error in the approach of the  First-Tier
    Tribunal to the appellant's evidence on how the discrepant  declaration
    came to be made. The correct legal test was  applied  to  the  material
    evidence and the reasons given were rational and open to the judge.

22. For these reasons, the grounds do not disclose an error of law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
