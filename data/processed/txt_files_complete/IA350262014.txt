                      DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE DOYLE

                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:       Mr E Waheed (counsel) instructed by Saj Law
Chambers.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.  I have considered whether any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings  this  appeal,  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid, promulgated on 30 October  2015
which allowed the Appellant's appeal.
Background


3. The Appellant was born on 17 April 1989 and is a national of Pakistan.

4. On 21  August  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application for a residence card as confirmation of a  right  to  reside  in
the UK.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Majid ("the  Judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and, on  12  April  2016,  Judge  Robertson
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      "The grounds of application have arguable merit. Although there is  no
      reason to identify the regulation under  which  the  appeal  has  been
      allowed because it is clear from the reasons for refusal letter, it is
      arguable that the Judge gave  no  reasons  for  finding  that  it  was
      unreasonable for the Respondent to require more than 3 wage  slips  to
      confirm that the EEA national was in fact  exercising  treaty  rights.
      This is particularly the case because the dates of such  payslips  are
      not mentioned and there is no assessment of such evidence  before  the
      Judge concludes  that  the  Respondent  was  unreasonable  to  require
      additional evidence."

The Hearing

7. Mr Duffy, for the respondent,  told  me  that  the  Judge's  decision  is
inadequately reasoned. He told me that the decision is 11  paragraphs  long,
and only 1ï¿½ paragraphs relate to the appellant. He told me that  it  is  not
clear why the Judge reached his decision, and that  the  Judge  simply  does
not  engage  with  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter.  He  referred  me  to
Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC). He told me  that
because no reasoned findings in fact had been made, the  conclusion  reached
by the Judge is entirely unsupported. He urged me allow the  appeal  and  to
set the decision aside.

8. For the appellant, Mr Waheed told me that the Judge reached  the  correct
decision on the  evidence  placed  before  him,  so  that  if  the  decision
contains an error, it is not a material error of law.  He  took  me  to  the
bundle of evidence which was before the First-tier and told me that,  within
the bundle, there was sufficient evidence to  satisfy  the  Judge  that  the
appellant meets the requirements of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006.
He urged me to dismiss the appeal and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

9. At [7] the Judge states that in response to questions "....the  Appellant
gave evidence consistent with his assertions in the  application.".  Nowhere
else  in  the  determination  does  the  Judge  deal  with  the  appellant's
evidence.  Nowhere in the decision does the Judge analyse the  evidence  and
consider the evidence against the  requirements  of  the  2006  regulations.
Instead of analysing the evidence and establishing  findings  of  fact,  the
Judge races to his conclusion at [1] that "..the refusal  was  ill-conceived
and should be set aside."

10. The decision does not contain  any  meaningful  findings  in  fact.  The
decision avoids consideration of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,
which is exactly what the appeal is about. The Judge has not  explained  why
he preferred the appellant's evidence  to  the  respondent's  evidence,  nor
which  parts  of  the  appellant's  evidence  he  placed  weight  on.    The
appellant's 33-page bundle is not considered by the Judge.  The  Judge  does
not consider the payslips and the bank statements produced. In  short  there
is no meaningful analysis of  the  evidence  which  was  placed  before  the
Judge.

11. In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641  (IAC),  it  was
held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination  disclosed  clearly  the
reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal  found  oral  evidence
to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document  to  be  worth  no
weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in the determination  and  for
such findings to be supported by reasons. A bare statement  that  a  witness
was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight was  unlikely  to
satisfy the requirement to give reasons.

12. I can only come to  the  conclusion  that  the  summary  nature  of  the
decision indicates that the Judge has given inadequate reasons and that  his
fact-finding exercise is flawed. These are material errors of  law.  I  must
therefore set the decision aside.

13. There is, however,  sufficient  evidence  before  me  to  enable  me  to
substitute a  decision.  I  have  before  me  the  respondent's  PF1  bundle
together with the appellant's bundle which contains the items listed on  the
index to the bundle. The respondent was not represented  before  the  First-
tier. No application was made from an adjournment.  If  the  respondent  was
happy for the case to be considered without representation before the First-
tier there is no reason why I should not proceed to determine this  case  of
new.

My Findings of Fact

14. The appellant is a national of Pakistan,  born  on  17  April  1989.  He
entered the UK as a  student  on  26/12/2010.  The  respondent  granted  the
appellant further leave to remain in the UK, so that  he  enjoyed  leave  to
remain in the UK until 16/08/2014.

15. In July 2013 the  appellant  met  D  M  ("The  EEA  National")  The  EEA
national is a citizen of the Czech Republic. Romance developed  between  the
appellant and the EEA National, and  they  were  married  on  30/01/2014  in
London. They have lived together since 22/10/2013. Their marriage endures.

16. The EEA national was working as an Office Assistant when  the  appellant
submitted an application for a residence card in  August  2014.  Since  then
she has changed her employment. She  now  works  as  a  sales  assistant  at
"Poundland" in Lewisham.

17. The EEA national maintains a current account with Lloyds  Bank.  Between
August and October 2015 she maintained her account with  a  credit  balance.
In September and October, both 2015, the  EEA  national's  wages  were  paid
directly into her bank account.

Conclusions

18.  In the reasons for refusal letter, the respondent bemoans  an  apparent
lack of documentary evidence. That is addressed by the evidence produced  in
the appellant's bundle, which includes copies of  the  EEA  national's  bank
statements.  The  banks  statements  produced  show  payment  of   the   EEA
national's  wages  into  her  current  account  with   Lloyd's   Bank.   The
respondent's reasons for refusal letter calls for precisely that evidence.

19 The respondent's position has  always  been  that  there  is  a  lack  of
sufficient evidence because the appellant relies on  only  three  pay-slips.
The three payslips are now  supported  by  the  reliable  evidence  of  bank
statements  confirming  payment  of  wages  into  the  EEA  national's  bank
account. In addition, the appellant produces the EEA  National's  employment
contract. The weight of reliable evidence indicates that  the  EEA  national
is exercising treaty rights of movement as a worker. Sufficient evidence  is
now produced to discharge the burden of proving that the EEA national  meets
the requirements of Regulation 6 of the 2006 regulations.

Decision

20. The decision promulgated on 30 October 2015 is  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. I set it aside.

21. I substitute the following decision

22. The appeal under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 is allowed.


Signed                                                              Date 16
