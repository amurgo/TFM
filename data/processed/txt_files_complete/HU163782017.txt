                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. This notice of decision is issued in accordance with rule 40(3)(a).

 2. The hearing today is treated as a 'rolled up hearing', the  hearing  of
    the  substantive  appeal  immediately  following  the  hearing  of  the
    application for permission.

 3. Permission is granted.

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error  of  law
    as identified in the grounds of appeal read with  the  observations  of
    Steyn J.

 5. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision.



 6. No findings are preserved; but it is noted that the First-tier Tribunal
    as previously constituted found that it would be unduly harsh  for  the
    entire family to leave the United Kingdom at the date of that  hearing,
    and the Secretary of State did not challenge that finding.
