Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Jaja, counsel (instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the ECO" and to  the  respondent  as
    "the claimant."

 2. The claimant is a national of Nepal born on 28 August 1976.

 3. The ECO appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fox who allowed the claimant's appeal against the  ECO's
    refusal of  her  application  for  entry  clearance  as  the  dependent
    relative of Mrs Lacchimi Sen, her sponsor, a widow of a  former  Gurkha
    soldier discharged from service prior to 1 July 1997. The decision  was
    promulgated on 11 July 2017.

 4. Judge Fox found that the claimant could not satisfy the  terms  of  any
    applicable policy [25]. However, the claimant had satisfied the  burden
    upon her in accordance with Article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention.
    He considered the five stage test set out in Razgar. He noted that  the
    claimant's bundle comprised  236  pages  as  well  as  over  310  pages
    relating to relevant authorities.

 5. The sponsor was the claimant's mother. The Judge  incorrectly  referred
    to her at [14] as having adopted "his" witness statement.

 6. In her statement she provided details of her continued  ties  with  the
    claimant. In fact she had spoken to the claimant on the morning of  the
    hearing. She contended that the claimant is alone and  is  experiencing
    difficulties.

 7. The sponsor was born on 18 June 1947. She was  granted  ILE  in  August
    2014 under the Gurkha policy as she was a spouse of  a  British  Gurkha
    veteran. She entered the UK on 25 September 2014.

 8. She had consulted with friends concerning the  claimant's  application.
    They advised her to settle in  the  UK  before  the  claimant  made  an
    application. She then travelled to the UK  with  friends  in  September
    2014. On account of expense and the documentation procedures she had to
    wait for some time to save money to make the application.

 9. When her husband was discharged from the army there was  no  settlement
    policy in place for British Gurkhas and their families. That  was  only
    given to  Gurkha  veterans  more  recently.  They  had  never  had  the
    opportunity to apply for settlement together as  a  family  immediately
    upon his discharge. They would have applied for settlement together had
    she had the opportunity to do so upon her husband's discharge.

10. She has two children, including the claimant. She also has a son who is
    married and lives with his family in Motipur, Butwal.

11. Her husband was originally married to his first wife who died  in  June
    2001. He had seven children from that marriage. They  are  all  married
    and live independently with their families.

12. She contended that the claimant remains wholly  dependent  on  her  and
    will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.

13. Her late husband enlisted in the Gurkhas on 1  December  1943  and  was
    discharged on 22 April 1963 on termination  of  engagement.  He  was  a
    sergeant.

14. The claimant relies on her for financial support, accommodation and all
    other matters throughout her life. She lives in the family  home  which
    she owns.

15. The claimant is unmarried and unemployed. She lives in the family  home
    on her own. Her son has already claimed his share on the  property  and
    lives with his family independently.

16. She misses  her  daughter.  The  claimant  does  not  have  educational
    qualifications. She only had one primary school  up  to  Class  8.  The
    children studied up to Class 8 and  then  stopped  as  they  could  not
    afford their education in the city. Her daughter is studying an English
    course and bought many English books to improve her English.

17. She lives in a village where there is no proper road transport.

18. She receives a widow's pension of about �150  a  month.  She  withdraws
    some money when she goes to Nepal and gives it to the claimant. She has
    been saving that money.

19. She stated that she is getting old and suffers  from  health  problems.
    She cannot speak English. It is difficult for her to follow up hospital
    appointments. She does not wish to go back to Nepal and  die  like  her
    husband.

20. Her daughter has no income or resources of her own. She sends her about
    �50-�100 a month for her daily requirements. She is living in very poor
    conditions. She contacts her daughter regularly. They used to  talk  on
    the  telephone  every  day.  That  was  expensive.  Recently,  she  has
    installed Viber and needs her friend's assistance to call her daughter.
    This is comparatively cheap. She now speaks to her for hours  and  more
    often.

21. She requested her son to look after the claimant but  the  daughter  in
    law did not want to take on the burden of an unmarried woman.  This  is
    the duty of the unmarried woman's parents.

22. She will find suitable accommodation in the UK. Her  friend  will  help
    her accommodate the claimant.

23. It was difficult for her to leave her daughter behind. She came to  the
    UK for her health and a bright future. There was also a statement  from
    the claimant dated 15 June 2017.

24. She was subjected to very few questions during  her  cross  examination
    [15-18].

25. In his findings, the Judge reminded himself that the starting point  is
    that the entry clearance officer is entitled to control  the  entry  of
    foreign nationals into the UK. He noted  that  the  sponsor  sought  to
    understate the claimant's ties to Nepal to bolster the appeal.  By  her
    own evidence  the  claimant  has  no  social  contact  with  any  other
    individual in any meaningful way.

26. He did not accept that the claimant lives in complete social  isolation
    as claimed [27]. It was reasonable to  expect  that  the  claimant  has
    access to social interaction via  food  markets  and  neighbours  at  a
    minimum. She has a telephone provided by her mother.  The  sponsor  was
    reluctant to divulge extended family ties in Nepal.

27. However, the Judge stated that this could not detract from the  purpose
    of the discretionary policy intended to address the historic  injustice
    associated with ex- Gurkha soldiers' exclusion from the UK.

28. He accepted  the  documentary  evidence  demonstrating  the  claimant's
    relationship  with  her  mother.  There  is  no  suggestion  that   the
    claimant's late inclusion on the kindred role cannot be  relied  on  to
    show the claimant's family ties [30].

29. The discretionary policy has now evolved to include adult children to a
    maximum age of 30 years. This  demonstrates  the  acknowledgement  that
    family life can continue between adult  family  members  beyond  normal
    emotional ties. He recognised  the  state's  entitlement  to  determine
    those who qualified for  entry  clearance.  The  practice  however,  of
    restricting family members who qualify for leave to enter the  UK  can,
    in certain circumstances, perpetuate continued interference with family
    life that those policies are intended to address - [32].

30. Article 8 is intended to address exceptional  circumstances.  He  found
    that the "respondent's policies addressed the exceptional circumstances
    in part and it is reasonable to conclude that the policies are designed
    to acknowledge the interference  with  family  life  and  private  life
    historically suffered by ex Gurkha soldiers and their family  members."
    But for the historic reluctance to acknowledge the rights of  residence
    for such soldiers  and  their  family  members,  it  is  reasonable  to
    conclude that the sponsor would have settled in the UK  at  an  earlier
    date. Accordingly the claimant would  also  have  benefited  from  this
    historic entitlement [34-35].

31. But for the delay in acknowledging that right, it is most  likely  that
    the claimant would have exercised her  right  of  residence  while  her
    father was alive. The delay caused the sponsor and the claimant  to  be
    separated.  The  mother  had  to  choose  between  the  socio  economic
    advantages of life in the UK and family life with the claimant [36].

32. Notwithstanding embellishments to her evidence, he found that  she  had
    not formed an independent life in Nepal. She is single, lives alone and
    remains dependent in financial and emotional terms  upon  the  sponsor.
    The claimant's siblings have established independent lives and only the
    claimant seeks to join the sponsor in the UK for this reason - [37].

33. The claimant would qualify under the relevant policies but for her age.
    Her application for entry clearance was submitted within the two years'
    threshold as stated within the policies. He found that  the  claimant's
    particular circumstances amounted to exceptional circumstances for  the
    purpose of article 8. He applied the decision in Rai v ECO [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 320.

34. He considered s.117B of the  2002  Act.  The  claimant  is  financially
    dependent on the sponsor who in turn relies on public funds. To bar the
    claimant in  these  circumstances  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the
    relevant policies and the exceptions. But for the  historic  injustice,
    the  claimant  would  not  be  uneducated.  The  language   certificate
    described the claimant as intelligent. The  document  demonstrated  her
    willingness to engage with UK society and the socio economic advantages
    which flow from UK residency. [39-41].

35.  Accordingly  the  claimant's  absence  from  the  UK   constituted   a
    disproportionate interference with any legitimate aim pursued.

36. On 18 August 2017 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted  the  ECO
    permission to appeal. It was arguable that the Judge  materially  erred
    regarding the existence of ties beyond those normally existing  between
    adults, the impact  any  such  ties  had  on  proportionality  and  the
    application of s.117 of the 2002 Act.

37. Mr Clarke submitted that the Judge had regard to financial remittances.
    The Judge did not appear to have had regard to any evidence of  regular
    communication between them although satisfied that they  speak  on  the
    phone on a regular basis [17]. The sponsor  has  visited  the  claimant
    only once.

38. The limited evidence did not demonstrate emotional  dependence  to  the
    Kugathas standard. He noted that in paragraph 2 of the grounds the  ECO
    does not dispute that a family life exists between the claimant and her
    sponsor; simply that the evidence does not show elements of  dependency
    beyond the normal emotional ties between adults. It is normal for adult
    children to keep in touch with their parents. There has to be something
    more, however.

39. Mr Clarke referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  PT  (Sri
    Lanka) v Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  612.  The  Court
    considered whether the appellant's Article 8 rights had been engaged in
    that case. Mr Clarke submitted that there  must  be  a  fact  sensitive
    assessment made. The Court referred at  [23]  to  the  question  as  to
    whether Kugathas  establishes  a  rebuttable  presumption  against  any
    relationship between an adult child and his parents being sufficient to
    engage Article 8. However, in Ghising v  SSHD  [2012]  UKUT  00160  the
    Upper Tribunal was critical of that reading. The judgment  in  Kugathas
    has been interpreted too restrictively in the past and ought to be read
    in the light of subsequent decisions of  the  domestic  and  Strasbourg
    courts. The Court of Appeal set out the Tribunal's full account of  the
    Strasbourg case law at [60-61].

40. At [62] the Upper Tribunal concluded  in  Ghising  that  the  different
    outcomes in cases with superficially similar features  emphasised  that
    the issue under Article 8 (1) is highly  fact  sensitive.  Rather  than
    applying a blanket rule with regard to adult children, each case should
    be analysed on its own facts to  decide  whether  or  not  family  life
    exists within the meaning of Article 8(1).

41. The approach of the Upper Tribunal in Ghising was approved by the Court
    of Appeal in R (Gurung) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8.

42. The Court of Appeal concluded that the position  thus  is  that  Sedley
    LJ's statement of the applicable principles in Kugathas has not been in
    any sense disapproved since it requires a fact sensitive approach,  but
    that it requires to be understood in the light of the  subsequent  case
    law helpfully summarised in Ghising.

43. Mr Clarke submitted that the Judge was oblivious to the need for a fact
    sensitive assessment. There was no clear family life finding.  Even  if
    it is construed  as  such,  it  is  not  sufficient  to  constitute  an
    infringement under Article 8.

44. Accordingly, the decision is unsafe because without  a  proper  finding
    relating to family life, you do not get to consider historic injustice.
    Moreover, the reference to "historical injustice"  by  the  Judge  from
    [35] onwards amounted to pure speculation as to what someone would have
    done in hindsight. This should not have been given any  weight  in  the
    overall proportionality assessment.

45. Nor did the Judge make any findings concerning the  claimant's  ability
    to speak English, noting that  she  is  uneducated  and  has  not  made
    efforts to seek employment in Nepal. Although she  may  be  willing  to
    engage with the socio economic advantages flowing  from  UK  residency,
    this shows that she is motivated by reasons of economic migrancy.

46. In reply, Ms Jaja referred to the ECO's grounds. She submitted that  it
    is evident from the grounds themselves that "the ECO does  not  dispute
    that a family life exists between the claimant and  her  sponsor."  The
    contention is that the evidence does not show  elements  of  dependency
    beyond the normal emotional ties between adults.

47. Accordingly, it is not disputed that family life does exist between the
    claimant and her mother. She submitted that there is no  reason  to  go
    behind that concession. That is the starting point in the appeal.

48. The complaint is that the Judge  has  not  expressly  stated  what  his
    findings are. She submitted that this amounts to a complaint made about
    form  as  opposed  to  substance.  The  Judge  at  [9]  considered  the
    application of  Article  8  outside  the  Rules.  He  directed  himself
    correctly as well as noting the need to consider  s.117B  of  the  2002
    Act. He took into account relevant decisions  at  [11]  including  Rai,
    supra. The question is whether the 'principles'  from  the  authorities
    were properly applied to the evidence in this case. The substance shows
    that the Judge has taken into account and applied the recent  case  law
    relating to Gurkhas and dependants. There is, she submitted, no  reason
    for the determination not to be upheld.

49. She referred to paragraph [17] in Rai. The Court of Appeal  found  that
    the legal principles relevant to the issue were not controversial.  The
    nature of the links between the claimant and near relatives  constitute
    relevant factors. This includes the age of the claimant, where and with
    whom he has resided in the past,  and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
    maintained with the other members of the family with whom he claims  to
    have a family life.

50. Accordingly, Arden LJ stated in Kugathas that  a  family  life  is  not
    established between an adult child and his surviving  parent  or  other
    siblings unless something more exists than normal emotional ties.  Such
    ties might exist if the appellant were dependent on his family or  vice
    versa. It was not essential that members of the family should be in the
    same country.

51. In Patel and Others v ECO, Mumbai [2010] EWCA Civ 17, Sedley LJ  stated
    at [14] that what may constitute an extant family life falls well short
    of what constitutes dependency, and a  good  many  adult  children  may
    still have a family life with parents who are now settled here  not  by
    leave or by force of circumstance, but by long delayed right.

52. Ms Jaja noted that the Judge accepted that the evidence of the  sponsor
    was in certain  respects  "understated".  According  to  the  sponsor's
    evidence the claimant had no social contact with any  other  individual
    in any meaningful way. The Judge did  not  accept  that  she  lives  in
    complete social isolation as claimed [27]. Accordingly  the  Judge  did
    exercise a critical assessment.

53. The Judge stated that the crucial point  is  not  the  claimant's  age.
    However, it was not until 2015  that  adult  dependent  children  could
    apply under the policy.

54. Accordingly this was the government's delay in acknowledging the  right
    of residence for ex-Gurkha soldiers and their family members. The delay
    caused the sponsor and the claimant to be separated.

55. She submitted that the Judge did apply the legal principles as set  out
    in Rai at [17-18]. The Judge has stated the reason why her  mother  had
    settled here. This was as a result of a long delayed right.

56. With regard to the alleged speculation as to whether her  father  would
    have settled in the UK at an early stage, the sponsor clearly stated in
    the witness statement that  they  would  have  applied  for  settlement
    together had she had the  opportunity  to  do  so  upon  her  husband's
    discharge.

57. Moreover, the  claimant  stated  in  her  witness  statement  that  she
    continued studies in English and completed an English course.  She  has
    been reading books to improve her English.

58. The financial considerations  were  addressed  by  the  mother  in  her
    witness statement  at  [39].  Her  friend  will  help  accommodate  the
    claimant. She will assist the claimant in finding a job. She  will  not
    be a burden on public funds. The claimant also stated that she declared
    in her appendix form when applying for settlement that she  would  find
    appropriate work in the UK.

59. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the Judge has not  given  reasons
    for  the  conclusions  reached.  There  is  an  absence  of   findings,
    particularly in relation to proportionality.

    Assessment

60. It is asserted that the Judge did not indicate the basis upon which  he
    found the claimant to be emotionally and financially dependent  on  her
    mother in the UK. It is  asserted  that  the  dependency  is  based  on
    financial remittances. The Judge apparently did not have regard to  the
    evidence of regular communication between them including phone cards or
    text messages. He was satisfied that they speak  to  each  other  on  a
    regular basis by telephone.

61.  However,  there  was  substantial   evidence   produced   of   regular
    communication between them by way of Viber call logs and  screen  shots
    between the claimant and her mother in the UK. There were  also  copies
    of previous telephone call details and calling cards  from  pages  109-
    151. There were also copies of money remittance  receipts  between  the
    sponsor and the claimant produced at page 87-108.

62. The ECO moreover stated in  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  it  is  not
    disputed that the family life  exists  between  the  claimant  and  her
    sponsor.

63. The Judge was not uncritical of the sponsor's  evidence  regarding  the
    assertion that the claimant  has  no  social  contact  with  any  other
    individual in any meaningful way. He did not accept that she  lives  in
    complete social isolation as claimed. However,  that  did  not  detract
    from the purpose of the discretionary policy intending to  address  the
    historic injustice associated with ex Gurkha soldiers'  exclusion  from
    the UK [27-29].

64. Judge Fox found that the relevant policy acknowledges that family  life
    can continue between adult family members beyond normal emotional  ties
    [31]. He found that the claimant is single,  lives  alone  and  remains
    dependent in financial and emotional terms upon the sponsor  [37].   He
    had had regard to the evidence produced in support. He has  had  regard
    to the witness statements produced as well as the sponsor's evidence.

65. During submissions it was contended on behalf of  the  entry  clearance
    officer that any interference with Article 8 is  proportionate.  Family
    life can continue by visits from the sponsor [21].

66. The Judge had regard to the evidence that the claimant has  not  formed
    an independent life in Nepal [37]. She is unmarried and dependent  upon
    her mother financially and emotionally. They cohabited until 2014. They
    separated only for the sponsor to exercise belated rights of  residence
    in the UK.

67. The Judge has properly directed himself in accordance with the relevant
    authorities at [8 to 11] which included Rai v ECO, supra. It is evident
    that the Judge found as a matter of  substance  that  family  life  can
    continue between adult family members beyond normal emotional ties,  as
    he noted at [31]. He found that the claimant had satisfied  the  burden
    upon her in accordance with Article 8. He found  in  the  circumstances
    that family life did exist between these adult relatives.

68. Judge Fox also considered as part of the proportionality assessment the
    historic  injustice  in  delaying  the  acknowledgement  of  rights  of
    residence for ex Gurkha soldiers and their family members. The  sponsor
    did state that but for that injustice they would have settled in the UK
    as a family at a much earlier date.  There  was  accordingly  a  proper
    basis for the finding that the claimant would also have benefited  from
    this historic entitlement. [35]

69. Having applied the decision in Rai, supra, he found that the claimant's
    particular circumstances amount to exceptional  circumstances  for  the
    purpose of Article 8 [39]. He has considered s.117B of the 2002 Act  as
    part of his decision.

70. There have been no material errors of law.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
