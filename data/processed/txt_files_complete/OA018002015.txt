                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance officer (ECO) I refer
    to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the ECO  dated  20th  December  2014  to
    refuse her application for entry clearance under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules as the partner of Mr Mohammed Abbas.   Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Suffield-Thompson allowed the Appellant's appeal in
    a decision dated 14th June 2015.  The Secretary of State  appeals  with
    permission against that decision.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the ECO refused  the  Appellant's
    application   on the basis that the Sponsor did not meet the  financial
    requirements as set out in paragraph E-ECP.3.3. of Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   According  to  the  ECO  the  Appellant  provided
    documents to show that the Sponsor is self-employed in two occupations,
    in business as AA Chicken & Pizza and as a butcher.  The ECO considered
    the documentation but noted that the Sponsor's bank statements  do  not
    show the claimed turnover of �42,627 as detailed in the HMRC tax return
    and the accounts supplied.  The ECO  considered  the  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's accountants which  details  a  salary  income  as  a  butcher
    amounting to �13,530 from DHM London.  It is stated that the tax return
    and the accounts detail  costs  and  overheads  from  this  employment.
    However, the ECO considered that the documents submitted appear to show
    that the Sponsor is actually  employed  by  this  company  and  is  not
    therefore a self-employed butcher.  The ECO was not therefore satisfied
    that the accounts or the submission to HMRC is a true reflection of the
    Sponsor's self-employment income.   Furthermore,  the  ECO  noted  that
    there are entries in the Sponsor's bank account from the Student  Loans
    Company which suggest that the Sponsor is actually a student and caused
    the ECO to doubt that the Sponsor is  employed  as  claimed.   The  ECO
    refused the application under paragraph EC-P.1.1.(d) of Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the appeal on the papers.  The
    judge noted that the Appellant and the Sponsor  married  on  10th  June
    2013 and that they now have a baby and that the Sponsor  and  Appellant
    are applying for a British passport  for  the  baby  as  the  child  is
    entitled to British nationality through the Sponsor.  The  judge  noted
    that the Sponsor in this case claims to be self-employed  and  to  have
    two businesses in the UK, a pizza takeaway and a butcher's  shop.   The
    judge also noted that the Appellant claims that the Sponsor undertook a
    part-time business course in 2014 in  order  to  enhance  his  business
    skills which would be of benefit to his  businesses  and  that  he  was
    still running his businesses whilst he undertook this course.

 5. The judge identified the two main areas of dispute as being whether the
    Sponsor is employed or self-employed and whether the Sponsor  has  been
    self-employed for the entire requisite period or  whether  he  gave  up
    work in December 2013 to become a student.  The judge considered all of
    the evidence before the ECO including the  Sponsor's  bank  statements,
    his self-assessment tax returns, HMRC SA302 form,  a  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's  accountant,  business  accounts,  national  insurance   bill
    payment and invoices.

 6.  The  judge  concluded  at  paragraph  15  that  the  ECO   had   ample
    documentation before her to assess that the Sponsor  is  self-employed.
    The judge concluded that the fact that the bank statement  shows  pages
    called "wages" is immaterial  on  the  basis  that  most  self-employed
    people pay themselves a salary or wage from their own business  and  it
    is logical that such identification would  be  made  for  the  payments
    going into their accounts.  The judge concluded that it is  clear  from
    the HMRC SA302 that any income was self-employed income  and  that  the
    accountants' letter details a salary income from the butcher's business
    but states clearly that it is self-employed income.

 7. The judge considered  the  documents  and  also  considered  the  ECO's
    guidance (Annex FM Section FM 1.7 paragraph 9.3.7)  which  states  that
    self-employed income can be cash in hand but it would be expected  that
    the person's business or personal bank statements would  fully  reflect
    all gross pre-tax cash income and that flexibility may only be  applied
    where the decision maker is satisfied that the cash income relied  upon
    is fully evidenced by the tax returns and accounts information.

 8.  The  judge  went  on  to  find  that  the  guidance,  which  had  been
    specifically  referred  to  in  the  Appellant's  application  and  was
    therefore before the ECO, showed that the ECO  did  not  consider  this
    policy.  The judge considered that the business accounts, the HMRC form
    and the self-assessment tax return fully  evidenced  the  income  [20].
    The judge found that the Sponsor was self-employed,  not  employed  and
    that the Respondent had erred in not finding this to be the case.

 9. The judge considered  the  whether  the  Sponsor  was  a  student  from
    December 2013 and concluded that there was no evidence on which the ECO
    could conclude that student loan payments cast doubt on the credibility
    of the Appellant's claim that the Sponsor was running  two  businesses.
    The judge found that the Sponsor was self-employed for  the  period  as
    required and allowed the appeal.

10. The ECO's Grounds of Appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  contend  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  carry  out  an  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's income or make findings as  to  how  this  relates  to  the
    minimum income requirement of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE and that a
    fundamental aspect of the claim had not therefore been considered.  The
    grounds contend that the Tribunal  failed  to  make  an  assessment  of
    income for the relevant period which was twelve  months  prior  to  the
    date of application.

11. At the hearing before me Mr Worboys clarified that as  the  Sponsor  is
    self-employed and not employed and that the relevant period is in  fact
    the last full financial year, which is 2013/14, not a period of  twelve
    months prior to the  application  as  suggested  in  the  grounds.   Ms
    Isherwood did not dispute this submission and I accept that this is the
    relevant period.

12. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge did make a material error because
    the judge did  not  assess  how  the  Appellant  met  the  Rules.   She
    submitted that the judge had not properly considered the  Secretary  of
    State's position.  She  submitted  that  the  bank  statements  do  not
    correspond with the invoices and that the judge considered the  policy,
    9.3.7, but did not resolve the matter.  She submitted  that  the  point
    about the student loan is that after that date the income stopped.  The
    refusal did not say that the Sponsor could not be a student and be self-
    employed but said that the ECO was not satisfied that the  Sponsor  was
    self-employed or earning income after that date.  She submitted that at
    paragraph 21 the judge fails  to  explain  how  the  document  explains
    itself.  She submitted that the judge did not resolve the  issue  about
    the claimed income.

13. Mr Worboys submitted  that  the  issue  in  relation  to  turnover  was
    misconceived.  He submitted that the judge had considered  all  of  the
    evidence as set out at paragraph 13.  He submitted that at paragraph 20
    the judge found that the income was fully evidenced.  He submitted that
    any discrepancy in relation to cash income was  captured  by  the  Home
    Office policy and that it was clear that the judge had considered  this
    policy.  He submitted that all of the provisions of the relevant  Rules
    had been met.  Paragraph  12  of  the  skeleton  argument  contained  a
    statement of the relevant provisions of Appendix FM  and  he  submitted
    that all of the documents set out therein had been  in  fact  provided.
    In these circumstances the judge was not required to make  any  further
    findings than those she did.

14. He submitted that page 54 of the Appellant's bundle  shows  an  invoice
    issued on 30th March 2014 which was after the date it was alleged  that
    the Appellant became a student and that there is  nothing  to  preclude
    the Appellant studying and being self-employed.  He said that the judge
    was right to consider that it was not proper for the ECO to  draw  that
    conclusion from the payment of the student loans.  He said that even if
    the judge had made any misdirection there is no material error  of  law
    because all documents were provided and relied upon.  He submitted that
    the judge set  out  all  of  the  relevant  principles,  discussed  the
    relevant evidence, considered the position of both parties,  considered
    all of the documents on the basis of the evidence, assessed  the  Rules
    and addressed the issues between the parties.

15. In response Ms Isherwood submitted that there had  not  been  a  proper
    assessment of the evidence and the Rules.  She submitted that the judge
    had not applied the policy  that  she  set  out  at  paragraph  19  and
    submitted that the reasoning was not on the evidence.

Error of Law

16. I have considered all of  the  evidence  and  the  submissions.   I  am
    satisfied that  the  judge  made  no  material  error  of  law  in  her
    consideration of this appeal.  I consider that when the appeal is  read
    as a whole it is clear that the judge  assessed  all  of  the  evidence
    which was before the ECO.  The judge set out at paragraph 19  that  the
    ECO's guidance allowed for consideration of cash in hand if the  income
    is fully evidenced  by  the  relevant  tax  returns  and  the  accounts
    information.  In my view the finding in paragraph 20  that  the  income
    was fully evidenced was open to the judge  on  the  basis  of  all  the
    evidence before her.  I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  implicit  in  the
    determination that the  judge  found  that  the  Sponsor  was  employed
    throughout the relevant period and that this means that  the  Appellant
    has demonstrated that the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  have
    been met. This amounts to a finding that the relevant provisions of the
    Immigration Rules were met at the time of the decision.

17. In these circumstances the judge made no material error of law.
