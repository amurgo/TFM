                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT are set out in  her  application
    dated 26 June 2017.

 2. The submissions of both parties were based on  the  following  passages
    from Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702:

         37.      We consider that the proper  approach  lies  between  that
         advocated by Mr Lewis and that advocated by  Miss  Giovanetti,  but
         considerably  nearer  to  the  latter.   The  first   Adjudicator's
         determination stands (unchallenged, or not successfully challenged)
         as an assessment of the claim the Appellant was then making, at the
         time of that determination.   It  is  not  binding  on  the  second
         Adjudicator; but, on the other hand, the second Adjudicator is  not
         hearing an appeal against it.  As an assessment of the matters that
         were before the first Adjudicator it should simply be  regarded  as
         unquestioned.  It may be built upon, and, as a result, the  outcome
         of the hearing before the second Adjudicator may be quite different
         from what might have been expected from  a  reading  of  the  first
         determination only.  But it is not the second Adjudicator's role to
         consider arguments intended to undermine  the  first  Adjudicator's
         determination.

         38.       The  second  Adjudicator  must,  however  be  careful  to
         recognise that the issue before him  is  not  the  issue  that  was
         before the first Adjudicator.  In particular, time has passed;  and
         the situation at the time of the second Adjudicator's determination
         may be shown to be different from that which  obtained  previously.
         Appellants may want to  ask  the  second  Adjudicator  to  consider
         arguments on issues that were not - or could not be - raised before
         the first Adjudicator; or evidence that was not - or could not have
         been - presented to the first Adjudicator.

         39.      In our view  the  second  Adjudicator  should  treat  such
         matters in the following way.

             (1) The first Adjudicator's determination should always be the
             starting-point.  It is the  authoritative  assessment  of  the
             Appellant's status at the time  it  was  made.   In  principle
             issues such as whether the Appellant was properly represented,
             or whether he gave evidence, are irrelevant to this.

             (2)   Facts   happening   since   the   first    Adjudicator's
             determination can always be taken into account by  the  second
             Adjudicator.  If those facts lead the  second  Adjudicator  to
             the conclusion that, at the date of his determination  and  on
             the material before him, the appellant makes his case,  so  be
             it.  The previous decision, on the material before  the  first
             Adjudicator and at that date, is not inconsistent.

 3. Mr Matthews argued along the lines of the grounds that the  FtT  failed
    to apply Devaseelan correctly, did not take the previous decision as  a
    starting point, failed to approach credibility  in  light  of  previous
    negative findings, and failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for  his
    positive finding on credibility.  He said that Devaseelan was not to be
    interpreted to the effect that a finding that an appellant  was  not  a
    truthful witness on an earlier claim was irrelevant to his truthfulness
    on a later claim.  The FtT was wrong to say at  �43  that  the  earlier
    decision was "not directly relevant"; it was.  The appellant  had  been
    found untruthful about a sur place claim (based on political  activity)
    which was "in the same area" as the present case  (based  on  religious
    conversion) and showed that the appellant  could  invent  a  case.   Mr
    Matthews accepted my observation that these submissions  had  not  been
    made to the FtT, as the SSHD had not been represented, but he said they
    were obvious matters of law which the FtT was bound to apply, when  the
    respondent had placed the previous decision before  the  tribunal.   He
    also said that the judge failed  to  deal  with  the  several  specific
    credibility matters raised in the refusal letter, but acknowledged that
    point was not in the grounds.

 4. Although not specifically in the grounds, Mr  Matthews  submitted  that
    there was no justification for expressly  not  taking  it  against  the
    appellant that he remained in the UK (�43).  He said the legal position
    was that the appellant should have left, not that the respondent was to
    blame for not enforcing removal.

 5. The SSHD sought a remit to the FtT, before another judge.

 6. Ms Loughran submitted along the lines of her rule 24 response, which is
    on the file.  She said that the previous decision was acknowledged as a
    starting point at �43.  The judge then correctly  identified  that  the
    new claim was made for different reasons, which justified  his  comment
    that the previous decision was not directly relevant.  This  case  fell
    squarely within �38  and  39(2)  of  Devaseelan,  which  was  correctly
    applied.  The FtT's conclusions had to be read in the  context  of  the
    considerable amount of evidence, documentary and oral, led  in  support
    of the appellant's case, which amounted to ample justification for  the
    unequivocally positive finding thereon.

 7. Mr Matthews in response accepted that the previous  decision  had  been
    referred to, but pointed out that there was no mention of the fact that
    the case had failed solely on credibility, on which  the  present  case
    also turned.

 8.  I reserved my decision.

 9. There is some force in the submission by Mr Matthews  recorded  at  �4,
    but it is not in the grounds, and does not disclose a crucial error  on
    a decisive point.

10. There was also some force in the point that the FtT did not  deal  with
    the SSHD's reasoning in the refusal letter, which is quite detailed and
    specific; and notwithstanding the acknowledgment by Mr Matthews, it  is
    in grounds, at their final paragraph.

11. Devaseelan has become well known, and judges are expected to apply  it.
    The principle that lack of truthfulness in one case may be relevant  to
    truthfulness on another is an obvious one.  However, I see no error  in
    the phrase "not directly relevant".  Error  would  lie  in  saying  the
    prior decision was entirely irrelevant, or it  was  entirely  decisive;
    not at a mid-point.

12. As I observed during  submissions,  the  decision  might  ideally  have
    included a phrase or a sentence to  the  effect  that  it  was  reached
    bearing in mind and notwithstanding the  previous  adverse  credibility
    finding.  However, the Devaseelan principles are so well known, and the
    history was so plainly  before  the  judge,  that  it  may  readily  be
    presumed that the matter was part of the decision-making process.

13. The ground further loses force  on  reference  to  the  SSHD's  refusal
    decision.  Although referenced at �9 and 10, that is on  the  political
    aspect. Little, if anything, is based on Devaseelan in the rejection of
    the religious aspect.  In  absence  of  representation,  there  was  of
    course no development of the point at the hearing.

14. The judge heard the appellant and other witnesses about  his  Christian
    practice and faith, whom he found convincing, and he found  significant
    documentation in support, including  letters  from  senior  members  of
    churches in both Liverpool and Glasgow (�45).

15. The grounds and submissions for the SSHD do not show that the  decision
    as  a  whole  is  vitiated  either  by  failure  to  follow  Devaseelan
    principles or by inadequacy of reasoning.  The decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal shall stand.

16. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
