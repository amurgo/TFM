Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision, promulgated on 7 May 2015, of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Stokes  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
       FTTJ).

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley  on
       1 September 2015.

    3. On 13 November 2009, the appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  with
       leave to enter as a spouse of a person settled here, which was  valid
       until 13 January 2012.  An in-time application for leave to remain in
       the United Kingdom on the same  basis  was  rejected.  The  appellant
       resubmitted that application on 17 January 2012 and  it  was  refused
       with no right of  appeal.   Thereafter,  the  appellant  requested  a
       reconsideration of the earlier  decision  and  furthermore  requested
       that his case be considered under Article 8 ECHR  with  regard  to  a
       relationship with a different partner.

    4. The respondent considered that the  appellant  met  the  suitability,
       relationship and eligibility  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  to  the
       Immigration Rules, however as the appellant's stepchild was over  the
       age of 18, paragraph EX.1 did not apply.  With  regard  to  paragraph
       EX.2, the respondent did not accept that  a  "mere  wish,  desire  or
       preference" to live in the United Kingdom amounted to  insurmountable
       obstacles  to  family   life   continuing   outside   this   country.
       Furthermore, it was not accepted that the appellant could meet any of
       the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. Reference was made
       to the appellant's claim that  his  partner  could  not  relocate  to
       Jamaica because she  cares  for  her  elderly  mother  and  that  his
       stepdaughter, who is at university, enjoyed a close relationship with
       her father but these were not considered  to  amount  to  exceptional
       circumstances meriting a  grant  of  leave  outside  the  Rules.  The
       Secretary of  State  also  commented  adversely  on  the  appellant's
       continued unlawful presence and  employment  in  the  United  Kingdom
       since his leave to enter expired.

    5. At the hearing before the FTTJ, the appellant and  his  partner,  MD,
       provided oral evidence. The FTTJ noted that there were no credibility
       issues, but dismissed the appeal on the  basis  that  there  were  no
       insurmountable obstacles to family life being continued in Jamaica.

    6. The grounds of application consisted of  fifteen  handwritten  pages,
       which argued that the FTTJ's decision did not  show  respect  to  the
       human rights of the appellant, his partner  and  other  relatives  as
       well as the appellant's complaints about his former partner  whom  he
       described as violent and bullying.

    7. UTJ Lindsley granted permission on the basis  that  it  was  arguable
       that it was not the role of the FTTJ to review the reasonableness  of
       the respondent's decision, as she appeared  to  do  at  [27]  of  her
       decision. Furthermore, a degree of hardship had been presented to the
       tribunal in relation to the mother of the  appellant's  partner  were
       the couple to have their family life outside of the United Kingdom.

    8. The respondent lodged a Rule 24 response to the grant of  permission.
       The appellant's appeal was opposed and it was argued  that  the  FTTJ
       directed herself appropriately. In relation to the  ground  on  which
       permission was granted, the  respondent  argued  that  the  FTTJ  had
       properly  considered  the  degree  of  hardship  the  mother  of  the
       appellant's partner would face were the appellant and his partner  to
       leave the United Kingdom. The appellant's grounds were said to amount
       to no more than mere disagreement with the negative outcome  and  did
       not establish a material error of law.

    9. At the hearing before me, the appellant reiterated his criticisms  of
       the FTTJ's decision. In essence, he was of the view that the FTTJ had
       become confused  between  his  partner's  brother  and  her  mother's
       brother and he wondered if other mistakes had been  made;  albeit  he
       was unable to direct me to any. He told me that his partner's  mother
       was not accompanied to Jamaica by her brother rather the  family  met
       her there. His partner's mother was elderly and sickly and needed the
       support of his partner round the clock.

   10. The appellant did not believe that he would be able to find  work  in
       Jamaica owing to his long absence, the fact  that  he  had  sold  his
       tools and car to come to the United Kingdom and that he had no  paper
       qualifications. I asked him why he could not return simply  to  apply
       for entry clearance, however he said that he would be sleeping on the
       street, his partner's finances were not in a strong enough  state  to
       provide for him and that his  return  to  Jamaica  would  ruin  their
       relationship.

   11. The appellant appeared to me to be preoccupied  with  the  manner  in
       which he was treated by LH,  his  former  partner  and  became  quite
       distressed when recounting these matters. He repeated much of what he
       said in  his  grounds  regarding  LH's  physical  and  verbal  abuse,
       cruelty, control of his finances,  extortion  and  manipulation.  The
       content of those grounds, which contain much credible detail, is very
       concerning. I explained that these events were not  relevant  to  the
       decision of the FTTJ as these matters were not ventilated before her.
       Instead, I encouraged the appellant to seek urgent  legal  advice  in
       relation to a possible claim that his marriage had broken down  owing
       to domestic violence.

   12. During his submissions, Mr Walker commented that it was "clear"  from
       the appellant's evidence that domestic violence was involved  in  his
       relationship with LH but that an application could be  made  in  that
       regard. Otherwise, he drew my attention to various paragraphs of  the
       FTTJ's decision in which reference was made to various aspects of the
       appellant's circumstances and that of his partner and her family.

   13. In response, the appellant stressed that it would be  very  difficult
       for his partner's family if the appellant and his  partner  lived  in
       Jamaica. While his partner had a brother in the United Kingdom,  that
       brother lived an hour away and had his own family. He argued that his
       partner's daughter was a young adult and was not  that  helpful.  She
       did not do for his partner's mother, what his partner did.

   14. At the end of the hearing, I concluded that no error of law was  made
       by the FTTJ.

   15. Permission to appeal was granted, partly, owing to what the FTTJ said
       at [27] of the decision and reasons; "I find  that  the  Respondent's
       conclusion that the hardship did  not  amount  to  an  insurmountable
       obstacle was a rational one and was  sufficiently  explained  in  the
       refusal letter." While this comment gives an impression that the FTTJ
       was merely  and  erroneously  reviewing  the  reasonableness  of  the
       respondent's  decision,  a  reading  of  the  decision  as  a   whole
       demonstrates that this was not the case. Prior to making the  comment
       at [27], the FTTJ set  out  and  assessed,  at  considerable  length,
       between [16] and [26] of the decision, all the matters relied upon by
       the appellant in his appeal. It is only  after  considering  all  the
       evidence before her and concluding that there were no  insurmountable
       obstacles to family life taking place in Jamaica, that the FTTJ  made
       any substantial reference to the respondent's decision. She  directed
       herself appropriately.

   16. Reference was also made, in the grant of permission, to evidence of a
       degree of hardship being before the FTTJ. This was indeed  the  case.
       The decision of the FTTJ, at [24] demonstrates that she had regard to
       the  correct  legal  tests  regarding  the  meaning   of   the   term
       insurmountable obstacles.

   17. The particular issue said be a cause of potential  hardship,  is  the
       health of the mother of the appellant's partner. However, at [21] the
       FTTJ  correctly  records  that  the  lady's  kidney  disease  is   in
       remission; that her consultant described her as "very well;" that she
       had travelled to Jamaica for 3 months and that she would not be  seen
       again by her consultant until a year had elapsed. At [26],  the  FTTJ
       considered the fact that the partner's  mother  was  able  to  travel
       abroad and remain  there  for  some  time  without  jeopardising  her
       health; at [22] that the partner's mother had her  own  accommodation
       and a son in London, at [20], lived with her adult granddaughter  and
       that no referral to social services had been made.

   18. The FTTJ gave careful consideration to  the  care  of  the  partner's
       mother and concluded that there would be  no  significant  degree  of
       hardship were the appellant and his partner to relocate  to  Jamaica.
       Alternatively, in considering the appellant's Article 8 claim outside
       the Rules, the FTTJ found at [35] that a temporary separation for the
       appellant   to   seek   entry    clearance    did    not    interfere
       disproportionately with his protected rights. At  [20]  it  is  noted
       that the appellant's partner earns in excess of �18,600 per annum and
       at [22] that she has relatives of her own in Jamaica who could  offer
       the appellant "initial support".

   19. The decision of the FTTJ comprehensively  addressed  all  the  issues
       before her. If the FTTJ was mistaken as to one  particular  relative,
       this was not a material error in view of the clear evidence that  the
       partner's mother is well, would not be living alone were his  partner
       to accompany him to Jamaica and that she is able to travel abroad for
       extended periods of time. The decision of the FTTJ does not display a
       material error of law and is therefore upheld.

   20. No anonymity direction was made  by  the  FTTJ,  however,  given  the
       revelations as  to  the  treatment  the  appellant  appears  to  have
       suffered during his relationship with LH, I consider  it  appropriate
       to make the following anonymity direction:

"Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. "

  Conclusions

  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
  making of an error on a point of law.

  The decision of the FTTJ is upheld.
