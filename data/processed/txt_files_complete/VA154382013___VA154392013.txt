For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Malik  promulgated  on  25th  April  2014,  following  a  "paper
    hearing", in which the judge had refused the appeals of Mr  Rana  Azhar
    Ahmad Khan and his wife Mrs Maryam Saddiqa, both of  whom  subsequently
    applied for, and were  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife respectively.  The first Appellant,
    the husband, was born on 2nd March 1972.   The  second  Appellant,  his
    wife, was born on 15th July 1987.  Both are citizens of Pakistan.  Both
    applied for a visitor's visa  in  order  to  visit  their  Sponsor  and
    relative, Mr Arshad Mahmood, who is the first Appellant's brother,  and
    the second Appellant's brother-in-law.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The Appellants' claim is that the ECO was already  satisfied  that  the
    Sponsor could pay for the  Appellants'  maintenance  and  accommodation
    once they had visited in the UK.  The Appellant had stated  his  income
    was �544 per month from his jewellers  business  which  operated  since
    14th August 2011.  He had provided a letter  from  the  Anuman-e-Tajran
    Chenab Nagar and a  bank  statement.   The  bank  statement  showed  an
    increasing balance from �299 on 6th December 2012 to  �15,593  on  14th
    May 2013.  It is true that the ECO had  held  that  the  provenance  of
    these funds could not  be  demonstrated.   However,  he  was  wrong  to
    conclude that the  Appellants  were  not  generally  seeking  entry  as
    visitors.  The review by the Entry Clearance Manager  on  19th  January
    2014 was also wrong in upholding the decision  of  the  original  Entry
    Clearance Officer.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that, given that the  first  Appellant,  Mr  Rana  Azhar
    Ahmad Khan "has supplied numerous documents in support  of  his  appeal
    that is in business as claimed ... I am satisfied  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities he is" (paragraph 8).  However, the judge then turned  to
    consider whether in "turning next to the issue of income" the Appellant
    could discharge the burden of proof that was upon  him  (see  paragraph
    9).  Here the judge held that the Appellant  could  not  discharge  the
    burden of proof.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds  of  application  state  that  given  that  the  judge  was
    satisfied that the principal Appellant was in business as he claimed it
    was wrong to have dismissed the appeal.

 6. On 2nd July 2014 permission to appeal was granted on the basis that "it
    is arguable that the judge applied a too high standard of proof".

Submissions

 7. At the hearing before me the Appellants were  again  unrepresented  and
    the Sponsor, Mr Arshad Mahmood,  was  also  not  in  attendance.   With
    respect to the Respondent, Mr D Mills, a Senior Home Office  Presenting
    Officer, was in attendance.  He submitted that the judge was  perfectly
    entitled to conclude that the first Appellant was in business,  and  at
    the same time to find that, the income derived from  the  business  was
    not such as to enable the first Appellant to discharge  the  burden  of
    proof that was upon him.

No Error of Law

 8. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside this decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.  This is a case where the judge considered the evidence  in
    the round.  He approached the matter comprehensively.  He decided  that
    the Appellant, on the basis of  the  documentation  provided  from  the
    bank, and in the form of a letter, was generally in business.  However,
    it is also the case that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  expressed
    concern in this case that the Appellant's income had shot up from  �299
    on 6th December 2012 to �15,593 on 14th May 2013 (see paragraph 4).

 9. The question here was whether the Appellant generally was in receipt of
    such an income.  In a well crafted, and fully  reasoned  determination,
    the judge went on to hold (see paragraph 9) that  the  Appellant  could
    not discharge the burden of proof in this respect.  He was categoric in
    his statement that, "I am unable  to  determine  the  income  generated
    either through buying or selling".

10. He gave his reasons.  First, there  were  no  certified  completed  tax
    returns.  Second, the Appellant had not provided a credible explanation
    as to how the balance in his account increased to over �15,000.  Third,
    there was no reasonable evidence before the judge to indicate that  the
    funds in the business account were solely for the Appellants'  personal
    use to fund  the  trip.   Finally,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    Appellant derives an income from this land, and nor was there  evidence
    that he derived an income from his investments.

11. The judge was perfectly entitled to come  to  these  conclusions.   The
    findings were open to him.  The decision is in no way irrational.

Decision

12. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

13. No anonymity order is made.
