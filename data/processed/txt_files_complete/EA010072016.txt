Before:                                             Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt



	Between:             

Earl Nathaniel Williams

Appellant

and



Secretary of State for the Home Department

Respondent

	

	Decision and Reasons 

		

			The Tribunal issued a decision on 20 June 2018 requesting that the parties provide written reasons within 7 days as to why an error of law should not be found and the appeal remitted to the First-tier Tribunal following Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. 

			No response was received from either party within 7 days. 

			The Tribunal therefore finds an error of law, sets aside the decision dated 10 May 2017 of First-Tier Tribunal McMahon and remits the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made de novo.



		Signed:				Dated: 29 June 2018
