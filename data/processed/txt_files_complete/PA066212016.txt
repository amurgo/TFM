Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr A Devlin, Advocate, instructed by Livingstone
                 Brown, Solicitors
For the Respondent:   Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 10 June 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bradshaw dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 18 April 2017.

 3. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23  (1A),  the
    appellant's application for permission to  appeal  now  stands  as  the
    notice of appeal to the UT.   The  grounds  therein,  in  summary,  are
    these:




      Ground 1

      At �82 the judge said, "However, the appellant was not  'tortured'  as
      claimed by her until 17 January 2013 so the reason her husband did not
      come in September 2012 could not have been that he  learned  that  his
      wife had been arrested and tortured". The definition of torture is not
      limited to physical torture  as  experienced  by  the  appellant  when
      detained on 17th of January 2013 but [includes] mental torture and the
      appellant has detailed various occasions when she was detained for the
      weekend. The remit of article 3  is  wider  than  simply  torture  and
      includes... other forms of inhumane and degrading conditions.

      In any event, the appellant explained that her husband was informed of
      her house being repossessed by  the  authorities  and  this  was  what
      prompted him not to return to the Gambia (�29-30, page 10, appellant's
      inventory of productions, bundle 1).

      Ground 2.

      The judge erred in law in placing no weight on the "attestation"  from
      the appellant's mother and brother (�108 of the decision) and refusing
      to give any weight to two bail documents ... (�109) as these documents
      corroborated the appellant's reasons  for  seeking  protection.  These
      documents should have been considered individually and  to  their  own
      merits ...  as  opposed  to  concluding  "these  documents  have  been
      produced to improve the appellant's chances of success ...".

 4. Mr Matthews did not concede that there was any merit in  ground  1.  On
    ground 2, he said that while the fault might be only that the  decision
    is poorly expressed at �108-9, it does give the impression that adverse
    conclusions  have  been  reached  before  turning  to  the  documentary
    evidence, a structural flaw which renders the decision unsafe.

 5. The following outcome was agreed between the parties.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Bradshaw.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
