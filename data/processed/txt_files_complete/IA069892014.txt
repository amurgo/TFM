For the Appellant:     Ms A Muzira (Solicitor)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ghaffar,  promulgated  on  15th  September  2014,  following  the
    hearing at Birmingham Sheldon  Court  on  29th  August  2014.   In  the
    determination, the judge allowed the appeal of Malik  Khurram  Murtaza.
    The Respondent Secretary of State, subsequently applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  15th
    December 1985.  He appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 20th January 2014  refusing  to  grant  him  a
    residence card  under  the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is based upon his marriage to a EEA  national,  a
    Kinga Kondrakiewicz, who is a national of Poland, and therefore an  EEA
    national, who the Appellant maintains has been self-employed in the UK,
    and therefore exercising her treaty rights.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge  held  that  the  Appellant  was  validly  married  to  Kinga
    Kondrakiewicz, and they had a child, Eliasz  Pawel  Kondrakiewicz,  and
    there was no issue in relation to this fact (paragraph 14).  He went on
    to conclude that the Sponsor, Kinga Kondrakiewicz,  was  self-employed,
    and trading via an eBay account.  He found that "this  amounts  to  her
    exercising her treaty rights".  The  judge  also  noted  that  "she  is
    making national insurance contributions and there is a  certificate  of
    comprehensive health insurance cover" and "there is a wealth  of  other
    documents, some from her accountant uncle" (paragraph 15).

 5. Accordingly, the appeal of the Appellant was allowed  under  Regulation
    17 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on  the
    basis that the Appellant was  the  family  member  of  a  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights in the UK.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge wrongly found that  the
    Appellant was self-employed and trading via an eBay account  (paragraph
    15) because national insurance contributions alone  are  not  proof  of
    employment as they can be paid voluntarily, and the judge had given  no
    indication what the other documents were, and what period they  related
    to, or how much, if an income, was being generated on the eBay  trading
    account around the hearing date.  The judge's conclusions with  respect
    to the Sponsor's employment, and  that  she  was  self-sufficient  were
    unsustainable in the light of Regulation 4 which defined a worker and a
    self-employed person, and sufficient resources must be such  so  as  to
    prevent a person from  becoming  a  burden  on  the  social  assistance
    systems of the United Kingdom.  More importantly, having  comprehensive
    sickness  insurance  cover  was  not  in  itself  enough  because  this
    requirement "shall only be satisfied if he and his family members  have
    such cover", which was not the case here.

 7. On 28th October 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 2nd December 2014, Mr Armstrong, on  behalf
    of the Respondent Secretary of State, submitted that he would rely upon
    the Grounds of Appeal.  The judge had erred in the following  respects.
    First, the judge erred at paragraph 15 in concluding that just  because
    national insurance contributions were being made (which could  be  made
    voluntarily  in  any  event)  were  just  because   the   Sponsor   had
    comprehensive health insurance cover (which  had  to  be  comprehensive
    cover that related not just to the Sponsor but to the entire family  as
    well), the Appellant would succeed.  This was not the case.  A  finding
    of an error of law had to be made so  that  the  Appellant  could  make
    another application.

 9. For her part, Ms Muzira submitted that she relied upon the  grounds  of
    the Appellant and the skeleton argument that was before the Immigration
    Judge.  This was a case where  the  Appellant  had  paid  tax  on  18th
    October and this was recognised in the refusal letter (as well as  page
    3 to 6 of the Appellant's bundle, which  showed  tax  of  �32.40  being
    paid).  This evidence was irrefutable (including the  evidence  at  the
    supplementary  bundle  which  showed  tax  of  �70  being  paid).   The
    Appellant was making class 2 national  insurance  contributions  (which
    were not  voluntary  contributions).   The  judge  had  regard  to  the
    documents because it is clear that  there  is  extensive  documentation
    (see page 206 of the application form).  As for the  Sponsor,  even  if
    she was trading via an eBay account, this did not mean that she was not
    self-employed.  She was making  a  profit  of  �753  on  one  occasion.
    Finally, the judge had regard to the guidance available at paragraph 16
    which shows that "self-sufficiency" can come from employment  or  self-
    employment or any of the family members legally working in the UK.   In
    reply, Mr Armstrong submitted that Regulation 4(b) makes it quite clear
    that comprehensive health insurance cover had to relate to  the  entire
    family.  In this case only the Sponsor had the health cover but not the
    Appellant.

Error of Law

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law such that I should  set  aside
    the decision and remake the decision (see Section 12 of TCEA 2007).  My
    reasons are as follows.

11. First, there is a question of "comprehensive health  insurance  cover".
    Regulation 4 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 makes it quite clear that "the requirement for that person to have
    comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United Kingdom shall only
    be satisfied if he  and  his  family  members  have  such  cover"  (see
    Regulation 4(2)(b)).   Second,  the  reference  to  a  "self-sufficient
    person" in Regulation 4(1)(c) means such as "not to become a burden  on
    the social assistance system of the United Kingdom during his period of
    residence".  This is a case where the Sponsor alone  has  comprehensive
    sickness insurance cover.  The Appellant does not and the rest  of  the
    family do not.

12. Second, whether or not trading on eBay amounts to a proper  trade,  the
    fact is that the evidence has to show that the self-employed person  in
    question has "sufficient resources" such that he or she do not  "become
    a burden on the social assistance system" in the UK.

13. There is no evidence that this is the case.  It may be that  a  one-off
    profit of �753 was made on one occasion.  However,  the  evidence  does
    not show that the Sponsor was conducting a roaring trade  on  the  eBay
    account such that she was self-sufficient.  The judge's conclusions  at
    paragraph 15 are to that extent flawed.

Remaking the Decision

14. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings by the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am dismissing this appeal for the reasons set out above,  and
    in particular for the reason that only  the  Sponsor  here  has  had  a
    comprehensive sickness insurance cover.  The rest of the family do not.
     It is open to the Appellant to apply again on  the  basis  of  further
    evidence.

Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set the decision  of  the
    original judge.  I remake the decision  as  follows.   This  appeal  is
    dismissed.

16. No anonymity order is made.
