Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance

                                   NOTICE

 1. The Respondent Randy Libman is a national of the USA  born  12/07/1970.
    The Appellant is the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department.  For
    ease of reference in this notice I shall  refer  to  the  Secretary  of
    State as "the Respondent" and Randy Libman as "the Appellant", as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2.  In a  determination  promulgated  on  22nd  January  2014,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the
    Respondent's decision of 6th June 2013 refusing to grant him indefinite
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of  being  a  Work
    Permit  Holder.  However  having  dismissed  the   appeal   under   the
    Immigration Rules, the Judge noted that a decision to  refuse  to  vary
    leave to enter contained a removal  notice  under  Section  47  and  in
    paragraph 14 the Judge said as follows.

         "I note that a decision has also been made with regard  to  Section
         47 but following the decision in Ahmadi [2013] EWCA  Civ  512  this
         decision  is  remitted  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  further
         consideration".

 3. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision on the ground that the  Tribunal  had  made  a
    material misdirection of law; the reason being the decision  to  remove
    was made on 6th June 2013, therefore after 8th May 2013 and  benefitted
    from the amendments made by Section 51 of the  Crimes  and  Courts  Act
    2013 (which make the removal decision lawful).

 4. Matters were listed for a hearing  before  me,  in  order  to  consider
    whether the determination contained an error of law such that it should
    be set aside and, if appropriate, to proceed to remaking the decision.

 5. At the hearing before me on 7th May 2014, Mr Jack attended on behalf of
    the Respondent. He informed  me  that  the  Appellant  had  voluntarily
    departed from the United Kingdom for the United  State  of  America  on
    Sunday 10th November 2013. This was evidenced by a  disclaimer  in  the
    case of Voluntary Departure Form (IS101) duly signed by  the  Appellant
    together with a notice of flight  details  signed  by  the  Immigration
    Enforcement Team. Mr Jack asked that I treated the appeal as abandoned.



 6. I  am  satisfied  by  virtue  of  Section  104(4)  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and by paragraph 17a  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 that this appeal can  be  treated
    as abandoned. This notice is drawn up pursuant to Rule 17(5) to  inform
    the parties that the Appellant's case is treated as abandoned and there
    are no further proceedings before either the  Upper  Tribunal  nor  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made



Signature                                             Dated
