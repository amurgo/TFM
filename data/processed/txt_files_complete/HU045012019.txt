For the Respondent:    In Person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing Mrs  [I]'s  appeal  against
the respondent's decision to refuse her human rights claim.

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of  State  as  the  respondent  and  Mrs  [I]  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 20 May  1988.  She  entered
the UK on 12 July 2016 with entry clearance  as  a  spouse  valid  until  22
March 2019. On 2 February  2019  she  applied  for  leave  to  remain  under
Appendix FM on the basis of her family life  with  her  husband,  a  British
citizen.

The  appellant's  application  was  refused  on  21   February   2019.   Her
relationship with her husband was accepted but it was  considered  that  she
failed to meet the  eligibility  financial  requirements  in  paragraphs  E-
LTRP.3.1 to 3.4 because she had  failed  to  demonstrate  that  she  or  her
husband had an annual income of �18,600, either  individually  or  combined.
Although the appellant stated that her husband worked as an FC Associate  at
Amazon  UK  Services  and  earned  �21,840  per  annum,  the  gross   income
calculated from the 26 payslips provided for a six  month  period  prior  to
the date of the application gave a total of �8,672.52 which,  when  doubled,
equalled an annual income of �17,345.04. The respondent went on to  consider
paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM but considered there to be  no  evidence  that
there were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  Pakistan.
The requirements of Appendix FM  were  therefore  not  met.  The  respondent
considered further that the appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  in
paragraph 276ADE(1) on the basis of her private life and that there were  no
exceptional  circumstances  justifying  a  grant  of   leave   outside   the
immigration rules.

The appellant appealed that decision. In her grounds of  appeal  she  stated
that doubling the amount of the payslips did not  give  an  accurate  figure
for her husband's income as he had earned  less  than  usual  in  those  six
months owing to him missing work to accompany her to  medical  appointments,
but his annual salary was over �18,600. She stated that her  husband  had  a
second job as a part-time self-employed taxi driver, details  of  which  had
not previously been included in the application, as they believed  that  his
annual income from  his  employment  with  Amazon  UK  was  sufficient.  The
appellant submitted that the respondent's decision  was  in  breach  of  her
Article 8 rights and she referred to receiving fertility  treatment  in  the
UK which her husband was paying for privately.

With her grounds of appeal the appellant produced a  Statement  of  Earnings
from Amazon UK Services Ltd dated 27 February 2019 showing earnings for  her
husband for the tax year 2018/19 up to that date  of  �17,985.77;  a  letter
from Amazon UK confirming her husband's employment  from  2  December  2012,
paid on a weekly basis, at an annual salary of �21,840; a  P60  for  2017/18
for  employment  at  Amazon  Services  Ltd  showing  an  annual  income   of
�20,118,86;  evidence  of  fertility  treatment;  and  a  letter  from   her
husband's accountant together with his accounts for his self-employment.

 The appellant's appeal was heard in the First-tier  Tribunal  on  29  April
2019 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Brewer.  The  evidence  before  the  judge
consisted of the respondent's appeal bundle which  included  a  letter  from
Amazon UK Services Ltd dated 23  January  2019  confirming  the  appellant's
husband's annual salary of �21,840, the appellant's husband's  P60  for  the
tax year 2017-18 showing a gross annual income of �20,118.86 from Amazon  UK
Services Ltd,  the appellant's husband's payslips from 13  July  2018  to  1
February  2019  and  the  appellant's  husband's  bank  statements   showing
transactions from 3 September 2018  to  5  February  2019;  the  appellant's
grounds of appeal; and the appellant's appeal bundle including a  downloaded
HMRC list of Taxable Income together with the  appellant's  husband's  self-
assessment tax returns for April 2018/19 and a letter  from  his  accountant
together with his accounts for his self-employment.

Judge Brewer accepted that the documentation provided was not the  specified
evidence  required  by  the  Immigration  Rules  but  he   considered   that
currently, at the date of the hearing, he had  a  complete  picture  of  the
last two  years'  earnings  showing  that  the  appellant's  husband  earned
�20,118.86 to 5 April 2018  and  �19,686.43  to  5  April  2019.  The  judge
considered that, on the face  of  it,  the  application  met  the  financial
eligibility requirements of the rules. He concluded that,  for  the  purpose
of Article 8, there was no  legitimate  aim  since  the  appellant  met  the
immigration rules  and  the  decision  was  therefore  disproportionate.  He
accordingly allowed the appeal.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
grounds that the judge had made a  material  misdirection  in  law  and  had
erred in law by allowing the appeal  despite  acknowledging  that  the  HMRC
print-out was not a  specified  document  as  required  by  the  immigration
rules. Permission was granted in the First-tier Tribunal.

The matter then came before me.  The  appellant  and  her  husband  appeared
before me, accompanied by their neighbour and friend Mr  Bracken  who  acted
as a McKenzie Friend. I had before me three further  documents  received  by
the  Upper  Tribunal  on  11  September  and  submitted  under  Rule  15(2A)
consisting of the appellant's husband's P60  for  2018/19  showing  a  gross
annual income of �19,686.43, an HMRC  tax  calculation  for  2018/19  and  a
letter from HMRC dated 17 April 2019 enclosing the tax calculation.

Ms  Bassi  submitted  that  the  judge  had  erred  by  finding   that   the
requirements  of  the  rules  had  been  met,  despite  accepting  that  the
documents submitted were not specified documents. The appellant's  husband's
gross income had been calculated  in  accordance  with  paragraph  13(a)  of
Appendix FM-SE and on the basis of the evidence  produced,  fell  below  the
income threshold. The judge erred by relying upon  the  HMRC  print-out  and
that infected all his findings.  She  relied  on  the  case  of  Rhuppiah  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  UKSC  58  in  submitting
that the judge had  given  no  reason  for  accepting  the  downloaded  HMRC
Taxable Income at face value and  on  the  case  of  TZ  (Pakistan)  and  PG
(India) v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
1109 in submitting that the judge failed to follow the  structured  approach
to consideration  of  Article  8  and  did  not  consider  the  question  of
"insurmountable obstacles".

Mr Bracken advised me that the further HMRC documents were received the  day
after the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal  and  Judge  Brewer  was  aware
that they had been requested from the HMRC and accepted the downloaded  list
of Taxable Income instead.

Consideration and Findings

Judge Brewer allowed the appellant's appeal on  Article  8  grounds  on  the
basis that there could be no legitimate aim or public interest in  requiring
a person to leave to leave the UK who was able to meet the  requirements  of
the immigration rules. However the appellant was plainly not  able  to  meet
those requirements on the evidence submitted.

As Ms Bassi submitted, the respondent had calculated the  appellant's  gross
annual income on the basis of the  payslips  produced  for  the  six  months
prior to the application in line with paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE and  on
the basis of  that  calculation,  and  pursuant  to  paragraph  A1(2)(a)  of
Appendix FM-SE, found that the income threshold  of  �18,600  had  not  been
met. That was accepted by the judge. However, Judge Brewer went on  to  find
that the financial eligibility requirements of the rules had  been  met,  on
the face of it, on the  basis  of  the  HMRC  print-out  of  Taxable  Income
showing a total of �19,686.43 for the tax year  6  April  2018  to  5  April
2019, despite acknowledging at [16] that that was not specified evidence  as
required by the immigration rules. In so doing he appears to have  concluded
that an apparent  ability,  on  the  face  of  it,  to  meet  the  financial
eligibility requirements was sufficient to establish  that  the  immigration
rules had been met, despite the fact that the requirements of  Appendix  FM-
SE had not been met. However paragraph E-LTRP.3.1 of  Appendix  FM,  setting
out the level of specified gross annual income, specifically  requires  that
that income must be evidenced by specified evidence. Accordingly  the  judge
plainly erred in law in that respect.

As Ms Bassi submitted, that error then infected  the  rest  of  the  judge's
Article 8 assessment, as it was on the basis of his finding, at  [28],  that
the appellant was able to meet the requirements of  the  immigration  rules,
that  he  then  concluded  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  show  the
legitimate aim being pursued and that  the  decision  was  disproportionate.
The judge accordingly erred by summarily allowing the appeal  on  the  basis
that he did. He failed to go on to consider paragraph EX.1  of  Appendix  FM
and paragraph 276ADE(1) of the immigration rules and  failed  to  go  on  to
conduct  a  full  and  proper   proportionality   assessment   outside   the
immigration rules. Accordingly  the  judge's  decision  on  the  appellant's
Article 8 claim is simply unsustainable and has to be set aside.

In view of the fact that there has been no effective  Article  8  assessment
it seems to me that the appropriate course would be for  the  matter  to  be
remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  appellant  will  then  have  the
opportunity to ensure that all the required specified evidence  is  properly
collated and presented to the Tribunal so that a full and proper  assessment
may be made of her claim, both within and  outside  the  immigration  rules.
The appellant may find it beneficial to take  legal  advice  in  preparation
for that appeal.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed
and the decision is set aside.

The appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  pursuant  to  section
12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007  and  Practice
Statement 7.2(b), to be heard before any judge aside from Judge Brewer.
