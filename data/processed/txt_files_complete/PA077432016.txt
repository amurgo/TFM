For the Respondent:         Mr S.Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a Kurd who lived in Kirkuk. He worked for the
      British forces as an engineer and said he was threatened by ISIS. He
      also worked as a freelance journalist. He was writing an article on
      corruption within the Peshmerga. He said he received threats from
      both sides, causing him to leave his country. The respondent accepted
      his identity but not that he was threatened by ISIS or that he was a
      journalist. Because Kirkuk was a contested areas it was felt he could
      safely go to the I KR.


   2.  His appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal PA Grant
      Hutchinson and was dismissed in a decision promulgated on 11 April
      2017. He acknowledged that Kirkuk was a contested region and the
      intention was that the appellant would not be returned there.
      Instead, the plan was for him to go to the I KR. There, ISIS did not
      have a presence and would not present a risk. He accepted that he was
      a journalist and was at risk from corrupt Peshmerga in Kirkuk.
      However, he could relocate to the I KR where he would not be at risk.
      The appellant said he studied in Arabic and spoke Kurdish, Arabic and
      some English. He concluded he would be able to obtain employment
      there, pointing out he was young, healthy, spoke the language and had
      qualifications.

   3. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis the appellant could not
      be returned to the IKR because he was not Kurdish. This misstates the
      undisputed factual position that he is Kurdish. Permission was
      granted on the basis it was arguable the judge erred in law in not
      applying the guidance set out in AA Iraq [2015 ]UK UT 544, section E.
      This deals with returns to the IKR. It is not apparent if the Upper
      Tribunal Judge in granting leave was aware the factual background had
      been materially misstated. A discrete ground in the application was
      that the judge failed to enquire about documentation to facilitate
      return or the factors set out in D 15 of AA Iraq [2015] UK UT 544
      concerning relocation to Baghdad. These include the availability of a
      CSID, the ability to speak Arabic and family support.

   4. The presenting officer acknowledged that the decision of the First-
      tier judge failed to set out the relevant factors for the return to
      Baghdad. The refusal however is primarily on the basis that removal
      to Baghdad would be for purposes of transit to the I KR. The
      presenting officer submitted that whilst the judge made no specific
      findings about the appellant's contact with his family the appellant
      had indicated the existence of family. I was referred to questions 15-
      16, 47, and 48 of his substantive interview where he denied being in
      contact with his family and said he could not find any way to
      telephone. At question 110 and 111 he repeated that he could not
      manage to contact his family. It was pointed out that at screening
      the appellant said he had worked as an engineer and as a journalist
      and that he spoke Arabic. It was submitted that he would be able to
      obtain employment and the transition would be assisted by the
      voluntary assistance package.

   5.  Mr McGlashan submitted that the judge materially erred in law and
      that the appeal should be remitted for a fresh hearing. The judge had
      accepted he had written about Peshmerga corruption and would be at
      risk in Kirkuk. He submitted that for the same reason he would be at
      risk in the I KR. He submitted that given what was happening in the
      country it was possible his family would be lying low. He said that
      the country guidance was silent as to travel beyond Baghdad. He said
      the appellant would be travelling on a laissez-passer which would be
      taken from him on arrival in Baghdad. The appellant has always lived
      in Kirkuk. He cannot stay there and the judge acknowledged the risk
      there. He referred to the cost of travel by air from Baghdad to Erbil
      which he put at ï¿½200 .He submitted there was no evidence the
      appellant would have access to such funds. He said there were
      2,000,000 displaced people in the I KR. The appellant would need to
      register there and the Peshmerga would be aware about his background.
      He submitted that it would be too dangerous for him to relocate to
      the I KR.

Consideration.

   6. The evidence was that the appellant is educated to graduate level and
      worked as an engineer as well as in journalism. He spoke Kurdish,
      Arabic and some English. He was a young single male with no
      significant health problems. The judge concluded he was likely to be
      able to obtain employment on return.


   7.  It is known he has family in Iraq. He referred to his father being
      able to make arrangements for his departure. He also referred to help
      given by his married brother. There was a telephone in their home but
      he said he had been unable to make contact.

   8. When he came to the United Kingdom he brought documentation to
      support his claim. He brought his degree certificate. He provided his
      journalist union card. He brought a letter of recommendation from a
      British soldier in respect of the work he did. He was able to provide
      his Iraqi identity card number. He did not produce a passport but he
      indicated he had been issued with one. It is my conclusion from this
      and the fact he has family members in Iraq he should have little
      difficulty in establishing his identity with the Iraqi authorities.
      Following from this, I conclude he would be able to obtain the CSID
      necessary to access aid within the country. For the same reason I
      find he would be able to obtain the necessary travel documentation.

   9. He is not from the IKR.There are direct flights there from the United
      Kingdom but he would not be flown directly because he does not
      originate from there.Instead, he would be flown to Baghdad. The
      intention is that this would be a transitional move for onward travel
      within the country to the IKR.Available information indicates air
      travel to Baghdad and from there to Erbil is feasible. Should he have
      to remain in Baghdad for any length of time then the country
      information indicates that he would not face a 15(c) risk there. I
      can see no reason why, given his background, he could not establish
      himself there.

  10.  In any event, the intention is that he will only be in transit. It
      was suggested by Mr McGlashan that he would be stranded in
      Baghadad.He suggested his laissez-passer would be taken from him and
      the county guidance case was silent about the documentation required
      for onward travel. There was also the likely cost of airfare.

  11.  The nature of a laissez-passer is that it is issued by the Iraqi
      authorities here to facilitate return. If this is taken from the
      appellant on arrival at Baghdad airport the country guidance case is
      silent as to the need for documentation for onward travel within the
      country. Put another way, I have not been referred to any evidence
      that further documentation is required for travel within Iraq. The
      onus is not on the respondent to prove in each case what documents
      are required to board an internal flight from Baghdad to the IKR.Nor
      does she have to show that the appellant has them or can access them.
      Paragraph 170 of the County Guidance case was a discussion on
      internal relocation which does not make its way into the head note.
      The Court of Appeal's comments on para 170 (AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ
      944) does not affect my conclusion as I find he would be entitled to
      a laissez-passer.

  12. Consequently, on the basis the appellant can get to the IKR the judge
      has already indicated his likely employment prospects. He has
      experience. He is Kurdish. He also speaks Arabic and has some
      English. He will have the benefit of the assisted return and the
      local aid packages. He has family in country that should be able to
      assist.

  13. For these reasons I find the grounds and the submissions on behalf of
      the appellant do not show a material error of law in the decision of
      the First tier Tribunal. Consequently it shall stand.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed and the First Tier Tribunal decision shall stand.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly
