                            DECISION AND REASONS


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. J Flynn, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr. M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer.

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria who seeks an EEA  family  permit
    as the spouse of an Irish national who resides in Northern Ireland. Her
    application falls to be  considered  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ('the 2016 Regulations').

 2. Her appeal was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fox)
    by a decision dated 19 December 2019. She  was  granted  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal and by a decision  dated  17  February  2021  I
    allowed her appeal to the extent that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside, and the decision  was  to  be  remade  by  this
    Tribunal. No findings of fact were kept.

Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Microsoft Teams  video  conference  hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by Mr. Flynn and Mr. Diwnycz in exactly the same way as if we
    were  together  in  the  hearing  room.  I  am  satisfied:  that   this
    constituted a hearing in open court; that the  open  justice  principle
    has been secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that,  insofar
    as there has been any  restriction  on  a  right  or  interest,  it  is
    justified as necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. No anonymity direction was issued by the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  no
    application for such direction was sought by the parties.

Background

 5. The appellant is a national of Nigeria and is presently aged 30. She is
    married to Mr. John Flynn, a national of the Republic  of  Ireland  who
    resides in Northern Ireland.

 6. The couple met in 2010 and a relationship  commenced  thereafter.  They
    agreed to marry in 2014 and officially became engaged in 2016, with  an
    engagement ring being purchased. They married in December  2016.  Prior
    to the application for an EEA Family Permit,  the  couple  met  between
    three to six times a year in Nigeria, spending between six and fourteen
    weeks a year living together.

 7. The application for an EEA Family Permit was made  in  April  2017  and
    refused by an entry clearance officer ('ECO') whose decision was  dated
    13 June 2017. It was not accepted that the  appellant  had  established
    that she was a family member of her sponsor, Mr. Flynn: regulation 7 of
    the  2016  Regulations.  Alternatively,  the  ECO  concluded  that  the
    appellant was not in a  durable  relationship  with  an  EEA  national:
    regulation 8(5) of the 2016 Regulations.

 8. An entry clearance manager ('ECM') confirmed the decision on 10 January
    2019. Somewhat surprisingly, the ECM believed that the ECO had  refused
    the application on 'marriage of convenience' grounds and  proceeded  to
    reaffirm the decision, purportedly made with  reference  to  regulation
    2(1) of the 2016 Regulations, on this basis. It was  not  said  in  the
    alternative that the marriage was not genuine or subsisting.

 9. I note at this juncture that there is no reference to  regulation  2(1)
    in the ECO's decision nor is a reasonable  suspicion  raised  that  the
    marriage was one of convenience.

Evidence

10. Before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  relied  upon  detailed
    evidence as corroborating the genuine intentions of  both  herself  and
    Mr. Flynn when they entered into their marriage. Such evidence included
    a letter from the appellant  which  stood  as  her  witness  statement;
    photographs of the couple taken over various  years  between  2010  and
    2017; photographs of the couple's wedding; email correspondence between
    the couple from 2012 to 2015 which predates the wedding; a receipt  for
    the appellant's engagement  ring;  records  of  WhatsApp  communication
    between the  couple  from  2017  to  2018  and  evidence  of  financial
    remittances from Mr. Flynn to the appellant.

11. The email correspondence relied upon runs to 10 pages and the  WhatsApp
    records run to 93 pages. They  clearly  evidence  a  close  and  loving
    relationship between the couple.

12. Also filed with the Tribunal was evidence of Mr. Flynn's regular visits
    to Nigeria in the form of a copy of his  passport  with  relevant  visa
    stamps for the years 2010,  2011,  2014,  2015,  2016  and  2017.  This
    evidence was submitted with the appeal notice filed in January 2019.

13. At the hearing before me the appellant relied upon a  307-page  bundle.
    Included within  the  document  were  letters  from  two  long-standing
    friends of Mr. Flynn, namely Dr. Patrick McIlwee and Mr.  David  Brown,
    attesting to their regular contact with the appellant when  they  visit
    Nigeria and her lengthy and loving relationship with Mr. Flynn.

Law

14. The burden is upon the  appellant  to  establish  that  she  meets  the
    requirements of the 2016 Regulations.  The standard  of  proof  is  the
    ordinary civil standard, namely the balance of probabilities.

15. Further considerations  arise  where  the  respondent  asserts  that  a
    marriage  is  one  of  'convenience'  and  therefore  falls  under  the
    definition of such marriage at regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations.
    The Court of Appeal confirmed in Rosa v. Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 14; [2016] 1 WLR 1206 that in  EU  free
    movement law cases the burden for proving that a  marriage  is  one  of
    'convenience' rests with the respondent. As the Supreme Court  observed
    in Sadovska v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]  UKSC
    54; [2017] 1 WLR 2926 as  to  the  burden  of  proof  in  'marriage  of
    convenience' cases: 'One of the most basic rules of litigation is  that
    he who asserts must prove'.

16. In Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT
    00038 (IAC), [2012] Imm AR 447, at [37] this Tribunal confirmed:

         '37. It is not enough that the ECO honestly  suspects  there  is  a
             marriage  of  convenience;   the   claimant   will   only   be
             disqualified  if  it  is  established  that  it  is.   Adverse
             inferences may be drawn by a  claimant's  failure  to  provide
             data reasonably open to her in the course of the investigation
             or appeal; but that cannot form the sole  or  decisive  reason
             for the conclusion. ...'

17. The approach adopted in Papajorgji was endorsed by the Court of  Appeal
    in Agho v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    1198, [2016] I.N.L.R. 411 and approved by the Court of Appeal in  Rosa,
    at [24].

18. The Supreme Court in Sadovska further approved the approach adopted  in
    Papajorgji that the Tribunal is to form its own view of the facts  from
    the evidence presented.

19. The Court of Appeal held in Rosa  that  the  focus  in  relation  to  a
    marriage of convenience ought to be on the intention of the parties  at
    the time the marriage was entered into, whereas the question of whether
    a marriage was subsisting looked to whether  the  marital  relationship
    was a continuing one. Nonetheless, the Court confirmed that the  First-
    tier Tribunal was correct to have looked at the evidence concerning the
    relationship between the claimant and the sponsor  after  the  marriage
    itself, since that was capable of casting light on their  intention  at
    the time of marriage.

20. I observe at this juncture that the ECO only considered the marriage in
    terms of whether it was subsisting,  and  therefore  on  its  face  the
    decision implicitly accepts that the intentions of the couple when they
    married were genuine. The ECM was simply erroneous when asserting  that
    the ECO had concluded the  marriage  to  be  one  of  convenience.  Mr.
    Diwnycz accepted before me that such conclusion could not  properly  be
    drawn from the ECO's decision. I address this in more detail below.

21. I observe that the European Commission has produced guidance  by  means
    of a handbook addressing the issue of 'alleged marriages of convenience
    between EU citizens and non-EU citizens in the context of EU law':  ref
    SWD (2014) 284 final (26 September 2014).  It  defines  a  marriage  of
    convenience as a marriage contracted for  the  predominant  purpose  of
    conferring a right of free movement and residence under  EU  law  to  a
    person who would otherwise not have such a right and explains  that  as
    'sole purpose' is an  autonomous  EU  law  concept  it  is  not  to  be
    interpreted literally as being the unique or exclusive  purpose.  There
    is no definition of 'predominant' but the handbook indicates  that  the
    phrase is used because someone may have more than one  abusive  purpose
    (such as a tax advantage). The key is whether there is abuse.

22. The Supreme Court considered the guidance offered by  the  handbook  in
    Sadovska, [29]:

         '29. ... Although it is defined  in  the  Directive  and  the  2009
             Communication as a marriage the sole purpose of  which  is  to
             gain rights of entry to and residence in the  European  Union,
             the 2014 Handbook suggests a more flexible approach, in  which
             this must be the predominant purpose. It is  not  enough  that
             the  marriage  may  bring  incidental  immigration  and  other
             benefits if this is not its predominant purpose.  Furthermore,
             except in cases of deceit by the non-EU national, this must be
             the purpose of them both. Clearly, a non-EU  national  may  be
             guilty of abuse when the  EU  national  is  not,  because  she
             believes that it is a genuine relationship.'

23. Therefore, the objective to obtain the right  of  entry  and  residence
    must be  the  predominant  purpose  for  the  marriage  to  be  one  of
    convenience and a marriage cannot be considered to  be  a  marriage  of
    convenience simply because it brought an immigration advantage.

Decision

24. At the commencement of the hearing Mr. Diwnycz  confirmed  that  having
    read the decisions of the ECO and the  ECM  as  well  as  the  evidence
    relied upon by the appellant, he presented  little  resistance  to  the
    appellant's appeal, observing that he had no  instructions  to  concede
    the appeal.

25. Mr. Diwnycz further confirmed that it was not  reasonably  possible  to
    read  the  ECO's  decision  in  this  matter  as  asserting  that   the
    applicant's marriage to Mr. Flynn was one of convenience. The  decision
    of the ECO was very clearly  concerned  solely  with  the  genuine  and
    subsisting nature of the marriage, and not the intentions held  by  the
    couple when they entered into it.

26. I am satisfied that Mr. Diwnycz  was  correct  to  adopt  the  approach
    adopted. It is entirely clear from the evidence presented  to  the  ECO
    and subsequently filed with this Tribunal that the appellant  has  been
    in a genuine, long-term and loving  relationship  with  Mr.  Flynn  for
    several years prior to the marriage. It is clearly established that Mr.
    Flynn has through his employment regularly worked in West  Africa,  and
    in particular Nigeria. There is photographic  evidence  of  the  couple
    having known each other since 2010 and both  photographic  and  written
    evidence as to their relationship having developed and blossomed  since
    such date. The email and WhatsApp  communication  between  the  parties
    clearly identify a loving and close relationship.  There  are  messages
    written in 2013 that confirm Mr. Flynn's intentions to spend  his  life
    with the appellant once his divorce is finalised. Emails from this time
    confirm that Mr. Flynn was in communication with the appellant's family
    and also as to his family  knowing  about  his  relationship  with  the
    appellant,  which   strongly   indicates   the   genuineness   of   the
    relationship.

27. I am satisfied that consequent to the issuing of a decree  absolute  in
    April 2014 Mr. Flynn felt able later that year to ask the appellant  to
    marry him. The fact that an engagement ring was bought in 2016 does not
    undermine the email evidence of the continuing, loving bond between the
    couple after 2014.

28. Mr. McIlwee confirmed that he is a  business  consultant  who  met  Mr.
    Flynn in  Nigeria  in  or  around  2010  and  met  the  appellant  soon
    afterwards. He has conveyed presents between  the  United  Kingdom  and
    Nigeria on behalf of the couple over  the  years  to  help  bypass  the
    difficulties inherent in the  Nigerian  postal  service.  He  has  also
    passed on personal messages between the couple.

29. Mr. Brown detailed by means of his letter, dated 13 March 2017, that he
    has known Mr. Flynn for over 25 years and had  regularly  travelled  to
    Nigeria with him over some 8 years as at the date of  the  letter.  Mr.
    Brown was introduced to the appellant in 2010  and  has  met  her  many
    times since. He watched the relationship develop over the years and was
    invited to the wedding in December  2016  though,  ultimately,  he  was
    unable to attend.

30. The respondent's case before me is solely that the marriage is  one  of
    convenience. The appellant has filed with the Tribunal a  copy  of  her
    marriage certificate confirming  her  marriage  to  Mr.  Flynn  at  the
    Federal Marriage Registry, Lagos, on 17 December 2016. The legal burden
    falls upon the respondent to establish that there is  evidence  capable
    of establishing a reasonable suspicion that  the  marriage  is  one  of
    convenience,  thereby  transferring  the  burden  of  proof  onto   the
    appellant. I find that the respondent is simply  incapable  of  meeting
    the required threshold. The evidence submitted, both to  the  ECO,  and
    now before this Tribunal  can  only  be  considered  to  establish  the
    genuine nature of the couple's long-term  relationship  and  that  they
    entered the marriage  with  genuine  intentions  to  live  together  as
    husband and wife. No reasonable suspicion as to the genuine  intentions
    of the couple can properly be identified in this matter.

31. For the sake of completeness, I  am  satisfied  having  considered  the
    evidence before me that the marriage is genuine and subsisting.

32. In the circumstances, the appellant's appeal is allowed.

Postscript

33. The appellant applied for an EEA Family Permit in April 2017. As I have
    concluded above, the marriage is a loving one and Mr. Flynn enjoyed the
    right as an EEA national exercising EEA Treaty rights in  this  country
    to be joined by his wife.

34. The application was refused by an ECO in June 2017. I observe that  the
    decision provides limited  express  consideration  of  the  documentary
    evidence relied upon  and  adopts  a  narrow  approach  of  criticizing
    perceived inconsistencies without engaging with the wider corroborative
    evidence.

35. Consequent to a failure by the ECO to note that an  EEA  Family  Permit
    could at the relevant time only be refused in respect of  a  spouse  if
    there  was  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  marriage  is  one   of
    convenience, the application was erroneously refused  on  'genuine  and
    subsisting' grounds which played no part in the consideration  of  this
    application, with an alternative decision that the couple were not in a
    durable relationship. As the marriage was not considered to be  one  of
    convenience, the EEA Family Permit should properly have been granted.

36. Almost 4 years has now passed since the ECO failed  to  appreciate  the
    true legal position.

37. The appellant filed  an  appeal,  which  was  initially  considered  on
    'review' by an ECM. I have considerable  concern  as  to  the  approach
    adopted by the review  decision,  dated  10  January  2019,  which  was
    undertaken some 10 months after the appeal was lodged.

38. Firstly, whilst not critical for the purposes of this matter,  the  ECM
    proceeded on the basis that Mr. Flynn was 'an  EEA  national  of  Irish
    descent'. Mr. Flynn is an Irish citizen and an EEA  national.  He  does
    not hold British  citizenship.  Whether  he  is  Irish  by  descent  is
    irrelevant to the consideration of the appellant's application.

39. Secondly, the introduction to the ECM's decision detailed,

         'The ECO was satisfied that the appellant's  marriage  to  her  EEA
         sponsor was one of convenience  and  her  application  was  refused
         under Reg 2(1) which defines a 'spouse' not to include a party to a
         marriage of convenience.'

40. The ECM then proceeded to outline with clarity  the  relevant  law  and
    precedent concerned with the consideration of marriages of convenience.
    I am satisfied that this establishes that  the  ECM  had  a  clear  and
    correct understanding of the relevant law.

41. The ECM concluded that the ECO had discharged the burden  of  proof  by
    raising  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  marriage   was   one   of
    convenience. The ECO was said to have  based  such  conclusion  on  the
    absence  of  'any  evidence  to  the  effect  that  [the   appellant's]
    relationship with her EEA national spouse did in fact continue,  beyond
    the marriage certificate and some photographs in support of her case'.

42. It is abundantly clear from the ECO's decision that no  such  suspicion
    as to the marriage being one of convenience was expressly raised. It is
    of grave concern to this Tribunal that the ECM took such  a  course  of
    action. It strongly suggests a clear understanding that  consequent  to
    the ECO's reasoning an EEA Family Permit should have been  granted.  It
    further strongly suggests an effort being made  to  distort  the  ECO's
    reasoning to ground an alternative basis for refusal. The fact that the
    ECO had not raised a reasonable suspicion required the  ECM  to  invent
    the ECO as having had such suspicion. On the papers  before  me,  I  am
    satisfied that the approach adopted was inappropriate. If it  had  been
    undertaken by a legal representative before  me,  I  would  have  given
    serious consideration to exercising the Tribunal's 'Hamid' jurisdiction
    and considered whether to take steps to report the legal representative
    to their professional regulator: R. (on the  application  of  Hamid)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWHC 3070 (Admin).

43. A further concern is that  having  secured  legal  representation,  the
    appellant filed with her appeal notice further documentary evidence  as
    to her relationship with Mr. Flynn, including email and  phone  records
    as well as copies of Mr. Flynn's passport stamps confirming his regular
    admission into Nigeria. The ECM  failed  to  expressly  consider  these
    documents, as required on review, and  failed  to  place  them  in  the
    bundle which was served upon the Tribunal. The failure to consider such
    evidence, which clearly established the strength of  the  relationship,
    strongly suggests that the ECM adopted from the outset a position  that
    the review's conclusion was to be a  negative  one.  Such  approach  is
    wholly inappropriate.

44. Almost 2 � years has now passed since  the  ECM  adopted  an  irregular
    approach to the consideration of this matter.

45. It is unfortunate that the appeal proceeded to the First-tier  Tribunal
    where a decision was issued that was  wholly  unsatisfactory,  for  the
    reasons detailed in my decision dated 17 February 2021.

46. I am satisfied on considering the papers before me that both  the  ECO,
    and in particular the ECM, wholly failed to properly recognise that the
    right enjoyed by Mr. Flynn to reside in this country with his wife  was
    established by EU law. Upon confirming that the appellant's appeal  was
    allowed at the hearing I observed Mr. Flynn, a professional man used to
    the rigours of the World, break down with emotion. He explained  to  me
    the  stress  and  strain  that  being  separated  from  his  wife   and
    participating in these proceedings has placed upon him over the last  4
    years. I am satisfied that the appellant should have  been  granted  an
    EEA Family Permit in 2017, and at the very least upon the conclusion of
    an  appropriately  conducted   review   in   January   2019.   In   the
    circumstances, a loving couple engaged in a genuine  relationship  have
    been separated for over  4  years  consequent  to  very  poor  decision
    making. Such process as has been adopted by the ECO, and in  particular
    the ECM, in this matter is of grave concern to the Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

47. By means of a decision dated 17 February 2021 this Tribunal set aside a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated  on  19  December  2019
    pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal,  Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007.

48. The decision on the appellant's appeal on this issue  is  re-made,  and
    the appeal is allowed.

To the Respondent
Fee Award

The appellant's appeal has been allowed. For  the  reasons  detailed  above,
the respondent's defence of this matter was unreasonable  from  the  outset.
The initial application for an EEA Family Permit should properly  have  been
allowed.

In the circumstances the appellant is awarded her fee of �280.
