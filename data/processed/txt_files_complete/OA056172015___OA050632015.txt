                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first respondent is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 23 April 1984.
    She is married  to  a  British  citizen  ("the  sponsor").  The  second
    respondent, who was born on 1 January 2012, is their daughter.

 2. The respondents' application for entry clearance  as  the  partner  and
    child of a British citizen was rejected on the basis that the sponsor's
    earnings were insufficient to meet  the  income  threshold  requirement
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. It was  also  not  accepted
    that there were exceptional  circumstances  that  would  warrant  entry
    clearance being granted outside the Rules under Article 8 ECHR.

 3. The respondents' appealed and their  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Jones. In a decision promulgated on 8  April  2016,  the
    judge allowed the appeal on human rights grounds. That decision is  now
    being appealed by the appellant.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The judge found that prior to the  application  the  sponsor  earned  a
    gross monthly salary of �2,083.33, which equates to an annual income of
    �25,000. However, he was only paid for ten of the twelve months  before
    the application (as he took unpaid leave to assist the respondents with
    making  their  application)  and  therefore  his   total   income   was
    �20,833.30. As this amount is  below  the  threshold  of  �22,400,  the
    requirements of Appendix FM were not met. The judge therefore concluded
    that the respondents could not succeed under the  Rules.  However,  the
    judge found that there were compelling circumstances that warranted the
    appeal being allowed outside the Rules.

 5. In assessing  the  respondents'  circumstances,  the  judge  took  into
    account the challenges they faced in making the application as well  as
    the consequences they faced as  a  result  of  making  an  unsuccessful
    application. As found by the judge, these are as follows:

      a. The first respondent left Afghanistan in 2000 and had  been  living
         (with the second respondent since her birth) in Iran.

      b. On 19 October 2014 the sponsor travelled  to  Iran  to  assist  the
         respondents with their application.

      c. It was not possible to apply for entry  clearance  from  Iran.  The
         respondents  and  the  sponsor  therefore  decided  to  travel   to
         Afghanistan. Before the first respondent  was  permitted  to  leave
         Iran she was kept for 2 -3 weeks in a deportation centre.

      d. On 10 November 2014 they travelled  to  Afghanistan.  However,  the
         British embassy in Kabul could not deal with the application.

      e. They decided to travel to Islamabad, Pakistan.  This  required  the
         first respondent to obtain a new passport. On 29 November 2014 they
         travelled to Pakistan where they made the application.

      f. The respondents were not permitted to return to their home in Iran.
         They therefore moved to Afghanistan where  they  are  staying  with
         family in the Ghazni province.

      g. The sponsor is a British citizen and the Foreign  and  Commonwealth
         Office advises British nationals against travel to Ghazni province.



      h. Had the respondents  made  the  application  in  October  2014,  as
         planned, the income requirements under Appendix FM would have  been
         satisfied. The sponsor travelled with the  respondents  throughout.
         By the time the application was made, because the sponsor  had  not
         been working for about two months, the requirements  in  the  Rules
         could not met.

      i. Since returning to the UK, the sponsor has  changed  jobs  and  now
         earns a sum (approximately �21,000)  that  is  below  the  required
         threshold.  He does not anticipate being in a position  to  reapply
         for at least another 12 months.

 6. At paragraph [35] the judge set out three  reasons  why  he  considered
    there to be "compelling circumstances" that would warrant allowing  the
    appeal outside the Immigration Rules. Firstly, he noted that  the  best
    interests  of  a  child  are  involved  and  that  this  is  a  primary
    consideration  under  section  55  of  the  Borders   Citizenship   and
    Immigration Act 2009 ("Section 55"). He found  that  the  child's  best
    interests were to live with both her parents. Secondly, the judge found
    that the respondents have been unable to return to their home  in  Iran
    and forced to move to a country in which they feel unsafe. Thirdly, the
    judge found that the sponsor fears for his safety  in  Afghanistan  and
    that this  fear  is  supported  by  objective  evidence,  rendering  it
    unreasonable for him to be expected to move to Afghanistan to  be  with
    the respondents.

 7. At paragraph [37] the judge found that because  the  respondents  would
    have succeeded under the Rules if their application had been  made,  as
    planned, in October 2014 and the delay was a result of obstacles beyond
    their control, the case "is a 'near miss' within SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA
    Civ 387"

Grounds of appeal and submissions

 8. The grounds of appeal make four arguments. First, they contend that the
    judge erred in finding the respondents would not be  a  burden  on  the
    state because of the sponsor's income when  the  only  question  should
    have been whether the financial requirements under Appendix FM-SE  were
    met. The second ground submits that  the  judge  erred  by  considering
    Section 55 as this is  not  applicable  to  children  outside  the  UK.
    Thirdly, the grounds argue that the wrong test was applied  in  respect
    of whether family life could continue in  Afghanistan  -  the  test  is
    insurmountable  obstacles.  The  fourth  ground  is  that   the   judge
    improperly applied the "near miss" principle.

 9. In his submissions, Mr Whitwell focused on the  "near  miss"  argument,
    contending that the principle had been  misapplied  by  the  judge.  He
    relied on Patel and others [2013] UKSC 72 at [56] which provides that:

         "A near miss under the rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human
         rights case which is otherwise lacking in merit"

10. Mr Jaisri argued that  "near  miss"  is  a  factor  that  needs  to  be
    considered under Article 8.  He argued that if "near miss" was the only
    basis for the respondents' Article 8 claim, it would not be sufficient.
    However, there are other factors at play which taken together establish
    why respondents should succeed under Article 8.

Consideration

11.  The  near  miss  principle  in  the  context  of  an  entry  clearance
    application where the financial  requirements  are  not  satisfied  was
    recently considered by the Court of Appeal in SS Congo,  where  it  was
    held:

         "55. ... [The] fact that an applicant may be able to say that their
         case is a 'near miss' in relation to satisfying the requirements of
         the Rules will by no means show that compelling circumstances exist
         requiring the grant of LTE outside the Rules. A good deal more than
         this would  need  to  be  shown  to  make  out  such  a  case.  The
         respondents' argument fails to recognise the value to  be  attached
         to having a clear statement of the standards applicable to everyone
         and fails to give proper weight to the judgment of the Secretary of
         State, as expressed in the Rules, regarding what is needed to  meet
         the public interest which is in issue. The 'near miss' argument  of
         the  respondents  cannot  be  sustained  in  the  light  of   these
         considerations and the authority of Miah v Secretary of State  for
         the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26].

         56.  However, it cannot be said that the fact that a case  involves
         a 'near miss' in relation to the requirements set out in the  Rules
         is wholly irrelevant  to  the  balancing  exercise  required  under
         Article 8. If an applicant  can  show  that  there  are  individual
         interests at stake covered by Article 8 which give rise to a strong
         claim that compelling circumstances may exist to justify the  grant
         of LTE outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also a  'near
         miss' case may be a relevant consideration which tips  the  balance
         under Article 8 in their favour. In such a case, the applicant will
         be able to say that the detrimental impact on the  public  interest
         in issue if LTE is granted in their favour will  be  somewhat  less
         than in a case where the gap between the applicant's  position  and
         the requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that they  may
         end up having recourse to public funds and resources  is  therefore
         greater."

12. In my view,  the  present  case  falls  squarely  within  the  type  of
    circumstances contemplated by the Court of Appeal in SS Congo  where  a
    "near miss" argument could be viable. Reading the decision as a  whole,
    it is apparent that the judge did  not  find  there  to  be  compelling
    circumstances because the respondents came very close  to  meeting  the
    financial requirements or that but for the obstacles  they  faced  they
    would have met the requirements. Rather, the judge identified interests
    at stake covered by Article 8 which gave rise to a strong claim outside
    of Article 8 ECHR irrespective of whether the respondents were close to
    the financial threshold. These, in sum, are that  the  consequence  for
    the respondents of attempting  to  make  their  application  for  entry
    clearance has been that they have lost their ability to live  in  Iran,
    where they had hitherto been residing,  and  have  been  left  with  no
    choice  other  than  to  move  to  a  region   of   Afghanistan   where
    (understandably, given the objective evidence)  they  and  the  sponsor
    feel unsafe. Moreover, these  difficult  circumstances  do  not  solely
    affect adults, but also a small child who has now been unable  to  live
    with her father for a prolonged period. Taking these factors  together,
    the  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  were   compelling
    circumstances under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules. Where this
    is the case, SS Congo makes clear that how close the  respondents  came
    to satisfying the financial threshold under the  Rules  is  a  relevant
    consideration which could "tip the balance," as the smaller the gap the
    less the likelihood of the respondents having recourse to public funds.
    In adopting and following the approach in SS Congo, the judge  has  not
    made an error of law.

13. The other grounds of appeal can be dealt  with  briefly.  There  is  no
    merit in the contention that the judge erred by considering whether the
    respondents would be a burden on the state. This finding  was  made  in
    the context of considering Article 8 outside the Rules (where it  is  a
    relevant factor) and played  no  part  in  the  judge's  assessment  of
    whether the Rules were satisfied (where it is not a relevant factor).

14. The appellant is correct that the judge erred by relying on Section 55,
    as this section is not applicable where a  child  is  outside  the  UK.
    However, even though  Section  55  was  not  relevant,  the  judge  was
    nonetheless required  to  take  into  consideration  that  this  appeal
    concerned a child. The judge's approach to the  second  respondent  was
    consistent with case law on  entry  clearance  cases  where  a  child's
    interests are at stake (see, for example, SS (Congo) at  [39(iv)])  and
    the error was not material.

15.  The  appellant  argues  that  the  judge  should   have   applied   an
    insurmountable obstacles test  when  assessing  if  family  life  could
    continue in Afghanistan. Insurmountable obstacles is a test  under  the
    Immigration Rules where an applicant  who  cannot  meet  the  financial
    requirements seeks leave  to  remain  as  a  partner.  It  is  also  an
    important factor in cases under Article 8 where a family life has  been
    established in the UK at a time when the presence of one  or  other  of
    the partners is precarious. See Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ  440.  However,
    there is no test of insurmountable  obstacles  in  an  application  for
    entry clearance as a partner. As there is no such  test,  there  is  no
    merit in the contention that the judge failed to apply it.

16. This is an appeal where the judge had to determine whether  there  were
    compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently   recognised   under   the
    Immigration Rules that would warrant a grant of leave to enter  to  the
    partner and child of a British citizen.  The  judge  properly  directed
    himself to the correct  legal  standard  and  proceeded  to  apply  it,
    identifying a number of factors which, taken together,  could  properly
    be considered to amount to compelling circumstances. Accordingly, I  am
    satisfied that the judge reached a decision that was open to him on the
    evidence and did not make a material error of law.



Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law and shall stand.

18. The appeal is dismissed.
