Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M Murphy, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, HOPO
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka.  They are a  mother  and  her
    four daughters.  The first appellant was  born  on  29  May  1965,  the
    second appellant on 5 September 2005, the third and  fourth  appellants
    are twins and their date of birth is 7  November  1997  and  the  fifth
    appellant  was  born  on  29  April  1999.   The  appellants  made   an
    application on 3 February 2012 for entry clearance to  the  UK  as  the
    spouse  and  children  respectively  of  their  sponsor,  Mr  Kanapathy
    Subramaniam, a person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

2.   The Entry Clearance Officer refused their application on 11 April  2012
    for the following reason:

    (a)  He was not satisfied that the  first  appellant  had  provided  an
         English language test certificate in speaking and listening from an
         approved  test  provider  and  she  was  not   exempt   from   this
         requirement.

    (b)  She had married the sponsor on  1  June  1994  and  last  saw  the
         sponsor in  1999.   The  first  appellant  had  failed  to  provide
         evidence of contact with the sponsor.  The only evidence of contact
         submitted were remittance slips which  only  dated  from  2011  and
         there was no  evidence  that  funds  were  received  by  the  first
         appellant  for  her  upkeep.   The  respondent  was  therefore  not
         satisfied that the first appellant and the sponsor intended to live
         together as a couple.


    (c)  In the absence of evidence of regular contact, the respondent  was
         not satisfied that their marriage was subsisting or that the  first
         appellant and the sponsor intended living together permanently.


    (d)  The first appellant had failed to  provide  satisfactory  evidence
         that there was sufficient accommodation for the parties.

3.   The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  following  his  review  maintained  the
    decision adding that he was not satisfied that the submitted copies  of
    telephone cards provided sufficient evidence of  telephone  contact  as
    claimed.

4.   The appellants' appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor
    and dismissed by him in a determination promulgated on 24 January 2013.



5.   At the hearing before the judge the Presenting Officer accepted in  the
    light of new documentation that there was  adequate  accommodation  for
    the appellants and that issue was satisfied.

6.   The judge found  that  the  application  of  the  first  appellant  was
    appropriately refused as she had failed to meet  the  English  language
    test requirement.   This  was  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the
    requirements of being in both speaking and listening and had  not  been
    provided by an approved test provider.  The appellants'  representative
    also conceded that she did not  fall  within  any  of  the  exemptions.
    Therefore as the first appellant failed to meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules, the second to  fifth  appellants  were  consequently
    unable to do so.

7.   The judge said that as it had been accepted that  the  appellants  were
    unable to meet the Immigration Rules, it was not necessary for  him  to
    make a specific finding with regard to the subsistence of the  marriage
    and the intention to live together permanently.  Nevertheless  he  went
    ahead and made specific findings in relation to these issues.

8.   The judge found as follows at paragraph 15:

         "... There is no dispute that the parties  were  married  and  that
         they lived together for five years and had four daughters together.
          The difficulty is the paucity of evidence that  the  marriage  has
         subsisted since the sponsor travelled to the UK in 2000.  I  accept
         the submission that the sponsor  could  not  travel  to  visit  the
         appellants because his status in the UK was  not  finalised  for  a
         period of almost ten years until 2010.  I also accept that this  is
         not the first application for entry clearance and  that  the  first
         application was made  soon  after  the  sponsor  was  granted  ILR.
         However, the sponsor claims that he has  been  in  regular  contact
         with the first appellant,  two  or  three  times  a  week  but  has
         submitted no reliable evidence of this assertion.  While  I  accept
         the submission that phone cards may be acceptable as  corroborative
         evidence of contact, they cannot be accepted in the absence of  any
         other reliable evidence.  The phone cards on their own  provide  no
         evidence of the numbers contacted or that they  were  used  by  the
         parties.  The sponsor  has  submitted  no  supporting  evidence  of
         contact such as his landline using the access number on  the  phone
         cards and has not submitted a single telephone bill indicating that
         he had telephoned the first appellant.  The sponsor claims that  he
         has been in correspondence with the appellants but has produced  no
         exchanges of correspondence in the twelve years since  2010,  apart
         from the recent letters containing the submitted photographs.   The
         sponsor and appellants have submitted no record of the  sending  of
         cards on special occasions, or of email  or  communication  through
         electronic media in recent years.  The sponsor claims that  he  has
         been sending money regularly since 2001 but has only submitted  one
         money transfer receipt prior to 2011.  While I accept that  he  may
         not have had a bank account, he was able to  send  one  payment  in
         2007, as shown by the  receipt  but  has  not  provided  any  other
         receipts until June 2011.  He claims  that  he  was  sending  money
         through the bank account of a friend but has produced  no  evidence
         from the friend relating to the arrangement.  The  first  appellant
         has submitted her bank statement showing regular  income,  but  she
         had local income and there is no evidence that  the  deposits  came
         from the sponsor.  While the absence of visits may be explained and
         the long period of separation is similarly explained, I  find  that
         there is virtually  a  complete  absence  of  evidence  of  contact
         between the parties from 2000 until 2011.  On the  evidence  before
         this Tribunal I cannot be satisfied that the marriage  subsists  or
         that there  is  an  intention  of  the  parties  to  live  together
         permanently".

9.   Permission  was  granted  to  the  appellants  to  appeal  the  judge's
    decision on the basis that the judge arguably misdirected himself  when
    he held that evidence of phone cards  could  not  be  accepted  in  the
    absence of other reliable evidence.  This was arguably  a  misdirection
    as phone cards can constitute evidence of contact  where  there  is  no
    proper reason to doubt the sponsor's credibility, as held by the  Upper
    Tribunal in Goudey [2012] UKUT 41.  Further the judge arguably erred in
    law by failing to make any clear finding as to whether he accepted  the
    sponsor's testimony and, if he did not, why  he  did  not.   Leave  was
    further granted on a point that was not raised in the grounds which was
    this, that the judge arguably erred  in  law  by  failing  to  consider
    whether family life existed  between  the  sponsor  and  his  daughters
    simply by virtue of their relationship.

10.  Before the start of  the  hearing  I  intimated  that  the  appellants'
    appeal could not succeed on immigration grounds because at the date  of
    the ECO's  decision  she  did  not  submit  an  English  language  test
    certificate  that  met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Counsel said that the first appellant took a test and passed but it was
    not the correct test because it was the wrong provider.  The day before
    the ECO's decision she took the test again, this  time  with  City  and
    Guilds and she was awarded the certificate on 30 May  2012,  after  the
    respondent's decision.  Whilst those facts are not in  dispute,  it  is
    the facts relevant at the date of the respondent's decision that  apply
    in an entry clearance decision.  Accordingly I found that as the  first
    appellant could not satisfy that requirement of the Immigration  Rules,
    it also meant that the remaining appellants could not also satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules.

11.  The issue I have to decide is whether the judge made an  error  of  law
    in his decision.

12.  It was more or less conceded by Mr Deller that in light of  Goudey  the
    judge misdirected himself in his assessment of the  sponsor's  evidence
    in relation to the telephone cards.  In Goudey the Upper Tribunal held,

         "Evidence of telephone cards is capable of being  corroborative  of
         the contention of the parties that they communicate  by  telephone,
         even if such data cannot confirm the particular number the  sponsor
         was calling and the country in question.  It is not  a  requirement
         that the parties also write or text each other".

13.  Mr Deller also conceded that the judge had not made  a  finding  as  to
    whether  or  not  he   accepted   the   sponsor's   evidence.    Whilst
    corroborative evidence is not required, the sponsor's oral evidence was
    corroborative of the appellants' claim and  it  was  incumbent  on  the
    judge to make a finding on the credibility of the  sponsor's  evidence.
    The judge failed to make such a finding and consequently erred  in  law
    in failing to do so.

14.  In light of the concessions made by Mr. Deller, I found that the  judge
    made an error of law and the error  was  material.   I  set  aside  the
    decision in order to remake it.

15.  The sponsor Mr Kanapathy Subramaniam gave evidence  by  confirming  his
    name and address.  He adopted his statement dated 7 June 2013.  He  was
    not cross-examined by Mr Deller.

Findings

16.  In this case accommodation was accepted by the Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer below.  The sponsor's ability to maintain  the  appellants  was
    not made an issue by the respondent.  It has  been  accepted  that  the
    award of the English language test was not in place at the time of  the
    ECO's decision.

17.  The outstanding issues in respect of the Immigration Rules are  whether
    the first appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  a  genuine  relationship;
    whether their marriage is subsisting in light of their long  separation
    and have an intention to live together permanently as husband and wife.
     There is also their appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.  The  relevant
    date for considering the evidence is 9 April 2012,  the  date  the  ECO
    refused their applications.

18.  The sponsor said in his statement that  he  arrived  in  the  UK  on  2
    February 2000.  After he sought asylum he  was  granted  permission  to
    work after six to eight months.  Since then  he  has  been  financially
    responsible for his wife and four children.  He did not  keep  all  the
    receipts of the money transfers.  He sent 30,000 rupees to his wife and
    she  opened  an  account  in  a  bank  with  the  money.   Through  his
    remittances they have been able to buy food and clothes and some of the
    money has been used to pay for the children's school fees.

19.  Even though they are separated geographically due to the  war,  he  and
    his wife have always been in contact by telephone  and  have  discussed
    every issue of their four children's welfare and needs and the decision
    as to where they would study.  He has also kept  in  contact  with  his
    family through extended relatives in the UK who have visited  them  and
    updated him of  their  wellbeing.   Whenever  extended  relatives  have
    visited his wife and children, he has sent them gifts.

20.  He also mentioned  that  his  wife's  English  exam  was  not  accepted
    because it was not undertaken by an approved provider.  She undertook a
    further test with the right provider and passed it.

21.  He said that he cannot go and live in Sri Lanka  due  to  his  previous
    asylum claim.  His wife and children  cannot  make  a  new  application
    because if they did the new entry clearance Rules would apply  and  the
    minimum income for them to join him would be �29,600 per annum.  At the
    moment he is earning �24,000 a year.  He added that his family has been
    waiting to join him since  31  March  2010  when  they  first  made  an
    application as soon as he was granted indefinite leave to  remain.   At
    the time he did not have a  bank  account.   They  then  made  a  fresh
    application but by then the Immigration Rules had changed  again  which
    meant that his wife was required to pass an English language test.   He
    said that he would like his family  to  join  him  as  they  have  been
    separated due to the civil war in Sri Lanka.  Although the  Sri  Lankan
    problem has been mitigated, he still cannot visit Sri Lanka.

22.  Mr Deller did not challenge the  sponsor's  evidence  and  accepted  in
    light of Goudey that call cards  are  a  cheap  and  effective  way  of
    maintaining contact.  Having accepted the sponsor's  evidence  that  he
    has been in contact with the first appellant, Mr. Deller accepted  that
    the sponsor has demonstrated  that  his  relationship  with  the  first
    appellant is subsisting and the existence of their four children can be
    seen as evidence of a subsisting relationship.  In the circumstances  I
    find that the sponsor and the first appellant intend to  live  together
    permanently as husband and wife.  This means that the  first  appellant
    and the four remaining appellants satisfy all  the  requirements  under
    the Immigration Rules bar one, namely, the  inability  to  satisfy  the
    English language test requirement at the date of decision.

23.  I now consider the appellants' appeals under Article  8  of  the  ECHR.
    Again Mr Deller conceded in the light of his acceptance that the  first
    appellant and the sponsor are in a genuine relationship and  intend  to
    live together permanently, that there  is  family  life  between  them.
    There is also family life between the sponsor and  his  four  children,
    applying the principles in Razgar.  We can skip the second,  third  and
    fourth questions in Razgar, which can be answered in the affirmative.

24.  The issue  comes  down  to  the  proportionality  of  the  respondent's
    decision, whether the family being kept apart by the  decision  of  the
    ECO is proportionate and in accordance with Article 8(2) of the ECHR.

25.  I find that the English language test is a  necessary  requirement  for
    the purpose of integration  and  social  cohesion  and  in  respect  of
    immigration control.   I  also  accept  that  there  is  no  near  miss
    principle in Article 8.  The appellants have satisfied  almost  all  of
    the Immigration Rules with  the  exception  of  the  first  appellant's
    ability to satisfy the English  language  test.   Whilst  that  can  be
    remedied by a fresh application, I  find  that  the  fresh  application
    comes with further complications.  The  second  appellant  who  is  the
    eldest daughter will be 18 in September.  However should they make  the
    application before September, the sponsor will have to prove that he is
    earning �29,600  under  the  amended  Immigration  Rules  which  govern
    applications made from 9 July 2012.  This is a  family  that  has  been
    waiting to join the sponsor since 2010  when  he  was  finally  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

26.  It is not disputed that the first appellant's English language was  not
    in place at the date of the respondent's decision.   The fact that  she
    passed the first test, albeit with the wrong  provider  in  my  opinion
    shows that the first appellant is able to speak English  to  a  certain
    degree.  That has been proved by the fact that she sat the  test  again
    this time with an approved provider and passed it.  This  is  a  factor
    that counts in her favour.

27.  I bear in mind Mr Deller's submission that Section 55 of the  2009  Act
    does not apply to children outside the UK but the  policy  is  that  an
    Entry Clearance Officer has to have regard to the wellbeing and  safety
    of the children.  I accept that the children have been in the  care  of
    their mother for the last fourteen years and have been safe  with  her.
    I take account of the sponsor's unchallenged evidence that he cannot go
    and live in Sri Lanka even though the problem there has been mitigated.
     He has been separated from them due to the civil war in Sri Lanka.  In
    the circumstances I accept Mr Murphy's submission that the  only  place
    family life between the appellants and the sponsor can continue  is  in
    the UK.

28.  I find that the facts in this case are  such  that  balancing  all  the
    factors as I am required to do in Razgar, the decision of the  ECO,  if
    maintained, would amount to a disproportionate  interference  with  the
    family life of the appellants and the sponsor.

29.  The appeals of the appellants are allowed.
