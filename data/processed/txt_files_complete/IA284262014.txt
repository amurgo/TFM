Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease of  reference,
      I refer below to the parties as they were in the First-Tier  Tribunal
      albeit that the Secretary of State is technically  the  Appellant  in
      this particular appeal.


   2. The Appellant is a citizen of Brazil  born  on  6  April  1991.   She
      appeals the Respondent's decision dated 30 June 2014 refusing  her  a
      residence card as confirmation of a  right  of  residence  under  the
      Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the  EEA
      Regulations").


   3. The Appellant last entered the UK on 18 December 2007 as  a  visitor.
      She applied for a residence card under  the  EEA  Regulations  on  27
      April 2011.  This was refused on 9 September 2011.  She made a second
      application on 1 December 2011 which was again refused on 22 February
      2012.  She appealed against that refusal and her appeal was dismissed
      on 13 March 2012.  She made a third application on 30 July 2013 which
      was again refused on 9 October 2013.  It is the refusal  against  her
      sixth application made on 27 May 2014 which is the  subject  of  this
      appeal.


   4. The Appellant relies on  her  relationship  with  her  sister  Cleoni
      Valerio Da Silva.  Her sister is a Portuguese national.  She also now
      has permanent residence in the UK as a result of her EEA status.  The
      application was refused for lack of evidence  of  dependency  on  her
      sister.  Article 8 ECHR was not considered as no separate application
      has been made on that basis.


   5. The Appellant's appeal  was  allowed  by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Malins in a decision promulgated on 31 March 2015  ("the  Decision").
      The Judge allowed the appeal on the basis that regulation 8(2) of the
      EEA Regulations was satisfied as the Appellant could  show  that  she
      was dependent on her sister while the Appellant still lived in Brazil
      because they were members of the same  household  before  her  sister
      left or could show that her sister had sent  money  to  maintain  the
      Appellant after her sister left Brazil.  Since that was sufficient to
      satisfy regulation 8(2)(a) and the Appellant is now dependent on  her
      sister in the UK (thereby  meeting  regulation  8(2)(c)),  the  Judge
      found that the Appellant is  entitled  to  a  residence  card  as  an
      extended family member.


   6. The Respondent sought permission to appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
      Appellant could not show that she was dependent on  an  EEA  national
      before coming to the UK.  She  could  only  show  dependency  on  her
      sister who was the spouse of an EEA national at the relevant time but
      not an EEA national in her own right.  Further, permission was sought
      on the basis that the appeal should not have  been  allowed  outright
      but remitted to the  Respondent  to  consider  the  exercise  of  her
      discretion under  regulation  17(4)  of  the  EEA  Regulations.   The
      Appellant would not be entitled as an extended family member  to  the
      grant of a residence permit as of right but only as the result of the
      exercise of discretion in her favour by the Respondent.


   7. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Nicholson on 3 June 2015 on all grounds.  The matter comes before the
      Upper Tribunal to determine whether the First-tier Tribunal  Decision
      involved the making of an error of law.








      Submissions


   8. At the start of the hearing, Mr Bramble handed in  the  decisions  of
      Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79  (IAC)  ("Dauhoo")
      and Ihemedu  (OFMs  -  meaning)  Nigeria  [2011]   UKUT  00340  (IAC)
      ("Ihemedu").  I  also  handed  the  parties  the  Court  of  Appeal's
      judgment in Soares v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2013] EWCA Civ 575 which appeared to me to be relevant to the  issue
      in this appeal.  Miss Valerio was not legally  represented.   I  gave
      both parties time to read the judgments produced and  made  clear  to
      her that if she had any questions about those judgments or the issues
      in  this  appeal,  she  should  ask  and  that  she  would  have  the
      opportunity to make any comments about those matters in reply  to  Mr
      Bramble's submissions.


   9. Mr Bramble relied on Dauhoo as authority for the proposition that the
      Appellant has to meet one of the four scenarios in the headnote.  She
      could not do so as she was dependent before coming to the UK  on  her
      sister and not on her sister's husband who was the EEA national.  The
      Judge had therefore erred in allowing the appeal. This submission was
      reinforced by the Court of Appeal's judgment in Soares which  was  on
      not dissimilar facts to the current case. However,  Mr  Bramble  very
      fairly indicated that the Appellant's sister's status did need to  be
      clarified as it was not clear when  her  sister  had  become  an  EEA
      national.  There is an ID card in the bundle dating from  2009  which
      indicates that the Appellant's sister became an EEA national in  2009
      but if she had that status before the Appellant came to the  UK  then
      obviously this issue would not be pursued.


  10. Mr Bramble relied on Ihemedu to show from the headnote that the issue
      of a residence card to an extended family member is in the  Secretary
      of State's discretion and that  the  Judge  had  therefore  erred  in
      allowing the appeal outright.   In the event that I agreed there  was
      an error of law in  the  Decision,  he  invited  me  to  re-make  the
      Decision on the  basis  of  the  material  before  me  but  with  the
      necessary clarification from the Appellant's sister as to the  timing
      of her EEA national status.


  11. The Appellant's sister was in attendance and  I  therefore  clarified
      her position.  She informed me that she made  an  application  for  a
      Portuguese passport as long ago as 2002 (she resided in Portugal from
      1999 to 2002).  She came to the UK and it was only in 2009  that  she
      was given Portuguese nationality.  The  ID  card  in  the  bundle  is
      therefore correct as to the date when she acquired EEA nationality.


  12. The Appellant in her submissions pointed out that she came to the  UK
      in 2007 aged 16.  She came to live with and assist her elder  sister.
      She is now aged 24 and has been trying to sort out  her  visa  for  a
      number of years.  Her first application was in 2011.  Her sister knew
      that she had made a mistake in the way in which she had  brought  the
      Appellant to the UK but neither she nor her sister knew that  at  the
      time and neither she nor her sister should be made to  pay  for  this
      mistake.  This submission was reinforced by her sister who said  that
      she assumed because she was working and paying tax  in  the  UK,  she
      could bring her sister to live with her.  She  did  not  realise  she
      needed Portuguese nationality to do this.  If she had known that, she
      would have waited for her Portuguese nationality to be conferred.


  13. Both the Appellant and her sister pointed out that they spoke  little
      English at the relevant times and were reliant on legal advice.  They
      had paid lawyers a lot of money - ï¿½500 per application - and  because
      they did not speak much English, they were reliant on the lawyers  as
      to the basis of the applications.  The Appellant pointed out that the
      Respondent  had  refused   the   earlier   applications   (and   this
      application) on the basis that she could not show  dependency.   This
      was difficult to do due to her lack of status in the UK.  She  opened
      a bank account on legal advice to show that her sister was paying her
      money but it was too slow so she no longer used this.  She noted that
      if the Respondent was going to take the point that her  sister  could
      not sponsor her due to her sister's nationality at the relevant time,
      that point could have been taken earlier rather than refusing on  the
      basis that dependency was not established as a matter of fact.


  14. The Appellant said that her father and mother are now dead.  She  has
      siblings in Brazil and a sister in Germany but they  have  their  own
      families.  Her sister in the UK is divorced and  she  wants  to  stay
      with her elder sister and her nieces.  Her sister was divorced  about
      5 years ago and obtained permanent residence in the UK in 2013.


  15. In reply, Mr Bramble confirmed that the factual issue  of  dependency
      was no longer contested.  The Respondent accepts that  the  Appellant
      was dependent on her sister in Brazil before coming to the UK and  is
      dependent now.  However,  the  Appellant's  sister  was  not  an  EEA
      national in 2007 when the Appellant came to the UK and the dependency
      in Brazil did not therefore satisfy regulation  8(2)(a)  of  the  EEA
      Regulations.  If the application had been  under  regulation  7,  the
      relevant point in time to consider the issue would be at the date  of
      hearing but regulation 8 is historic.  He pointed out that  it  would
      be open to the Appellant to make an application under Appendix FM  on
      the basis of the relationship with her sister (although  he  made  no
      concession as to the likelihood of any application succeeding on that
      basis). However, she could not succeed under the EEA Regulations.  He
      therefore invited me to find there was a material error  and  to  re-
      make the Decision by allowing the Secretary of State's appeal.


      Decision and Reasons


  16. The issue in this appeal is a very narrow  one,  namely  whether  the
      Appellant should be granted a residence card as the  extended  family
      member of her sister.  In order to  succeed,  the  Appellant  has  to
      show, in the circumstances of her case, that she was dependent on her
      sister in Brazil before coming to the UK and that  she  has  remained
      dependent on her sister in the UK.  There is no dispute that she  can
      show the necessary dependency.  The issue is solely one of the status
      of her sister at the time before the Appellant came to the  UK.   The
      Appellant's sister did not obtain Portuguese nationality until  2009.
      Until then, she was in Portugal and then the UK as the spouse of  her
      Portuguese, EEA national husband and was  therefore  herself  an  EEA
      family member and not an EEA national.


  17. Regulation 7(3) of the EEA  regulations  provides  that  an  extended
      family member issued with a residence card shall be treated as an EEA
      family member.  In relation to the granting of a residence card to an
      extended family member (which as Mr Bramble  rightly  points  out  is
      discretionary), regulation 8  of  the  EEA  regulations  provides  as
      follows:-
      "(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person who
      is not a family member of an EEA national under  regulation  7(1)(a),
      (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions in  paragraph  (2),  (3),
      (4) or (5).
      (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the person
      is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil partner and-


      (a)   the person is residing in an EEA State in which the EEA
           national also resides and is dependent upon the EEA national or
           is a member of his household;
      (b)   the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
           accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes to
           join him there; or
      (c)   the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has joined
           the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to be
           dependent upon him or to be a member of his household."


  18. As is clear from the above, and confirmed by the Court of  Appeal  in
      Soares  (in  particular  paragraphs  22-24),  the  person  seeking  a
      residence card as an extended family member has to be dependent on an
      EEA national and not the family member of an EEA national.


  19. After having considered the grounds of appeal and oral arguments I am
      therefore satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  Decision  involved
      the making of an error of law in  finding  at  paragraph  13  of  the
      Decision that the Appellant satisfies  regulation  8(2)  of  the  EEA
      regulations.  I also find that the Judge erred in law in allowing the
      Appellant's  appeal  outright  rather  than  remitting  it   to   the
      Respondent to consider the exercise of  her  discretion  to  issue  a
      residence card but that is not material in light of the error I  have
      found to exist in relation to the allowing of the  appeal  under  the
      EEA regulations.


  20. The error which I have found to exist is clearly material because  as
      a matter of law, the Appellant cannot meet the EEA regulations as  an
      extended family member.  I therefore set aside the Decision  and  re-
      make it.  Whilst I have sympathy for the  predicament  in  which  the
      Appellant and  her  sister  find  themselves,  the  Appellant  cannot
      succeed under the EEA regulations.  I therefore re-make the  Decision
      by allowing the Secretary of State's appeal.  Miss  Valerio's  appeal
      against the Secretary of State's  decision  dated  30  June  2014  is
      therefore dismissed.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision did involve the making of  an  error  on  a
point of law.

I set aside the Decision

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing the  Secretary  of  State's
appeal.  Miss Valerio's appeal is therefore dismissed.
