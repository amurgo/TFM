Solicitors LLP

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. When I found there was an error of law, I set out my reasons in  these
      terms.  Having set out these reasons, I shall continue to follow their
      paragraph numbering in order to avoid confusion:


   The error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision


      The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Page promulgated  on  29  December  2014  allowing  the
      appeal of Mr Van-Dunem, to whom I shall refer to as 'the appellant' as
      he was before the First-tier Tribunal.


   2. The single most crucial error of the Judge was his failure to consider
      and follow the approach adopted by the Court of Justice  in  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department v MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12.

   3. The appellant is a citizen of Portugal born on  7  February  1989  and
      entered the United Kingdom aged 5 in 1994 or  1995.   It  is  conceded
      that he is entitled to  a  right  of  permanent  residence  under  the
      Citizens  Directive  and  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2006 (2006 No 1003).

   4.  The appellant was convicted of an offence on 1 September 2010 when he
      was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment on 2 counts for possessing Class
      A drugs (crack cocaine) with intent  to  supply.   The  offences  were
      committed on 2 August 2010.  He had 118  packets  of  cocaine  in  his
      possession and �2,000 in cash.  The Secretary of State made a decision
      to deport the appellant on 28 June 2012.

   5. His appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal in  a  determination
      promulgated on 15 October 2012  in  purported  reliance  on  the  2006
      Regulations.  [I then set out the provisions of Reg.  21  to  which  I
      shall return later in the determination.]

   6.  The 'serious grounds of public policy threshold' and the  'imperative
      grounds of public security' threshold are sometimes referred to as the
      second and third (or highest) level of protection respectively.


   7. The appellant was subsequently convicted  on  5  July  2013  for  like
      offences committed in April 2013 and was sentenced  to  a  further  2�
      years imprisonment. The Secretary of State made a second  decision  to
      deport him on 20 August 2014.

   8. A period of imprisonment  breaks  the  continuity  of  residence,  see
      Onuekwere v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EUECJ C-
      378/12 (16 January 2014) and paragraph 33 of Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department v MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12.  The relevant  passage
      dealing with effect of imprisonment in assessing  the  application  of
      the reg. 21(4) imperative grounds is as follows: [paragraphs 33  -  36
      were recited, see below].


   9. Accordingly, neither when the decision was made in June 2012 nor  when
      the decision was made  in  August  2014  had  the  appellant  been  in
      continuous residence for 10 years for the purposes of reg. 21(4).  The
      same  was  true  when  the  appeals  were  heard  in  2012  and   2014
      respectively.

  10. Judge Page treated the determination of  the  panel  in  2012  as  the
      starting-point.  This was unfortunate since the  panel  in  the  first
      appeal applied the wrong test at paragraph 50 of its determination:

      The decision to deport the appellant is dated 28 June 2012. In the  10
           year period ending on that date, the  appellant  was  imprisoned
           for two years and in detention in a Young  Offender  Institution
           for  10  weeks.  We  are  satisfied  that  the   appellant   was
           continuously resident in the UK for a period  of  more  than  10
           years before he was sentenced to  10  weeks  detention.  We  are
           satisfied that neither his period in detention nor his period of
           imprisonment involved the  transfer  to  another  State  of  the
           centre of his personal, family, or  occupational  interests,  or
           the breaking of the integrating links we had  previously  forged
           with the UK. We  are  satisfied  that  he  is  entitled  to  the
           enhanced,  third  and  highest  level  of   protection   against
           expulsion, provided by reg. 21(4)(a).

  11.  The panel was wrong in adopting this approach. He was not entitled to
      the highest level of protection, namely, imperative grounds of  public
      security. The periods of imprisonment broke the period  of  continuous
      residence during the 10  years  immediately  preceding  the  decision.
      Indeed, it had happened twice.


  12. Further, when Judge Page came to determine the issue in December 2014,
      the appellant had by then committed a further offence of the same type
      for which he had received a second substantial period of imprisonment.
      Hence, the first panel's determination of the appellant being a medium
      risk of harm had proved over optimistic.  Had the panel had  the  gift
      of foresight (which it did not), it  would  not  have  determined  the
      appellant was a medium risk of harm; rather, it would have been forced
      to say that he was a risk of harm.

  13. In addition, the appellant had been given a warning on 22 October 2012
      that, should he re-offend, further consideration  would  be  given  to
      deporting him.

  14. Consequently, not only was the appellant  convicted  of  possessing  a
      controlled drug (cocaine) with intent to supply on 24 April  2013  but
      he did so (a) in defiance of the express warning that  had  previously
      been given only six months before and  (b)  any  mitigation  he  might
      advance to the effect that he had  become  a  reformed  character  was
      torpedoed by the re-offending. Talk of his  having  become  integrated
      into the life and values of the United Kingdom rang hollow. For  these
      reasons, if the panel's earlier decision  was  a  starting-point,  (as
      indeed it was), circumstances had already departed significantly  from
      it to require a thorough-going re-assessment.

  15. Unfortunately, Judge Page appears to have  become  over-influenced  by
      the Secretary of State's concession that imperative grounds of  public
      security had not been met.  This was not the correct  approach  since,
      in the appellant's case, this was not  a  material  consideration  and
      never had been.  The appellant  did  not  meet  the  threshold  to  be
      treated as benefitting from this highest level of  protection  against
      removal and the Secretary of State did not need to establish that  the
      threshold had been met.

  16. At no stage in the determination did the Judge apply the correct test,
      namely,  serious  grounds  of  public  policy.    This   renders   the
      determination seriously flawed and requires it to  be  set  aside  for
      this reason alone.

  17. It is compounded by the Judge's approach to the  respondent's  failure
      to meet the imperative grounds test. He appears  to have treated  this
      as dispositive of the appeal in the appellant's favour, see  paragraph
      15 of the determination:

      I agree with the submission made on behalf of the respondent that  the
           appellant does pose a risk of reoffending, a risk to the public,
           but imperative grounds of public security are not  made  out  by
           that. The position is that this  appellant,  having  acquired  a
           permanent right of residence, cannot be deported if  he  commits
           criminal offences unless those offences can arguably give ground
           to a finding that there are  in  imperative  grounds  of  public
           security to deport the appellant.


  18. This is simply wrong.


  19. It is particularly disquieting given that the Judge has  accepted  the
      appellant poses a risk of re-offending and a risk to the public. (I do
      not entirely comprehend why this does not amount to imperative grounds
      of public security but, for the reasons I have given, that  is  beside
      the point.)  I do, however, understand why  the  Judge  was  persuaded
      otherwise, given the repeated concessions by  the  Presenting  Officer
      that the respondent could not establish  that  there  were  imperative
      grounds of public security to deport  the  appellant  under  the  2006
      regulations; see, for example, paragraphs 2 and  11  of  Judge  Page's
      determination.

  20. As a repeat offender, it is my preliminary view that the appellant  is
      unlikely to succeed in establishing that he is not a serious threat to
      the well-being of the community, given the findings of fact about  the
      threat he poses to the public.  For the present, I cannot see how  the
      respondent has not established  the  threshold  test  for  removal  on
      grounds of public policy given the sustainable finding that there is a
      risk of reoffending.   In other words, can the appellant realistically
      argue that these  are  not  serious  grounds?   Whilst  I  permit  the
      appellant to argue the issue fully before me,  it  is  useful  if  the
      parties are aware of where the real issue lies in this case.

  21. As the Judge's determination is materially flawed,  I  set  aside  the
      decision and give directions for it to be re-made. Given the fact that
      the appellant has been in the United Kingdom since he was  five  years
      old and is now aged 26, with little  or  no  links  to  Portugal,  the
      substantial issue  in  this  appeal  is  the  proportionality  of  his
      removal.  His immediate family is in the United Kingdom and have  been
      here for more than two decades.

  22. The determination is likely to focus on the issue of  proportionality,
      a matter on which Judge Page had nothing to say.

The re-making of the decision


  23. As I stated, the appellant first arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
      1994, some 21 years ago, aged 5. He first came to the attention of the
      authorities on 5 April 2005  when,  aged  16,  he  was  cautioned  for
      disorderly conduct. He was convicted in August 2006, aged  17,  of  an
      assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The sentence was varied  to  a
      supervision order of 12 months presumably  on  his  conviction  on  23
      October 2006, aged 17 of theft and common assault. On 6 July 2007,  by
      which time the appellant had become  an  adult,  he  demonstrated  his
      involvement with drugs. He was convicted of possession of cocaine  and
      heroin  and  was  sentenced  to  10  weeks  in  a   young   offenders'
      institution. This was followed by convictions in 2008 and  2009,  when
      the appellant was 19 and 20, of possessing cannabis for which, on each
      occasion, he was fined.


  24. Pausing there, these are typical offences committed by a minor  and  a
      young man who was clearly in need of some form of re-direction.  These
      were relatively petty crimes and dabbling in drugs. Whilst they form a
      substantial part of the tally of his offending (which now stands at  7
      convictions  relating  to  12  offences)  they  commenced  after   the
      appellant had been in the United Kingdom for at least 10 years.  Given
      his age, they took place at  a  time  when  it  must  be  assumed  the
      appellant had become integrated into the United Kingdom.


  25. Considerable caution must be exercised before placing too much  weight
      on juvenile offending given the fact that an individual should not  be
      'written-off' at an early age.  One looks to see if the individual has
      turned the corner so that, with greater age and maturity, with greater
      responsibility and commitments, the adolescent offending may  properly
      be seen as an unfortunate phase in that individual's  formative  years
      which should not impact on a person's  chances  in  life  at  a  later
      stage.  That is not to say that the offending can be  overlooked.   It
      is part of the history, all of  which  must  come  into  play  when  a
      rounded assessment is called for.  For the purposes of this appeal, it
      does not signify  greatly.   In  any  event,  it  pales  into  greater
      insignificance when the Tribunal is faced with the impact of  the  two
      much more serious convictions.

  26. It is within this context that the Tribunal considers the  appellant's
      conviction at Kingston Crown Court on 1 September 2010  of  possessing
      what appears to have been cocaine and heroin with  intent  to  supply.
      For these two offences he was sentenced to a  concurrent  sentence  of
      four years imprisonment. Deportation proceedings  were  initiated  and
      his appeal against the respondent's decision to deport him was allowed
      on 15 October 2012. Unsurprisingly, a warning letter was sent  to  the
      appellant on 22 October 2012  that,  should  the  appellant  reoffend,
      further consideration would be given to his deportation.  Regrettably,
      on 5 July 2013, he was convicted Kingston Crown Court of  two  similar
      offences as well  as  possessing  cannabis  for  which  he  was  later
      sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. It is important to  consider  the
      basis of his plea, repeated before me, that he  was  pressurised  into
      reoffending by  those  involved  in  the  commission  of  his  earlier
      conviction who felt that they were out of pocket. The  basis  of  this
      plea was accepted by the prosecution and must, I feel, be the basis of
      my approach, notwithstanding the doubts expressed  by  the  sentencing
      judge:
      I do accept that people in your position can sometimes find themselves
           in a situation  where  they  are  subject  to  intimidation  and
           coercion. That is the basis of your plea.
      The prosecution do not seek to go behind it, but I make it clear  that
           I do not wholeheartedly accept that and, as I say, I  know  that
           this is not the first time you have been involved in drugs.  One
           of the serious aggravating features of  this  case  is  that  in
           2010, you were given four years imprisonment  for  an  identical
           offence at this court, 1 September  2010,  for  possession  with
           intent to supply Class A drugs and another  offence,  possession
           with intent to supply Class A drugs. I do not know whether  they
           are indicted in that way because one was for cocaine and one was
           for heroin and  so  I  feed  that  into  the  context  of  these
           sentencing remarks.
      You did not say whether or not you were intimidated  or  coerced  into
           offending on that occasion.
      In any event, the basis of your plea was that  you  were  cutting  and
           packing the drugs and I take that at its highest and then I look
           at the sentencing guidelines that drug offences, it seems to  me
           that places you firmly within the significant role bracket.


  27. The effect of this is that the appellant has now been convicted of two
      offences of the most serious kind for which he has been sentenced,  in
      total, to 6 � years imprisonment. Even if due allowance  is  made  for
      the element of coercion involved in the later offence  (which  may  be
      reflected in the sentence of 30  months  imprisonment)  this  is  very
      serious criminal misconduct. The  risk  of  reoffending  must  form  a
      central part of this appeal.


The Directive and the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
(2006 No 1003)
      28.   Recitals 23 and 24 in the preamble to the  Directive  2004/38/EC
      ('the directive'):

           (23) Expulsion of Union citizens and their  family  members  on
           grounds of public policy or public security is  a  measure  that
           can seriously harm persons who, having availed themselves of the
           rights and freedoms conferred on them by the [EC]  Treaty,  have
           become genuinely integrated into  the  host  Member  State.  The
           scope  for  such  measures  should  therefore  be   limited   in
           accordance with the principle of proportionality to take account
           of the degree of  integration  of  the  persons  concerned,  the
           length of their residence in the host Member State,  their  age,
           state of health, family and economic  situation  and  the  links
           with their country of origin.


           (24) Accordingly, the greater the degree of integration of Union
           citizens and their family members in the host Member State,  the
           greater the degree of protection against  expulsion  should  be.
           Only in exceptional circumstances, where  there  are  imperative
           grounds of public security, should an expulsion measure be taken
           against Union citizens who have resided for many  years  in  the
           territory of the host Member State, in particular when they were
           born and have resided there throughout their life. In  addition,
           such exceptional circumstances should also apply to an expulsion
           measure taken against minors, in order to  protect  their  links
           with  their  family,  in  accordance  with  the  United  Nations
           Convention on the Rights of the Child, of 20 November 1989.


  28. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  accurately
      transpose the  requirements  of  the  Directive  into  United  Kingdom
      domestic law:


           21.-(1) In this regulation a "relevant decision"  means  an  EEA
           decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security
           or public health.
           (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
           (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a  person
           with a permanent right of residence under regulation  15  except
           on serious grounds of public policy or public security...
           (4) A relevant decision may not be taken  except  on  imperative
           grounds of  public  security  in  respect  of  an  EEA  national
           who...has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period
           of at least ten years prior to
           the relevant decision;
           (5) Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of  public
           policy or public security it shall,  in  addition  to  complying
           with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles-
                 (a) the decision must comply with the principle of
                 proportionality;
                 (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal
                 conduct of the person concerned;
                 (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must
                 represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
                 threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of
                 society;
                 (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or
                 which relate to considerations of general prevention do not
                 justify the decision;
                 (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
                 themselves justify the decision.
           (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds  of  public
           policy or public  security  in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of the person, the person's length
           of residence in the United  Kingdom,  the  person's  social  and
           cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the  extent  of
           the person's links with his country of origin.

The case law

  29. In Secretary of State v MG, Case (C-400/12) the Court of Justice  held
      the question of the level of protection  to  which  an  appellant  was
      entitled was an holistic question and that the  determination  of  the
      level of protection attained  required  scrutiny  of  the  appellant's
      links to the country of residence and to his  degree  of  integration.
      As we shall see, that is no more than the application of principles of
      proportionality where the forces in favour of removal are balanced  by
      the forces gravitating in  favour  of  permitting  the  individual  to
      remain.  In order to attain the highest level  of  protection,  it  is
      accepted that the ten-year period of residence must  in  principle  be
      continuous and must be calculated by counting back from  the  date  of
      the decision ordering expulsion:


       33. It follows that periods of imprisonment  cannot  be  taken  into
       account  for  the  purposes  of  granting  the  enhanced  protection
       provided for in article 28(3)(a) of  Directive  2004/38  [imperative
       grounds]  and  that,  in  principle,  such  periods  interrupt   the
       continuity of the period of  residence  for  the  purposes  of  that
       provision.


       34. As regards the continuity of the period  of  residence,  it  has
       been stated in paragraph 28  above  that  the  ten  year  period  of
       residence necessary for  the  granting  of  enhanced  protection  as
       provided for in article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38  must,  in
       principle, be continuous.


       35. As for the question of the extent to  which  the  non-continuous
       nature of the period of residence during the ten years preceding the
       decision to expel the person concerned prevents  him  from  enjoying
       enhanced protection, an overall assessment  must  be  made  of  that
       person's situation on each occasion at the  precise  time  when  the
       question of expulsion arises: see the Tsakouridis case [2010] ECR I-
       11979, paragraph 32.


       36 In that regard, given that, in principle, periods of imprisonment
       interrupt the continuity of the period of residence for the purposes
       of article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38,  such  periods  may  -
       together with the other factors going to make  up  the  entirety  of
       relevant considerations in each individual  case  -  be  taken  into
       account by the national authorities responsible for applying article
       28(3) of that Directive as part of the overall  assessment  required
       for determining whether the integrating links previously forged with
       the host member state have been broken,  and  thus  for  determining
       whether the enhanced protection provided for in that provision  will
       be granted: see Tsakouridis case, paragraph 34.


       37. Lastly, as regards the implications of the fact that the  person
       concerned has resided in the host member state during the ten  years
       prior to imprisonment, it should be borne in mind that, even  though
       - as has been stated in paras 24 and 25 above - the ten year  period
       of residence necessary for the  grant  of  the  enhanced  protection
       provided for in  article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38  must  be
       calculated by counting back from the date of the  decision  ordering
       that person's expulsion, the fact that the calculation  carried  out
       under that provision is  different  from  the  calculation  for  the
       purposes of the grant of the right of permanent residence means that
       the fact that the person concerned resided in the host member  state
       during the ten  years  prior  to  imprisonment  may  be  taken  into
       consideration as part of the overall assessment referred to in  para
       36 above. [My emboldening.]


       38. In the light of the foregoing, the answer to [the  question]  is
       that article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must  be  interpreted  as
       meaning that a period of imprisonment is, in principle, capable both
       of interrupting the continuity of the period of  residence  for  the
       purposes of that provision and of affecting the  decision  regarding
       the grant of the enhanced protection provided for  thereunder,  even
       where the person concerned resided in the host member state for  the
       ten years prior to imprisonment. However, the fact that that  person
       resided in the  host  member  state  for  the  ten  years  prior  to
       imprisonment may be taken into consideration as part of the  overall
       assessment required in order to determine  whether  the  integrating
       links previously forged with the host member state have been broken.
       [My emboldening.]

  30. Nothing in these passages suggests that the appellant is permitted the
      automatic level of protection - imperative grounds - by reason of  the
      two periods of imprisonment and the effect that the actual  period  of
      imprisonment must have upon the integrative nature of his presence  in
      the United Kingdom.  Indeed, it would be a curious result if a  person
      who has recently committed a very serious offence  for  which  he  has
      been sentenced to a long term of imprisonment should be treated in the
      same way as a person who  has  lived  in  the  host  country  with  an
      untarnished private life.  That said, nothing  can  detract  from  the
      simple fact that the same individual has  grown  up  in,  familiarised
      himself with, shared in, a community  for  many  years  prior  to  his
      offending.


  31. The Court of Justice's decision in  MC  means  that,  just  because  a
      person cannot claim  as  of  right  to  benefit  from  the  protection
      afforded by imperative grounds, a decision maker should  overlook  the
      fact that in a period of 10 years preceding his  imprisonment  he  has
      developed links with the host country which  establishes  a  level  of
      integration  commensurate  with  the  length  of  his  stay  and   the
      activities that he has lawfully conducted.  This is  the  'integration
      test' described by the respondent in the decision letter as  emanating
      from the decision of the Court of Justice  in  Tsakouridis.   To  make
      better sense, the test might also have a comparative element within it
      so that domestic integration might also be compared with the level  of
      integration the individual retains with the country to which  he  will
      be returned.

  32. In MG (prison-Article 28(3) (a) of Citizens Directive) Portugal [2014]
      UKUT 392 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal guided by what had been said in the
      Court of Justice but doubtless baffled by precisely what the Court was
      saying, distilled the guidance into this passages in paragraph 48:

       Despite our difficulties,  we  have  concluded  that  a  categorical
       reading of (1) cannot be what the Court meant or at least that  what
       it must have had in  mind  was  to  draw  a  distinction  between  a
       positive taking into account and a  negative  interruption.  If  the
       Court in MG had meant to convey by the terms "cannot be  taken  into
       account" that periods of  imprisonment  automatically  disqualify  a
       person from enhanced protection under Article  28(3)(a)  protection,
       it would not have seen fit to proceed in paragraph 35 to accept as a
       possibility  that  the  "non-continuous"  nature  of  a  period   of
       residence did not automatically  prevent  a  person  qualifying  for
       enhanced protection. Nor would it have chosen  in  paragraph  38  to
       describe periods of imprisonment as "in principle, capable  both  of
       interrupting the continuity of  the  period  of  residence  for  the
       purposes of that provision and of affecting the  decision  regarding
       the grant of the enhanced protection provided for thereunder..."  It
       would have had to say that, if they fall within the 10  year  period
       counting back from the date of  decision,  periods  of  imprisonment
       always prevent a person  qualifying  for  enhanced  protection.   In
       addition, what the Court goes on to say in paragraph  37  about  the
       implications of the fact that a  person  has  resided  in  the  host
       Member State during the 10 years prior to  imprisonment  is  clearly
       intended to underline that even though  such  a  person  has  had  a
       period of imprisonment during the requisite 10 year period (counting
       back from the date of decision ordering the expulsion: see paragraph
       27) it is still possible for them to qualify for enhanced protection
       and in this regard their prior period of  residence  "may  be  taken
       into consideration as part of the overall assessment referred to  in
       paragraph 36 above". We also bear in mind, of course, as did Pill LJ
       in Secretary of State for the Home Department v  FV  (Italy)  [2012]
       EWCA Civ 1199 at [42] that in Tsakouridis the CJEU Grand Chamber did
       not consider the fact that Mr Tsakouridis had  spent  a  substantial
       period of time in custody in  Germany  in  the  year  prior  to  the
       decision to expel him (taken on 9  August  2008)  as  defeating  his
       eligibility  for  enhanced  protection   under   Article   28(3)(a).
        Nevertheless (and this is where we consider Mr  Palmer  right  and
       Miss Hirst wrong), the  fact  that  the  Court  specifies  that  "in
       principle" periods  of  imprisonment  interrupt  the  continuity  of
       residence for the purposes of meeting the 10  year  requirement  can
       only  mean  that  so  far  as  establishing   integrative  links  is
       concerned such periods must have a negative impact.


  33. This passage was what the Court of Appeal had in mind in Warsame v the
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] WLR(D) 29, in  which
      Longmore LJ decided


       that there is a "maybe" category of cases under MG (Portugal) where
       a person has resided in the host state during the ten years prior to
       imprisonment,  depending  on  an  overall  assessment   of   whether
       integrating links have been broken, and that in such cases it  might
       be relevant to determine, by way of overall assessment,  the  degree
       of integration in the host member state or the extent to which links
       with the original member state have been broken.


  34.  That  does  not  mean  he  automatically  benefits  from  a  specific
      'imperative grounds' test from  which  he  is  excluded  on  a  proper
      interpretation of the Directive and the 2006 Regulations.  However, he
      is entitled to have a decision maker have regard to the tangible links
      that he has with the country where he has spent long periods of  time;
      all the more so where the links he has with the country of origin  are
      tenuous, even ephemeral.


  35. Hence in this case there is a balance sheet.   On  the  negative  side
      there is criminal offending, 6� years imprisonment,  public  interest,
      risk of re-offending; on the positive side there are the  strength  of
      the links with United Kingdom, 21 years spent in United  Kingdom,  the
      relative weakness of the links with the  country  of  his  nationality
      (albeit a European country with the comparative advantages that Europe
      offers over some other parts of the  world)  and  the  loss  of  those
      elements in  the  United  Kingdom  which  tend  to  suggest  that  his
      offending may be a thing of the past - his  commitment  to  work,  his
      friendships, his family, his home.

  36. This is no more than a proper application  of  proportionality,  as  I
      suggested in my decision identifying a error on a  point  of  law.  If
      after  throwing  all  the  pros  and  cons  into  the   air,   it   is
      disproportionate to remove him, it is disproportionate.  It  does  not
      cease to be disproportionate because of an 'imperative grounds'  test.
      The most such a test can do is to remind the decision maker the weight
      that is to be attached to a particular element.   In the same way that
      Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1) and the criteria  mentioned  there
      are never an absolute substitute for proportionality in a human rights
      case but must always be subject to the refiner's fire  of  exceptional
      circumstances or proportionality.

The appellant's present circumstances

  37. There are several elements of the present circumstances upon  which  I
      wish to concentrate, although the appellant's evidence is found in two
      statements and the  record  of  proceedings  that  I  kept.  Upon  his
      release, the appellant attended a gym. He was  looking  for  work.  He
      accepted a job at a Virgin gym doing cleaning work.  His  attitude  to
      work impressed his manager. Consequently, when his manager moved to  a
      gym run by Nuffield Health, the appellant  was  invited  to  join  his
      former manager.  The appellant is now the supervisor of a team of  six
      cleaners working beneath him. In addition, he is currently pursuing  a
      personal trainer's course at a modest level 2 which may, or  may  not,
      have its equivalence in NVQ. Having completed the course,  this  opens
      up an opportunity of working in the gym as a trainer rather than as  a
      cleaner. Originally he was paid on a piecemeal basis with a zero hours
      contract. Now he is on a salary. He has  completed  (or  is  about  to
      complete) a lifeguard's course.


  38. Ms Fijiwala correctly brought to his attention that  he  was  in  work
      when the second offence took  place  and  this  did  not  prevent  his
      offending for a second occasion. He explained that (as the prosecution
      accepted) that he was facing a threat because of the  loss  occasioned
      as a result of his first conviction. He also accepted, as of course he
      was bound to do, that he should have gone to the authorities to report
      it.

  39. The second element which requires attention is that  he  is  currently
      living with Mr Gamal  who  has  himself  been  convicted  of  offences
      relating to drugs. They were not  the  same  offences  for  which  the
      appellant himself was convicted. He described Mr  Gamal  as  a  friend
      from childhood who is currently training in construction.   The  added
      significance is that the appellant is no longer living at home.


  40. The third element concerns the evidence about  the  appellant's  links
      with Portugal.  The appellant described how he  went  to  Portugal  in
      2009 with his father. He described his father as of  African  descent.
      On the last occasion he spoke with his father, he was  living  in  the
      United Kingdom.  He described how his father is a  Portuguese  citizen
      who went to Portugal at the age of 14 and remained there for  some  15
      years. The appellant was, of course, born there, but  accompanied  his
      father in 1994, when he came to the United  Kingdom  aged  5.  He  was
      subsequently joined by his mother and sister. He has a half sister  in
      Portugal who is in  her  30s.  She  remained  in  Portugal  after  her
      grandmother had died.  The rest of  the  family  came  to  the  United
      Kingdom. When in Portugal in 2009, the appellant was introduced to two
      aunts, one of whom is now living in Angola and another in Canada.

  41. Whilst there must be a healthy scepticism about the evidence  of  this
      appellant when describing the family members that he has in  Portugal,
      I am satisfied he stayed in Portugal for a period of 2  or  3  months.
      His relationship with his father is  slight.  The  appellant's  mother
      stated that her second husband suffered from schizophrenia.  She  said
      that when the appellant was in Portugal for the first 5 years  of  his
      life, he spoke Portuguese. Thereafter,  however,  I  accept  both  his
      evidence and that of his  mother  that  in  order  to  progress  their
      chances in the United  Kingdom,  they  spoke  English.   She  hired  a
      private English tutor for him.

  42. The appellant's mother gave evidence that  she  returned  to  Portugal
      last Christmas. She did so in order to visit her parents'  grave.  She
      had been to university there and had stayed with a university  friend.
      She was unable to stay with her daughter from her first marriage since
      she was living with  her  father,  the  mother's  first  husband.  She
      described how she was not able to afford to return to Portugal for the
      first 11 years spent in the United Kingdom.

  43. The appellant's mother spoke of her son's childhood. It  was  apparent
      that  she  did  not  exercise  adequate  control  over  him  and   she
      acknowledged that he needed more supervision. I place little weight on
      her ability to control or influence the appellant if he is  minded  to
      misbehave. She is however well-intentioned and was at something  of  a
      loss to know how it all went so badly wrong. Although  their  evidence
      must be approached with considerable caution, she spoke of  her  son's
      attitude being different now that he was trying to progress;  that  he
      had commenced a professional  fitness  course  and  that  others  were
      paying for him to progress. She described how he  does  not  live  far
      away.


  44. I raised with her that she had a strong Portuguese  accent  which  she
      somewhat ruefully acknowledged she was unable to change. She described
      how she  had  spent  two  thirds  of  her  life  in  Portugal.  At  St
      Bartholomew's Hospital where she works in the cancer unit as a  nurse,
      she describes how she is known as a  Portuguese  speaker  amongst  her
      colleagues. She is not linked to a Portuguese diaspora in  the  United
      Kingdom. She does, however, speak to patients in  Portuguese  if  they
      find it difficult to speak English. She has one work colleague who  is
      Portuguese with whom she speaks in Portuguese.

  45.  Finally, the appellant's girlfriend gave evidence. She described  how
      she had known the appellant since 2006 when she was 16, some 10  years
      ago. It had not been a constant relationship. In particular,  she  did
      not know the appellant was in prison and, although she texted him,  he
      did not respond. After his recent release in April  or  May  2015  she
      contacted him. She is a British citizen. They  do  not  live  together
      although she told me he stays with her for a few days at a  time.  She
      is working with young people as a youth worker. Her charges  are  aged
      between 18 and 25. Some are in care. Her role is  to  assist  them  in
      finding jobs and resolving family problems.


Analysis

  46. At the heart of this appeal are the  appellant's  two  convictions  in
      2010 and 2013.  He must have spent at least 3 years of  the  10  years
      preceding the decision in prison.  The appellant is  not  entitled  to
      benefit from the level of protection set at 'imperative grounds'.  For
      the reasons I have given, this does  not  mean  that  his  immigration
      history is not to be fully considered in the assessment.


  47. The appellant has a permanent right of residence and this enables  him
      to benefit from a level of  protection  such  as  to  require  serious
      grounds of public policy before he ought be removed.

  48. If the appellant commits further offences involving the possession  of
      Class A drugs with intent to supply them to vulnerable members of  the
      public, this will be highly damaging to society.  It  amply  satisfies
      the classification of 'serious grounds'.   Furthermore, the  community
      wishes to rid itself of the scourge of drugs.  Although I do  not  see
      it as applicable here, I consider that the removal of drug dealers  is
      a goal that society properly sees as imperative.  I would wish to  say
      nothing that marginalises either its seriousness,  or  the  damage  it
      inflicts, or the weight that society attaches to the removal of  those
      involved.

  49. The primary assessment that I need to make relates to the  risks  that
      is faced by  the  community  as  a  result  of  the  appellant's  past
      offending. This is, of course, in the context of an assessment  is  as
      to whether the appellant's  personal  conduct  represents  a  genuine,
      present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one   of   the
      fundamental interests of society within the meaning of reg. 21.

  50. There are a number of matters which have  caused  me  concern.  First,
      notwithstanding the first deportation proceedings and, one might  say,
      the good  fortune  of  his  first  successful  appeal,  the  appellant
      reoffended. I am, however, prepared to accept that the second  offence
      was the result of coercion in order to make good the losses  that  had
      been experienced by the drug gang with which  he  was  associated  and
      which were occasioned by his first  arrest.  The  second  offence  was
      committed notwithstanding the warning that had been given to him.




  51. Secondly, I am concerned that he continues to share accommodation with
      a convicted drugs user or dealer.


  52. Thirdly, although I  have  no  doubt  about  the  genuineness  of  his
      relationship with his girlfriend and  the  concern  expressed  by  his
      mother, I do not see them as capable of exercising  effective  control
      over his behaviour if he decides to  override  their  wishes  for  his
      future. The only person who is in effective control of the appellant's
      conduct is the appellant himself.

  53.  Whilst I take all of these misgivings into account, I  was  impressed
      by the evidence as a whole notwithstanding my very severe  misgivings,
      trenchantly expressed in my original decision to find an error of law.
      I formed a strong view that,  however  belatedly,  the  appellant  has
      finally seen the  advantages  of  work  and  study  as  the  means  of
      improving himself. I avoid the use of rose-tinted  spectacles  and  am
      conscious of the ease by which a decision maker  can  be  beguiled  by
      promises that an individual has turned  the  corner.  Nevertheless,  I
      have concluded that the appellant is now showing a maturity that is in
      marked contrast with his  former  conduct  as  a  tear-away  and  drug
      dealer.


  54. Whether this is seen as a question of rehabilitation or  risk  of  re-
      offending, it is now the  case  that  the  appellant  is  in  salaried
      employment with a future which is worth effort to achieve.  He  struck
      me as motivated and engaged with pursuing a career.  The  question  of
      his  rehabilitation  is  material  to  the  proportionality   of   his
      deportation as Essa v Secretary of State for the Home Department (EEA:
      rehabilitation/integration) Netherlands [2013] UKUT  316  (IAC)  makes
      clear.   As the appellant's skeleton argument suggests, it echoes what
      Carnwath LJ said in Batista [2010] EWCA Civ 896):


           Even in  respect  of  those  deemed  sufficiently  dangerous  to
           justify deportation under the  EEA  rules,  common  sense  would
           suggest a degree of shared interest between the EEA countries in
           helping progress towards a better form of  life.  The  prospects
           offered by the relationship with Miss Deane in this country  may
           have been fragile, as the tribunal thought, but in Portugal they
           would be practically non-existent. Although he has  siblings  in
           that country, there seems to have been  no  evidence  that  they
           would be able or willing to offer the support needed to  prevent
           what the tribunal saw as his likely drift back to  crime.  There
           may be room for argument as to  the  relevance  of  such  points
           under the Directive, but as at present advised I see  no  reason
           in principle why they may not  be  taken  into  account  in  the
           overall balance of proportionality. It  will  be  a  matter  for
           tribunal to consider whether they have any  materiality  in  the
           present case.


  55. In my judgment they are material to the outcome of this case.  It  had
      been found by the Tribunal in 2012 that the appellant had no more than
      tenuous links with Portugal. Having heard the evidence, I  agree  with
      that finding. However much the Tribunal would wish to  place  reliance
      upon the presence of a half-sister in Portugal who is living with  the
      first husband of this appellant's mother, it  strikes  me  as  evident
      that the appellant has only a fragile relationship  with  her,  having
      left the home some 21 years before. There  is  no  evidence  that  the
      appellant has any relationship with his mother's  first  husband.  His
      mother's own evidence was that she had not visited  Portugal  for  the
      first 11 years after her arrival in 1994 but has made periodic  visits
      but not to visit her daughter although she has seen her.  Accordingly,
      the presence of family members in Portugal (if that rightly  describes
      the relationship)  does  not  operate  as  a  significant  reason  for
      diminishing the effect of removal from the UK.


  56. Even if there  were  no  relatives  at  all,  there  are  no  physical
      obstacles to the appellant being removed to Portugal. Even if he  does
      not speak Portuguese, save in a very rudimentary form, he will be able
      to acquire the language were he to be removed. Portugal is a civilised
      European country where a resourceful young man would be able to  start
      life afresh  and  find  accommodation  but  the  risk  of  failure  is
      certainly greater than the risk of failure here, given the start  that
      he has made in that direction. However,  it  is  not  principally  the
      ability to relocate in Portugal that operates as a determining factor;
      rather it is the proportionality  of  removing  the  appellant  there,
      given his presence in the United Kingdom for the past 21  years  since
      he was five years old.


  57. The consideration that  has  most  influenced  me  is  what  in  other
      contexts might be termed 'the green shoots of recovery'.   It  is  not
      altogether inapt an expression when one  considers  the  descent  into
      criminality that has blighted  this  appellant's  life  in  the  past.
      There is no evidence  that  he  is  now  involved  with  the  criminal
      elements with whom he  previously  resorted.   Instead,  his  life  is
      remarkably ordinary.  The routine of  a  job;  the  responsibility  of
      looking after a team of fellow workers; the respect which  I  feel  he
      has earned from the person who engineered his present job;  a  regular
      salary;  efforts  to  achieve  a  qualification;  a  goal   of   self-
      improvement.  There is a genuine interest in preserving these elements
      and, even if Britain breaks away from  Europe,  society  as  whole  is
      worse off if, without these positive influences, the appellant  drifts
      back into crime.

  58. It would be wrong on my part to classify the appellant as being of  no
      risk, although if he continues on his present  trajectory  he  is  not
      likely to re-offend.  I would not, at present, classify  the  risk  as
      serious.  The problem, however, is if anything occurs to  deflect  the
      appellant from this path; the loss of his job or  isolation  from  the
      influence of his friends and family, limited as it may  be.   For  all
      the reservations I have, I am very  reluctant  indeed  to  derail  the
      appellant from his present path.

  59. There are almost  non-existent  links  that  the  appellant  has  with
      Portugal.  His removal there is bound to be a destabilising  influence
      and, given the untested nature of process by  which  he  is  acquiring
      maturity, I am not satisfied the public  interest  is  served  by  his
      removal or that it would be proportionate  to  remove  him.  Thus,  on
      balance, I have concluded that it is disproportionate to  remove  him.



  60. Whilst there is the inevitable risk that I  have  been  misled,  there
      will be no concealing the fact that I have been if  there  is  further
      offending. Were this to occur, the arguments about  integration,  risk
      to the community and rehabilitation will have  proved  groundless.   I
      will have been proved wrong and the appellant's own further misconduct
      will be the proof of it.  I would not then expect a Tribunal to  reach
      the same conclusion as I have. That event is, however, firmly  in  the
      appellant's own hands and he must know it.
