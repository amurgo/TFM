Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. P. Georget, Counsel instructed by Good Advice UK
For the Respondent:    Mr. L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By way of a decision promulgated on 4 March 2019 I set aside the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The appeal came before me
    to be remade.

The hearing

 2. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant and from her sons, Mr. Omar
    [H] and Mr. Ahmed [H].  The Appellant was assisted by the interpreter,
    who confirmed before proceeding that they both fully understood each
    other.  The language spoken was Arabic.  Both representatives made oral
    submissions.  I reserved my decision.

 3. I have taken into account the documents in the Respondent's bundle  (to
    D12), the Appellant's bundle from the First-Tier Tribunal (108  pages),
    the Appellant's bundle prepared for  the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing  (55
    pages), and the skeleton argument.

 4. At the outset of the hearing,  Mr.  Georget  submitted  that  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) was not the "best rule" in the Appellant's  circumstances
    as the focus was on her family life.  I will therefore  first  consider
    family life.

Burden of proof

 5. The burden of proof lies on the Appellant to show that, at the date  of
    the hearing, the Respondent's decision  is  a  breach  of  her  rights,
    and/or those of her family, to a family and private life under  Article
    8 ECHR.  The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.

Findings and conclusions

 6. I found the Appellant and her sons to be honest and credible witnesses.
     The Appellant and Omar  were  cross-examined.   There  was  no  cross-
    examination of Ahmed.  They answered all questions put to them and were
    not evasive.  Their evidence was consistent.  I find that I can rely on
    the evidence of the Appellant and her sons.

Family life

 7. It was not submitted that the Appellant could meet the requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  She cannot meet the requirements for an  Adult  Dependent
    Relative as she is already in the United Kingdom.

 8. I have considered the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 in  accordance
    with the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I have considered whether  the
    Appellant has family life  with  her  sons  sufficient  to  engage  the
    operation of Article 8.  I find that the Appellant came to  the  United
    Kingdom as a visitor on 16 October 2016 with her husband.  She came  to
    visit her sons and their families.  Omar  is  married  with  two  sons.
    Ahmed is now divorced with one son.  While  they  were  in  the  United
    Kingdom, on 17 December 2016, the Appellant's husband suddenly died  of
    a heart attack.  He is  buried  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Ahmed  gave
    evidence that he visits his father's grave with the  Appellant  between
    once a week and once a fortnight.

 9. The Appellant has been living with her sons in the United Kingdom  ever
    since.  She spends half the week living with Omar and half with  Ahmed.
    Given the circumstances under which she  has  remained  in  the  United
    Kingdom following the sudden death of her  husband,  I  find  that  the
    bonds between the Appellant and her adult sons go above and beyond  the
    ties normally to be found between a mother and her adult sons.  I  find
    that the bonds have been strengthened due to the circumstances  of  her
    husband's death, and the consequent shared  grief.   I  find  that  the
    Appellant depends on her sons for emotional support.   She  lives  with
    them and is maintained  by  them.   I  find  that  she  is  financially
    dependent on them.  I find that this financial and emotional support is
    real, effective and committed.

10. I have considered the Appellant's grandsons.  I find that the Appellant
    has visited her grandchildren in the United Kingdom over  a  number  of
    years with her late husband, and that she now  lives  with  them.   She
    gave evidence that she had been to visit her sons  and  their  families
    every year for a couple of months.  She visited about four times.   She
    gave evidence that  she  looks  after  her  grandchildren  while  their
    parents work.  She is very close to her grandchildren.  I find,  taking
    the above into account, that the Appellant has a family life  with  her
    grandchildren.

11. I find that the Appellant has a family life with  her  sons  and  their
    families sufficient to engage the operation of Article 8.  I find  that
    the decision would interfere with this family life.

12. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.

13. In assessing the public interest, I have taken into account section  19
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Section  117B(1)
    provides that the maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
    the public interest.  I have found above that the Appellant cannot meet
    requirements of the immigration rules in relation to her family life.

14. I have no evidence of the Appellant's English language skills  (section
    117B(2)).

15. The Appellant is supported financially by her sons and I find that  she
    is financially independent (section 117B(3)).  Omar gave evidence  that
    he earns ï¿½35,000 per annum.  In relation to her healthcare  needs,  she
    gave evidence that her medication still comes from Egypt.  She pays for
    it from her husband's state pension.  Omar gave evidence that, when the
    Appellant has used NHS services, she comes up  on  the  system  as  not
    being entitled to free care, and so his details have been given to  the
    NHS for the payment of any bills.  I find that the  Appellant  and  her
    sons are fully aware  that  the  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  free
    treatment on the NHS.  I find that her sons have undertaken to the  NHS
    to pay any bills.  I find that she is not a burden on the public purse.



16. Sections 117B(4) and 117B(5) do not apply to family life.  However,  it
    is nevertheless relevant and significant that the Appellant  has  never
    been in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  She came here on a  visit  visa
    with her husband.  She did not intend to remain in the United  Kingdom.
    It was only due to the traumatic circumstances of the sudden  death  of
    her husband in the United Kingdom that she  remained  here.   She  made
    this application when she still had leave to  remain.   She  has  never
    been in the United Kingdom without leave.  I find that she  is  not  in
    the category of appellants who come to the United Kingdom  on  a  visit
    visa with no intention of leaving the  United  Kingdom.   She  has  not
    sought to frustrate the immigration rules by remaining here  illegally.
    This weighs heavily in her favour.

17. Section 117B(6) is  not  relevant.   The  Appellant  does  not  have  a
    parental relationship with her grandchildren.

18. I find that the Appellant is 71 years old.  She  takes  medication  for
    diabetes and blood pressure, and that she has some  eyesight  problems.
    She has poor mobility.  In a letter from Dr.  Vanessa  Mooney  dated  4
    July 2018 she stated that the Appellant "really is not well  enough  to
    live alone and this will not get any better in the future" (page  309).
    This was not the first time that the Appellant  had  been  to  see  Dr.
    Mooney.  There is another letter from her dated 7 February  2017  (page
    304).

19. Neither the Appellant nor her sons made any attempt to  exaggerate  her
    needs.  The Appellant has not claimed  that  she  cannot  manage  basic
    personal tasks such as dressing.  Omar gave evidence that her  mobility
    was "not what it used to be", but that she was able to carry out  basic
    personal tasks.  However, given her age, her mobility problems and  the
    nature  of  her  medical  conditions,  I  find  on   the   balance   of
    probabilities that she will need more assistance in the future.

20. I find that she has two supportive sons in the United Kingdom  who  see
    it as their duty to look after their mother.   Especially  taking  into
    account Omar's oral evidence of the impact that the death of his father
    had on him, I find that if the Appellant were to return to  Egypt,  and
    he was not able to fulfil this duty in  the  way  he  considers  to  be
    right, this would have significant impact on him, especially given  the
    circumstances of their father's death.  Omar gave CPR  to  his  father,
    and he and his sons were present when his father died.

21. I find that the Appellant has two  sisters  in  Egypt.   One  lives  in
    Cairo, and one in El Mahalla.  The Appellant's home was in  Alexandria.
    One sister lives with her daughter.  She is not well, and her  daughter
    cares for her.  The other sister lives with her son.

22. I find that the only income the Appellant has is  her  husband's  state
    pension, 4,000 Egyptian pounds, which amounts to about ï¿½190 per  month.
    The Appellant and her  husband  lived  in  rented  accommodation.   The
    Appellant's sons are still paying the rent on this property.  Omar gave
    evidence that it was, in effect, peppercorn rent.  They had  rented  it
    for 50 years and paid about ï¿½1 per month.  Omar gave evidence that, due
    to the low rent, they could be evicted at any time.  The rent was  this
    low as it was a very old contract.

23. The Appellant said that she would not be able to get a carer in  Egypt.
    She had asked the person who used to come  and  clean  for  them  on  a
    weekly basis, but she would not stay  overnight.   Her  sons  had  also
    asked her, but the answer was the same.  Omar gave evidence that he had
    recently researched the possibility of a carer.  It  would  cost  about
    ï¿½500 per month for a carer to come in for eight hours a day,  for  five
    or six days per week.  He gave evidence that he worried  about  leaving
    the Appellant alone without any care overnight.  He  would  also  worry
    about her as an elderly lady living alone with  someone  they  did  not
    know.

24. Omar gave evidence that his father, the Appellant's husband, used to do
    everything.  He was "the boss" at home.  The stronger parent had  died,
    and the weaker one had survived.  The effect on him of being  with  his
    father when he died had been that he was really worried now  about  his
    mother, and panicked if she got the flu, for example.

25. Taking all of the above into account, I find that the  Appellant  would
    not get the level of care in Egypt that she gets from her sons.  I find
    that overnight care would be unaffordable, even if it  were  available.
    Importantly I find that she would not get the  emotional  support  that
    she gets from her sons from a carer.  She has no family  in  Egypt  who
    would be able to care for her.

26.  I  have  considered  very  carefully  whether  family  life  could  be
    maintained with the Appellant living in Egypt and her sons remaining in
    the United Kingdom.  I have found above that the  Appellant  would  not
    get the level of care in Egypt that she gets from  her  sons.   I  find
    that this support forms a very important part  of  their  family  life,
    given the trauma that they have been through with the  death  of  their
    father.  The Appellant accepted that she could contact her  sons  using
    the phone, but I  find  that  this  contact  would  not  replace  daily
    physical contact.

27.  I  have  also  considered  the  best  interests  of  the   Appellant's
    grandchildren.  They must be a primary concern following the case of ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.  They are British citizens.   Since  December
    2016, for some two and a half years, she has been living with them  for
    half of the week.

28. Omar's sons provided letters (pages 34 and 36 of the  FTT  bundle,  and
    pages 2 and 4 of the Upper Tribunal  bundle).   They  stated  that  the
    Appellant looked after them while their mother went to work.  They said
    that they wanted her to stay as she needed  them  to  look  after  her.
    They wanted her to stay living with them for their entire lives.  While
    I accept that these  may  be  described  as  the  normal  wishes  of  a
    grandchild, and there is no indication that their  parents  are  unable
    properly  to  look  after  them,  I  find  that  given  the   traumatic
    circumstances  of  their  grandfather's  death,  they  have  a   closer
    relationship  with  the  Appellant  than  would  have  been  the   case
    otherwise.

29. In a letter from Sarah Harris, school  home  support  worker,  dated  5
    April 2019 (page 6 of the Upper Tribunal bundle) she  states  that  the
    Appellant plays an  invaluable  part  in  the  family  structure.   She
    describes her as a "vital part of the family".  It is clear  from  this
    evidence that the Appellant is known to the school,  and  is  known  to
    play a part in her grandchildren's lives.

30. In relation to Ahmed's son, his parents are now divorced.  Ahmed stated
    that  the  Appellant  had  been  "fully  supportive  (emotionally   and
    physically)  throughout  the  whole  ordeal"  ([12]  of   his   witness
    statement).  He gave evidence that the Appellant looked after  his  son
    "deeply" during the period immediately after the divorce.

31. I find that the Appellant is part  of  her  grandchildren's  lives  and
    routines.  I find that, in all the circumstances, especially given that
    they were present when their grandfather died, and in the  interest  of
    maintaining stability in their lives, it is in the  best  interests  of
    the Appellant's grandchildren for the Appellant to remain in the United
    Kingdom.

32. This is an unusual and compelling set of circumstances.  It is  due  to
    the traumatic event of her husband's sudden death  that  the  Appellant
    finds herself living in the United Kingdom, being wholly  supported  by
    her sons.  Her husband is buried in the United Kingdom, and she  visits
    his grave regularly.  It weighs heavily in the Appellant's favour  that
    she is not a burden on the public purse, and that she has not attempted
    to evade immigration control.  She enjoys family life with her sons and
    grandsons which could not be enjoyed at a long distance.  The  physical
    and emotional support that they provide could not be replicated if  she
    were to return to Egypt.

33. Taking all of the above into account, and giving  weight  to  the  best
    interests of the Appellant's grandsons, I find that the  balance  comes
    down in favour of the Appellant.  I  find  that  the  decision  is  not
    proportionate.  I find that the Appellant has shown, on the balance  of
    probabilities, that the decision is a breach of her rights,  and  those
    of her sons and grandsons, to a family life under Article 8 ECHR.

Notice of Decision

34. The Appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
