               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Claimant: no appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes. Presenting officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. For the sake of clarity, the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal  is
   referred to in this determination as the claimant. For clarity also,  the
   Secretary of State who is the appellant  here,  but  was  the  respondent
   below, is referred to in this determination as the respondent.

2. The respondent appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
   tier Tribunal promulgated on 3  December  2012  allowing  the  claimant's
   appeal against the respondent's decision made on 17 August 2012 to refuse
   to revoke a deportation order against him.

3. I make an anonymity order  protecting  the  identity  of  the  claimant's
   children and prohibiting the publication of any details permitting  their
   identification.


4. The claimant is a citizen of the Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  ("DRC")
   who arrived in the United Kingdom on 12 September  1994  to  join  family
   here. On 25 August 1999 he was granted indefinite leave to remain as  the
   dependant of his mother.  His case is that he has  two  children:  a  son
   born in 2004 who lives with his mother, and a daughter born in  2012  who
   lives with him and his partner. His partner is also a citizen of the  DRC
   settled here; their child is a British Citizen.

5. On 12 August 2008, the claimant was convicted of  handling  stolen  goods
   and conspiracy to defraud. He was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. A
   deportation order was signed against him on  24  December  2008.  Appeals
   against that decision, including a hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  in
   2010 (DA/00005/2009) were unsuccessful,  and  his  appeal  rights  became
   exhausted on 12 August 2010. He was not  removed  as,  according  to  the
   respondent, he had no Travel Document.  In  October  and  November  2011,
   further representations were made to the respondent on  the  basis  that,
   amongst other things, the claimant's mother had now died, leaving him  in
   her absence as the pivot of the family in the United Kingdom; that he was
   now in regular contact with his son.

6. The respondent refused to revoke the deportation order, considering  that
   the requirements of paragraph 399(a) were not met, as  his  son's  mother
   (his ex-partner) could look after the child.  She  considered  also  that
   while it would be in the interest of the son to have regular contact with
   his father, this could be continued by modern means of communication [28]
   and that the  child's  best  interests  were  outweighed  by  the  public
   interest in deporting the claimant.

7. The respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  paragraph
   399(b) were met, as she was not satisfied that  the  claimant  was  in  a
   subsisting relationship; nor was she satisfied that the claimant met  the
   requirements of paragraph 399A either, given that he had not  spent  over
   20 years here and there were insufficient  reasons  to  depart  from  the
   immigration rules.

8. The appeal against the respondent's decision came before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal on 1 November 2013, the panel consisting of First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Abebrese and Mr J Eames.  They found:

      i) that the evidence the claimant and his  partner  gave  about  their
         relationship was credible [15] and can be relied upon;
     ii) that the claimant and his partner are in a relationship and have  a
         child; and, that there would be a significant effect on  all  three
         of them were the claimant to be deported [15];
    iii) that the claimant has in the nearly 20  years  he  has  spent  here
         developed a substantial private life  in  addition  to  his  family
         life[15];
     iv) that the claimant's  presence  in  the  United  Kingdom  no  longer
         presents a threat or a danger to  the  public,  and  that  he  will
         desist from any further criminal activities [15];
      v) that while the Upper Tribunal had in 2010 not been  satisfied  that
         the claimant had contact with his son, they were satisfied that  he
         now does so, given the letter from his mother and the  evidence  of
         the claimant and his partner [15], notwithstanding the respondent's
         withdrawal of the concession that family life existed  between  the
         claimant and his son [16];
     vi) that it would not be in the interests of the son for  the  claimant
         to be deported [15];
    vii) that "the public interest  in  deportation  is  outweighed  by  the
         evidence against the  claimant's  deportation  in  respect  of  his
         private had family life [16];
   viii) that the appeal fell to be allowed under the immigration rules  and
         under article 8 of the Human Rights Convention [19];

9. The respondent sought permission to  appeal   on  the  grounds  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal had erred in law:


      i) By failing to give adequate reasons for concluding in  the  absence
         of corroborative documentation that the claimant  and  his  partner
         were in a relationship [1]; had failed to address the outcome of  a
         previous adjournment to obtain  a  social  work  report  which  had
         resulted in a report concerning only the claimant's teenage sister;
     ii) By failing to give adequate reasons for going behind the finding of
         the Upper Tribunal made in 2010 that  the  claimant's  relationship
         with   his   son   was   not   sufficient   to   make   deportation
         disproportionate; and, that that conclusion and  the  finding  that
         the claimant and his  partner  were  credible,  were  based  on  an
         incomplete assessment of the evidence [4];
    iii) By failing to take into  account  when  assessing  proportionality,
         public policy  as  set  out  in  the  article  8  sections  of  the
         immigration rules [5,6];

10.  On  21  December  2012,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Mailer   granted
   permission on all grounds. There is no reply to the grant of permission.

Adjourned Hearing on 24 June 2013

11. This matter first came before me on 24 June  2013.   On  that  occasion,
   there was no appearance by the claimant and it was only  after  enquiries
   had been made of his representatives, Fletcher Dervish & Co,  seeking  an
   explanation for non-attendance that a representative from that  firm,  Mr
   Diavewa, arrived at court at 12.50 p.m.  Mr Diavewa  explained  that  his
   firm had sent a brief to 12 Old Square Chambers  as  Mr  Klear  of  those
   Chambers had represented the claimant before  the  First-tier.   He  said
   that the brief had been returned, apparently without explanation.  As  he
   did not have a file he was unable to provide me with any attendance  note
   or other correspondence indicating that Counsel had been instructed.   He
   said that the claimant was aware that he should have been at court and he
   had been surprised to learn that he did not attend.  He said he attempted
   to contact him by telephone but that this appeared to  have  been  turned
   off.

12. In the  circumstances,  I  gave  oral  directions,  later  confirmed  in
   writing, requiring the claimant's solicitors to provide a  full,  written
   explanation for what had happened and, an  explanation  from  Mr  Klear's
   clerk for the brief being returned.  A new  date  for  hearing,  23  July
   2013, was fixed in Mr Diavewa's presence. I explained that if the  matter
   were to proceed to remaking the decision it  would  proceed  on  23  July
   2013, and that therefore the  claimant's  representatives  should  ensure
   that the witnesses attend.

13. Subsequent to that on 28 June  2013  Mr  Djemal  Dervish,  Principal  of
   Fletcher Dervish  and  Company  wrote  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   It  is
   explained that they had received the notice of hearing for 24 June  2013,
   had explained this to Counsel and had briefed  him  to  attend  but  that
   unfortunately they inserted the date of hearing in their diary system  as
   25 June and briefed Counsel on that, incorrect basis  and  that  although
   the notice of hearing giving the correct date, 24 June 2013, was  amongst
   Counsel's papers, the error was not noticed and Counsel was not available
   for 25 June.  Chambers then returned the papers on 21 June 2013 at  which
   point alternative Counsel had been briefed to attend on 25 June 2013.   I
   note that the letter from Mr Dervish dated 28 June 2013 is headed

         "Re Appeal Number  IA/18503/2012  Appellant  A  K  Z  next  hearing
         23/07/2013 [emphasis added]."

Hearing on 23 July 2013

14. When the matter came before me at 10 a.m. on 23 July 2013 there  was  no
   appearance either from the claimant or from his representatives.   I  had
   enquiries made of the claimant's representatives and at 11.59 they sent a
   fax stating

         "We find ourselves very unfortunately in a very similar position to
         what happened on the last occasion.  The only  difference  on  this
         occasion is that we have been without fresh instructions since  the
         last hearing and we were proposing to notify the court that we  may
         not have been able to attend.  Unfortunately, we have not  informed
         the court and we again sincerely apologise.  We will make one  last
         endeavour to  contact  our  client  within  the  next  14  days  to
         determine whether or not we will continue to be acting.

         However it is we feel pertinent that although today's  hearing  was
         given to us orally at the  last  hearing,  we  were  never  sent  a
         hearing notice, which would have triggered an entry in our  hearing
         diary.  It would seem that having written the letter to  the  court
         on 27 June 2013 a copy was sent to the Counsel's clerk  at  12  Old
         Square, who we understand were also required at the last hearing to
         given an explanation, the file was put away."

   The letter indicates that the brief has since been returned. Despite  the
   reference to seeking further instructions from their  client,  there  has
   been no further communication from him or his representatives.

15. While it may well be  that  the  hearing  notice  was  not  received  by
   Fletcher Dervish & Co that does not absolve them from failing  to  attend
   the hearing as they acknowledge that they were given oral notice  of  the
   hearing and it is to say the least remarkable that although their  letter
   to the court of 28 June 2013 (see paragraph 14 above) clearly shows  that
   they were aware of the hearing  on  23  July  2013,  this  fact  was  not
   recorded in any diary.

16. In all the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that  this  is
   a sufficient explanation for the claimant's failure to  attend  court  or
   for his representatives to fail to attend.  I am not  satisfied  that  it
   would be on the facts of this case, given that the solicitors accept they
   were notified of the hearing date, that sufficient reason has been  given
   as to why this appeal should now be  adjourned.   I  therefore  proceeded
   with the appeal.

Does the determination of the First-tier Tribunal involve the making  of  an
error of law?

17. I am satisfied that it does for the reasons set  out  below.  Ms  Holmes
   submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in their analysis of the
   evidence in failing to take into account the  findings  by  the  previous
   Tribunal as upheld by Upper Tribunal Judge Nichols in  her  determination
   promulgated on 26 July 2010.  She submitted further that they had  failed
   to engage with the respondent's submissions that there was little  or  no
   evidence that the claimant has a relationship with his son and  that  was
   of particular concern in the context of the previous concerns about  lack
   of documentation in particular in relation to the elder child as well  as
   the conflict between him and his former partner as to how much contact he
   had.

18. Ms Holmes submitted that in addition, whilst considering  doubts  should
   have been raised in the First-tier Tribunal's mind  from  the  very  late
   registration of the birth  of  the  elder  child  and  the  lack  of  any
   documentary evidence to show  that  the  claimant  and  his  claimed  new
   partner were in a relationship. Ms Holmes submitted also that the  First-
   tier Tribunal's consideration of the public interest  against  which  any
   family and private life needs to be balanced was wholly unreasoned.

19. In their determination the First-tier Tribunal say this [15]:

         "The Tribunal notes the facts and evidence previous application  in
         that the appellant does have a second child  as  stated  above  and
         that he is in a relationship with  his  present  partner  who  gave
         evidence on his behalf in these proceedings.  The Tribunal take the
         view that the evidence in respect of this relationship is  credible
         and that the evidence that  was  given  by  the  claimant  and  his
         partner can be relied upon to substantiate  the  relationship  that
         they have together.  They have a child and the  Tribunal  took  the
         view that their relationship is cemented by the presence  of  [that
         child] and that it would indeed  be  an  impact  on  all  concerned
         presently and in the future if the claimant  were  to  be  deported
         from the United Kingdom."

20. What is remarkable about this passage is that it  indicates  the  First-
   tier Tribunal believed that the claimant's most  recent  application,  to
   have the deportation order against him revoked, which was the subject  of
   a refusal on 17 August 2012, had been based on his relationship with  his
   current partner (whom I refer to as Ms B) and the existence of her child.

21. It is evident from the refusal letter that that was  not  the  basis  on
   which the claimant sought to  have  the  deportation  order  revoked  but
   rather his relationship with his older child.   There  is  no  indication
   that it was submitted to the respondent  prior  to  the  service  of  the
   appeal bundle that he was in a  relationship  with  his  claimed  current
   partner which is said to have  endured  for  some  two  to  three  years.
   Whilst I accept that the younger child was not yet born,  it  is  unclear
   why the fact that the  mother  was  pregnant  was  not  raised  with  the
   respondent.

22.  As  the  First-tier  Tribunal  notes,  [15]  they  had  Judge  Nichols'
   determination yet despite the  significant  concerns  recorded  in  there
   about the relationship between the claimant and his  former  partner  and
   child, they do not adequately explain why they now accept that  they  are
   now satisfied that the situation  had  changed  considerably  since  that
   determination, given the discrepancies in evidence referred to  in  Judge
   Nichols' determination.

23. I consider that the First-tier Tribunal has given  insufficient  reasons
   for concluding that, in the absence  of  any  documentary  evidence,  and
   given the concerns raised about the claimant's credibility in a  previous
   determination,  the  claimant  and  his  claimed  partner   were   in   a
   relationship and had been for some two to three years and that they had a
   child, in the absence even of a birth  certificate.   Whilst  credibility
   was a matter for the First-tier Tribunal, given that  what  is  concerned
   here is the serious matter  of  the  welfare  of  two  children,  it  was
   incumbent on them for them to give a  proper  reasoned  approach  to  the
   evidence and to explain adequately to the respondent  why  they  rejected
   her submissions first that the claimant  had  a  continuing  relationship
   with his older child and second that he was in a relationship with  Ms  B
   and that they had had a child together.  I consider that this failure  to
   give adequate reasons for findings of fact is a  material  error  of  law
   given that these findings of fact underpin First-tier Tribunal's  finding
   that it  would  be  disproportionate  to  deport  the  claimant  to  DRC.
   Further, in what is a highly fact-sensitive issue, it cannot be said that
   the First-tier Tribunal would not, had they given thought to the  defects
   in the evidence and the submissions  of  the  respondent,  have  come  to
   another decision nor, that they could not have done so reasonably.

24. The claimant had been convicted  on  a  guilty  plea  of  conspiracy  to
   defraud and handling stolen goods.   It  is  clear  from  the  sentencing
   remarks  that  he  had  pleaded  guilty  to   possession   of   a   false
   identification document.  He was also  sentenced  for  breaching  earlier
   community orders imposed on 10 April 2007 for a conspiracy to defraud.

25. The First-tier Tribunal were aware that the claimant  faced  deportation
   under the automatic provisions set out in the UK Borders  Act  and  could
   not have been aware that as a result his deportation was deemed conducive
   to the public good.

26. As is noted in SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  550,  there  is  a  strong
   public interest in deporting foreign criminals.  Whilst that decision had
   not been handed down at the time the First-tier  Tribunal  reached  their
   decision, the learning on this issue establishes that significant  weight
   has to be attached to the public interest in deporting such persons.

27. The First-tier Tribunal  said  only  this  in  relation  to  the  public
   interest:

         "The Tribunal took the view on balance that there  is  evidence  of
         family life before us and that the public interest of the public in
         this instance in respect of  deportation  were  outweighed  by  the
         evidence against the [claimant]'s deportation  in  respect  of  his
         private and family life."

28. This is inadequate.  It discloses  no  basis  on  which  the  respondent
   could know why the strong public interest in  favour  of  deportation  in
   this case was  outweighed;  there  is  no  proper  analysis.   For  these
   reasons, I am satisfied that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal
   did involve the making of an error of law and I set it aside.

29. The respondent  has  not  challenged  the  finding  in  respect  of  the
   claimant no longer presenting a threat or danger to the public or that he
   will  desist  from  further  criminal  activities  in  this  country  and
   accordingly, that must stand.

Remaking the Decision

30. It is not disputed that the claimant arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in
   1994 or that he was granted leave to remain;  or,  that  he  was  granted
   indefinite leave to remain in August 1999 in line with his  mother.   The
   claimant has been present in the United Kingdom since the age  of  9  and
   has been here for now very nearly twenty years.  That  is  a  significant
   factor in his favour.  It appears from the social work report in  respect
   of his sister that he has played an important part in her life but  there
   is no witness statement from her nor is there any evidence before me from
   the claimant about his relationship with her.  In any event, it is  clear
   from the social work report that he has other  siblings  here  but  again
   there is no evidence from them about their relationship.

31. In considering the claimant's claim that he has a relationship  with  Ms
   B, I have not had the  benefit  of  hearing  evidence  from  her  or  the
   claimant.  Beyond her witness statement there is no documentary  evidence
   of where she lives nor, beyond the evidence of her and  the  claimant  is
   there any evidence that they lived together as it is unsupported by other
   evidence.  Similarly, it is only their evidence that he is the father  of
   her child.

32. I considered that the fact that the existence of  this  relationship  is
   not mentioned in submissions made to the respondent prior to  the  appeal
   is significant.  There is no mention in the social work report  that  the
   claimant is any long-term relationship.

33. I do not consider that, in the absence of more  detailed  testimony  and
   documentary evidence such as  photographs  of  them  together,  that  the
   situation of contact between the claimant and his son has  changed  since
   the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Nichols.  Judge Nichols  found  that
   there was no birth certificate and whilst I accept that  this  was  later
   amended to show that he is the father, it does not follow from this  that
   there  has  been  any  real,  substantial  and  lasting  change  in   the
   relationship.

34.  Whilst  I  note  that  it  is  said  that  the  claimant  has  a  close
   relationship with his sister, who is a minor, and that she is recorded as
   saying she could not cope with life without her  brother,  she  also  has
   other family on whom to depend including other brothers and an  aunt  but
   equally I note they do not live  together  and  the  level  of  financial
   support for her said to come  from  the  claimant  is  not  supported  by
   documentary evidence nor is it clear where the  claimant  receives  these
   funds from.  Further, it is difficult to attach much weight  to  what  is
   recorded as being the younger sister's words  but  there  is  no  witness
   statement from her nor has she  attended  to  give  evidence  and  to  be
   subjected to cross-examination, if relevant.   I  therefore  attach  less
   weight to this evidence.  Whilst it is not apparently in doubt that their
   mother has died, and it would be remarkable if she had not been  strongly
   affected by this, it is also remarkable that she has provided no evidence
   in support of her brother's case.

35. I accept that the claimant would be returning to DRC,  a  country  which
   he left some twenty years ago and about which he may know little.   While
   there is in the claimant's bundle a report on DRC at pages 54 to 75, this
   report is concerned with the state of the media and  it  is  unclear  why
   this is of any relevance to the  claimant's  situation  on  return.   The
   additional material in the bundle said to form part of  the  same  report
   includes a generic  statement  on  international  protection  covering  a
   number of countries and is of little or  no  relevance  to  DRC.   Whilst
   there is a letter (page 83) from a Congolese support group  this  has  no
   particular relevance to the claimant.

36. Taking all of these matters into account, I am not satisfied, given  the
   very limited evidence before me, that the claimant is in  a  relationship
   with Ms B or that he is the father of her  child.   I  am  not  satisfied
   either that he has a family relationship with her.

37. Whilst I accept  that  the  claimant's  sister  may  have  an  emotional
   attachment to him they do not cohabit and I  am  not  satisfied,  in  the
   absence of clear testimony from her and him that there continues to exist
   between them a family life although I accept that this may  have  existed
   in the past when they were younger.  His removal may have  an  impact  on
   her but only in the sense of her private life and whilst it may be in her
   interests, as a minor, for him to be here,  and  although  she  has  only
   limited contact with her birth father, she has other  relatives  in  this
   country including an aunt and brothers on whom she relies also.

38. I accept, given the findings of the previous  court  that  the  claimant
   has a son in this country but I am not satisfied that they  have  regular
   contact and the family life, which I  accept  must  exist,  is  now  very
   attenuated and of limited content.  There is limit evidence of the effect
   there would be on the child.  I consider that therefore,  the  claimant's
   removal to DRC would have a minimal impact on the family life that exists
   between him and his son.

39. Following Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60  (IAC)
   and MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  00393(IAC),  I  deal
   first with the position under the Immigration Rules. I consider  that  by
   operation of paragraph 390A of the immigration rules, the  appellant  may
   be able to succeed if he meets the requirements of paragraph 399 or 399A.
   I find that the does not, given that he has not established that he has a
   subsisting parental relationship with his son,  or  the  claimed  younger
   child, or that he has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  Ms  B.
   Further, he is over 25 and has not lived in this country  for  20  years,
   discounting his periods of imprisonment.

40. In turning to the issue of Article 8, I bear in mind the  questions  set
   out by Lord Bingham at paragraph 17 of the opinions in Razgar.    I  bear
   in mind also the decisions in �ner v The Netherlands (2007)  45  EHRR  14
   ("�ner") and  Maslov  [2009]  INLR  47  which,  with  other  cases,  were
   summarised in Masih (deportation - public interest  -  basic  principles)
   Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046(IAC) at paragraph 11:


    11. In our view those basic principles, on the public interest  side  of
        the balancing  exercise,  are  as  follows;  we  have  set  out  the
        authorities on which they are based in foot-notes, to make it  clear
        that there is no need for further reference to them by panels:


       (a)     In a case of automatic deportation[1], full account  must  be
       taken of the strong public  interest  in  removing  foreign  citizens
       convicted of serious offences, which lies not only in the  prevention
       of further offences on the part of the individual concerned,  but  in
       deterring others from committing them in the first place[2];
       (b)       Deportation  of  foreign  criminals  expresses  society's
       condemnation  of  serious  criminal  activity  and  promotes   public
       confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens  who  have  committed
       them[3];
       (c)        The starting-point for assessing the facts of the offence
       of which an individual  has  been  committed,  and  their  effect  on
       others, and on the public as a whole, must be the view taken  by  the
       sentencing judge[4];
       (d)       The appeal has to be  dealt  with  on  the  basis  of  the
       situation at the date of the hearing;
       (e)       Full account should also be taken of any developments since
       sentence was passed, for  example  the  result  of  any  disciplinary
       adjudications in prison or detention, or any OASys or licence report;
       (f)        In considering the relevant facts on 'private and  family
       life' under article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
       "for a settled migrant[5] who has lawfully spent all  or  the  major
       part of his or her  childhood  and  youth  in  [this]  country,  very
       serious reasons are required to justify expulsion"[6];
       (g)       Such serious reasons are needed "all the more so where the
       person concerned committed the relevant offences as a juvenile" [7];
       but "very serious violent offences can justify expulsion even if they
       were committed by a minor"[8] . Other very serious offending may also
       have this consequence.


41. I accept that the burden is on the Secretary  of  State  to  demonstrate
   that her actions are proportionate, but the balancing exercise  can  only
   be undertaken once facts are established. As a general principle,  it  is
   for the person asserting the fact to prove it.

42. The welfare of the children is a paramount concern, but in this case,  I
   have little or no credible evidence as to the links the claimant has with
   his so; and, as noted above I am not satisfied that the claimant  is  the
   father of Ms B's child, or that he  is  in  a  family  relationship  with
   either of them. I am not satisfied that the claimant has anything  but  a
   very tenuous link with his son or that he has any  regular  contact  with
   him. In the absence of evidence as to the  child's  wishes,  or  reliable
   evidence as to his current circumstances, or any reliable evidence  other
   as to the impact on him of the claimant's removal,  I  am  not  satisfied
   that that would cause any substantial detrimental effect  on  the  child.
   While it may be in his best interests for his father to remain here,  and
   I bear in mind he may well wish to re-establish links  with  his  father,
   these factors must still be weighed.


43. In this case there is no evidence of  any  adjudications  in  prison  or
   detention, nor of any re-offending. These are matters in  the  claimant's
   favour. It is also very much in his favour that he as spent  by  far  the
   greater part of his life here, but equally he has a history of  offending
   and there is in fact little change in his situation since his deportation
   was found by Judge Nichols to be proportionate other than the  fact  that
   he is older and has spent more time here.

44. That said, I remind myself that the claimant  has  spent  a  substantial
   part of his life in this  country,  where  his  siblings  live,  and  was
   partially educated and , to a great extent, formed here. He has been here
   for nearly 20 years, and these are weighty matters in his favour. He  has
   not, however, put his case forward to any  substantial  degree,  and  has
   failed to attend before Tribunals on more than one occasion.

45. I turn now to the factors which weigh against the  appellant.  There  is
   here, a history of offending which goes back a number of years, including
   breaches of community sentences imposed against him. This shows a  degree
   of contempt for the legal process and the further offending  after  those
   sentences were imposed is a factor weighing against him albeit that he is
   now of low risk of re-offending.


1. I note that in  OH (Serbia) v  SSHD [2008]  EWCA  Civ  694 Wilson  LJ
   summarised the relevant principles as follows at paragraph 15:

     a) The risk of reoffending is one facet of the public interest but, in
        the case of very serious crimes, not the most important facet.


     b) Another important facet is the need to deter foreign nationals from
        committing serious crimes  by  leading  them  to  understand  that,
        whatever the other circumstances, one consequence of them may  well
        be deportation.


     c) A further important facet is the role of a deportation order as  an
        expression of society's revulsion at serious crimes and in building
        public confidence in the treatment of  foreign  citizens  who  have
        committed serious crimes.


     d)  Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose view  of  it
        is likely to be wider and better informed than that of a  tribunal,
        resides in the respondent and accordingly  a  tribunal  hearing  an
        appeal against a decision to deport should not  only  consider  for
        itself all the facets of the public interest but should weigh, as a
        linked but independent feature, the approach to them adopted by the
        respondent in the context of the facts of the  case.  Speaking  for
        myself, I would not however describe the tribunal's  duty  in  this
        regard as being higher than 'to weigh' this feature."


46. I consider also that factors (b) and (c) identified in OH  (Serbia)  are
   of considerable importance here, not least because of the seriousness  of
   the most recent offences, and the effect on the  public  as  a  whole.  I
   consider that the seriousness of  the  offences  and  the  need  to  mark
   society's revulsion at serious crimes  weigh  significantly  against  the
   claimant, all the more so given  the  fact  that,  as  was  noted  in  SS
   (Nigeria) Parliament has indicated  that  significant  weight  is  to  be
   attached to the public interest in deporting those to whom section 32  of
   the UK Borders Act 2007 applies.

47. I accept that deporting the claimant to  DRC  will  have  a  significant
   impact on the claimant and in particular  on  the  private  life  he  has
   created here, severing the ties he has made with this country,  and  with
   his siblings. I accept also that it will in effect sever the relationship
   (such that it is) with his son. Nonetheless, given the tenuousness of his
   family life, I consider that it is a proportionate interference with  the
   claimant's right to respect for his private and  family  life  to  deport
   him, given the significant weight to be attached to the  public  interest
   in showing that foreign criminals, particularly those who have  continued
   to offend, and given that his  deportation  is,  as  is  deemed  by  law,
   conducive to the public good.

48.  For all these reasons, I find that the claimant has failed  to  satisfy
   me that he meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules such that  his
   deportation order should be revoked or that the respondent's decision not
   to do so amounts to a disproportionate interference  with  his  right  to
   respect for his private and family life.  I therefore dismiss the  appeal
   on all grounds.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the  making  of
   an error of law. I set it aside

2. I re-make the determination by dismissing it on all grounds.
