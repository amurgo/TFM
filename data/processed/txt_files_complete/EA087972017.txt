                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr D McGlashan, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellant  appeals  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Agnew,
    promulgated on 21 August 2018.

 2. It was conceded for the respondent that the  decision  does  not  reach
    clear conclusions on the evidence which was before it,  and  could  not
    stand as a legally adequate resolution of the case.

 3. Based on discussions between representatives, the appellant may now  in
    a position to apply for a registration certificate, with good prospects
    of success.  Any application will fall to be resolved  on  its  merits,
    but it may be that would result in withdrawal of this case,  and  avoid
    further unnecessary process.

 4. Mr McGlashan undertook to apply promptly, and said that should not take
    more than two weeks.  Mr Matthews indicated that he would try  to  have
    the matter prioritised as far as possible.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. The nature of the  case  is  such
    that it is appropriate under section 12 of  the  2007  Act,  and  under
    Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to  the  FtT  for  an  entirely  fresh
    hearing. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case  are  not
    to include Judge Agnew.

 6. The case should not be listed in the FtT until on or  after  the  first
    available date in April 2019.  It  should  by  then  be  clear  whether
    matters have been resolved, or whether the re-hearing needs to proceed.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
