For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a  national  of  Iraq,  date  of  birth  2  April  1991,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, of 12 July 2016  to  refuse
    asylum and  protection  claims.   Her  appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Caleb (the Judge) whose decision promulgated on 2  March
    2017 dismissed the appeal for protection under the  Refugee  Convention
    Articles 2 and  3  ECHR,  and  generally  under  Article  8  ECHR.   An
    anonymity direction was made and is continued.

2.   I considered the challenge on 20 December 2017 promulgated my  decision
    that the Original Tribunal's decision could not stand because the Judge
    had failed to  give  sufficient  or  adequate  reasons  addressing  the
    totality of the  evidence.   I  gave  directions  for  further  witness
    statements and evidence to be filed and for the case to be  listed  for
    decision by me on its merits.

3.   To that end a fresh bundle was prepared  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant
    which contained a helpful chronology as well  as  statements  from  the
    Appellant, the Appellant's  father,   the  Appellant's  aunt  (initials
    KHM),  a country expert report from Dr Alan George, dated  15  February
    2018, and background evidence supporting the claim  of  risk  that  the
    Appellant faced.

4.   At the hearing before the Judge evidence was given from an aunt of  the
    Appellant (ZA) and a relative, Mr FSH.  Essentially, the  parties  have
    for these purposes today identified that whilst the Appellant fears the
    risk of being kidnapped and  relies  upon  historical  matters  of  her
    brother being kidnapped, at its core the question of real risk  is  the
    return to Baghdad of the Appellant as a lone female.  The evidence  has
    therefore been filed to the effect that the  Appellant's  close  family
    are not living within Baghdad or Iraq  but  are  living  outside  their
    country of origin, either in Turkey, Sweden, or the UK.

5.   The position is that the  Appellant  (and  it  is  not  argued  to  the
    contrary) is a lone woman and on a return to Iraq would have no home to
    return to, no family network to support her, no other  support  of  any
    sort, and no effective protectors against kidnapping,  violence,  abuse
    or being taken advantage of as a single woman.

6.   The Appellant's evidence reflected in her  statements  shows  that  she
    comes from  a  relatively  well-to-do  family,  largely  consisting  of
    professional persons, all of  whom  have  left  Iraq:  They  have  been
    leaving since about 2014/2015, and the last aunt, KMH,  in  2016.   The
    evidence is that they have left because of conditions in Iraq,  threats
    they faced, difficulties arising from their  religious  faith  and  the
    circumstances as events deteriorated in  Iraq.   Mr  Bramble  does  not
    argue that the Appellant could return to the KRG or that she  would  be
    any safer there than elsewhere in Iraq.

7.   The Appellant makes plain that she simply has no-one  to  turn  to  and
    that she is vulnerable to threats as a lone woman, but more importantly
    perhaps, a lone woman who has lived outside of her home country  for  a
    number of years  who  would  be  perceived  as  being  of  a  different
    background, putting aside other considerations.   The  position,  which
    was not substantively argued  to  the  contrary,  putting  aside  other
    matters, the assessment on the evidence and  the  opinion  of  Dr  Alan
    George was of real risk of ill-treatment on return or of serious  harm.
    The material from Dr Alan George addressed the  position  of  women  in
    Iraq and the risks they generally  face,  as  well  as  the  risks  the
    Appellant faced as a lone female without male support.  Dr George  said
    this:-

         "144.    If returned to Iraq, Ms H would be vulnerable - especially
                in non-KRG Iraq - as a single female  without  a  supportive
                family network.  I refer  to  my  Paragraphs  119-136.   The
                risks she would face would be especially severe because,  in
                this highly patriarchal society,  she  would  have  no  male
                protectors.


         145.  As  a  single  woman  she  would  face  serious   risks   and
                difficulties throughout Iraq.  I have stressed in my  Report
                ... the crucial importance of such family support networks."

     He noted other  material  from  a  joint  British  Danish  Fact-Finding
    Mission as well as from the UNHCR which identified the risks that women
    who do not benefit from any type of  family  network  or  tribal  links
    within Iraq, do not have the protection; They are even more at risk and
    likely to be prime targets for traffickers.

8.       The dangers faced by single women have clearly been  recognised  in
    other material, not least the country guidance  cases  of  AA  (Article
    15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC) and BA (Returns to Baghdad) Iraq
    CG [2017] UKUT 00018 which identified  the  general  lack  of  security
    within Baghdad, the risks of kidnapping, the greater  use  of  violence
    and  the  difficulties  that  those  without   protection   face   from
    kidnapping, including kidnapping returnees from the west.  In that case
    Dr George appeared and gave evidence on a range  of  subjects  and  his
    views and representations were accepted  by  the  Tribunal.   There  is
    nothing within BA that qualifies the real risks that a lone woman might
    face.  The Appellant claims to be at risk  of  persecution  as  a  lone
    woman (a particular social group) on return to Baghdad.  The burden  of
    proof is upon her to  establish  that  risk,  but  in  accordance  with
    familiar case law the standard of proof is a low one and  I  rely  upon
    the case of Karanakaran [2000] EWCA  Civ  11  as  well  as  Sivakumaran
    [1968] Imm AR 147 and Ravichandran [1996] ImmAR 97.

9.    The  position  is  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  which   was   not
    substantively challenged on this issue by Mr Bramble stands as reliable
    evidence of the risks she faces.  In addition, Dr George also  comments
    upon the risks of kidnapping and he takes the view that  the  risks  of
    kidnapping that Miss H would face in Iraq would  not  be  high  and  he
    gives his reasons for that.  Nevertheless, even if it  is  subjectively
    well-held as, the fact is that  extortion,  exploitation  and  violence
    represent  real  threats  to  a  single  woman  without  a  network  or
    protectors to turn to in Iraq.

10.  In these circumstances I find the Appellant has discharged  the  burden
    of proof to that low standard that she is at risk  of  persecution  and
    for the same reasons, on the same evidence, that  she  faces  the  real
    risk of Article 2 and Article 3 ill-treatment on the basis that she  is
    vulnerable to exploitation and abuse from militia forces of one sort or
    another, either deployed or in being in Iraq.  Accordingly, whether the
    fear is of the state or of non-state agents, I  find  on  the  evidence
    that internal relocation is not a reasonable  option  on  the  evidence
    before me. I also find on the evidence  that  there  is  no  sufficient
    protection to  which  she  could  have  recourse.   For  these  reasons
    therefore, and briefly, I find that her case properly sits against  the
    objective material and that read as a whole, together with  the  expert
    evidence. I find the Appellant has discharged the burden  of  proof  of
    the real risks that she faces on return.  It seemed  to  me  consistent
    with her claim the fact that so many others of her relatives have  left
    Iraq, settled in other countries and show no signs whatsoever of return
    to Iraq.

11.  I indicated to the parties and they agreed that on the  basis  that  if
    the need for protection was to be found under the  Refugee  Convention,
    or alternatively through Humanitarian Protection, was established there
    was no issue about return with reference to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules, nor in relation to  Article  8  ECHR.  The  Original
    Tribunal's decision does  not  stand  and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted. In the  alternative,  if  the  threat  is  from  non-state
    agents, whilst the risk is of serious harm I  would  have  allowed  the
    appeal on Humanitarian Protection grounds.

NOTICE OF DECISION
12.  The appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention.

ANONYMITY
An anonymity direction was made and is continued.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of ï¿½140.00 was paid.  In the light of  the  additional  evidence  that
has been provided now it is clear that the matter  has  significantly  moved
on in terms of up-to-date and relevant evidence on  the  Appellant's  behalf
and it seems to me that a fee award is not appropriate.
