For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr A Alexander, Counsel instructed on
Direct Access


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer from the decision  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision to refuse him entry clearance as
    the spouse of a  person  present  and  settled  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is required for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national  of  Turkey.   His  application  for  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  was
    refused on two grounds by an Entry Clearance  Officer  (post  reference
    965737) on 18 December 2012.

 3. The first ground was that he was  not  satisfied  that  the  claimant's
    relationship with his sponsor was genuine and subsisting or  that  they
    intended to live together permanently in the UK.  He stated he had  met
    his sponsor in May 2011, and that the relationship had started the same
    day.  He noted they had married on 3 September  2012.   He  had  stated
    they stayed in touch over the telephone, but the  information  provided
    did not demonstrate communication between two parties in a relationship
    akin to marriage.

 4. The second ground  was  that  the  sponsor  was  not  exempt  from  the
    financial requirements as defined in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  The claimant
    had not provided a copy of the sponsor's employment  contract  or  bank
    statements corresponding to the same six month  period  as  wage  slips
    demonstrating payment of wages  as  evidence  of  his  sponsor's  gross
    income from her employment.  These  documents  were  specified  in  the
    guidance, and had to be provided.  So his application was refused under
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Rules.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Mackintosh  sitting  at  Taylor
    House in the First-tier Tribunal on 31 March  2014.   Mr  Alexander  of
    Counsel appeared on behalf of the claimant,  and  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was represented by a Home Office Presenting Officer.

 6. In his subsequent determination, the judge found that the claimant  was
    in a genuine and subsisting marriage.  On the question of the financial
    requirements, he found that the sponsor, Ms Diyenli, was  in  full-time
    employment at the date of  decision,  receiving  a  monthly  income  of
    �1,300.  So he found on the balance of probabilities that the  claimant
    had established that he met requirements of the Rules, and he therefore
    allowed the appeal under the Rules.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 7. On 20 May  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Reed  granted  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         The grounds do disclose an arguable error of law, as it is  unclear
         from the determination whether or not the [claimant]  had  provided
         all the required documentary evidence with  regard  to  maintenance
         specified in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules.   The  judge
         has not clearly explained how the [claimant] met  the  requirements
         of the Rules before allowing the appeal.  Indeed, in  paragraph  17
         the determination refers to the sponsor receiving a monthly  income
         of �1,300 (it is unclear whether this is gross or net), if it is  a
         net sum, this income would fall well below the required  figure  of
         �18,600 per annum.  In any event, the documentary  requirements  of
         the Rules had to be  met  before  any  finding  upon  an  appellant
         meeting the required income level can be made.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 8. At the hearing before me, I received submissions from Mr Alexander  and
    Mr Nath on whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did, or  did
    not, contain a material error  of  law.   Having  ruled  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's favour on this question (for the  reasons  which  I
    give below) I heard submissions  from  both  of  them  as  to  how  the
    decision should be remade.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses a material  error  of
    law because the judge has failed to give adequate reasons  for  finding
    that the sponsor had an annual gross income of at least �18,600 at  the
    date of application (5 October 2012) or indeed at the date of decision.

10. I note that earlier in his decision  he  records  that  the  Presenting
    Officer conceded that the net income shown in the sponsor's wage  slips
    matched the recorded credits in her bank statements.  Upon a review  of
    these documents, it is apparent that the figure of �1,300  referred  to
    later by the judge is a net income figure per month.  The  evidence  of
    the payslips is that the gross amount that the  sponsor  was  receiving
    each month was in excess of �1,600, and this corresponds to  an  annual
    gross salary in excess of �18,600.

11. However, one of the evidential deficiencies identified in  the  refusal
    of entry clearance was a failure to provide  a  copy  of  the  relevant
    employment contract; and in his ECM review, the Entry Clearance Manager
    highlighted the  absence  of  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's  employer
    "stating the required information".

12. At paragraph 9 of his determination, the judge addressed this aspect of
    the evidence.  At the hearing, the sponsor submitted a letter from Well
    Food and Drink Limited dated 7 January 2013, which simply repeated  the
    fact that she worked for the company on a full-time basis. But, as  the
    judge noted, the letter did not provide details of the  sponsor's  rate
    of pay or her hours of work.  Similarly, Koza  International  Food  and
    Wine confirmed that the sponsor had commenced employment with them on 1
    February 2012 and outlined her duties.  But the  letter  did  not  give
    details of her hours of work or her rate of pay.

13. Under Appendix FM-SE, the provision of such information in a  specified
    document or documents is a  mandatory  requirement.   Although  it  was
    reasonable for the judge on a holistic assessment of  the  evidence  to
    reach the conclusion that the sponsor had in fact been earning at least
    �18,600 gross per annum at the date of application/decision, it was not
    open to the judge to allow the appeal under the Rules as there had been
    non-compliance with a mandatory requirement of Appendix FM-SE.

14. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error
    of law such that the decision allowing the claimant's  appeal  outright
    has to be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

15. Mr Alexander argued in the alternative before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that the appeal should be allowed under  Article  8  ECHR.   The  judge
    below did not address Article 8, as he allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Rules.  Mr Alexander submitted to me that the appeal should be  allowed
    under Article 8 as it was harsh that the claimant did not succeed under
    the Rules in circumstances where the sponsor was  in  fact  earning  at
    least �18,600 gross per annum, and the claimant had in effect lost  out
    on a technicality.

16. But as stated by the Specialist Appeals Team when seeking permission to
    appeal,  if  the  sponsor's  current  income  does  exceed  the  income
    threshold, there is nothing to prevent the claimant from making a fresh
    application based on the sponsor's income at this time.   The  sponsor,
    who was present in court, confirmed to me that she continued to earn  a
    gross income of around �1,600  each  month,  albeit  with  a  different
    employer.

17. Some eighteen months have  elapsed  since  the  application  for  entry
    clearance was refused.  But the appeal process has not been a waste  of
    time or money,  as  the  claimant  has  obtained  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal a crucial finding in his favour which will  assist  him  in  a
    fresh application for entry clearance: the finding that his marriage to
    the sponsor is genuine and subsisting.  This is not a finding which the
    Entry Clearance Officer has sought to challenge by way of appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal, so the First-tier Tribunal's finding of  fact  on  this
    essential question stands.

18. In all the circumstances, I do not consider it can be said to be harsh,
    still less unjustifiably harsh, to require the claimant to make a fresh
    application which is compliant with Appendix FM-SE.  It does not appear
    that the claimant will  have  any  difficulty  in  complying  with  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE, and there is no reason to suppose  that
    there will be any undue delay in the Entry Clearance Officer  making  a
    decision  on  a  fresh  application.   The  decision  on  the  original
    application was made rapidly, within a matter of weeks.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against refusal of entry clearance  as  a
partner is dismissed under the Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.
