Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. J Walsh, Counsel, instructed by Gulbenkian

For the Respondent:    Mr. D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Hembrough ('the Judge') who dismissed  his  appeal  against  a
    decision of the respondent to  refuse  him  leave  to  remain  in  this
    country on human rights grounds and  to  deport  him  to  South  Africa
    having concluded that he is a persistent  offender.  The  decision  was
    sent to the parties on 10 March 2020.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge  Lindsley  granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal by a decision dated 21 September 2020.

Anonymity

 3. The First-tier Tribunal did not issue an anonymity  order  and  neither
    party sought one before me.

 4. I note the recent observation of Elisabeth Laing  LJ  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v. Starkey [2021] EWCA Civ 421, at  [97]-
    [98], made in the context of deportation proceedings,  that  defendants
    in criminal proceedings are usually not anonymised. Both the First-tier
    Tribunal and this Tribunal are  to  be  mindful  of  such  fact.  I  am
    satisfied that the appellant in this matter has already been subject to
    the open justice principle in  respect  of  his  criminal  convictions,
    which are a matter of public record and so considered to  be  known  by
    both the local community and the wider public.

 5. I find that the common law right permitting the public  to  know  about
    Tribunal proceedings, a right further protected  by  article  10  ECHR,
    outweighs the appellant's rights under article 8 ECHR: Cokaj (anonymity
    orders, jurisdiction and ambit) [2021] UKUT 202, at [17]-[28].

 6. I do not make an anonymity order in this matter.

 7. The appellant has been convicted of a serious  sexual  offence.  Whilst
    there is no requirement for the victim to be named in  my  decision,  I
    take the opportunity to observe that consequent to  section  1  of  the
    Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act  1992  ('the  1992  Act')  there  is  a
    prohibition upon the reporting of any matter  which  may  lead  to  the
    identification of a complainant in respect of certain sexual  offences,
    including exposure contrary to section 66 of the  Sexual  Offences  Act
    2003: section 2(da) of the 1992 Act. Such anonymity is for life.

Background

 8. The appellant is a national of South Africa and is presently  aged  28.
    He was granted entry clearance on 14 November 2003 as  a  dependant  of
    his father, who enjoyed leave to enter as a  work  permit  holder.  The
    appellant entered this country when  aged  11.  The  appellant  enjoyed
    lawful leave until securing indefinite leave  to  remain  on  24  March
    2006.

Criminal convictions

 9. The appellant was convicted of two counts of exposure at South Somerset
    and Mendip Magistrates Court on 8 June 2012.  He  was  sentenced  to  a
    community order, a supervision requirement, an unpaid work  requirement
    and was made the subject of a sex offenders' notice for five years.

10. By means of his witness statement dated 18 February 2020 the  appellant
    stated that he was high on drugs at the time of these offences and only
    possesses a faint recollection of being around a care home and exposing
    himself.

11. At Taunton Crown Court on 4 January 2013, the appellant  was  convicted
    of exposure  and  sentenced  to  a  community  order,  an  unpaid  work
    requirement of 150  hours,  a  programme  requirement  of  60  days,  a
    supervision requirement for three years and made the subject of  a  sex
    offenders' notice for 5 years. The community  order  imposed  by  South
    Somerset and Mendip Magistrates' Court was revoked.

12. The appellant details in his witness statement  that  he  was  high  on
    drugs in the middle of the night, naked in  his  room  whilst  watching
    pornography and was observed as he had failed to draw his curtains.

13. On 21 September  2015,  at  Bristol  Crown  Court,  the  appellant  was
    convicted of a failure to comply with the requirements of  a  community
    order and sentenced to  the  order  being  varied  with  the  programme
    requirement being revoked and a �200 fine was imposed. He  was  ordered
    to pay costs in the sum of �85.

14. At Bristol Crown Court on 6 January 2016, the appellant  was  convicted
    of failure to comply with the requirements of a  community  order.  The
    order of Taunton Crown Court was varied to  a  community  order  and  a
    curfew requirement for four weeks with electronic tagging.

15. On 12 April 2017, the appellant was  convicted  at  Avon  and  Somerset
    Magistrates'  Court  on  three  counts  of  failing  to   comply   with
    notification requirements and was sentenced to a  community  order,  an
    unpaid work requirement, �85 costs and �85 victim surcharge.

Index offence

16. As recorded in the OASys from information obtained  from  relevant  CPS
    documents, at 08.10 on 9 August 2018  the  female  victim  was  walking
    through a park in Bristol and approaching a 'zig-zag' path when she saw
    the appellant run down a hill and cut across her  path,  continuing  in
    the direction of the exit from the park which leads into a neighbouring
    road. As  the  victim  approached  the  same  exit,  she  observed  the
    appellant standing in an alcove by garages, making a fast and  rhythmic
    movement. She noticed that he had both hands down by  his  groin,  that
    his penis was exposed, and he was very clearly masturbating. The victim
    informed the police that the appellant made no  attempt  to  hide  from
    her, and that he was looking at her straight in the eye  while  he  was
    performing the act. Her opinion was that the appellant  wanted  her  to
    see what he was doing, and this added to her alarm and distress.

17. During his police interview, the appellant denied events.  He  asserted
    that he had been out for a run and his penis was exposed because he was
    urinating. He repeats this version  of  events  in  his  February  2020
    witness statement, further detailing:

         'I denied that I had exposed myself this time and  after  the  duty
         lawyer came to me and advised that there was no case against me,  I
         was relieved. I did not  get  a  representative  nor  did  I  plead
         guilty. But the  victim  then  changed  her  statement  and  I  was
         sentenced to just over 6 months in prison.'

18. On 29 October 2018,  at  Avon  and  Somerset  Magistrates'  Court,  the
    appellant  was  convicted  of  exposure  and  sentenced  to  26  weeks'
    imprisonment, placed on the sex offenders' register  for  7  years  and
    required to pay a �115 victim surcharge.

Deportation proceedings

19. On 22 March 2019 a deportation order  was  signed  in  respect  of  the
    appellant. It was served on 25 March 2019. Following receipt  of  human
    rights representations, the respondent refused to grant  the  appellant
    leave to remain on human rights grounds by means of a decision dated 24
    September 2019.

Hearing before the FtT

20. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Hatton Cross on 18 February
    2020. The appellant attended with his parents. Unusually in respect  of
    deportation proceedings, the Home Office Presenting Officer declined to
    cross-examine the appellant. A decision was also taken  not  to  cross-
    examine the appellant's parents. The Judge recorded the observations of
    the representatives that 'there  was  nothing  controversial  in  their
    evidence as set out  in  their  respective  witness  statements.'  This
    observation was made as to the evidence of the appellant as well as his
    parents.

Grounds of Appeal

21. The grounds of appeal in this matter are addressed  in  two  documents:
    the grounds seeking permission to appeal from the  First-tier  Tribunal
    to this Tribunal, dated  23  March  2020,  and  the  addendum  document
    renewing the application to this Tribunal, dated 21 August  2020.  Both
    were carefully drafted by Mr. Haywood,  Counsel,  who  represented  the
    appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

22. Five grounds of complaint  are  advanced,  though  the  representatives
    before me agreed that I should initially consider ground 1 because if a
    material error of law were established, it would  be  determinative  in
    respect of the appeal.

23. Ground 1 is identified in the original document as:

         '10. The Judge erred in his analysis when concluding that A  was  a
             'persistent offender'. The Judge so found on the basis  that  A
             had, over a protracted period, continued to commit exactly  the
             same type of offence  despite  the  penalties  imposed  on  him
             [determination at �28].

         11.  In so finding, it is submitted that the  Judge's  analysis  is
             inadequate  and  fails  to  take  account  of  the   range   of
             considerations that were relevant: see Chege ('is a  persistent
             offender') [2016] UKUT 00187: Inter alia:

             a) The question is whether the person is a persistent offender
                [Chege at �36]: Iie. looking at A's current position. It is
                not  clear  that  that  is  the  question  the  judge   has
                addressed.

             b) The analysis must take account of the overall  picture  and
                pattern of offending (the judge refers only to the repeated
                commission of offences over a period of time: it is a range
                of  facts,  including  in  relation  to  the   nature   and
                circumstances of offending that are relevant);

             c) Reasons underlying the behaviour, such as  drug  dependency
                or other considerations leading  to  particular  behaviour,
                are relevant [Chege at �57]. A's clear  evidence  was  that
                his circumstances were now very different,  given  that  he
                was no longer using drugs and was in  stable  accommodation
                and supported by his family.

             d) A pattern of rehabilitation may lead to a  conclusion  that
                the person is no longer a persistent  offender  [Chege,  at
                �60].

24. The respondent  filed  and  served  a  detailed  and  helpful  skeleton
    argument, authored by Mr. Clarke, dated 22 October 2020.

Decision on Error of Law

25. At the outset of the hearing Mr. Clarke accepted that in respect of the
    challenge advanced by ground 1 the Judge had erred in law. However,  he
    submitted that it was open to the Tribunal to consider the  materiality
    of such error and on the facts arising in this appeal it could  not  be
    said that they were material because the appellant could  not  possibly
    succeed in respect of his underlying appeal.

26. Mr. Clarke's submissions were thoughtful and well-constructed. However,
    as I explained at the hearing, the facts arising in this case could not
    be said to be such that a reasonable judge could only make  an  adverse
    decision in respect of the appellant's underlying appeal.

27. Further, Mr. Clarke sought to rely upon a  number  of  factual  matters
    such as whether or not the appellant was accurate as to  the  level  of
    support he currently receives  from  his  family,  his  rehabilitation,
    whether his lack of recent offending was  consequent  to  these  appeal
    proceedings hanging over his head,  his  ability  to  secure  and  hold
    employment, his continued high levels of recklessness  and  risk-taking
    behaviour, his lack  of  insight,  his  lack  of  understanding  as  to
    personal boundaries, and his denial of the offence which took place  in
    2018. However, as observed above, unusually the respondent decided  not
    to cross examine either the appellant or his witnesses before the First-
    tier Tribunal. It would not  be  appropriate  for  this  Tribunal  when
    considering materiality to consider issues upon which the appellant was
    not given a fair opportunity to comment  on  matters  now  said  to  be
    wholly adverse to him.

28. In the circumstances, for the reasons detailed in ground 1  above,  the
    decision of the Judge is adversely impacted by material  error  of  law
    and is properly to be set aside.

29. Mr. Clarke informed me that it is likely that the respondent would wish
    to cross-examine the appellant and his parents at the resumed  hearing.
    Mr Walsh acknowledged that the appellant was  now  on  notice  of  such
    intention.

30. I make the following observation with respect to the  decision  of  the
    respondent not to cross examine the  witnesses  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, a decision said to have been made on the purported basis that
    there was nothing controversial in their evidence. It is striking  that
    the appellant provides very little detail as to his conviction in  2018
    beyond asserting that he pleaded not guilty.  Whilst  complaining  that
    the victim changed her witness statement, there is no  confirmation  in
    the appellant's witness statement as to his attending a trial and being
    found guilty. I am surprised that the appellant was not  cross-examined
    on his continued denial of the offence. Nor was  there  any  engagement
    with the appellant as to how such denial impacts upon  his  ability  to
    address sexual preoccupation and deviant fantasies linked to voyeurism.

31. I further observe the appellant's evidence as to the  circumstances  of
    his previous offences, but at first blush they appear to  minimise  his
    offending behaviour when read alongside section R6.2 of OASys  [pg  C38
    of  the  appellant's  bundle].  It   is   surprising   that   potential
    inconsistency was not fairly put to the appellant.

32. I make two  further  observations  about  the  appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal. Reliance is placed upon the  appellant's  use  of  drugs  being
    associated with his offending. This in turn relies upon ��14-17 of  the
    appellant's witness statement  dated  18  February  2020.  However,  as
    confirmed by these paragraphs the use of drugs may be relevant  to  the
    first two convictions alone. There is no reference to the use of  drugs
    having played a part in the 2018 offence.

33. Secondly the addendum grounds of appeal  identify  at  �7(d)  that  the
    appellant's risk of offending is assessed as being low  with  reference
    to section R4.4 of OASys [pg C35 of the appellant's bundle]. I  observe
    that this particular assessment relates  to  the  statistical  risk  of
    offending identified by the OVP, or  OASys  Violence  Predictor,  which
    estimates  the  likelihood  of  nonsexual  violent  offending.  In  the
    circumstances, it is not appropriate to advance  a  general  submission
    that the appellant is 'low risk' of offending when his risk relates  to
    sexual and not nonsexual offending.  The  appellant  is  identified  by
    OASys as being of medium risk of proven non-violent offending:  section
    R11.12 of OASys [pg C43 of the appellant's  bundle],  repeated  in  the
    OASys summary [pg C45 of the appellant's bundle].

Resumed hearing

34. I confirmed to the representatives at the hearing that  I  would  allow
    the appellants' appeal to the extent that the decision  be  set  aside.
    The representatives confirmed that this matter could properly be remade
    by the First-tier Tribunal.

35. I have given careful consideration to the Joint Practice  Statement  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal concerning the  disposal  of
    appeals in this Tribunal.  That reads as follows at 7.2:

         'The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to  proceed  to
         re-make the decision, instead of remitting the case to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

             (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
                the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or   other
                opportunity  for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

             (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
                necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
                made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the   overriding
                objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to
                the First-tier Tribunal.'

36. I have reached the conclusion that it  is  appropriate  to  remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all  matters.
    The appellant has enjoyed no adequate consideration of  his  appeal  to
    date and as he has not previously given oral evidence there  is  likely
    to be extensive judicial fact-finding to be undertaken.

37. I consider this matter is suitable for a face-to-face  hearing,  though
    ultimately this is a matter for the First-tier Tribunal.



Notice of decision

38. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision  promulgated  on
    10 March 2020 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

39. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross  for
    a fresh hearing before any judge other than  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Hembrough.

40. No findings of fact are preserved.
