For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth  1  January  1987,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated  20  March  2018,  to
    refuse application for leave to remain based on  him  being  a  spouse.
    His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles  whose  decision
    [D], on 15 October 2018, dismissed the appeal on human rights  grounds.



2.    The  Appellant's  application  under  the   Immigration   Rules,   and
    particularly Appendix FM, had failed, so the judge found,  because  the
    Appellant had failed to provide the necessary evidence that he met  the
    financial requirements.  Those requirements under the Rules fell to  be
    considered in the usual way at the date submitted with the application,
    but in this case because this matter had been through  the  process  of
    judicial review, the matter was remade and effectively the Secretary of
    State remade the decision as of March 2018.

3.   The issue before this Tribunal turned to a great  extent  upon  whether
    or not, at the time the matter was looked at by the Secretary of State,
    the Secretary of State had been presented with evidence from the Meezan
    Bank and from UBL, which set out the  financial  circumstances  of  the
    Appellant.  Mr Bramble correctly accepts that if that  information  was
    before the Secretary of State, then the Appellant would  have  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and the application would,  on  a
    remaking, have succeeded.

4.   Mr Bramble made the point that the Judge in dealing  with  this  matter
    seemed, without saying so, but by implications, to have taken the  view
    that the UBL certificate and information was not before  the  Secretary
    of State and had only been produced as  at  the  hearing.  Accordingly,
    whilst it  was  not  excluded  per  se,  nevertheless,  the  Presenting
    Officer's argument had been that little weight should  be  attached  to
    the documentation  because  it  was  produced  after  the  Respondent's
    decision and was never before the Respondent.

5.   The Judge was to some extent,  and  this  was  not  to  be  seen  as  a
    criticism, somewhat uncertain about the  ultimate  position,  vis-�-vis
    the documents, i.e. whether they had been  presented.  The  Appellant's
    case was that it had been provided,  accompanying  a  letter  from  his
    solicitors, SZ Solicitors, which had been sent on 1 February 2018.  The
    actual difficulty for the Judge  arose  because  the  letter  does  not
    particularise the bank documents being provided but identify a document
    which is called a 'bank reconciliation document'. The documents  within
    the Appellant's bundle, before the Judge, simply seemed  to  relate  to
    the Meezan Bank and not the UBL account (see Appellant's bundle,  pages
    108 to 111).  The covering letter from SZ Solicitors  did  not  specify
    what bank statements were being sent, from which  bank,  if  any  other
    than the Meezan Bank. Nor  was  there  copied  within  the  Appellant's
    bundle, the  'bank reconciliation statement'.  The Meezan  Bank  letter
    (AB111) was simply relating to two accounts held by  the  Appellant  at
    the Meezan Bank and  were  not  referencing  or  relevant  to  the  UBL
    account.

6.   The Judge did not actually address the Appellant's evidence about  this
    matter as recited through the decision letter, for the Judge [D35]  was
    less than clear  whether  or  not  he  was  recording  the  Appellant's
    evidence as being that the Appellant had provided the UBL  letter.  The
    Judge said:-

         "35. ... At the hearing itself  appellant  (sic)  also  produced  a
             balance confirmation certificate issued  by  the  United  bank
             (sic) Ltd of Karachi dated 29 January 2018 certifying that the
             appellant was maintaining Rs.6,700,000 with the bank  since  1
             January 2015, which is the equivocal of �43,872."

7.   The Judge continued D36:-

         "36. As I have  noted  above  the  appeal  bundle  itself  was  not
             received by the tribunal or the respondent until 24  September
             2018 which was the day before  the  appeal  hearing,  and  the
             additional financial documents were submitted in  copy  rather
             than original form, when  it  must  be  the  case  that  those
             originals could have been  provided  and  they  would  clearly
             constitute the best evidence of these claimed savings.  As  it
             is, these documents were produced, effectively without notice,
             when their importance is such that there is no reason why they
             should not have been produced at early (sic) stage so that any
             pending enquiries could have  been  undertaken  prior  to  the
             appeal hearing.  The evidential requirements of appendix FM-SE
             required the requisite financial information for  a  six-month
             period to be provided with the application  which  is  clearly
             not the case on the appellant's own evidence.   Even  allowing
             for those documents to have been provided  subsequently  given
             the success of his judicial review application of the original
             refusal  decision,  then  the  consent  order  was  clear   in
             identifying a three-month period from the date of  that  order
             which was on 10 January 2018.  In my judgement the Meezan Bank
             letter was not produced within that period given the date that
             it bears, when there was no reason why it could not have  been
             provided.  The UBL certificate,  although  dated  within  that
             period was only produced on the morning of the appeal  hearing
             and in copy form.  Given the lateness of  its  production  the
             original should have been submitted.  In those circumstances I
             give no weight to this additional evidence; therefore I am not
             satisfied that this application  does  satisfy  the  financial
             requirement under appendix FM of the immigration rules on  the
             balance of probabilities standard."

8.   I find [D36] slightly unclear because it was difficult to  see  why  no
    weight could be given to a document absent  of  some  good  reason,  as
    opposed to some weight , but the matter addressed by way of a  judgment
    and balance of the considerations. (my emphasis).   To  that  extent  I
    disagree with the way the Judge has expressed it, but I am still seized
    of the point that the Judge's remarks are equivocal as  to  whether  or
    not the UBL letter was sent,  in  January  2018,  and  was  before  the
    Secretary of State.  The Appellant's balance in the UBL account, on the
    face of the evidence, before the Judge had been in the  account  for  a
    significant period of time, there  was  no  obvious  reason,  short  of
    error, why the certificate from UBL would not have been put forward  in
    order to substantiate the financial requirements under the Rules.
9.       I look at this on the basis of  the  balance  of  probabilities.  I
    conclude that it was reasonably likely that the UBL letter was sent  to
    the Secretary of State in January 2018.    The  difficulties  that  the
    Secretary of State faced  time  and  time  again,  was  the  weight  of
    documentation that  comes  into  the  Home  Office,  which  must  be  a
    practical administrative nightmare.  I  concluded  that  there  was  no
    obvious reason why the UBL letter would not have been submitted, it may
    well have been overlooked by the Respondent  or  its  significance  not
    appreciated which is understandable. It may not have  been  appreciated
    that it represented a different account from the Meezan Bank  material.
    I do not know and I do not speculate, but I conclude that on a  balance
    of probabilities the evidence which showed that at the date  the  Judge
    was  looking  at  this  matter  weight  should  be  given  to  the  UBL
    certificate. Absent of the Judge finding that the  document  had  never
    been provided to  the  Secretary  of  State,  which  at  least  on  one
    construction may be what the Judge intended  to  say,  the  absence  of
    clarity showed that there is an absence of sufficient, adequate reasons
    which amounts to a material error of law.

10.  In those circumstances I find that  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision
    should not stand. It should be remade on the basis, as I see  it,  that
    the UBL material was provided and it showed the right level of required
    finances. The judge's finding the Appellant he did not comply with  the
    Rules it would not  be  proportionate  to  hold  that  against  him  in
    considering the Article 8 claim. I was invited  to  remake  the  appeal
    decision.

11.  In terms of the decision I find that as a fact the information  of  the
    UBL certificate and the relevant material  from  the  Meezan  Bank  was
    before the Judge. Had it been considered by the Secretary of State  the
    appeal would have succeeded under the Rules. There was no  other  basis
    for refusal.  However, this was an Article 8 ECHR based claim on  human
    rights grounds The issue was whether or not the  Respondent's  decision
    was proportionate.  In reaching a view on that I find that the basis of
    the application was to maintain private and family life within  the  UK
    and that the Respondent's decision was necessarily an  interference  in
    Article 8(1) ECHR rights.  I find, the Respondent's decision was lawful
    and properly served the  maintenance  of  immigration  controls  within
    Article 8(2) ECHR.

12.  I therefore, in considering the Article 8 claim, pay particular  regard
    to Sections 117A and 117B (1)-(5) of  the  NIAA  2002  and  the  public
    interest question.  The extent of its importance was, to a  degree,  as
    acknowledged in the case of Mostafa  (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)
    [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) It   was material to the weight to be given  to
    the public interest, particularly when someone had met the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.   I am not dealing with an appeal  under  the
    Rules, but the extent of compliance will weigh on the  outcome  of  the
    proportionality issue.

13.  I also take into account that the evidence showed  that  the  Appellant
    has no English language problems, given the findings made by the  Judge
    about the TOEIC test. There was nothing to suggest he could not be  and
    would not be a productive member of  and  integrate  into  UK  society,
    which may have occurred already.   I  therefore  find  that  whilst  of
    course his immigration history did not stand against  him,  he  has  no
    history of criminality or conduct  which  might  militate  against  his
    suitability. The only matter was the issue of  the  proxy  test  taking
    allegation. The Judge accepted the Appellant had  given  an  "innocent"
    explanation of the involvement  in  the  testing.  I  express  no  view
    whatsoever about the findings.  The findings made by the Judge stand in
    this respect and were not challenged by the Respondent.

14.  In those circumstances, looking at this matter in  the  round,  I  find
    Article 8(1) ECHR family life rights  were  engaged.  The  Respondent's
    decision was a  significant  interference  in  the  exercise  of  those
    rights. I find the decision of the Respondent  was  lawful  and  served
    Article 8(2)  ECHR  purposes.  However,  in  my  judgment  I  find  the
    Respondent's decision was disproportionate: The public interest, in the
    circumstances of this appeal did not, as they would otherwise  normally
    do, justify the adverse decision.  For those reasons I  substitute  the
    following decision.

NOTICE OF DECISION

15.  The appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

ANONYMITY

16.  No anonymity direction is made.



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal I have  considered  making  a  fee  award  This
appeal has succeeded with the clarification of  the  evidential  issues.  In
the circumstances I do not find a fee award is appropriate.
