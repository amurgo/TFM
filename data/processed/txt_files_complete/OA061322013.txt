                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appeal comes before the  Upper  Tribunal  following  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal to the Entry Clearance Officer by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge De Haney) on 21st  February  2014.   For  the  ease  of
    reference, I shall continue to refer to the Entry Clearance Officer  as
    the Respondent and to Ms Hossany as the Appellant.  No anonymity  order
    was made by the First-tier Tribunal and no request has been made of the
    Upper Tribunal either at the hearing that took place on 30th April 2014
    or that of the present appeal on 21st July 2014.

 2. In a determination promulgated on 2nd May 2014 following a  hearing  on
    30th April, I reached the conclusion after considering the evidence  in
    the  appeal  and  in  the  light  of  the  submissions  made  by   both
    representatives that the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Telford)  who  had
    allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  had  erred  in  law  in
    reaching that decision.  There is annexed to this determination a  copy
    of that decision which sets out the reasons  given  for  reaching  that
    conclusion.  In summary form, it had not  been  demonstrated  that  the
    Appellant could meet the Immigration Rules as a result of  her  failure
    to meet the  financial  requirements  that  were  plainly  set  out  in
    Appendix FM-SE.  The reasons are set out at  paragraphs  15-25  of  the
    determination of the Upper Tribunal.  As set out there, the  judge  was
    required to set out the relevant paragraphs of Appendix FM-SE  relating
    to family members and specified evidence  and  in  particular  that  of
    paragraph 7 which related to self-employment at (a)-(h)  and  to  cross
    reference the  evidence  provided,  including  that  given  orally,  to
    establish whether in fact the  correct  specified  documents  had  been
    provided.  However, the judge erred in law  by  not  considering  those
    issues in the light of the specified documents which were  required  to
    be produced to demonstrate that the financial  requirements  were  met.
    As stated at [18] had the judge set out the requirements, it would have
    been plain that the Appellant could not meet the Rules on the documents
    that had been presented; they are mandatory documents that are required
    to be produced and there is no discretion to reach  the  decision  that
    they are not applicable.  Thus  the  Appellant  had  not  provided  the
    specified documents showing the Sponsor's  income  as  a  self-employed
    person as required by paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE.  At paragraphs  19
    to 25, the missing documentation that had not been produced was set out
    in some particularity by the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Thus in those circumstances, I found that the judge had  erred  in  law
    and that the decision could not stand.  In the light of those  matters,
    the decision was remade by dismissing the appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The judge, having found that the Appellant could meet  the  Immigration
    Rules did not go on to consider Article 8.  In those  circumstances  Mr
    Kannangara had invited the court to consider Article 8 in the light  of
    the oral evidence of the Sponsor and any further documentation he would
    wish to provide.  In those circumstances, the  case  was  listed  as  a
    resumed hearing before me.

 5. The case resumed on 21st July 2014.   At  that  hearing  Mr  Kannangara
    appeared on behalf of the Appellant and Mr  Walker,  Senior  Presenting
    Officer, appeared on behalf of the Respondent.  For the purposes of the
    hearing a short bundle had been provided under cover of a letter  dated
    14th July 2014 consisting of a witness statement from  the  Sponsor  Mr
    Mohammad Norani Edoo, a letter from his daughter Farheen Edoo, a letter
    from her school confirming that she  was  a  full-time  student  and  a
    handwritten letter dated 4th June 2014 from the ex-wife of the Sponsor.
     No further  documentation  was  provided  but  the  Tribunal  had  the
    previous bundle that had been placed  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under cover of the letter of 16th December 2013 which contained in it a
    witness statement from the Sponsor.

 6. The Tribunal also heard oral evidence from the  Sponsor  Mr  Edoo.   He
    adopted those two witness  statements  as  his  evidence-in-chief.   No
    further questions were asked of him.  In cross-examination he was asked
    about the reference in his witness statement to having seen his wife in
    Mauritius.  He confirmed that the last time he went was in May 2013 and
    that he had not been since because it was too expensive  and  cost  him
    too much money.  He confirmed that they communicated over the phone and
    had done so even this morning.  As to the children, he  confirmed  that
    they also communicated with his wife approximately once a week or  once
    every fifteen days but not every day.  He confirmed  that  his  ex-wife
    had sent a letter (exhibited in a bundle).  In answer to a question  as
    to who his wife was living with in Mauritius, he confirmed that she was
    living with his mother, her own sister and also her mother.  He  stated
    that she did not live with them all together as one household  but  had
    stayed for a week with his mum then rotates with a week with her sister
    and then also her own mother.  In answer to questions relating  to  his
    visit to Mauritius in 2013 he  confirmed  that  in  that  year  he  had
    visited for a period of seventeen days; as he  was  self-employed  that
    was the period that he could take.  Previously he said that he had been
    in 2012 when the application was submitted when he  had  stayed  for  a
    longer period to await the outcome  which  did  not  take  place  until
    February 2013.  That  was  a  longer  period  but  that  could  not  be
    replicated now as he would not have sufficient funds.

 7. No further questions were asked of the Sponsor.

 8. I therefore heard submissions from each  of  the  parties.   Mr  Walker
    fairly conceded that it was to the Appellant's credit that she returned
    to Mauritius for entry clearance and that given  the  circumstances  of
    the Sponsor as a self-employed gas  engineer  it  was  plain  that  any
    visits would have to be for a short period and that he had  been  on  a
    visit last year but has not been able to go again due to the expense of
    it.   He  acknowledged  that  there  was  a  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and the children from the Sponsor's first marriage  and  also
    that he was in contact with his wife every day and that she was  living
    with family members, including her mother and sister and the  Sponsor's
    mother.  He further submitted it was clear that she could  not  satisfy
    the Immigration Rules at the date of decision but had a  strong  family
    life with her husband and the children.  He  submitted  that  when  the
    decision was made by the Entry Clearance Officer applying the  relevant
    law, there must be exceptionally strong  circumstances  as  to  why  it
    should be allowed outside of the Immigration  Rules  under  Article  8.
    Whilst the facts were moving they were not  compelling  to  the  extent
    they did not outweigh the decision of the Secretary of  State  via  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse entry clearance.  The Appellant could
    continue life as before since she had returned to Mauritius and that it
    would  be  open  for  her  to  make  a  fresh  application  given   the
    circumstances of the Sponsor that would on the evidence be successful.

 9. Mr Kannangara  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  under  the
    Immigration Rules having failed  to  provide  the  specified  documents
    under Appendix FM-SE, however, the documents when seen as a  whole  did
    show that the Sponsor  had  earned  the  minimum  level  of  income  of
    ï¿½18,600.  As to Article 8 outside of the Rules, the  evidence  relating
    to family life with his wife is set out in  the  papers.   There  is  a
    history, namely that she was approximately six years in  the  UK.   She
    then went to Mauritius in October 2012 to make an  application  to  re-
    enter as the spouse of the Sponsor.  He submitted that whilst there was
    a delay in submitting the appeal, no point had been taken either before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  the  Upper   Tribunal   and   in   those
    circumstances the evidence was accepted as to  why  there  had  been  a
    delay.  He submitted  that  the  Appellant  could  satisfy  EX.1(b)  of
    insurmountable obstacles as the Sponsor could not return to  Mauritius.
    The reasons given is that he has two children for which he has a strong
    bond and at the time of decision the eldest child was 17ï¿½ (now 19)  and
    the other  child  a  minor.   There  was  a  letter  from  his  ex-wife
    confirming their  relationship.   If  the  Sponsor  was  to  return  to
    Mauritius having been a British citizen of twenty  years  standing  and
    with  both   children   having   been   born   here   that   would   be
    disproportionate.

10. In  consideration  of  the  case  of  Gulshan,  there  is  no  test  of
    exceptional circumstances and no criminal element alleged in this case.
     It is also not the case of a precarious family life as he met his wife
    in legitimate circumstances.  Thus for those reasons, the children have
    a strong bond with their father and therefore  he  could  not  live  in
    Mauritius; that would be disproportionate.

11. When asked to deal with the second submission made by Mr  Walker  which
    was that it would be open to the Appellant to  apply  again  for  entry
    clearance, Mr Kannangara submitted that it would be difficult  for  her
    to do so and that there had already been disruption of family life  and
    that the Sponsor continued to be employed and maintain his income.  The
    amount of money it would involve and it would  be  time  consuming  and
    thus he invited the court to disregard that as  a  future  possibility.
    He also submitted that whilst there  may  be  an  option  for  a  fresh
    application the Entry Clearance Officer  would  look  at  the  previous
    refusal.

12. At the end of the proceedings I reserved my determination which  I  now
    give.

13. Having found that the Appellant could not meet the  Immigration  Rules,
    the correct legal test that I must apply is that of Gulshan (Article  8
    - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00064 (IAC) and R (Nagre) v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and the approach  endorsed  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision in Shahzad [2014] UKUT  85  at  paragraph  31  that
    where an area of the Rules does not have such an express mechanism, the
    approach in R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin)  at  [29-31]  and
    Gulshan (as cited) should be followed,  that  is,  after  applying  the
    requirements of the Rules, only if there may be arguably  good  grounds
    for granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider   whether   there   are   compelling
    circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  them.   Thus   the
    relevant jurisprudence makes it clear that the Immigration Rules should
    certainly be the starting point in any consideration of  the  issue  of
    the rights of the Appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR.

14. I make the following findings from the evidence.  There is  no  dispute
    that the parties are in a genuine relationship and  are  married.   The
    evidence demonstrates that in October 2011 the parties  met  in  London
    and lived together following the nikah in November 2011 until she  left
    for Mauritius to apply for entry clearance in or about September  2012.
    The application was made on 29th October 2012.   The  Sponsor  Mr Edoo
    accompanied the Appellant when she left for Mauritius and they remained
    together  until  the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    received.  Whilst the decision appears to be dated 5th  December  2012,
    from the evidence of Mr Edoo, it appears that it was not  served  until
    sometime later in February.  Following the service of the  decision  he
    returned to the United Kingdom.

15. Since the parties  have  not  lived  together,  Mr  Edoo  has  been  to
    Mauritius  on  three  occasions  (see  paragraph  12  of  the   witness
    statement); the most recent visit was in  May  2013  for  a  period  of
    seventeen days.  Mr Edoo  is  originally  from  Mauritius.   They  have
    maintained contact with each other by frequent telephone contact.

16. Mr Edoo was previously married and it is plain from the letter  written
    by his ex-wife that notwithstanding their divorce and  separation  they
    remain on good terms and indeed the two children  of  the  relationship
    aged 19 and 18 now (but 17ï¿½ and 16 at the date of decision) who  reside
    with his ex-wife also have continued to  enjoy  a  strong  relationship
    with their father, the Sponsor.  I am satisfied that he has  maintained
    a good relationship with both of those children  and  set  out  in  the
    letter of his ex-wife exhibited in the bundle  (see  letter  dated  4th
    June 2014).  The letter also makes plain that  he  helps  the  children
    with their studies and also the letter from Farheen, who at the date of
    decision was in full-time education, makes reference  to  the  type  of
    support that he provided to her and her sibling which included  regular
    weekend contact.

17. The Sponsor is  a  British  citizen  although  he  is  originally  from
    Mauritius.  Whilst Mr Kannangara made submissions that EX.1(b)  should
    be applied this is an out of country entry clearance case to which EX.1
    has no application.  However, whilst the submissions made relate to the
    unreasonableness of expecting the Sponsor to leave the  United  Kingdom
    and live with his wife in Mauritius, that was not an argument  properly
    advanced by Mr Walker on behalf of the Secretary of State.   Indeed  if
    it were I would not have found that it could have succeeded.   Such  an
    argument would fail to take into account the effect of  disrupting  the
    relationship that the Sponsor has maintained  with  his  two  children,
    both minors at the date of decision, and it would not be,  I  find,  in
    their best interests for that to occur given the type  of  relationship
    that they have with their father; it being one that could not  properly
    be replicated or continued by the modern methods of communication.

18. As set out earlier, the Appellant cannot meet the Immigration Rules and
    therefore  whilst  they  are  the  starting  point  for  an  Article  8
    application to succeed there must be a compelling  reason  which  would
    mean that the Appellant could succeed outside the Rules  on  Article  8
    grounds.  I remind myself  there  is  no  need  for  exceptionality  as
    Mr Kannangara quite correctly submitted.  However, I do not find  that
    it has been demonstrated that there are any compelling circumstances or
    in the alternative, that the decision to  refuse  entry  clearance  was
    disproportionate.  The failure to meet the Immigration Rules because of
    the stringency of the documents required for those Immigration Rules is
    not a factor to  amount  to  "compelling  circumstances",  nor  is  the
    submission made by Mr Kannangara that the Sponsor has, in effect,  been
    able to meet the minimum level of income necessary by provision of  the
    documentation when viewed as a whole.  Firstly,  this  is  an  argument
    based on the basis of a "near miss" and contrary  to  the  decision  in
    Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261 where at [26] it was said "there is  no  Near-
    Miss principle applicable to the Immigration Rules".  Secondly, such an
    argument fails to have regard to the requirement of predictability  and
    certainty in the application of the Rules.  In considering the issue of
    proportionality the decision of Huang [2007] UKHL 11, referred  to  the
    general administrative desirability of applying known Rules if a system
    of immigration control is to be workable, predictable,  consistent  and
    fair as between one applicant and another and that "the damage to  good
    administration and effective  control  if  a  system  is  perceived  by
    applicants  internationally  to  be  unduly  porous,  unpredictable  or
    perfunctory".  The legitimate aim under Article 8 in this case  is  the
    economic wellbeing of the  country  expressed  as  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control bearing in mind the principle of applying
    a predictable and consistent application of the Immigration Rules.   As
    identified in the decision of Shahzad [2014] UKUT 85, it  is  necessary
    to consider not only an assessment at the individual "micro" level  but
    also the "macro  level"  and  that  the  general  aspects  of  economic
    wellbeing include the need to limit numbers who have access  to  public
    services and the benefits of the NHS and who are able  to  compete  for
    housing and for employment with those already in the UK (see FK and  OK
    (Botswana) [2013] EWCA Civ 238).

19. I have had to consider  whether  under  "compelling  circumstances"  or
    under a proportionality assessment it would be open to the Appellant to
    make a fresh  application  for  entry  clearance  again.   The  present
    circumstances of the Appellant are that she lives with  family  members
    including her sister and mother and also  the  Sponsor's  mother.   The
    evidence before me from the Sponsor, which I accept,  is  that  she  is
    alternating between those households.  She  returned  to  Mauritius  in
    2012 to make this application and it is entirely to her credit that she
    did so to make such an application.  However, that does not  mean  that
    she  should  not  make  an  application  that  complies  with  the   UK
    Immigration Rules and law.  She would be able to  continue  her  family
    life with the Sponsor as she has done to date by being able to maintain
    the telephone contact which I am satisfied takes place  frequently  and
    also by the medium of visits.  I wholly accept that time and money  are
    both limited for the Sponsor, who I believe to be  a  hardworking  man.
    Indeed I found him a credible witness as indeed the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge did, but it is the case that since she returned to  Mauritius  he
    has been able to visit on three  occasions  and  at  the  date  of  the
    application stayed there for a prolonged  period  from  December  until
    February 2013 and therefore it is open to him to continue  family  life
    with his wife in that  way  and  during  the  period  where  the  entry
    clearance application is being made.

20. Whilst there would be some delay, the evidence demonstrates  that  when
    the application was made on 29th  October,  the  decision  came  a  few
    months later and therefore any delay would not be for  an  overly  long
    period and the relationship can be maintained as it is presently.

21. Whilst I also accept that she has a relationship with the  children  in
    the UK, it is a relationship that is a limited one and it is  not  said
    that they have visited her in Mauritius, however, they have  maintained
    contact by telephone calls which  according  to  the  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor take place approximately once a week or every fifteen days  and
    there is no reason why that could not continue in any period  when  the
    entry  clearance  application  is  being  made  and   considered.    Mr
    Kannangara submitted that the Entry Clearance Officer would look at the
    old refusal, however, I do not think that that is the case.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer will have this determination and that of the previous
    judge as well as the findings made concerning the  genuineness  of  the
    relationship, the strength of the  family  life,  the  Sponsor's  self-
    employment record and earlier documentation  and  no  doubt  will  give
    proper consideration to the application being  made.   It  is  for  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor to ensure that they provide all the documents
    that are necessary and ones  that  are  specified  documents  with  the
    application. If necessary to obtain advice at the time the  application
    is to be made.  If this is done, there is no reason why the application
    should not be successful.   However,  that  by  itself  is  not  in  my
    judgment sufficient to allow the appeal on Article  8  grounds  outside
    the Rules.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The  decision  is
remade as follows.  The appeal is dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
The appeal is dismissed on Article 8 grounds.
