Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr K Bhatoo, Counsel, instructed by
                       Messrs M J Solomon & Partners, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Vale, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The public interest in ensuring that persons subject to immigration control
do not enter the United Kingdom on a false basis can prevent a person  from
relying on a claim of legitimate expectation so as to compel effect  to  be
given to a representation that entry clearance would  be  granted  to  that
person

1.    The appellant, born on 28 January  1970,  is  a  citizen  of  Romania.
      On 24 January 2004 he  applied  for  entry  clearance  to  the  United
      Kingdom as a person intending to establish himself in business in this
      country under the provisions of the EC Association Agreement  relating
      to Romania.   On  29  September  2004  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
      Bucharest refused the appellant's application on the  basis  that  the
      appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraphs 212  to  214  of
      the Immigration Rules (HC 395).   The appellant appealed against  that
      decision on 15 October 2004.   By reason of article 4  of  the  Asylum
      and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act  2004  (Commencement
      No 5 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2005, that appeal, made to  an
      Adjudicator and pending immediately before  4  April  2005,  continues
      thereafter as an appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.

Background to the Appeal

2.    The Association Agreement relating to Romania is one of  a  number  of
      such agreements made between the members of  the  European  Union  and
      various other European States.   The Agreements  provide  a  right  of
      establishment for nationals of those other States, within the European
      Union.   Nationals of the relevant States, when seeking to set  up  in
      business  or  as  self-employed  persons,  must  be  treated  no  less
      favourably than nationals of the host State.   The  operation  of  the
      Agreements can be  limited  by  national  rules  governing  entry  and
      residents in respect of a particular EU  state,  provided  that  those
      rules do not make it impossible or excessively difficult for the right
      of establishment to be exercised.

3.    The United Kingdom's national rules include a  requirement  for  prior
      entry clearance before applicants travel to the United Kingdom.  As  a
      result of arrangements between the Home Office  and  the  Foreign  and
      Commonwealth Office, Entry  Clearance  Officers  in  the  past  sought
      authorisation from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of  the
      Home Office for decisions on entry clearance in this category of case.

5.    Paragraphs 212 to 214 of the Immigration Rules provide as follows:

           "212. The requirements to be met by a person  seeking  leave  to
                 enter the United Kingdom to establish himself  in  business
                 are that:

                 (i)   he satisfies the requirements of either paragraph 213
                       or paragraph 214; and

                 (ii)  the money he is putting into the  business  is  under
                       his control and sufficient to  establish  himself  in
                       business in the United Kingdom; and

                 (iii) until his business provides him  with  an  income  he
                       will have sufficient additional funds to maintain and
                       accommodate  himself  and  any   dependants   without
                       recourse to employment (other than his work  for  the
                       business) or to public funds; and


                 (iv)  his share of the profits  of  the  business  will  be
                       sufficient to maintain and  accommodate  himself  and
                       any dependants without recourse to employment  (other
                       than his work for the business) or to  public  funds;
                       and


                    v)  he  does  not  intend  to  supplement  his  business
                       activities by taking or  seeking  employment  in  the
                       United Kingdom other than his work for the  business;
                       and
                   vi) he holds a valid entry clearance for  entry  in  this
                       capacity.


           213.  Where a person intends to establish himself in  a  company
                 in the United Kingdom which he effectively controls he will
                 need, in addition to meeting the requirements at  paragraph
                 212, to show:


                 (i)   that he is a national of Bulgaria or Romania; and


                 (ii)  that he will  have  a  controlling  interest  in  the
                       company; and


                 (iii) that he will be actively involved  in  the  promotion
                       and management of the company; and


                 (iv)  that the company will be  registered  in  the  United
                       Kingdom and be trading or providing services  in  the
                       United Kingdom; and


                 (v)   that the company will be the owner of the  assets  of
                       the business; and


                 (vi)  where he  is  taking  over  an  existing  company,  a
                       written statement of the terms on which he is to take
                       over  the  business  and  audited  accounts  for  the
                       business for previous years.


           214.  Where a  person  intends  to  establish  himself  in  self
                 employment or in partnership in the United Kingdom he  will
                 need, in addition to meeting the requirements at 212 above,
                 to show:


                 (i)   that he is a national of Bulgaria or Romania; and


                 (ii)  that he will  be  actively  involved  in  trading  or
                       providing  services  on  his  own   account   or   in
                       partnership in the United Kingdom; and


                 (iii) that he, or he together with his  partners,  will  be
                       the owner of the assets of the business; and


                 (iv)  in the case of a partnership, that his  part  in  the
                       business will not amount to a  disguised  employment;
                       and


                 (v)   where he  is  taking  over  or  joining  an  existing
                       business a written statement of the terms on which he
                       is to take over or  join  the  business  and  audited
                       accounts for the business for previous years".

6.    The appellant made his application on the basis that  he  intended  to
      work in the United  Kingdom  as  a  self-employed  electrician.    His
      application made its  way  to  the  General  Group  Managed  Migration
      Directorate of the IND in Sheffield.   On 19 February  2004,  the  IND
      wrote to the Entry Clearance Officer in Bucharest, requesting that the
      appellant be issued with an  entry  clearance.    Enclosed  with  that
      letter was a further letter of the same date, written in English,  and
      addressed to the appellant.   This stated that "you have  been  issued
      with entry clearance as a self-employed person under the provisions of
      an EC Association Agreement".

7.    On 30 March 2004, the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      announced  a  suspension  of  the  consideration  of  all  Association
      Agreement applications from Romania and Bulgaria, pending  an  enquiry
      into the way  in  which  they  were  being  handled.    This  followed
      publication on 25 March 2004 of a report by  Mr  Ken  Sutton,  dealing
      with allegations that followed disclosures made by a civil servant  in
      the IND, that there had been a deliberate policy to relax  the  checks
      on Association Agreement applicants in the run up to EU Accession on 1
      May 2004.   On 30 March 2004, the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department asked Mr Sutton to examine  further  allegations  that  had
      been made by the Entry Clearance Manager in  Bucharest,  described  by
      the Shadow Home Secretary in the House  of  Commons  on  that  day  "a
      massive, well organised migration scam that civil servants  had  drawn
      to the attention of the Home Office but the Minister did nothing about
      it" (Hansard, 30 March 2004, Column 1431).

8.    The report of Mr Sutton's further investigation was  published  on  17
      June 2004.    The Sutton report's  first  key  finding  was  that  the
      Association Agreements had "been exploited  in  the  sense  that  many
      Bulgarian and Romanian nationals have been helped to make applications
      to set them up in business  or  as  self-employed  in  the  UK.     In
      effect, many applicants have been sold a service  that  includes  pro-
      forma  business  plans.     Through   this   technique,   some   legal
      representatives have helped many applicants  to  successfully  present
      themselves, in person and in writing, in a way which  has  exaggerated
      their ability to meet the  UK's  national  rules  for  setting  up  in
      business under this scheme, when it is likely that, in practice, their
      real purpose was simply seeking work in the UK whether formally  in  a
      self-employed or in a paid capacity"   (paragraph 1.14).

9.    As a result of this abuse, the Sutton report  found  that  "there  are
      now Bulgarian and Romanian nationals in the  United  Kingdom  who  are
      unlikely to have been able to demonstrate that they could successfully
      set  up  in  business  here  if  their  applications  had   not   been
      manufactured for them".  For those in this category who  had  not  yet
      been given indefinite leave to remain,  the  Sutton  report  concluded
      that, were its recommendations to be implemented,  the  IND  would  be
      able "to consider carefully whether they should be allowed  to  remain
      in the UK permanently or should be removed if they are not meeting the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules" (paragraph 1.16).

10.   The report's second key finding was as follows:

           "1.16 The second key finding is  that  officials  handling  ECAA
                 applications have been sharply divided in their view of the
                 relevant law.  The period since 2001 in particular has been
                 marked  by  a  conflict  between  two  approaches.    Entry
                 clearance  staff  in  Sophia  and  Bucharest  favoured   an
                 approach which, if  adopted,  would  have  meant  that  the
                 majority of  applicants  would  have  been  refused.   Home
                 Office staff in IND thought that  refusals  on  that  basis
                 would be unsustainable in law and took  an  approach  under
                 which the majority of applicants were granted.    The  Home
                 Office  view  prevailed  -  but  the  tension  between  the
                 approaches continued and remains to be resolved."

11.   The third key finding of the report flowed directly  from  the  second
      such finding.   Having taken legal advice, Mr  Sutton  concluded  that
      "while the requirements for a successful  application  are  not  high,
      especially for self-employment in a lower skilled trade, the law would
      support a more questioning and  challenging  approach  than  has  been
      taken in the past.  The problem over the ECAA category  can  therefore
      be resolved through changes in the way decisions are  taken  which  do
      not require  primary  legislation  or  amendment  to  the  Agreements"
      (paragraph 1.17).  Amongst the principal changes  recommended  in  the
      report were the introduction of a more  robust  process  for  deciding
      applications for entry clearance, with those decisions being taken  by
      entry clearance staff on the basis of the local enquiries, rather than
      by the Home Office working from the United Kingdom, the  reinstatement
      of interviews for some or all applicants and better training for  case
      workers in the assessment of financial  accounts  and  other  business
      documents.

12.   As a consequence of the government's response to  the  Sutton  report,
      the Entry Clearance Manager in Bucharest wrote on 10 September 2004 to
      the appellant.  The appellant was told as follows:

           "As you may be aware, the Home Secretary announced a  suspension
           of consideration of ECAA applications on 30 March 2004,  pending
           an enquiry into the handling of such applications.    The report
           of the Inquiry was published on 17 June.    The  Home  Secretary
           subsequently announced on 22 July that  the  service  for  entry
           clearance cases would resume on 1 September.

           Although previously it may have been indicated that you were  to
           be issued  with  entry  clearance  in  the  ECAA  category,  the
           conclusions of the Inquiry, and in particular the finding that a
           more robust interpretation of the law than that  on  which  case
           workers in the UK were basing their recommendations  would  have
           been appropriate, and that there had been  exploitation  of  the
           scheme, mean that the  public  interest  requires  that  we  now
           consider your application afresh."

13.   As part of the consideration process, the  appellant  was  invited  to
      attend an interview at the Embassy in Bucharest on 29 September  2004.
       At that interview, the appellant told the interviewing  officer  that
      he was an engine locomotive  electrician  for  the  Romanian  National
      Railways and that he intended to do  electrical  work  in  the  United
      Kingdom, comprising "cable installation and plugs, installing and  fix
      them" (question 5).    He said he ran a company in  Romania  with  his
      wife selling children's and women's clothing.   Asked who had compiled
      the business plan which  he  had  submitted  in  connection  with  his
      application, he replied "accountancy company  with  my  ideas".    The
      appellant said that he spoke English "not very good,  but  sometime  I
      will go to school in England".     Asked  how  he  would  conduct  his
      business with limited knowledge of  English,  he  said  that  "I  know
      technical terms and I know what to do, I will go to a course  as  soon
      as I there" (question 15).    He  said  that  he  would  "also  do  an
      electricians course, this is necessary as  currently  there  are  some
      changes in the colours and the cables and voltage will change  in  the
      next year as well" (question 16).    Asked where the course  would  be
      held, the interview record records "applicant looks blank".    It  was
      pointed out to the appellant that  although  he  said  he  could  read
      English, he could not say where the course would be held although  the
      address was clearly on the letterhead of a document he apparently  had
      before  him.    The  appellant  said  that  he  did   not   have   the
      qualification known as BS7671 but that this was not  compulsory  since
      the appellant intended to "work for private  people,  but  in  time  I
      think I will need this for  the  big  companies,  I  will  improve  my
      English first".  The appellant said that whilst it would be  difficult
      for him in the beginning, given his problems with English,  he  had  a
      friend in the United Kingdom who had a business (question 21).

14.   There then occurred the following exchange:

           "22.  What colours are the wires  in  a  UK  domestic  appliance
                 plug?  Blue, Brown, and Yellow and Green, Red or Brown, Red
                 or Blue.

            23.    Why have you given me so many  different  colours?   They
                 are the connections to the earth (Yellow and Green) and its
                 either Brown or Black or Red or Blue that's why."

15.   The appellant was also asked about his earnings  in  Romania  and  his
      business activities in that country.   At the end  of  the  interview,
      the interviewing officer produced a "summary", which reads as follows:

           "The applicant elected to be interviewed throughout in Romanian,
           and showed no real understanding of  questions  in  English,  he
           states he will take English classes in UK, not  beforehand.   He
           states that his "friend" will  pass  on  work  to  him  but  has
           provided no details of any such contracts or employment  offers.
           As stated that he  will  do  an  electrical  course  in  UK  and
           provided details, despite stating that he could read English, he
           was unable to state  where  this  course  was,  and  this  is  a
           conversion course for tradesmen who already hold  BS7671,  which
           of course the applicant does not have.  He and his  wife  run  a
           clothing business here  and  produce  funds  of  around  �6,000,
           although company registration documentation seen,  no  documents
           of actual sales to substantiate  funds.    Has  previously  been
           refused visit EC's twice (with his wife).

           The applicant provided vague and contradictory answers regarding
           the colours of the wires in a domestic appliance plug and  I  am
           not satisfied that he has the ability to provide services on his
           own account.


           On 19 February 2004, the HO authorised issue  of  ECAA  EC's  to
           this applicant and his wife, but I am not prepared  to  exercise
           my discretion, and honour the issue of these EC's.    Under  the
           new interpretation of the law, this applicant and  his  wife  do
           not qualify under the rule."


16.   The refusal of entry clearance  set  out  these  matters  in  somewhat
      greater detail.   The refusal noted that the appellant had been unable
      to provide business accounts or documentation detailing  the  business
      of selling  clothing,  nor  had  the  appellant  provided  documentary
      evidence to support his assertion that that business brought a  profit
      of �400 per month.   The  appellant  was  said  to  have  been  unable
      satisfactorily to explain the source of  the  funds  he  had  and  his
      funding balance  was  not  consistent  with  statements  he  had  made
      regarding  his  current  income.     The   Entry   Clearance   Officer
      accordingly concluded that  those  funds  had  been  credited  to  the
      appellant's  account  in  an  attempt  to  lend  credibility  to   the
      appellant's  application.    The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was   not
      satisfied that the funds were in  fact  available  to  the  appellant.
      The Entry Clearance Officer noted that the appellant had  been  unable
      to provide any documentation relating to the friend whom the appellant
      said he had in the United Kingdom and who was  said  to  be  similarly
      engaged as a self-employed electrician.  Overall, the Entry  Clearance
      Officer considered that  the  appellant  displayed  a  clear  lack  of
      knowledge regarding arrangements for making his business in the United
      Kingdom a  viable  one.    The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  accordingly
      concluded that the appellant had not shown  a  genuine  and  realistic
      intention to establish such a business in the  United  Kingdom.    Nor
      did  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  consider  that  the   appellant's
      proficiency in English would  enable  his  business  to  grow  at  the
      proposed rate in the business plan.

The Appellant's Appeal

17.   In the appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  dated  15  October  2004,  he
      asserted that the Entry Clearance Officer had been shown documentation
      relating to the appellant's employment, and that of his wife, as  well
      as letters  from  the  Tax  Authorities  in  Romania,  concerning  the
      appellant's business, and documents relating to the property in  which
      the appellant lived.  The appellant accepted that  he  did  not  speak
      "good enough English" but said he had told the Entry Clearance Officer
      that he was ready to learn more and that Romanians had gone to England
      without as much English as he had.  As for the  answers  at  interview
      regarding the wiring of a domestic plug, the  appellant  said  it  was
      possible that his answers had been incorrectly translated or recorded.
       He said he knew the colours "perfectly".

18.   On 15 April 2005, the  Tribunal  adjourned  the  appeal  in  order  to
      enable the parties to submit arguments concerning the issue of whether
      the appellant had a legitimate expectation that he  would  be  granted
      entry clearance, as a result of the letter to him  dated  19  February
      2004.  At the adjourned hearing on 25 May, the Tribunal had before  it
      skeleton arguments from the appellant and the respondent.

Did the appellant have a legitimate expectation that Entry  Clearance  would
be granted?

19.   By section 84(1)(e) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
      2002, one of the grounds of  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  is  "that  the
      decision is otherwise  not in accordance  with  the  law".     If  the
      effect of the letter of 19 February 2004 was to  create  a  legitimate
      expectation on the part of the appellant, that he would be  given  the
      entry clearance he needed  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom,  then  the
      decision of 29 September 2004 to refuse to grant entry  clearance  may
      be said to be not in accordance with the law.   This, we find, is  the
      only  legal  basis  upon  which  an  argument  based  upon  legitimate
      expectation may be advanced before us.

20.   For the  respondent,  it  was  submitted  that  a  person  seeking  to
      establish a legitimate expectation must show the following:

           (a)   a clear and unambiguous  representation  of  a  particular
                 benefit being granted;

           (b)    detrimental  reliance  by   the   applicant   upon   that
                 representation;  and

           (c)   no overriding public interest  which  justifies  defeating
                 the expectation.

21.   As the respondent's skeleton argument acknowledges however,  paragraph
      (b) above is subject to a caveat.   In R v Department of Education and
      Employment ex parte Begbie [1999]  EWCA  Civ  2100,  Peter  Gibson  LJ
      accepted the appellant's submission  in  that  case  that  it  is  not
      necessary for a person to have changed his position  as  a  result  of
      representations in order for a legitimate expectation to  subsist.  He
      nevertheless held (at paragraph 48 of the judgments) that "it would be
      wrong to understate the significance of reliance in this area  of  the
      law.   It is very much the  exception,  rather  than  the  rule,  that
      detrimental  reliance  will  not  be  present  when  the  Court  finds
      unfairness in the defeating of a legitimate expectation."

22.   In the  present  case,  there  is  no  evidence  whatsoever  that  the
      appellant has relied on the representation contained in the letter  of
      11 February 2004.    He may be disappointed by the  eventual  decision
      to refuse him entry clearance, notwithstanding the earlier letter, but
      that is all.   Before  the  Tribunal,  Mr  Bhatoo  asserted  that  the
      appellant had, in fact, sold his house on the strength of  the  letter
      and had been compelled to go to  live  with  relatives.     Mr  Bhatoo
      readily conceded, however, that he had no evidence to put  before  the
      Tribunal to support this assertion.

23.   The following point is also of significance.    The  actual  grant  of
      entry clearance consists of the placing of a visa in  the  appellant's
      passport.    It  is  common  ground  that   that   was   never   done.
      Furthermore, there is no evidence that the  appellant,  at  any  stage
      between February 2004 and 10 September 2004, ever attended the Embassy
      in Bucharest, in order to secure that visa, or  that  he  communicated
      with the Embassy in any other way, in order to get the Entry Clearance
      Officer to act in pursuance of the letter of 19 February.

24.   Faced with a lack of evidence  of  reliance  upon  the  letter  of  19
      February, Mr Bhatoo submitted that the decision in February  2004  had
      involved the appellant being granted a work permit  and  that  it  was
      therefore the case that entry clearance had to be granted by the Entry
      Clearance  Officer  in  Bucharest.     That  submission  is,  however,
      incorrect.   There is no indication that any work permit  is  required
      in a case of this kind, involving as  it  does  an  application  by  a
      person who proposes to be self-employed.

25,   The Tribunal further  finds  that  there  is  in  any  event  a  clear
      overriding  public  interest  which  would   defeat   any   legitimate
      expectation the appellant might seek to assert.   In Begbie,  Laws  LJ
      explored the scope of this principle at paragraphs 75  to  85  of  the
      judgments.   Essentially, Laws LJ held that the intensity of  judicial
      review in cases of legitimate expectation will depend upon the  extent
      to which the decision in question raises important matters of  general
      policy affecting the public at large or a significant section  of  it.
      At paragraph 82, the learned Lord Justice  held  that  "the  more  the
      decision challenged lies in what may inelegantly be called the  macro-
      political field, the less intrusive will be the  Court's  supervision.
      More than this:  in that field, true abuse of power is less likely  to
      be found,  since  within  it  changes  of  policy,  fuelled  by  broad
      conceptions of the public interest, may more readily  be  accepted  as
      taking  precedence  over  the  interests  of  groups   which   enjoyed
      expectations generated by an earlier policy."

26.   In the present case, a finding that the  appellant  has  a  legitimate
      expectation to be granted entry clearance would require this  Tribunal
      to venture into the very middle of the macro-political field described
      by Laws LJ in Begbie.   The decision to reconsider the issue of  entry
      clearance arose  directly  from  the  recommendations  of  the  Sutton
      Inquiry and the acceptance by the Government of those recommendations.
        There was, we find, a very strong public interest in  ensuring  that
      persons, such as the appellant, who had not actually been given  visas
      so as to enter the United  Kingdom,  should  have  their  applications
      reassessed on the basis  of  the  "more  questioning  and  challenging
      approach" to the relevant Immigration Rules identified  in  the  third
      key finding of the Report.  To put the matter bluntly, the public  has
      a strong and legitimate interest in seeing its Government  take  steps
      to ensure that people who are subject to immigration  control  do  not
      enter the United Kingdom on a false basis.

27.   The Tribunal accordingly finds that the decision in the  present  case
      cannot be said to be "not in accordance with the law".

Does the appellant meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules?

28.   The Business Plan submitted by the appellant to  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer is an important part of the appellant's application.   On  any
      reading, it  is  highly  unsatisfactory  document,  as  the  following
      examples make plain.   On  page  3,  under  the  heading  "details  of
      business activities", we find this:

           "Advertising and relying on word and mouth will achieve  finding
           customers (sic).  [The appellant] expects his initial  customers
           to be private households because most of them accept to  wait  a
           little bit more to have the  work  done  (sic).   Increasing  of
           incomes will be inevitably achieved  when  commercial  buildings
           are served.   But  "Romeo  Electrics"  will  offer  services  to
           owners of such buildings once he has maintained  a  considerable
           number of regular clients from the private households  who  will
           are (sic) supposed to guarantee  his  permanent  income.     For
           this purpose he will need to hire some qualified assistants  who
           will help him with the  vast  accomplishment  of  the  projects.
           Everything  will  be  considered  with  the   desires   of   the
           customers."

29.   At page 4, under the heading "expansion of business  services  in  the
      future" it is stated that the appellant's  "long  term  plan  for  the
      Business is to expand his client base beyond London.   Also he intends
      to broaden his services in order to have more customers.  He plans  to
      start repairing of electrical devices.   The purpose  of  the  company
      will be to service more well-to-do people, a fact  which  will  surely
      have positive effect on the revenues of the company".

30.   On the same page, under "strength of the business" it is  stated  that
      the appellant has received a very good  education  and  experience  in
      Romania.   No details are given.    It is then asserted  that  because
      of his qualification and experience, the appellant "will  build  up  a
      reputable business to generate a lot of good will and contacts,  which
      will be of immense value to the future development  of  his  business.
      The fact that he will  offer  reasonable  competitive  prices  of  the
      services should attract more customers".

31.   At page 5,  somewhat  belatedly,  we  find  some  details  as  to  the
      qualifications and experience of the appellant.   He is said  to  have
      graduated as a  locomotive  electro  mechanic  which  would  give  him
      "extensive knowledge on electrical  installations  both  domestic  and
      industrial".    The appellant is said to have changed his position  in
      November 2001 when  he  began  working  as  an  installation  assembly
      electrician and that since 2000 he has  worked  "on  his  own  account
      servicing private clients as an electrician".    No further details of
      that are given.

32.   On page 7, reference is made to "available sub-contractors".    It  is
      stated that "should the need arise for taking on a  larger  number  of
      sub-contractors [the appellant] intends to  use  his  own  connections
      and/or  to  advertise  in  order  to  find  suitable  and   beneficial
      contracts".  No details of any such  connections  are  given.      The
      Plan then goes on to say  that  in  case  the  appellant  faces  "some
      initial difficulties in finding clients", he  would  work  as  a  sub-
      contractor and that amongst such sub-contractors  the  appellant  "may
      find his future partners for bigger projects".

33.   On page 8, the "strategy of the company"  is  said  to  be  "based  on
      continual improvement of the material base".   By "material  base"  it
      appears that the Plan is referring to "materials  which  have  already
      proven their names and brands, which will attract a larger  number  of
      customers".    On  page  9,  reference  is  made  to  the  appellant's
      "contacts within the industry" who, it is said, "will help him to gain
      first hand knowledge of the electrical market requirements in London".
        No details of these contacts are given.

34.   Overall, the Business Plan submitted by the  appellant  is,  we  find,
      both remarkably vague and shot-through with  platitudinous  and  naive
      statements.   It is very far from being a  document  that  suggests  a
      serious intent on the part of the appellant to leave his home  country
      and engage as a self-employed  electrical  contractor  in  the  United
      Kingdom.   Indeed, we have to say  that  its  submission  -  far  from
      advancing the appellant's application - does the opposite.

35.   Having considered the evidence in this case, the Tribunal  finds  that
      the appellant has entirely failed to show on balance that he meets the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph 212(2) requires  the
      money which the appellant is putting into the business to be under his
      control and sufficient to establish himself in that  business  in  the
      United  Kingdom.     Sub-paragraph  (iii)  provides  that  until   the
      business  provides  an  income  the  appellant  must  have  sufficient
      additional  funds  to  maintain  and  accommodate  himself   and   his
      dependants  (in  the  present  case  his  wife)  without  recourse  to
      employment or public funds.   Sub-paragraph  (iv)  provides  that  the
      appellant's share of the profits of the business must be sufficient to
      maintain and accommodate himself and his dependants  without  recourse
      to employment or  public  funds.    As  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      observed, significant deposits had been made into the appellant's bank
      account around the time of the  application  and  no  explanation  for
      those payments has been provided.   Nor were bank statements  provided
      to show the financial position of  the  appellant  over  a  sufficient
      period of time to enable an accurate picture of  his  finances  to  be
      obtained.   No accounts of the Romanian business were provided  so  as
      to show profit and turnover over  a  period  of  time.      There  was
      inadequate evidence to prove that the sum of some �6,000 held  by  the
      appellant had been earned and saved by him and his wife.

36.   An applicant's command of English  is  not  in  itself  a  determining
      feature.   Having said that, the appellant's command  of  English  was
      plainly very limited and the Entry Clearance Officer was  entitled  to
      observe that the appellant did not  intend  to  undertake  a  language
      course before coming to  the  United  Kingdom.     The  appellant  was
      unable to read a letterhead upon which the  address  was  given  of  a
      place in the United Kingdom, where the appellant said he  intended  to
      undertake a training course, following his admission to this  country.
       It is frankly difficult to see how any person who intended  to  work,
      at least initially,  as  a  domestic  electrician  would  be  able  to
      communicate with prospective customers, if he had as limited a command
      of written and spoken English, as does the appellant.

37.   As we have already found, the Business Plan in no sense suggests  that
      the appellant genuinely intends to work as an electrician in  a  self-
      employed capacity in the United Kingdom.    In addition, the appellant
      gave little explanation at his interview  as  to  the  nature  of  his
      business activities.  He asserted at one  point  that  replacing  plug
      points in a house could cost between �25 and �30 and  that  one  could
      charge �1,500 for rewiring a house.   He did not, however, explain how
      he had arrived by  these  figures.    Furthermore,  the  cost  figures
      provided by the appellant at his interview did  not  relate  to  those
      contained in the Business Plan.

38,    Quite  apart  from  his  difficulties  with  English,  the  appellant
      demonstrated what would be a frightening lack of knowledge  about  the
      wiring of a British plug if, as he would have had the Entry  Clearance
      Officer and the Tribunal believe, he were truly intending to carry out
      electrical work in private households in the United Kingdom.

39.   Overall, the Tribunal finds that the appellant has failed  on  balance
      to show that he meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules to  be
      admitted  on  the  basis  contained  in  his  application  for   Entry
      Clearance.

40.   This appeal is dismissed.
