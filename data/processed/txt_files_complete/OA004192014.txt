For the Appellant:     Mr M Blundell, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Indonesia born on 9th February 1986.  The
    Appellant applied for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules.  That application was considered under paragraph
    EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM.  The application was refused by the  Secretary
    of State's Notice of Refusal dated 3rd December 2013.

 2. The Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    on 5th March.  I am advised that paragraph 3 of those Grounds of Appeal
    are not pursued.  On 6th  May  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever
    granted permission to appeal.   Judge  Lever  noted  that  the  grounds
    asserted that the Judge erred in allowing third  party  support  to  be
    counted in the income threshold test and erred in not noting a document
    required was missing and in his  assessment  of  accommodation.   Judge
    Lever noted that the Sponsor was in receipt of disability allowance and
    was exempt from the financial requirements  of  E-ECP3.1.   However  he
    noted that it was still necessary to show that the Appellant  could  be
    adequately maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds
    and it was arguable that in the Judge's assessment of accommodation the
    Judge had erred in finding  there  was  such  a  prospect  of  adequate
    accommodation in light of his findings at paragraph  17.   Judge  Lever
    considered the question  of  adequate  accommodation  seemed  a  little
    speculative and that it was arguable that the Judge had erred  in  this
    aspect of the case.  It was on that basis that the appeal  came  before
    me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law in the
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   No  Rule  24  response
    appeared to have been filed on the Respondent's behalf.  Whilst this is
    an appeal by the Secretary of  State  for  the  purpose  of  continuity
    throughout the appeal process Mrs T Devita is referred to herein as the
    Appellant and the Secretary of State as the Respondent.

 3. It was the Secretary of State's submission that the Judge had erred  in
    taking into account gifts from the Sponsor's parents  to  mitigate  the
    shortfall in the Appellant's income considered against the level set by
    the income support threshold and that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had
    failed to give adequate reasons on making his findings with  regard  to
    the adequacy of the Appellant's forthcoming accommodation.  In  finding
    that there was an error of law I was satisfied that it  was  not  clear
    how the Judge has reached her findings and that  the  correct  approach
    was to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and to re-list
    the matter for further consideration.  I specifically indicated that at
    that stage I would expect the Sponsor/Appellant's solicitors to provide
    sufficient information to show that the Immigration Rules are  met  and
    if they failed to do so they may have to accept that the  appeal  could
    not succeed.

 4. It is on that basis that the appeal comes back before me for rehearing.
     In this instance the Appellants are represented  by  their  instructed
    Counsel, Mr Blundell.  Mr Blundell has provided a very helpful skeleton
    in  support  of  his  contentions.   Further  in  accordance  with   my
    instructions there is produced to me an additional bundle of  documents
    and within that bundle of documents are  witness  statements  from  the
    Sponsor and his parents which are signed and dated 11th December  2015.
    The Secretary of State appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr
    Bramble.

Submissions/Discussions

 5. As a precursor I am substantially helped by a  concession  made  by  Mr
    Blundell endorsed by Mr Bramble that it is now accepted that  in  order
    to meet the financial requirements under the Immigration Rules  at  the
    date of decision the Appellant through the funds  of  her  Sponsor  was
    �1.22 short of meeting the requisite requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It is further agreed and accepted that subsequent increases  to
    the Sponsor's disability living allowance cannot be taken into account.
     Despite that it is the submission of Mr Blundell that this appeal can,
    and should be, allowed under the  Immigration  Rules.   Further  it  is
    conceded by Mr Bramble the grounds of appeal plead a claim pursuant  to
    Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights  and  despite  the
    terms upon which my finding on the error of law was couched he does not
    object, if it is appropriate, for Article 8  to  be  raised  before  me
    today.  It is on that basis that we proceed.

 6. It is the submission of Mr Blundell that the Tribunal having  made  and
    sustained such findings must consider whether the shortfall in question
    is cured by the application of the principle of de  minimis  non  curat
    lex.  He submits that that maxim applies and is  accepted  as  applying
    within the Immigration Rules and he relies on  the  authorities  of  MD
    (Jamaica) [2010] EWCA Civ 213 and Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261.  He submits
    that the application of the principle to the present  case  is  plainly
    justified and that the shortfall in question is of no significance  and
    the Tribunal should not be concerned by  such  a  sum  particularly  in
    circumstances where the Sponsor has been able to save sufficient  money
    to visit his wife in Indonesia.

 7. Mr Blundell  further  produces  proof  of  ownership  of  the  relevant
    property where the Sponsor now intends to live as  being  the  property
    owned by his parents.  Mr Bramble does not wish to raise further  issue
    on this point.  On the above basis Mr Blundell asked me  to  allow  the
    appeal.

 8. Mr Bramble notes that the approach is based on  de  minimis  principles
    but points out that the Sponsor has travelled to Indonesia to visit his
    wife and that the Sponsor's finances are well set out at  paragraph  13
    of the First-tier Judge's determination.  He acknowledges  that  it  is
    perfectly  acceptable  for  the  Sponsor  to  save  money  out  of  his
    disability living allowance to pay for his trip to Indonesia  to  visit
    his wife but submits that he is  going  into  a  pool  of  funds  which
    already have a shortfall in an attempt to satisfy the de minimis  rule.
    He notes the Sponsor's parents will accommodate the couple and  submits
    that if this matter is being construed by pursuant to Article 8 outside
    the Rules that "near-miss" principles cannot be applied.  He  concludes
    by stating that the final decision is one he wishes to leave to me.

Findings

 9. Following the acceptance that under the financial requirements  of  the
    Rules the Appellant cannot succeed.  I am invited  by  Mr  Blundell  to
    still allow the appeal under the Rules applying  the  principle  of  de
    minimis non curat lex as backed up by the authorities of  MD  (Jamaica)
    and Miah.  It matters little whether the shortfall at date of  decision
    was �1.12 or �1.22.  I accept the point made by Mr Blundell and  indeed
    the de minimis point was not raised previously  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal nor has the Judge addressed the issue therein.  Mr Blundell is
    correct in his legal assertion that the "near-miss" is not the same  as
    the de minimis principle or if a departure from  a  Rule  is  truly  de
    minimis the Rule  is  considered  to  have  been  complied  with.   The
    starting point for the near-miss argument is that the Rule has not been
    complied with.  The approach set out by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MD
    ((Jamaica) reflects perfectly reasonably on the  manner  in  which  the
    Rule should be adopted here.  In MD (Jamaica) Dyson LJ stated:

         "I see nothing absurd in giving the Rule  its  plain  and  ordinary
         meaning.  The case of the applicant who submits his application one
         day late is catered for by  an  application  of  the  principle  de
         minimis non curat lex (the law is not  concerned  with  very  small
         things).  ... there is no reason not to give the  language  of  the
         Rule its plain and ordinary meaning."

10. In such circumstances applying similar principles the de  minimis  rule
    can be applied here.  There always has of course to be a cut off but  a
    shortfall of �1.22 per  week  at  the  date  of  decision  (and  now  I
    anticipate well met) cannot possibly reflect a proportionate basis  for
    refusing this appeal bearing in mind the effect such refusal will  have
    on the  family  life  of  the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant.   In  such
    circumstances the application of the principle to the present  case  is
    justified.  The shortfall in question is of  no  significance  and  the
    Tribunal need not be concerned by such a sum  particularly  I  note  in
    circumstances whether family life of the Appellant and  Sponsor  is  at
    stake and that the Sponsor has already shown that he is  able  to  save
    sufficient money to visit his wife in Indonesia.   For  all  the  above
    reasons the appeal is consequently allowed under the Immigration Rules.
