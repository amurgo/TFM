                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Sangha promulgated on 14th December 2013, following a hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 3rd December 2013.  In  the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of Mrs Salma Begum, who applied for, and
    was granted subsequently, permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 3rd March  1994.
    She appeals against the refusal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
    Islamabad to refuse her application for entry  clearance  to  join  her
    spouse, Mr Imtiaz Mohammed, a person present and settled in the UK,  as
    his partner, under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, in a  decision
    that was decided on 27th November 2012.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's  claim  is  that  her  sponsoring  husband,  Mr  Imtiaz
    Mohammed, is working at Foreign Car Spares, in Saltley  in  Birmingham,
    since 5th March 2012, as a clerical  assistant,  and  has  earnings  of
    �19,565 per year.  This is a permanent job.  He  receives  weekly  wage
    slips.  His wages are deposited on a weekly basis  into  his  Santander
    current account.  He has savings of �4,300.  He was also paid in  cash,
    but did not have any Santander account showing such payments  into  his
    account from 2012.  He also did not have his P60  for  the  year  2012.
    However, one was handed in for 2012 at the hearing.  The Appellant  was
    able to  meet  the  financial  threshold  requirement  test  under  the
    Immigration Rules such that she should be allowed  entry  to  join  her
    husband in the UK.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed how the Appellant had to show an income of at  least
    �18,600 gross per annum, and that she was relying  upon  her  husband's
    income as an office clerk with Foreign Car Spares Limited, where he had
    been employed since 5th March 2012.  A letter from Foreign  Car  Spares
    dated 28th December 2012 confirmed that the Appellant was working there
    on a full-time basis and that his gross pay was �382.50 per week as  an
    office clerk.  There was the Sponsor's P60  for  the  year  ending  5th
    April 2012.  This showed that his salary in that employment was �914.66
    and his employment with RMS Staffing  Services  Limited  was  confirmed
    here.

 5. The judge was not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant's  income  showed  a
    minimum earning of �18,600 per annum gross.  This is  because  his  P60
    for the year ending 5th April 2012 showed that his total salary in  the
    employment with Foreign Car Spares Limited was a mere �1,033.60, and  a
    P60 for the tax  year  ending  5th  April  2013  with  respect  to  the
    Sponsor's employment with Foreign Car Spares Limited showed that he had
    �17,790.50.  This P60 was postdecision evidence.  In the same way there
    was a letter dated 27th September 2013 from Foreign Car Spares Limited,
    which confirmed that he had been employed by them since 5th March 2012,
    in a permanent position, "as a clerical assistant and his gross  salary
    is �19,565.00.  However, this is inconsistent with the P60 that he  has
    produced" (para 16).  The appeal was dismissed.





Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state, inter alia, that the judge was  wrong
    (at para 16) to say that "the P60 is clearly postdecision evidence  and
    in any event if I did take it into account it still does not  meet  the
    threshold of �18,600."  This is  because  the  judge,  in  so  stating,
    failed to take into account the  employer's  letter  from  Foreign  Car
    Spares Limited, dated 7th January 2014, which clearly stated  that  the
    applicant was paid a rate of �6.08 per hour from 5th March 2012 and his
    hourly rate was later changed to �9 per  hour,  on  20th  August  2012.
    Therefore, the Appellant's P60 dated April  2013  would  have  a  lower
    overall figure.

 7. On 10th March 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that
    the judge ought to have taken into account Article 8 considerations  of
    his own motion by reason of Section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,
    even if, following the High Court judgment in MM [2013] EWHC 1900,  the
    judge felt that the Appellant could not succeed under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me  on  13th  June  2014,  Mr  Ali,  of  Counsel,
    appearing on behalf of the Appellant, submitted that Article 8 had been
    overlooked by the judge, even though it had been  specifically  pleaded
    in the skeleton argument submitted before the judge.  Under  Section  6
    of the Human Rights Act, a decision  by  a  public  authority  must  be
    compatible with human rights obligations.  Mr  Ali  accepted  that  the
    judge had summarised the  evidence  at  paragraphs  15  to  16  of  the
    determination quite accurately.

 9. He also accepted that the Appellant could not meet the  requirement  of
    providing evidence in a way that conformed  with  "specified  evidence"
    obligations.  However, the Article 8 considerations had to be looked at
    in the context of what the High Court said  in  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900.
    What was clear from that judgment was that the Sponsor's  status  as  a
    British citizen was not insignificant.  Secondly,  it  was  simply  not
    correct that the Appellant's income was �17,700, as found by the judge,
    because there had been an error, and a letter subsequently  in  January
    2014 that confirmed this from the employers.

10. For his part, Mr Smart submitted that Article 8 had not been  mentioned
    before the judge.  The Tribunal was the  product  of  a  statute.   The
    jurisdiction was a product of statute.  The judge could not enter  into
    considerations that had not been raised before him.  Second,  Mr  Smart
    drew to my attention the recent Court  of  Appeal  judgment  in  Sarkar
    [2014] EWCA Civ 195.  This case dealt with the issue  with  respect  to
    matters that had not been raised in the Tribunal below.  The  Court  of
    Appeal referred to the judgment in  Kizhakudan  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  566.
    This decided that one error of  law  on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is sufficient to give the Upper Tribunal jurisdiction  to  re-
    make the decision and deal with all the live issues.

11. The Court of Appeal explained that, "the court in that case  held  that
    the Upper Tribunal had a discretion to consider  an  Article  8  claim,
    even though it might not have been properly raised  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal" (para 15).  Mr Smart submitted that this  position  only
    crystallised once there had been a finding of  an  error  of  law.   If
    there was no finding of an error of law then this  Upper  Tribunal  did
    not have the jurisdiction to look at Article 8 considerations.

12. In reply, Mr Ali  referred  to  the  High  Court  judgment  in  MM  and
    explained that this was directly relevant.  He said that this claim was
    not simply about Article 8.  The facts had been  wrongly  appraised  by
    the judge because  the  Appellant  did  have  earnings  above  �18,600.
    Finally, on 19th August 2013, a daughter by the name  of  Balqees,  was
    born to the Appellant in India, and a letter of 21st March  2014,  from
    the Home Office refers to this, upon the application of the  Appellant.
    This was a consideration that should be taken into account.

Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law, such that it falls to be  set
    aside under Section 12(1) of  TCEA  [2007].   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    should have considered Article 8 of its own motion by reason of Section
    6 of the Human Rights Act because this was a "Robinson-obvious"  point.
    Second the judge does not consider the significance to be  attached  to
    the status of the Sponsor as a British citizen,  given  that  this  was
    specifically highlighted by Blake J. in MM [2013] EWHC 1900.

Re-Making the Decision

14. I re-made the decision on the basis of the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.  First,  I
    allow this appeal because in MM [2013] EWHC 1900  Blake  J  held  that,
    "British citizens were in a different class to foreigners generally, as
    they had a constitutional right of residence in their  own  country  as
    well as a human right to  marry,  found  a  family,  and  have  respect
    accorded to their family life" (para 123).  The status of  the  Sponsor
    as a British citizen carries weight.  The Respondent has been unable to
    explain why it is justified to restrict the right of Imtiaz Mohammed to
    be  joined  by  his  wife   from   Pakistan.    Were   an   appropriate
    "justification" to be given,  it  is  certainly  conceivable  that  the
    Respondent could prevent this couple from  living  together.   However,
    none is forthcoming.

15. Second, the evidence shows that the Appellant does succeed on the basis
    of being able to show a gross income of �18,600 because a letter  dated
    7th January 2014 from Foreign Car Spares  Limited  confirmed  that  the
    Appellant was paid a rate of �6.08 per hour from 5th March  2012.   The
    P60 from April 2013 would have a lower figure for this reason.  This is
    a matter that is clearly relevant to Article 8.  Third,  also  relevant
    to Article 8 is the fact that the Appellant's wife has now given  birth
    to a daughter, Balqees.  This is a family unit.  The best interests  of
    the child are served by having access to both parents, not least to the
    breadwinner in the family, who is the sponsoring father of the child.

16. Accordingly, the decision of the Respondent is  an  interference  by  a
    public authority with the exercise of the Appellant's right to  respect
    for family life.  It will have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as  to
    engage the  operation  of  Article  8.   The  interference  is  not  in
    accordance with the law if the Appellant succeeds by being able to show
    a reliance on income above �18,600.  The interference is not  necessary
    in a democratic society.  Finally, the interference is disproportionate
    to the legitimate public end that is sought to be  achieved.   For  all
    these reasons, this appeal is allowed.

Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    allowed.

18. No anonymity order is made.
