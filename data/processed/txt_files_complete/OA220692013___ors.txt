Representation:

For the appellants:    Mr I Hussain, instructed by Syeds Law Office
Solictors
For the respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appellants' appeals against the determination  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Parkes  promulgated  on  9.7.14,  dismissing  their
    linked appeals against the decisions of the respondent, dated  2.12.13,
    to refuse their applications made on 15.11.13 for  entry  clearance  to
    the United Kingdom as the dependants (wife and 3 children) of a Tier  2
    migrant.  The Judge heard the appeal on 20.6.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.8.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Parkes should be set aside.

 5. The refusal decision in relation to  the  first  appellant  noted  that
    whilst a marriage certificate had  been  submitted,  dated  8.1.08  and
    purporting to confirm a marriage taking place on 18.1.95, was  evidence
    that a marriage had been registered, it was insufficient to demonstrate
    that the relationship  is  subsisting  or  that  they  intend  to  live
    together in the UK as each other's spouse.  The  only  evidence  of  an
    ongoing relationship was a photograph said to show the sponsor with the
    appellants. The Entry Clearance Officer  considered  it  reasonable  to
    expect that a relationship dating back to 1995 would  have  accumulated
    numerous items that could be relied on as evidence  of  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship. The first  appellant's  application  was  thus
    refused  and  the  applications  of  the  other  appellants  failed  in
    consequence,  there  being  no  serious  compelling  family  or   other
    considerations making it desirable not to refuse their applications.

 6. Judge Parkes found most of the documentary evidence relied  on  by  the
    appellants to be  unreliable  and  unsatisfactory.  At  �25  the  judge
    reached  the  conclusion  that  the  evidence   was   insufficient   to
    demonstrate that the relationship between the first appellant  and  the
    sponsor was subsisting, citing a lack of evidence of regular contact or
    financial support. The judge also noted that  the  appellants  did  not
    meet the maintenance requirements of the immigration rules. The appeals
    were therefore dismissed.

 7. The grounds of application  for  permission  to  appeal  challenge  the
    manner in which the judge conducted the appeal proceedings in the First-
    tier Tribunal. However, in  the  absence  of  adequate  and  admissible
    evidence, that ground is not made out.

 8. The grounds allege an  error  of  law  on  the  basis  that  the  judge
    addressed issues of maintenance and accommodation requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in the absence of those matters having been raised as
    issues in the refusal decisions.

 9. The grounds also allege that  that  the  reliance  on  maintenance  and
    accommodate issue infected the examination of the evidence  as  to  the
    subsistence of  the  marriage  between  the  first  appellant  and  the
    sponsor.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Molloy  examined  the  refusal
    decisions and considered it arguable that the judge's on  accommodation
    and maintenance issues, not raised by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
    the refusal decisions, were arguable errors of law.

11. As these are out of country appeals, the Tribunal could  only  consider
    the circumstances appertaining at the date of decision, namely 2.12.13.



12. In relation to the judge's reliance on  maintenance,  Mr  Hussain,  who
    appeared at the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  stated  that  the  only
    discussion about finances at the hearing was in relation to the �18,600
    threshold. He  points  out  that  the  appellants  were  not  give  the
    opportunity to  make  submissions  through  him  or  to  call  evidence
    regarding the Tier 2 financial requirements. I note from �13 the  judge
    erroneously referred to the sponsor being a Tier 1  migrant.  In  fact,
    the judge got the financial requirements wrong, as a Tier 2 migrant can
    have maintenance provided by a sponsor and the rates per dependant  are
    different from those cited by the judge.

13. In relation to accommodation, another issue not relied on by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, the judge was  concerned  about  variations  in  the
    Burnley  Road  address,  and  the  discrepancy  between  that   address
    appearing on various documents and the accommodation report address  of
    Normandy Road. It is clear from �20 that the  judge's  concerns  as  to
    accommodation arose after the appeal hearing and thus  Mr  Hussain  was
    not afforded the opportunity to offer an explanation  for  the  alleged
    discrepancies, which  is  given  in  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In   summary,   that
    explanation  is  that  the  sponsor   used   his   work   address   for
    correspondence, not being at home during the day. Whether that is right
    or not, there was no opportunity for that to be addressed  in  evidence
    or by submission at the hearing.

14. In the circumstances, I find that it was unfair for the judge  to  take
    and rely on either of the accommodation and maintenance issues  without
    allowing the appellants' representative to  make  submissions  and,  if
    necessary, call evidence. As it happens, there was  a  serious  factual
    error in relation to the maintenance issue, and  what  may  well  be  a
    misunderstanding about the addresses  used  on  the  various  documents
    adduced in evidence.

15. In the circumstances, the judge's findings at �14 that the appeal could
    not succeed on maintenance grounds cannot stand.  The  judge  does  not
    appear to have reached a conclusion as to the issue  of  accommodation,
    as at  �25  reliance  is  placed  only  on  the  issues  of  subsisting
    relationship and maintenance.

16. The issue next arises as to whether the flawed findings and conclusions
    in relation to maintenance and/or accommodation so adversely affect the
    other and crucial finding, that of subsistence of marriage. Given  that
    at  �24  the  judge  found  the  evidence  "overall"   unreliable   and
    unsatisfactory, so that no weight was accorded to any of the documents,
    it is clear that there has been a degree of overlap  if  not  contagion
    between  the  flawed  findings  and  the  issue   of   subsistence   of
    relationship. In my view it would  be  unfair  and  unsafe  to  try  to
    separate out the flawed findings from what remains. The best and proper
    course is to set the decision aside as a whole and  to  relist  it  for
    rehearing.



Conclusion & Decision:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I reserve the remaking of the decision to myself in  the
                    Upper Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

18. The appeal is to be  relisted  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  at  the  first
    available date, reserved to Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup;

19. The hearing will be a de novo appeal, with no findings preserved;

20. The time estimate for the hearing is 2 hours;

21. The appellants' bundle is badly organised  and  entirely  unacceptable.
    The appellants' representative must compile a new appeal bundle putting
    documents in correct  order  with  simple  pagination  and  index,  and
    provide the same to the Tribunal and serve on the  Secretary  of  State
    not later than 7 days before the adjourned hearing date;

22. An interpreter will be required for the sponsor. If  it  is  not  clear
    from  the  case  file  what  language  is  required,  the   appellants'
    representative should be contacted to clarify.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeals remains to be decided.
