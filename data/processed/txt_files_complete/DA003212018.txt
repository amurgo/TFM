                                SEBASTIAN [G]
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Habtemariam, Anglia Immigration Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made on 28 November 2018 to allow Mr [G]'s  appeal  against  a
    decision to make a deportation order.  That decision was made  pursuant
    to Regulation 23(6)(b) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations"), so the appeal was under those
    regulations.

 2. The respondent has lived in the United  Kingdom  since  2004,  and  has
    worked during that period. It is not in dispute that  he  has  acquired
    the permanent right of residence.

 3. In 2009 the respondent was convicted of possessing a prohibited  weapon
    and tracking a conveyance without  consent  for  which  he  received  a
    community order.   On 13 October 2017 he was convicted  of  downloading
    117 indecent photographs or pseudo  photographs  of  a  child  and  was
    sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and was  made  the  subject  of  a
    sexual harm prevention order.

 4. In his letter of 1 May 2018 setting out  the  reasons  for  making  the
    decision to deport the respondent the Secretary of State explained  why
    it was considered that he did not  qualify for the enhanced  protection
    offered by reg. 27 (4) of the EEA Regulations [16] - [21]; and, that he
    poses a significant and unacceptable risk of harm to  children  in  the
    United Kingdom [35] such that his deportation is justified  on  serious
    grounds of public policy [36]. The Secretary of State  considered  also
    that his removal was proportionate.

 5. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, it was accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State that the appropriate level of test to be applied was
    that of "imperative grounds" as set out in reg. 27 (4). That concession
    is set out at paragraph [3] of the decision and is clearly recorded  in
    the record of proceedings.  The Secretary of State has  not  sought  to
    resile from that concession.

 6. Having noted that concession, the judge directed himself [9]  that  the
    respondent could only be deported on "serious grounds of public  policy
    or public security". He noted [12] that there  was  a  risk  assessment
    recently prepared showing him to be of low risk of harm to the  general
    public and a medium risk of harm to children because of the  nature  of
    the offence [12]; that he had been engaging with Victim Awareness work;
    and was complying with his licence condition.   The  judge  found  [14]
    that the respondent is totally integrated into society  here  and  that
    [15] he did not represent  a  proportionate  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat to the public  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  judge  therefore
    allowed the appeal on that basis.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had erred in concluding that the respondent did not presented
    a sufficiently serious threat in that he had failed  properly  to  take
    into account:

      i) That the respondent was required  to  sign  on  the  Sex  Offenders
         Register for 10 years;

     ii) That the respondent was subject to a Sexual Harm  Prevention  Order
         of an indefinite duration;

    iii) The observation in the OASys report that even if at a low  risk  of
         reoffending, this would present a medium risk of harm to children;

     iv) A concern that the respondent had denied his guilt;

 8. On 31 January 2019 the Upper Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on
    all grounds.

 9. At the hearing Mr Melvin  was  unable  to  identify  the  OASYs  report
    referred to in the grounds.

10. Mr Habtemariam asked us to note the  concession  by  the  Secretary  of
    State that the correct test to be applied in this case was  "imperative
    grounds of public security", and so, although  the  judge  appeared  to
    have erred when he applied the lower "serious grounds of public  policy
    and  public  security",  this  was  not  material  as  the  threat  the
    respondent posed could not on any view  reach  the  high  threshold  of
    imperative grounds.

11. In response, Mr Melvin did not seek to  persuade  us  either  that  the
    concession was incorrect, or that the high threshold was met.

The Law

12. The EEA Regulations provide so far is material:

    'Decisions taken on grounds  of  public  policy,  public  security  and
    public health

    27.  (1) In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
             with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15 except
             on serious grounds of public policy and public security

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
                  in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided
                  for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  adopted
                  by the General Assembly of  the  United  Nations  on  20th
                  November 1989(17).

         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
                  in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided
                  the grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy and public security in relation to a person  ("P")  who
             is resident in the United Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must
             take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
             health, family and economic situation  of  P,  P's  length  of
             residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and  cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom  and  the  extent  of  P's
             links with P's country of origin.

             ...

         (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
             this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society etc.).'

13. We remind ourselves first that categorisation of whether a person falls
    within reg. 27 (4) is a legal categorisation but was, as  is  noted  in
    Lopes v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ  199  at  [40],  that  is  based  on  an
    evaluation of the  facts,  and  thus  was  a  concession  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to make; in any event, this was  not  challenged  in
    the grounds of appeal nor in submissions made to us.

14. It is evident from the case law that the imperative  grounds  threshold
    is high; and, unlike the other tests relates only  to  public  security
    and not public policy.

15. In PI v Oberbï¿½rgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid [2012] EUECJ (C-348/09)
    the court  said this:

         "19. According to the Court, it follows from the wording and scheme
         of Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 that, by subjecting all
         expulsion measures in the cases referred to in that provision to
         the existence of 'imperative grounds' of public security, a concept
         which is considerably stricter than that of 'serious grounds'
         within the meaning of Article 28(2), the European Union legislature
         clearly intended to limit measures based on Article 28(3) to
         'exceptional circumstances', as set out in recital 24 in the
         preamble to that directive (Tsakouridis, paragraph 40).

         20.  The concept of 'imperative grounds of public security'
         presupposes not only the existence of a threat to public security,
         but also that such a threat is of a particularly high degree of
         seriousness, as is reflected by the use of the words 'imperative
         grounds' (Tsakouridis, paragraph 41)."

16. It should be recalled that PI had been convicted of the sexual assault,
    sexual coercion and rape of a minor. The acts which gave rise  to  that
    conviction took place between 1990 and 2001. From  1992,  PI  compelled
    his victim to have sexual intercourse with him or perform other  sexual
    acts on an almost weekly basis by using force and threatening  to  kill
    her mother or brother. The victim of  the  criminal  offences  was  his
    former partner's daughter, who  was  8  years  old  when  the  offences
    commenced. The offences in question are of considerably greater gravity
    than those perpetrated by the respondent.

17. We bear in mind that it is for the Secretary of State to show that  the
    imperative grounds were met. We do not consider, despite how  appalling
    the respondent's crimes are, that the risk he presents, meets that high
    threshold as identified in PI, nor did Mr Melvin seek  to  persuade  us
    that is so.  It is of  note  in  this  context  that  the  most  recent
    probation report states  he  is  a  low  risk  using  the  Active  Risk
    Management tool with is a  risk  assessment  specific  to  male  sexual
    offenders.   It is of note also that in the pre-sentence report in  the
    assessment of the risk of serious harm, no opinion of such  a  risk  is
    stated.

18. Accordingly, for these reasons, we conclude that the Secretary of State
    has not shown the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error of law capable of affecting the outcome.

Summary of Conclusions

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and we uphold it.
