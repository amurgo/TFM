Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs R Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Benfield, instructed by Soma & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Nay Zaw, was born on 11 December  1976  and  is  a  male
    citizen of Burma.  The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Herbert OBE) against a decision of the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    dated 21 May 2013 to refuse him leave to enter the United  Kingdom  for
    settlement as the partner of Yin Mar  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the
    sponsor).  The First-tier Tribunal, in a determination promulgated on 8
    May 2014, had allowed the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Secretary of State now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.
     I shall refer to the respondent as the appellant and to the  appellant
    as the respondent (as they appeared respectively before the  First-tier
    Tribunal).

 2. The First-tier Tribunal had found that the appellant and  sponsor  were
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship; that they  intended  to  live
    together permanently in the United Kingdom; that  the  sponsor  had  an
    income from employment amounting to �16,380 and from self-employment of
    �3,720, thereby meeting the financial requirement of �18,600  over  the
    period required under the Immigration Rules.  The only  issue  in  this
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal was whether the judge was correct  in  law
    in concluding that the income  requirement  had  been  satisfied.   The
    grounds of appeal argue that the appellant had failed  to  satisfy  the
    requirement to provide specified forms of  evidence  of  the  sponsor's
    income as required by Appendix FM: E-ECP.3.1.

 3. The grounds acknowledge that "some of the documentation [required]  had
    been submitted".  It was not clear whether twelve  months  of  payslips
    and bank statements had been provided and it is asserted in the grounds
    that the judge had "not addressed the relevant evidence from  prior  to
    the date of application."

 4. Mrs Pettersen, for the respondent, made oral submissions which differed
    from the grounds of appeal.  She recorded that the judge  had  accepted
    in evidence an HMRC tax return for the tax year April 2012 - April 2013
    and a tax calculation both of which documents had been provided in July
    2013 whereas the application for entry clearance had  been  made  on  1
    April 2013.  She submitted that the judge should  not  have  considered
    that evidence because it had not been  supplied  with  the  application
    itself.

 5. Dealing with that argument first, I accept the oral submissions  of  Ms
    Benfield.  She submitted that this was an appeal where  the  judge  was
    entitled to consider the circumstances appertaining at the date of  the
    immigration decision; this was not an appeal to which Exception 2  (see
    Section 85A(3) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002)
    applies, that is a decision under the "points-based  system"  (PBS)  of
    refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom or to  refuse  to  vary  a
    person's leave to enter or remain (see Section 82(2)(a) and (e) of  the
    2002 Act).  As Ms Benfield pointed out, the relevant tax year  in  this
    application was that occurring immediately prior to  the  date  of  the
    application, namely 2012/2013.  HMRC documents  relating  to  that  tax
    year were not available on 1 April 2013, that is before the end of that
    tax year (5 April  2013).   I  find,  therefore,  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to consider the  HMRC  documents  supplied  by  the  appellant
    notwithstanding the fact that the documents were not provided with  the
    entry clearance application.

 6. Concerning the grounds of appeal, which I have outlined above,  I  find
    that there was no error of law on the part of the First-tier  Tribunal.
    The sponsor had provided unaudited accounts showing a total income from
    employed and self-employed earnings.  She had  supplied  the  HMRC  tax
    return for 2012/2013 together with a tax  calculation.   She  had  also
    provided a self-employed class 2 national insurance contribution letter
    from HMRC dated 30 March 2013.  I note that the First-tier Tribunal  at
    [11] recorded that it was "accepted that the  bank  statements  showing
    those monies paid in had now been supplied."  I  accept  Ms  Benfield's
    submission that the judge had been right to conclude that the documents
    specified in E-ECP.3.1. had been provided  accordingly.  I  agree  also
    with Ms Benfield that there was no need for the  judge  to  go  on  and
    consider Article 8 ECHR having allowed the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules.

 7. In the circumstances, the Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

 8. This appeal is dismissed.
