Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Singer, Counsel,
For the Respondent:    Miss Brocklesby Weller, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of India, date  of  birth  29  December  1989
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 17 November 2014,  to
    cancel continuing leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  worker  on  18
    November 2013.  In addition removal directions were made.

2.   The basis of the Respondent's  decision  was  that  the  Appellant  had
    provided a TOEIC certificate, issued on  28  February  2013,  from  the
    Educational Testing Service (ETS), which had been fraudulently obtained
    through false representations, in an  application  made  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  The certificate provided by  ETS
    related to tests carried out on 16 October 2012 at South Quay  College.
    The matter came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  CJE  Nicholls  (the
    judge) who  on  29  January  2015  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision.  Permission to appeal that decision was given by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison on  20  March  2015.   On  12
    August 2015 I decided that the judge had made a number of errors of law
    in the assessment of all the evidence and the considerations raised  on
    behalf of the Appellant.  I concluded that there was a  material  error
    of law in the lack of adequate and sufficient reasoning.  Accordingly I
    directed that the Original Tribunal decision could not  stand  and  the
    matter would have to be remade in the Upper Tribunal by me.

3.   Directions were given for the Respondent to file evidence  relating  to
    the ETS decision, if advised, no later than six weeks  from  12  August
    2015 and any reply to be provided thereafter.

4.   The Respondent  did  not  lodge  any  information  in  compliance  with
    directions and it was only today (9 October 2015) a copy  of  the  tiny
    extract of the ETS SELT source data was  provided.   Eventually  during
    the  hearing  Miss  Brocklesby-  Weller  submitted  a  further  witness
    statement, dated 9 October 2015, which was  made  by  Darren  Morley  a
    senior caseworker.

5.   When the Appellant was first approached about this matter;  on  seeking
    to enter the United Kingdom he cogently denied any involvement  in  any
    fraud and in particular claimed that he had undertaken the tests.  In a
    screening  interview  and  later  interview  the  same   position   was
    maintained by him.   The  Respondent's  position  was  :-   First,  the
    Respondent received notification from ETS that they  had  assessed  the
    Appellant's speaking test using voice verification software.  Secondly,
    the Appellant had permitted someone to deal with that speaking test  on
    his behalf, in other words by proxy.

6.   No-one knows what documentation or information  was  actually  provided
    to the Home Office by ETS other than now a single printout was provided
    which asserted that the outcome of the test was invalid.  There was  no
    explanation.

7.   The Appellant has argued for a variety of reasons that  there  must  be
    some mistake in the recorded outcomes by ETS insofar as it  applied  to
    him.  The Appellant was adamant that he took and  passed  the  reading,
    writing and listening tests as well as the speaking test.

8.   The ETS printout provides no information as to the basis  on  which  it
    was said that test was invalid.  There is nothing to show on what basis
    the invalidity  was  correctly  coded  into  and  correlated  with  the
    Appellant's certificate number, name, date of birth, nationality,  test
    centre, and test date or the speaking and writing scores.

9.   There is also coded number which asserted a record number of 76910  but
    that does not tie in with  any  other  number  on  any  document.   The
    certificate for the speaking and writing  is  number  0044202171018022.
    The certificate for the listening and  reading  number  741327  on  its
    barcode and with an ID number of 4571473 did not assist  in  explaining
    or understanding the record number.  The certificate for  the  speaking
    and writing score also contains a barcode 744319 but  again  that  does
    not tie in with anything in the ETS printout.

10.  It is to be noted although the Appellant had  vigorously  disputed  any
    fraud by himself in taking the test there has been no further check  of
    the records either to confirm that there is an absence  of  any  coding
    error or alternatively to confirm on what basis  it  was  said  that  a
    different person had undertaken the speaking part of the test.

11.  Although some particulars are given in what is called  "Project  Facade
    Information" it was actually of really very  limited  value  because  I
    cannot tell what numbers of persons took the test or to what extent the
    tests identified as invalid or questionable, which total about  56,000,
    reflected upon the total number of tests carried out and to what extent
    tests were found to be valid.  The Project  Facade  document  therefore
    only gives  very  limited  information  concerning  either  invalid  or
    questionable outcomes of the tests.  The value of  the  evidence,  such
    evidence in the First-tier, is really no more or less than a report  by
    a Mr Milligan or a Miss Collings of the  Home  Office  who  essentially
    attend upon ETS.  They essentially repeat the processes that  ETS  were
    said to follow.  Ultimately I have no direct knowledge of the  validity
    of the tests or the reliability of those who carry out the audio checks
    or data processing.  Similarly the latest statement of Mr Morley simply
    repeated the sources of relating to the claimed fraud by the Appellant.
     Since the allegation was of fraud it is clear that the burden of proof
    was upon the Respondent to  show  with  cogent  evidence  that  on  the
    balance of probabilities the likelihood  was  that  the  test  was  not
    undertaken by the Appellant.

12.  Mr Singer advanced a number of arguments in short as follows;-   First,
    what incentive did the Appellant have to make a false statement in  his
    personal circumstances?  Secondly, he had  undertaken  and  obtained  a
    third class degree in Business Studies at a UK  recognised  university.
    Thirdly, he had a satisfactory immigration history  and  there  was  no
    background basis for  him  to  misrepresent  his  academic  skills  and
    achievements.  Fourthly, at the time these matters were being raised it
    is not suggested that the Appellant  was  not  able  to  understand  or
    address issues raised.  It was not therefore a case after the event  of
    improvements made with the passage of time from the date or  after  the
    date of the Respondent's decision.

13.  Fifthly, the Appellant had answered clearly  and  without  equivocation
    questions about the conduct of the test, how matters were arranged  and
    in those matters the Appellant was a confident  and  accurate  witness.
    Sixthly, therefore the only evidence was one strip  of  printout  which
    may or may not accurately reflect the circumstances of  the  Appellant.
    No-one provided evidence to show the likelihood was that the coding  in
    of the Appellant's name and particulars was correct.

14.  I did not find that the additional information from Mr Morley  assisted
    this matter. Essentially the evidence as provided by  Mr  Milligan  and
    Miss Collings really  does  not  get  to  grips  with  identifying  the
    likelihood of the printout strip being accurate.

15.  In the  circumstances  I  was  not  satisfied  that  the  evidence  was
    sufficient, as indeed has been assessed in the Upper Tribunal, to  show
    that there was fraud.  On the  face  of  it  absent  of  some  reliable
    evidence to support the possibility that the Appellant was involved  in
    misrepresenting and allowing a proxy to  take  the  test,  I  find  the
    allegation has not been established on a prima facie  basis  let  alone
    balance of probabilities.

16.  I therefore find, absent any other information against the  Appellant's
    credibility, the Respondent's decision was not in accordance  with  the
    law.

17.  The original Tribunal's decision cannot stand.  The following  decision
    is substituted.  The appeal of the Appellant is allowed.

Anonymity

No anonymity order is necessary or appropriate.

APPEAL AWARD

Given the absence of evidence and the opportunity  of  the  Respondent  over
more than one year to properly investigate this matter and provide  evidence
to support the decision I find that a fee award, in the sum  of  ï¿½140  paid,
should be made.
