Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 24  January  2017,  dismissing  his
    asylum appeal.

 2. It is common ground that the appellant is a citizen of Sudan,  that  he
    was recognised as a refugee in Kenya, and that if the issue was  return
    to Sudan, rather than to Kenya, he would be entitled to recognition  as
    a refugee in the UK.

 3. The grounds are rather over-lengthy.  Their essence is that  the  judge
    "adopted the wrong burden and standard of proof, above  the  reasonable
    degree of likelihood", in failing to recognise the following: in  Kenya
    the appellant was permitted to reside  only  in  Kakuma  UNHCR  refugee
    camp; the government  intended  to  close  refugee  camps  on  national
    security grounds; there was a risk of refoulment to  Sudan;  conditions
    in the camp infringed article 3 of the ECHR; the appellant would not be
    permitted to re-enter Kenya; if he was permitted to do so, he would not
    be able to relocate to avoid real risk, or undue harshness.

 4. At  �38  of  his  decision  the  judge  said  that  "life  may  not  be
    particularly comfortable for refugees in the Kakuma camp", but that was
    not a reason to grant asylum.  The judge granting permission to  appeal
    observed that might imply that the judge  had  not  applied  the  lower
    standard of proof on which he directed himself at  �4.   That  was  not
    specifically part of the grounds and Ms Loughran (rightly, in my  view)
    did not adopt the suggestion as part  of  her  submissions.   The  only
    sensible construction is that the judge (rightly or  wrongly)  did  not
    find difficulties in the camp to reach as high as article  3  or  undue
    harshness.

 5. Ms Loughran submitted that as the appellant was acknowledged  to  be  a
    refugee, the test for conditions  elsewhere  was  undue  harshness,  as
    defined in Januzi.  She said that there was no case on the point.

 6. The issue is not one of  relocation  within  the  country  of  possible
    persecution. I think that the tests would be risk or persecution or  of
    ill-treatment at the level of article 3, which is equivalent,  not  the
    different and somewhat lower test of undue harshness.  I do  not  think
    the point is a decisive one, as the outcome would be the same,  on  the
    evidence, by either test.

 7. Ms Loughran made her submissions by careful reference to  the  evidence
    which was before  the  FtT  about  conditions  in  the  camps  and  the
    intentions of the Kenyan authorities.  It is sufficient to record  that
    none of it disclosed that conditions, although difficult,  reached  the
    thresholds such as to require the judge to have found that a  need  for
    international protection outside Kenya  was  disclosed.   Nor  did  the
    evidence show that the Kenyan authorities, although they had considered
    the matter, had made the ultimate decision, or  taken  any  action,  to
    expel refugees from Kenya.

 8. Parties were not aware of  any  subsequent  evidence  that  the  Kenyan
    authorities had taken a decision to  expel,  or  conducted  expulsions,
    matters which might be expected to become rapidly and widely known; but
    in any event, that would be a foundation for a fresh claim, rather than
    a finding of error on a point of law by the judge.

 9. The appellant's solicitors had written to the Kenyan authorities  about
    his re-entry, and he had been to the  Kenyan  Embassy.   There  was  no
    response to the letter,  and  nothing  illuminating  emerged  from  the
    appellant's evidence about his visit.  If the  respondent  proceeds  to
    attempt  to  remove  the  appellant  to  Kenya,  and  that   encounters
    difficulties, other issues may emerge; but  that  is  for  the  future.
    There is nothing to show that the judge erred by failing to find that a
    case of refusal of re-entry had been established.

10. The judge did not get the burden of proof wrong.  There  was  no  issue
    between the parties in that matter.

11. The judge did not get the standard of proof  wrong.   The  grounds  use
    that heading as a way of dressing up disagreement on the facts.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
