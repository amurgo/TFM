Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr  R  O'Ryan,  Counsel  instructed  by  Jackson  &
                       Canter, Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen  of  Cameroon,  appeals  with  leave  of  the
      Tribunal against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr  K  S  Levin)
      dismissing her appeal against the decision of the respondent  made  on
      10 February 2003 to refuse to vary her leave to enter  and  to  refuse
      her asylum.

2.    The appellant arrived in the UK on 20 August 2002 and was granted  six
      months leave to enter as a visitor, which was to expire on 20 February
      2003.  She claimed asylum on 12 December 2002.

3.    The Adjudicator rejected the main plank of her claim  that  after  she
      came to the United Kingdom she heard from her husband in Cameroon that
      their home had been raided by security services who had  seized  files
      and her computer disc detailing  the  crimes  and  breaches  of  human
      rights abuses of the authorities in  Cameroon.   A  warrant  had  been
      issued for her arrest in Cameroon.  She had been warned by her husband
      and other people to stay away from Cameroon.   The  Tribunal  did  not
      grant leave on the Adjudicator's rejection of that claim.

4.    The facts of her claim accepted  by  the  Adjudicator  were  that  the
      appellant was a university graduate in history and political  science.
      She had taken a keen interest  in  politics  and  worked  for  an  NGO
      working for the empowerment of women and fighting against poverty. She
      was an Anglophone and a member of the  Southern  Cameroonian  National
      Council (SCNC).  It was reasonably likely that  the  appellant  was  a
      member of the Southern Cameroonian Youth  League  (SCYI).   Leave  was
      granted for the Tribunal to consider whether the appellant would be at
      real risk on return as a member of the SCNC, who would  be  likely  to
      resume her involvement with that party.

5.    Counsel referred us to the appellant's activities  on  behalf  of  the
      SCNC, which are set out in her statement at Annex B of the Home Office
      bundle.   At paragraph 12 the appellant stated as follows:

           "My involvement and total commitment to  the  Southern  Cameroon
           National Council stems from all  these  events.   I  pledged  my
           membership in 1999 and  since  then  have  offered  my  services
           unconditionally to the cause  I  believe  in.   Being  a  social
           worker I, amongst other things, offered my  services  to  fellow
           Anglophones.   We  give  lectures  on  social  skills,   poverty
           alienation schemes.  We also look after fellow members  who  are
           detained and offer moral support to  their  families.   All  the
           activities of the SCNC are public and non-violent,  and  nothing
           that I have done has been secret."


      At paragraph 14 she said:

           "With these commitments, I quickly posed as a true  patriot  and
           soldier to the cause.  With the permission of  the  Chairman,  (
                  ), me and my team of twenty people were trusted with  the
           whereabouts of many on the run; kept records and files of crimes
           against humanity on fellow  Southern  Cameroons,  at  the  scene
           pictures of tortures, eye witness  and  first  hand  reports  of
           unfair trials; things La Republique would  do  anything  to  get
           hold of."


      At paragraph 15 she said:

           "All this went on without La Republique putting an eye on me and
           I fought passionately with all my brains and strength to see the
           Anglophones out completely  despite  the  bumpy  road  to  total
           independence; especially as the  present  regime  considers  the
           SCNC as a secessionist group, and according to their law  it  is
           high treason against the state."


      At paragraph 16 she said:

           "I  participated  actively  in  meetings,  conferences,  protest
           marches and also took part in the National Day Celebration  that
           is the 1st October."


6.    Counsel submitted that the appellant was an activist in the  light  of
      the activities she engaged in.  He accepted that these activities  did
      not bring her to the attention of the authorities in  Cameroon.    The
      issue for the  Tribunal  is  if  the  appellant  were  to  resume  her
      activities on return to Cameroon,  is  there  a  real  risk  that  the
      activities will bring her to the  attention  of  the  authorities  and
      therefore lead to her being ill-treated.   In  order  to  answer  this
      question Counsel took us to the objective evidence.

7.    Counsel did not place any  reliance  on  the  statement  issued  by  (
      )on 30 July 2004 in support of the appellant's appeal.  (       )  had
      said that he was a journalist and served as  a  TV  presenter/reporter
      for the Cameroon Radio Television Corporation from September  1995  to
      October 2001.  He joined the SCNC in 1996.   He entered  the  UK  from
      Dï¿½sseldorf in January 2002 and was granted leave  to  remain  in  June
      2002.

8.    We accept from the  objective  evidence  drawn  to  our  attention  by
      Counsel that the human rights situation in Cameroon is extremely  poor
      and is  especially  detrimental  to  the  most  vulnerable  groups  of
      society, such as women.  The USSD Report of 31 March 2003 stated  that
      security  forces  committed  numerous  unlawful  killings   and   were
      responsible  for  disappearances.   They  also  tortured,   beat   and
      otherwise abused detainees and  prisoners,  generally  with  impunity.
      Amnesty International in their report covering events from January  to
      December 2002 also reiterated the point that security forces continued
      to ill treat criminal suspects, political  activists  and  members  of
      ethnic minorities in police stations.  The  Country  Report  on  Human
      Rights Practices - 2002 also  stated  that  members  of  the  security
      forces continued to  commit  numerous  serious  human  rights  abuses.
      Numerous international human  rights  organisations  and  some  prison
      personnel reported that torture was widespread.

9.    We now look at the objective situation in relation  to  SCNC  members.
      According to Amnesty International in  their  report  covering  events
      from January to December 2002, members of the SCNC were  arrested  and
      detained without trial for weeks.  The authorities continued to target
      English-speaking activists in the South West and North West Provinces.
       Throughout the year at least ten members of the  SCNC  were  arrested
      and detained without charge for  weeks.   Shiynyuy  Georges,  an  SCNC
      activist, was arrested on 10 September in the North West Province  and
      severely  beaten  by  the  gendarmerie.   He  died   in   custody   on
      16 September.  No investigation into the death was known to have taken
      place by the end of the year.  According to  the  USSD  Report  of  31
      March 2003, on 27 September  police  arrested  human  rights  activist
      Albert Mugong and nineteen other SCNC activists in  Mamfe  to  prevent
      them from taking any action on 1 October, the date associated with the
      Anglophone Independence Movement.  They were released  on  22  October
      pending trial on sedition charges. There were no developments  in  the
      2001 arrest of fifty demonstrators and three men from Jayiri following
      the October SCNC demonstrations.

10.   The USSD Report also says that there was  a  ban  on  SCNC  activities
      from 28 September to 10 October in  the  North  West  and  South  West
      Provinces.   Security forces disrupted attempts by the  SCNC  to  hold
      demonstrations on 1 October in Bamenda and Mamfe.

11.   The report of the Fact Finding Mission  to  Cameroon  from  17  to  25
      January 2004 states at  paragraph  3.8  that  the  SCNC  informed  the
      delegation that  many  of  its  members  are  harassed,  followed  and
      occasionally beaten by the Government security forces because of their
      alliance.   The SCNC are suppressed by the government and are  offered
      bribes to keep quiet about their objectives.  At 3.14 Jack Franquin, a
      representative of the UNHCR in Cameroon, stated that although  in  the
      past  particularly  groups  have   suffered   persecution   by   state
      authorities within the country, this is no longer the  case.   In  the
      past members of the SCNC have faced harassment and  inhuman  treatment
      by the police.  For example between 1999  and  2001  there  were  some
      clashes between SCNC members and the police and  some  SCNC  activists
      were jailed for their behaviour. However, the source  was  unaware  of
      any SCNC activists still in prison today.

12.   The Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2003 stated  that  on  17
      May the Sub-Prefect of the South West Provincial city of Tiko  ordered
      the arrest and detention of activists of SCNC.   The activists who had
      been attending the funeral of former SCNC Chairman Martin Nkeka  Luma,
      were  released  without  charge  after  several  days.    The   report
      highlighted arrests of SCNC activists in 2002 but  who  were  released
      and were awaiting trial.  The report also stated that  the  government
      held  political  prisoners,  including  Anglophones.   The  government
      permitted regular access to international  humanitarian  organisations
      to visit political prisoners in several prisons.

13.   Amnesty International in their report of 2004 stated that  members  of
      the SCNC serving lengthy prison terms were not granted  the  right  to
      appeal.   Political activity  by  opposition  parties,  repression  by
      government  and  security  officials  increased  in  the  run  up   to
      presidential elections in 2004.  In  April  Patrick  Mbuwe,  a  former
      secretary of the SCNC was shot by men in civilian  clothes  and  later
      died in hospital.  Local sources suspected that  the  assailants  were
      members of the security forces.  Members  of  the  SCNC  sentenced  to
      lengthy prison terms in 1999 continued to  await  a  decision  by  the
      Minister of Defence on their right to appeal against their convictions
      and sentences.

14.   These reports show that there is harassment of  SCNC  activists.   The
      reports also show that although they are arrested and  detained,  they
      are generally released pending trial.   What  the  evidence  does  not
      indicate is that mere membership of the SCNC  is  likely  to  lead  to
      persecution.

15.   We now apply the background evidence to the appellant's claim.

16.   The appeal was argued on the basis that the respondent was  likely  to
      resume her political activities were she to be returned  to  Cameroon,
      and consequently was likely to be persecuted.   In our opinion we were
      being asked to speculate what the appellant was likely to  do  on  her
      return to Cameroon.  We are unable to make such a speculative finding.
      There is no evidence that at the  hearing  before  the  appellant  was
      asked whether she intended to resume her political activities were she
      to be removed to Cameroon.  In her rebuttal  witness  statement  of  7
      January 2004 the appellant said at paragraph 13  that  since  she  has
      been in the UK she has continued to pledge her support for  the  SCNC.
      On 6 November 2003 she took part in a celebration of Southern Cameroon
      Independence Day, which was held in front of the  Cameroonian  Embassy
      in London.  An official came out of the Embassy and took  pictures  of
      all the demonstrators.   They had placards and she  feared  that  this
      may further incriminate her.  The demonstration was peaceful.  In  our
      opinion one demonstration is not an indicator that the  appellant  has
      been an active political supporter of the SCNC since  her  arrival  in
      the United Kingdom on 20 August 2002.   The fact that an official came
      out of the Embassy and took pictures of all the demonstrators does not
      of itself indicate that the appellant is likely to  be  identified  by
      the authorities in Cameroon as a political activist.

17.   We have taken account of the  appellant's  political  activities  when
      she was in Cameroon.  Her evidence was that  all  the  activities  she
      undertook on behalf of  the  SCNC  were  public  and  non-violent  and
      nothing that she did was secret.  Yet she did not come to the  adverse
      attention of the authorities.  Indeed, she said at paragraph 15 of her
      statement of 22 January 2003 that all her activities went  on  without
      La Republique putting an eye on her.  This means that she was  not  of
      any interest to the authorities as  a  consequence  of  her  political
      activities.  That evidence also means that  she  was  not  seen  as  a
      political  activist  by  the  authorities.     The   Adjudicator   had
      disbelieved  her  evidence  on  which  her  asylum  claim  was  based.
      Therefore, were she to be returned to Cameroon today, and  did  resume
      her  political  activities,  we  find  that  there  is  no  reasonable
      likelihood of the appellant being persecuted for a  Convention  reason
      or being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.

18.   Her appeal is dismissed.
