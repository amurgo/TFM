Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A. Corban of Corban Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A. Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the  respondent's  decision  dated  29  January
    2016 to refuse to issue a residence card recognising a derivative right
    of residence as the primary carer of  a  self-sufficient  EEA  national
    child (a 'Chen' child) with  reference  to  regulation  15A(2)  of  The
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the   EEA
    Regulations 2006").

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hanley ("the judge")  dismissed  the  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on 10 May 2017. The judge found the appellant
    to be an "unhelpful and evasive witness" [67].  He  was  not  satisfied
    that she had given a truthful account of the nature and  the  level  of
    contact that she has with the children's Spanish father.  Although  the
    judge accepted that Mr [G] was  likely  to  be  the  children's  father
    because his name was included on their birth certificates, he  did  not
    accept the appellant's claim that he no longer had any  involvement  in
    the children's lives [67].  The appellant contacted him  to  provide  a
    witness statement in support of the  appeal,  but  no  information  was
    provided in the statement to explain  the  nature  and  extent  of  his
    contact with the children [68]. The judge accepted that Mr [G]  was  in
    Spain when the statement was certified by a notary, but given the  fact
    that the appellant's 'uncle's' wife was living in Spain,  he  concluded
    that there were family connections there, and for that reason, he could
    not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr [G] "is not in
    the UK, nor that his permanent home is in Spain." [69].

3.    The judge rejected the appellant's claim to be  a  primary  carer  for
    the children because he was not satisfied that she  had  been  truthful
    about her family circumstances  (regulation  15A(2)(a))  [73].  It  was
    accepted that the children are Spanish  nationals  who  were  under  18
    years old (regulation 15A(2)(b)(i)) [71]. He was not satisfied that the
    children were self-sufficient because the main evidence of support came
    from the appellant's 'cousin', Mr Prince  [I].  The  evidence  did  not
    support his claim that he provided the appellant and the children  with
    financial support of �450 a month (regulation 15A(2)(b)(ii)) [75].

4.    In  relation  to  the  final  part  of  the  requirements,  the  judge
    concluded that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the
    children would be unable  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  if  the
    appellant was required to leave (regulation 15A(2)(b)(iii)). The  judge
    found that her reliance on the case of Ruiz Zambrano  [2011]  EUECJ  C-
    34/09 was "misplaced" because Mr [I] said that he would be  willing  to
    look after the children if necessary and because  there  had  been  "no
    real explanation as to why the children cannot live with  their  father
    wherever he is living." [74].

5.    The grounds of appeal  were  poorly  pleaded.  They  outlined  general
    disagreements with the decision without particularising  the  arguments
    within the proper context of European law. Mr Corban's oral submissions
    tended towards general submissions on the facts of the case rather than
    focussing on whether the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  involved  the
    making of an error of  law.  However,  the  Tribunal  identified  three
    grounds of appeal from the written arguments, which Mr Corban agreed at
    the hearing.

      i) The First-tier Tribunal findings relating to the whereabouts of the
         children's father were outside a range of reasonable  responses  to
         the evidence and/or the judge failed to give adequate  reasons  for
         his findings.


     ii) The judge erred in  finding  that  Mr  [I]  could  look  after  the
         children and failed to consider the best interests of the  children
         and section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
         2009.


    iii) The First-tier Tribunal's finding  that  the  appellant  failed  to
         discharge the burden of proof to show that the children were  self-
         sufficient was not consistent with the evidence.

6.    The  Upper  Tribunal  granted  permission  because  it  was  at  least
    arguable that the judge made assumptions about the whereabouts  of  the
    children's father that were not supported  by  evidence.  It  was  also
    arguable that the judge's finding  that  Mr  [I]  could  care  for  the
    children failed to consider (i) whether he was  a  suitable  person  to
    care for the children; and (ii) the best interests of the children.

Decision and reasons

7.    Mr Corban's submissions did not assist us  in  assessing  whether  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error of law. As
    we have already noted, he made general submissions about the  facts  of
    the case and appeared unable to make any clear arguments in relation to
    the relevant principles of European law  except  to  repeatedly  insist
    that it was not in the interests of the children to be forced to  leave
    the UK.

8.    Nevertheless, we have considered the First-tier Tribunal  decision  in
    detail to assess whether it involved the making of an error of law that
    might have been material to the outcome of the appeal.

9.     Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  accepted  that  the  respondent's  duty  under
    section 55 to consider the welfare of children in  the  UK  extends  to
    decisions made under European law. She also  accepted  that  the  judge
    erred in finding that Mr [I] was an appropriate person to care for  the
    children without further analysis of whether he could do so and it  was
    in the best interests of the children. However,  she  argued  that  the
    error was not material because there was no evidence to show  that  the
    children would be forced to leave the territory of the EU because  they
    both had the right to reside in Spain. Even if the children's father is
    resident in Spain,  the  appellant  was  not  divorced  and  previously
    resided in Spain. The appellant and the children could live  in  Spain.
    She argued that the principles outlined in Zambrano did not apply.  Any
    errors in the  judge's  findings  would  not  have  made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of the appeal. The judge's findings  relating
    to self-sufficiency were open to him on the evidence.

Findings relating to 'self-sufficiency'

10.   The  ground  of  appeal  outlined  in  the  original  application  for
    permission to appeal made to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  asserted  that
    there was evidence to  show  that  the  children  were  self-sufficient
    without addressing any of the reasons given by the judge for  rejecting
    this aspect of the case. Mr Corban was unable to expand on the  general
    assertion made in the grounds when asked to do so at the hearing.

11.   We are satisfied that the judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  finding
    that Mr [I] was not able to provide  the  claimed  level  of  financial
    support to the appellant and her children [75]. He noted that Mr  [I]'s
    claim to provide the appellant with �450 a month was inconsistent  with
    his income and the evidence of limited resources in his  bank  account.
    Given his doubts  about  the  credibility  of  the  appellant  and  her
    witness, it was open to the judge  to  place  little  weight  on  other
    evidence produced in support of the appeal  from  people  who  did  not
    attend to give evidence.

12.   The requirement for a child to  be  self-sufficient  is  an  essential
    element of regulation 15A(2). If the judge's findings relating to self-
    sufficiency do not disclose an error of law it matters not  whether  he
    made any errors in relation  to  the  other  issues  e.g.  whether  the
    appellant was a primary carer or the  children  would  be  required  to
    leave the UK. All the elements of regulation 15A(2) must  be  satisfied
    for the appellant to acquire a derivative right  of  residence  as  the
    primary carer of a 'Chen child'.

Findings relating to the whereabouts of the children's father

13.   We agree that the judge did not make clear findings as to whether  the
    children's father was likely to be resident in Spain or  the  UK.  This
    was relevant to the issue of whether the  appellant  was  the  'primary
    carer' of the children for the purpose of regulation 15A(2)(a).

14.   Having accepted that there was evidence to show that  Mr  [G]  was  in
    Spain when the witness statement was certified by a notary,  the  judge
    failed to give adequate reasons to explain  why  thought  he  might  be
    living in the UK. The only reason appeared to be that  there  was  some
    "family connection" between Spain and the UK, but this hardly explained
    how or why this suggested that Mr [G] might be living in the UK. It  is
    difficult to see  why  the  appellant  would  apply  for  a  derivative
    residence card if her estranged husband was exercising rights  of  free
    movement in the UK. It would be far easier to  apply  for  a  residence
    card as a 'family member'.

15.   Although we find that the judge failed to make a  clear  finding,  and
    failed to give adequate reasons for his findings regarding the father's
    whereabouts, we conclude that  this  error  would  not  have  made  any
    material difference to the outcome  of  the  appeal.  The  judge  heard
    evidence from the appellant. It was open to him to find that she was an
    "unhelpful and evasive  witness".  The  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
    appellant to show that she was the primary carer of  the  EEA  national
    children. It was open to the judge to  find  that  she  had  failed  to
    produce sufficient reliable evidence of  her  family  circumstances  to
    satisfy the requirements of regulation 15A(2)(a). The  outcome  of  the
    appeal would, in any event, have been  the  same  because  the  judge's
    findings relating to self-sufficiency  under  regulation  15A(2)(b)(ii)
    were sustainable (see above).

Findings relating to alternative care in the UK

16.   We also accept that the judge  erred  in  finding  that  the  children
    could live with Mr [I] on the sole ground that he agreed to look  after
    them. Consideration should have been given to  (i)  whether  he  was  a
    suitable carer; (ii) whether he was able to care for the children given
    the judge's findings regarding his resources; and (iii) whether it  was
    in the best interests of  the  children  to  be  separated  from  their
    mother. Given the consequences of such a finding the interests  of  the
    children were a primary consideration albeit they  must  be  considered
    within the context of existing EU law  principles:  see  Patel  v  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 2028.

17.   However, for the reasons outlined above,  the  error  would  not  have
    made any material difference to the outcome of the appeal. The issue of
    whether the children would be  unable  to  remain  in  the  UK  if  the
    appellant was required to leave is relevant to  the  test  outlined  in
    regulation  15A(2)(b)(iii).  If  the  appellant   failed   to   produce
    sufficient evidence to show  that  the  children  were  self-sufficient
    within the meaning of EU law the appeal would have  been  dismissed  in
    any event.

 'Zambrano' issues

18.   The appellant might have had an alternative strand of  argument  under
    EU law even if she failed to show that  she  met  the  requirements  of
    regulation 15A(2). The principles outlined in Zambrano are  wider  than
    the test set out in regulation  15A(2)(b)(iii),  which  only  considers
    whether the children would have to leave the UK.  However,  to  succeed
    with reference to the principles outlined in  Zambrano,  the  appellant
    would have to show that the children would be compelled  to  leave  the
    area of the EU.

19.   Even if the judge had taken the appellant's evidence at  its  highest,
    the children's father was living in Spain. The appellant is  separated,
    but not divorced. As Spanish citizens the children would be entitled to
    live in Spain. Apart from general assertions about the  best  interests
    of the children, no evidence appears to have been adduced to show  that
    it would contrary to the interests of the children to  live  in  Spain.
    The appellant failed to produce any evidence to show the nature or  the
    extent of the relationship the children had with their father.

20.   The appellant failed to produce any evidence to show  that  she  would
    not qualify for residence in Spain following her  separation  from  the
    children's father. Even if  the  children's  father  was  unwilling  or
    unable to look after the children, the appellant failed  to  show  that
    she would not be able to obtain a  derivative  right  of  residence  in
    Spain on Zambrano principles. In short, the appellant failed to produce
    sufficient evidence even to engage the possibility  that  the  children
    might be compelled to leave the area of the EU. In such  circumstances,
    it was open to the judge to conclude that her reliance on Zambrano  was
    misplaced "because there has been no real explanation  as  to  why  the
    children cannot live with their father wherever he is living" [74].

Conclusion

21.   For the reasons given above, we  find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision relating to self-sufficiency  under  regulation  15A(2)(b)(ii)
    was sustainable. Any errors relating to the judge's  findings  relating
    to the whereabouts of the children's father and alternative care in the
    UK were not material because the appellant was unable  to  satisfy  all
    the requirements of regulation 15A(2). It was  open  to  the  judge  to
    conclude that insufficient evidence had been  produced  to  engage  the
    Zambrano principles.

22.   We conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve  the
    making of a material error of law.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making  of  a  material
error of law

The decision shall stand
