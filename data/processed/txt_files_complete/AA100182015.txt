                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision of Judge A Khawar of the  First-
    tier Tribunal which was promulgated on 26th July 2016. The appellant is
    a national of Albania whose date of birth 28th April 1975.  She  has  a
    dependent son who is also Albanian and whose date of birth is 25th July
    2010.

The basis of the Appellant's claim

2.   The appellant claimed to have left Albania in March  2014  and  arrived
    in  the  United  Kingdom  illegally  on  22nd  April  2014.   She   was
    subsequently served with notice as an illegal entrant in June  2014  at
    which point she applied for asylum with her son as her  dependent.  The
    applicant's asylum claim related to a fear of  both  ill-treatment  and
    trafficking from her former partner.  The  applicant  lived  in  Durres
    which is located in the north of Albania.  She has five  brothers,  two
    of whom live out of Albania. She is educated to  university  level  and
    taught English at elementary school between 2007 and 2009. In 2009  she
    began a hotel tourism business with her ex-partner and with one of  her
    brothers. The brother now runs this business.

3.   The appellant maintains that her ex-partner is Kosovan and  that,  when
    they were together in Albania, he began to take  drugs  and  to  invite
    girls back to a hotel. In 2011 her ex-partner took money from  her  and
    left. There was also  a  dispute  with  the  appellant's  brother.  The
    appellant claims that in 2011 her ex-partner threatened her with a  gun
    as he wanted her and their son to go with him to Kosovo. The  appellant
    stood her ground and said that she would not go. She sent her son to  a
    private  school  and  they  did  not  go  out  freely.   The  appellant
    thereafter sought custody of her son and an Albanian court granted  her
    custody in May 2013. Although there is no evidence of this court  order
    it has not been challenged by the respondent.

4.   The appellant maintains that in February 2014 her ex-partner found  out
    about the outcome of the family court proceedings, came to Albania  and
    used emotional blackmail to force her and her son to visit his  parents
    whom he claimed were missing  their  grandchild.  Once  in  Kosovo  the
    appellant and her son and stayed for one night  with  her  ex-partner's
    parents. The next day the appellant's ex-partner took  her  to  a  flat
    where she was raped and then brought to an older  man  who  also  raped
    her.  The appellant  claims  that  she  overheard  her  ex-partner  and
    friends discussing the trafficking of women and she believed that  they
    intended to traffic her too. She was stressed and began  to  bleed  and
    became unconscious and her ex-partner took her to a hospital from where
    she was able to telephone her father in Albania. The  appellant  claims
    that three to four hours later her  father  and  two  of  her  brothers
    arrived in the hospital in Kosovo  and  they  then  took  her  back  to
    Albania having collected her son from his  paternal  grandparents.  The
    appellant believed her ex-partner wants to kidnap her son because other
    Kosovans in Durres told this to her older  brother.   She  additionally
    maintains that her younger brother had left the hospital with  her  ex-
    partner and had not been seen since. The  appellant  asserts  that  she
    went to the police in Albania  and  an  officer  who  knew  her  father
    advised her to leave the country.




The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellant was not legally represented at  the  hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. The judge did not  find  the  appellant's  account
    credible. The judge drew an adverse inference from the absence  of  any
    stamp or entry or exit endorsement on the appellant's passport relating
    to her travel to Kosovo in February/March 2014 and her return later  in
    March of that year. The judge noted the  explanation  provided  by  the
    appellant for the absence of any entry/exit stamp,  which  included  an
    assertion that she did not have time to get the passport, but also  her
    claim that the border between Albania and Kosovo was  porous  and  that
    one could bribe a border guard with the payment of  the  equivalent  of
    ï¿½3.  The judge did not find this plausible and noted the absence of any
    evidence from the  appellant's  father  or  older  brother.  The  judge
    assumed that if they had travelled across the border there  would  have
    been endorsements in their passports.

6.    The  judge  additionally  found  the  appellant's  account  of   being
    emotionally  blackmailed  to   be   implausible   and   noted   further
    inconsistencies in her account relating to the period of time that  she
    expected to remain in Kosovo and her use of a telephone (the  appellant
    claiming in oral evidence that she did not have a telephone with her in
    Kosovo but in her witness statement she said that  the  ex-partner  had
    smashed her phone in Kosovo).  Having regard to these factors the judge
    concluded that the appellant was not credible and dismissed the appeal.



Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal and Discussion

7.   The grounds identified two issues in respect of which  it  was  claimed
    the judge had materially erred in law. Mr McGann, who  represented  the
    appellant at the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, expanded upon  both
    those grounds. The first related to whether the judge properly  applied
    the correct standard of proof. This centres  on  paragraph  40  of  the
    judge's decision. This paragraph reads:

         "The cumulative effect  of  all  the  serious  causes  for  concern
         however is such as to cause me to conclude that the  appellant  has
         failed to submit satisfactory evidence to establish,  even  to  the
         standard of a reasonable degree of probability,  that  her  factual
         account is true. I therefore make a finding of credibility  adverse
         to the appellant in respect of the entirety of her account  and  in
         particular I do not accept that she is a victim of trafficking."


8.   Mr McGann has focused his submissions on the term "a reasonable  degree
    of probability". He maintains that this is indicative of a  failure  by
    the judge to apply the lower standard of proof, alternatively, that  it
    is insufficiently clear that the judge has applied the  lower  standard
    of proof applicable in protection claims  (general  accepted  as  being
    whether there is a reasonable likelihood or real  risk  of  persecution
    being established). It is unfortunate that the judge has used the  term
    "reasonable degree of probability". However, having regard to  the  use
    of this term in the sentence in which it appears, and in the context of
    the references to the standard of proof in the decision as a  whole,  I
    am not persuaded that the judge has applied  anything  other  than  the
    lower standard of proof. In paragraph 40  the  judge  stated  that  the
    appellant failed to submit satisfactory evidence to  establish,  "even"
    to the 'standard of the reasonable degree  of  probability',  that  her
    account was true. The use of the word "even" in such close proximity to
    the disputed term connotes a lower requirement than the civil  standard
    and suggests that the  standard  actually  applied  by  the  judge  was
    different to the civil standard of  proof.  I  am  reinforced  in  this
    conclusion by reference to the  decision  considered  as  a  whole.  At
    paragraph 23 the judge correctly indicated that the  appellant  had  to
    show a 'real risk' of the incidence of serious harm to her, 'real risk'
    clearly being the lower standard of proof. In the  same  paragraph  the
    judge goes on to state  that  the  appellant  has  to  establish  to  a
    'reasonable  degree  of  likelihood'  that  her   professed   fear   of
    persecution for a Convention reason was well-founded.  In  my  judgment
    this is the test that the judge  had  in  mind  when  he  inadvertently
    interposed the word 'probability' for that  of  'likelihood'.  Then  in
    paragraph 25, in relation to human rights issues, the judge talks about
    a 'real risk' of the appellant's human rights being  breached,  and  at
    paragraph 26 the judge talks about substantial  grounds  for  believing
    there is a 'real risk' of treatment contrary to Article 2 and 3. Having
    holistic regard to the decision I do not regard the term  used  by  the
    judge in paragraph 40 as  indicating  a  failure  to  apply  the  lower
    standard of proof.


9.   The second aspect in which it is claimed the judge materially erred  in
    law  relates  to  his  general  adverse  credibility  findings.  It  is
    submitted by Mr McGann that the appellant's evidence was, on the whole,
    consistent and that the judge improperly attached weight to  some  more
    minor inconsistencies. As a result it is  submitted  that  the  judge's
    overall decision did not properly reflect the quality  and  consistency
    of the appellant's account.

10.  I reject this submission for the following  reasons.  At  paragraph  38
    the judge rejected the appellant's claim that she  and  her  ex-partner
    were able to pass through what was described  as  a  porous  border  by
    simply bribing a guard and paying the equivalent of  ï¿½3.  This  was  an
    extremely small amount, even taking  into  account  the  difference  in
    incomes between the UK and Albania/Kosovo. In these circumstances I  am
    not persuaded that the judge's conclusion, for the reasons he gave, was
    not within the range of reasonable conclusions open to him.

11.  The judge in any event reinforced  his  finding  by  reference  to  the
    absence of any evidence that  the  appellant's  father  or  her  oldest
    brother had their passports endorsed when they  came  into  Kosovo  and
    when they left Kosovo taking the appellant and her son back with  them.
    It was reasonably open to the appellant to have sought  this  evidence.
    No explanation appears to have been proffered at the hearing as to  why
    the appellant could not reasonably have requested  such  evidence  from
    her family in Albania. The judge additionally  noted  at  paragraph  35
    that, according to the Conclusive Grounds decision, whilst  the  border
    procedures between Kosovo and Albania became less  stringent  from  the
    summer of 2015 there was nothing to suggest that there  was  visa  free
    travel between the two countries as the appellant had asserted  at  the
    time that she claimed to have entered and left Kosovo in 2014.

12.  The judge, in any event, found the core of the appellant's  account  to
    be implausible.  At paragraph 37 the judge simply  did  not  accept  as
    plausible the appellant's claim to have  been  emotionally  blackmailed
    into going off with  her  ex-partner  in  his  car  to  Kosovo  without
    organising such a trip.  The judge stated, "In view of  the  fact  that
    she had been threatened by her former partner in 2011 with  a  gun  and
    had been able to resist the same in my judgment it is highly improbable
    that she would have simply caved in as she claims. The appellant  is  a
    highly educated and intelligent lady and if there is any truth  in  her
    claim that her ex-partner is a dangerous man it is  inconceivable  that
    she would not have at the very least told  her  family  where  she  was
    going, obtained her passport, taken her phone and  at  the  very  least
    gone home to obtain a  change  of  clothing."  This  was  a  conclusion
    rationally open to the judge for the reasons given.

13.   The  judge  additionally  noted  inconsistencies  in  the  appellant's
    account that undermined her credibility. In her statement the appellant
    stated that her intention was to travel to Kosovo for a few days but in
    her oral evidence she stated that she only intended to go to Kosovo for
    one day. There was a further inconsistency in relation to  whether  the
    Appellant actually had a phone with her when she went to  Kosovo.   The
    judge additionally drew an adverse inference at paragraph 41  based  on
    Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants,  etc.)
    Act 2004 in relation to the failure by the appellant to claim asylum in
    Italy.

14.  I am satisfied  that  the  judge  gave  legally  adequate  reasons  for
    finding the appellant to be incredible. As such the decision  does  not
    contain any material error of law and I dismiss the appeal.
