Representation:

For the Appellants:    No representation
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of Nigeria born respectively on 16th  March
    1976, 1st October 1978, 13th August 2006 and 18th February 2008.   They
    are related as husband, wife and their two children.   Appellants  Two,
    Three and Four are dependants on Appellant One.  I shall refer  to  the
    First Appellant as "the Appellant" throughout.

 2. The Appellant appealed against the decision  of  the  Respondent  dated
    21st July 2014 refusing him leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  pursuant  to  paragraph  245DD  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended.  The other Appellants applied  for
    leave to remain as his dependants pursuant to paragraphs  319C  and  H.
    The Respondent also issued  removal  directions.   Their  appeals  were
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Oxlade on 3rd November  2014.
    Their appeals were dismissed in a  determination  promulgated  on  11th
    November 2014.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was made by the Appellants  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley on  28th  April
    2015.  The permission was granted on limited grounds.  It  states  that
    the appeal was dismissed for want of evidence but the Appellants  claim
    that this evidence was submitted with the application.   They  produced
    copies of financial  evidence  in  support  of  their  application  for
    permission to appeal.  A third party declaration letter  is  listed  in
    the summary of evidence at section  7  of  the  summary  sheet  of  the
    Appellant's application form  which  forms  part  of  the  Respondent's
    bundle.  This is the evidence which the Appellants state was  submitted
    to the Respondent with their application.  The permission  states  that
    it is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  in  finding
    that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant,  for  failure  to
    provide this evidence.  These are the limited grounds  that  permission
    has been granted on.  The other errors of law cited in the  grounds  of
    application, relating to Article 8 of ECHR, are not applicable as there
    was no appeal made under Article 8 of ECHR to the First-tier  Tribunal.



 4. The Respondent lodged a Rule 24 response.  This states that  the  Judge
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  directed  himself  appropriately.    The
    response states that there were various issues regarding the  financial
    documents  the  Appellant  relied  on.   At   paragraph   20   of   the
    determination the judge finds that the Halifax Bank account  could  not
    be considered as it was in the Appellant's spouse's name only,  without
    any declaration from his spouse.  Consequently the  Appellant  and  his
    dependants could not meet the requirements of the Rules.  The  response
    goes on to state that it should be further  noted  that  the  Appellant
    requested a paper  hearing  as  opposed  to  taking  advantage  of  the
    appellate system,  thus  ceasing  the  opportunity  to  make  his  case
    including the claims about the documentation before the  SSHD  and  the
    Tribunal.  The response states that  the  grounds  have  no  merit  and
    merely disagree with the adverse outcome of the appeal.

The Hearing

 5. The Appellant made submissions stating that the only problem  with  the
    application is the  financial  situation  and  he  submitted  that  the
    Halifax bank account statements  were  with  his  application  and  the
    Immigration  Officer  ignored  them.   He  submitted  that  a  previous
    application was made on 11th November 2013 and refused on 3rd  December
    2013.  He submitted that he appealed and the decision was withdrawn  by
    the Home Office in February 2014. He submitted that the refusal  letter
    relating to that application stated that the  bank  statement  provided
    from Halifax Bank was not acceptable because it was for an account that
    is  not  in  the  Appellant's  name,  as  required  by  paragraph   41-
    SD(a)(ii)(4) of Appendix A of  the  Immigration  Rules.   That  refusal
    letter states that the Appellant had not demonstrated he had access  to
    funds as required.  The sum referred to is ï¿½10,300.  The Appellant said
    that the new refusal letter of 21st July 2014, which is the decision  I
    am dealing with at this hearing, indicates that the bank statement  and
    the letter from the Appellant's spouse, (the  Second  Appellant),  were
    not with the  application.   He  submitted  that  they  were  with  the
    application.

 6. The Presenting Officer submitted that  the  decision  the  Home  Office
    withdrew in February 2014 and the refusal letter of 3rd  December  2013
    state that the  bank  statement  provided  from  Halifax  Bank  is  not
    acceptable because it is for an account that is not in the  Appellant's
    name.  The first refusal letter therefore,  under  the  heading  "funds
    held in  regulated  financial  institutions"  awarded  no  points.   He
    submitted that the refusal letter of 21st  July  2014  refers  to  this
    again for the same reasons.

 7. The Appellant submitted that the Halifax account is now in joint  names
    and was in joint names before the hearing but  the  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that this cannot be looked at as this was not  the  situation
    at the date of the application.

 8. The  Presenting  Officer  referred  to  paragraph  41-SD(c)(ii)(4)  and
    submitted that there requires to be a third party  declaration  and  at
    paragraph 41-SD(d)(ii) there requires to be  a  letter  confirming  the
    validity of the declaration from the financial institution.

 9. He submitted that there is now a signed declaration of support on file.
     This is what the Appellant states was submitted with  the  application
    but there is no confirmation on the bank statements or  otherwise  that
    the funds will be available specifically to the Appellant, as  required
    by in the Immigration Rules 41-SD(c)(i).

10. The Appellant submitted that there is  nothing  in  the  first  refusal
    letter about confirmation being required from the bank.   He  submitted
    that it was him who put the money into that account  with  the  Halifax
    Bank.

11. The Presenting Officer put to the  Appellant  that  the  first  refusal
    letter is not relevant, we are only dealing  with  the  refusal  letter
    dated 21st July 2014.

12. The Appellant referred to  paragraph  245  of  the  Rules  relating  to
    missing evidence.  He submitted that evidential flexibility applies and
    that the Home Office  should  have  contacted  him  if  documents  were
    missing and did not do so.

13. The Presenting Officer referred to evidential  flexibility,  submitting
    that the Appellant has made a clear admission  that  the  Halifax  bank
    letter was not with the application and he submitted that that is fatal
    to this appeal.  He submitted that although the Halifax account is  now
    in joint names of the Appellant and his wife it  is  not  open  to  the
    Appellant to rely on this as this was not the case when the application
    was made.  He submitted that  subsequent  events  are  irrelevant.   He
    submitted that that is the law as it stands.

14. The Appellant submitted that the Secretary of State should  have  given
    him the benefit of the doubt.  He submitted  that  the  refusal  letter
    refers to funds which are abroad and that he should have been given the
    opportunity to submit further documents in the interests of fairness.

15. The Presenting Officer submitted that  evidential  flexibility  is  not
    relevant in this case.  At the date of the decision  discretion  should
    not have been extended and if I overturn the decision the appeal should
    be remitted back to the Secretary of State.  He asked me to find  there
    to be no error of law in the determination and he  submitted  that  the
    decision should stand.

Decision & Reasons

16. The refusal letter of 21st July 2014 states that the  application  made
    by the Appellant was dated 11th November 2013.  It states that on  11th
    November 2011 the Appellant was granted leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 11th November  2013  and
    on 3rd December 2013 the application of 11th November 2013 was  refused
    with a right of appeal.  On 21st January 2014 the Appellant  lodged  an
    appeal but the decision was  withdrawn  by  the  Home  Office  on  11th
    February 2014.  It was withdrawn to enable the Home Office to undertake
    a reconsideration of this application.  The refusal letter refers first
    of all to paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.   This  does  not
    form part of the permission to appeal.  The refusal letter then goes on
    to the points scoring.  Under the  heading  "Applicant  has  access  to
    funds as required" no points are awarded.  Reference  is  made  to  the
    Halifax bank statement of the Appellant's spouse, the Second  Appellant
    and the signed declaration of support.  It states that no  confirmation
    was provided either on the bank  statements  or  otherwise  that  these
    funds will be available specifically to the Appellant  as  required  by
    the Immigration Rules 41-SD(c)(i)(6).  The refusal  goes  on  to  state
    that if the Appellant is relying solely on  UK  bank  statements  these
    would need to be in his name only and if relying on UK bank  statements
    from a spouse he would need to provide a  declaration  of  support  and
    confirmation from the bank that the funds are available specifically to
    him.  The  specific  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  found  by  the
    Respondent not to have been satisfied.

17. Under the heading "Funds held in regulated financial institutions",  no
    points are awarded.  The reason for this are that the Appellant has not
    demonstrated that he has access to funds as required so the  Respondent
    is  unable  to  accurately  assess  this  attribute  as  he   has   not
    demonstrated that the full amount of the funds required  is  held  with
    regulated financial institutions.

18. Under the heading "Funds disposable in the United Kingdom", the refusal
    letter states that the Appellant has not provided  sufficient  evidence
    with his application, as specified under Appendix A of the  Immigration
    Rules, so no points are awarded under this heading.   This  is  because
    the Appellant has not demonstrated that  he  has  access  to  funds  as
    required and has not demonstrated that the full amount of the funds  as
    required is disposable to him in the United Kingdom.

19. The Appellant's position is that the required  documentation  has  been
    provided and was provided with the application.  There is a  letter  of
    support signed by the Appellant and  signed  by  his  wife,  which  was
    received by the Tribunal on 28th July 2015.  This was after the date of
    the application which was 11th November 2013 and was after the date  of
    the refusal letter of 21st July 2014.  There is a  letter  from  Owens,
    Solicitors, Luton confirming the signatures on the letter  of  support.
    This is dated 8th November 2013.  At the top of the letter  of  support
    there  is  a  handwritten  note  which  states  that  this  letter  was
    previously submitted to the Upper Tribunal prior to the  hearing  date.
    Even if this is true the Rules  specifically  state  that  confirmation
    from the bank on the bank statements or  otherwise,  that  these  funds
    will be available specifically to the Appellant is necessary.  This  is
    stated in the Immigration Rules 41-SD(c)(i)(6) and  there  is  no  such
    confirmation  and  no  such  confirmation  was   submitted   with   the
    application.  For this reason the Respondent did not award  any  points
    in line with Appendix A of the Immigration Rules. For the  same  reason
    no  points  were  awarded  for  funds  held  in   regulated   financial
    institutions and no points were awarded for  funds  disposable  in  the
    United Kingdom.

20. The specific terms of the Rules have to be satisfied and  it  is  clear
    that in this case the Appellant has tried to do this  but  has  failed.
    He has admitted that the confirmation was  not  with  the  application.
    The fact that the Halifax account is now in joint names cannot be taken
    into consideration as this was done after the date of application.

21. The Appellant therefore cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph  41-
    SD(c) of Appendix A  because  all  the  specified  documents  were  not
    supplied with the application and so the appeal was bound to be refused
    under the Immigration Rules.  Even if these documents had been produced
    to the Respondent on another occasion  that  does  not  mean  that  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD would  have  been  met.   Nor  can  the
    deficiencies in the documents submitted with the application  be  saved
    by the application of paragraph 245AA and evidential flexibility.   The
    case of  Rodriguez  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  2  applies.  There  are  certain
    situations in which evidential flexibility applies but this is not  one
    of them. The missing document was not missing  from  a  list   and  the
    Respondent could not be expected to contact the Appellant because  this
    was not submitted as the specified documents are set out in the  Rules,
    the terms of which the Appellant had to adhere to.



DECISION

There is no material error of law in the judge's determination.  The  First-
tier determination, promulgated on 11 November 2014 must stand.



The appeals by the Appellants (being the First  Appellant  and  his  family)
for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
Migrant and for leave to remain as his dependants is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
