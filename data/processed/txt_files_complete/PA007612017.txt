Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A J Bradley, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1.  The  basis  of  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  is  set  out  in  the
    respondent's letter of 2 December 2016, in terms  which  the  appellant
    does not dispute.  That letter also gives the respondent's reasons  for
    refusing the claim.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Mays dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in her decision promulgated on 25 August 2017.

 3. The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  stated  in  the
    application for  permission  to  appeal  filed  on  4  September  2017.
    Permission was granted on 6 November 2017.

 4. At the outset of the hearing on 3 January 2018 Mr Bradley said that the
    expert had been provided with a copy of the FtT decision and had agreed
    to write a supplementary  report,  but  legal  aid  had  not  yet  been
    obtained to cover the cost.  He sought  an  adjournment  until  such  a
    report was available.   He  added  that  the  appellant  had  expressed
    concern over my hearing the appeal, because I had been the judge in  an
    unsuccessful appeal to the UT by her husband in 2016, at which time she
    had been a dependant on his claim.  Mr Bradley did not himself consider
    that there were grounds of objection to my hearing the case.

 5. Mr Matthews opposed the application.  He  said  there  was  nothing  to
    suggest that a further report might be relevant to whether the FtT made
    any error of law on the case before it, and  that  there  had  been  no
    application  to  lead  further  evidence,  as  required  by  rules  and
    directions.   The  case  I  had  previously  decided  related  to   the
    appellant's husband not to her, had been  concerned  with  legal  error
    only, and did not involve taking any view on credibility.

 6. I declined to adjourn.  The report which might be forthcoming  was  not
    shown to have any relevance to the issue of error of law.  Whether such
    a report might be admitted,  if  error  of  law  was  established,  for
    purposes of a fresh decision, was a question for the future.  There was
    no basis on which to recuse myself from hearing the case.

 7. The gist of the 3 grounds is as follows:

      (1) Taking account of irrelevant matters when considering  the  expert
      report of Dr Laker, in 3 respects:

           (i)  The judge suggested it was speculative  that  the  security
           services (the CMI) would know the appellant was  alive  and  had
           been taken to hospital.  This was perhaps of  little  importance
           as whether or not they knew she was  alive,  this  would  become
           apparent to them if the appellant was returned.

           (ii)  The judge had concerns over  the  report  being  based  on
           interviews carried out from 2009 to 2011 and not later.  In oral
           evidence the expert had confirmed his ongoing research visits to
           Uganda.  His report was largely but  not  exclusively  based  on
           prior research.  This criticism was "simply misplaced".

           (iii)  The judge noted that the expert report did not  refer  to
           well-known reports such as those from the  US  State  Department
           (USSD) and Amnesty International (AI).  There was  reference  to
           Human Rights Watch.  The expert explained that the CMI were  not
           much mentioned in public documents.  The explanation appeared to
           have been  given  little  weight.   The  judge's  criticism  was
           "misguided".  As an example,  the  AI  report  for  2016-17  was
           attached to the grounds.  It  did  not  mention  the  CMI.   The
           latest USSD report contained  one  very  short  reference.   The
           judge failed to consider what information in those reports might
           have  added  to  the  expert's  evidence,  which  was  "precious
           little".

      (2)  The judge suggested at �56 that as the appellant did not know the
      individual identities of her rapists, the CMI would not view her as  a
      threat.  The expert's position was that the CMI operates as a unit not
      as individuals responsible  for  their  actions.   It  was  irrelevant
      whether the appellant knew names, as she knew which  organisation  was
      responsible.  The CMI operate from a position of impunity  using  fear
      and intimidation.  They often silence people before  they  speak  out.
      The judge misunderstood the evidence.

      (3)  At �58 the judge inverted the standard of proof,  saying  it  was
      "perfectly possible" that individuals had moved on from the CMI.   The
      appropriate test was whether there was a real risk they  had  in  fact
      not moved on.

 8. Mr Bradley submitted along the lines of the grounds.  The main  further
    points I noted were these:

      i) On ground 1 (i), Mr Bradley's  record  of  the  evidence  was  that
         expert said that the CMI routinely  check  hospital  records.   The
         judge misunderstood what he said.

     ii) On ground 1 (ii), the judge made much of  the  expert's  interviews
         being carried out between 2009 - 2011, but he had explained how  he
         regularly updated himself through visits to Uganda,  where  he  has
         extensive political contacts.  Many of the  sources  cited  in  his
         report had dates in 2017.  There has been little recent  change  in
         the security situation in Uganda, where Museveni has held power for
         30 years.

    iii) On ground 1 (iii), the expert said in oral  evidence  that  reports
         such as those by the USSD and AI said little about and did not  add
         to his knowledge of the CMI.  The function of the expert was to  go
         beyond such reports.  The judge's criticism would  only  have  been
         valid if the reports added anything.

 9. The main points I noted from the submission  for  the  respondent  were
    these:

      i) Ground 1 was selective and failed  to  deal  with  the  FtT's  full
         reasons for finding no risk to the appellant from the CMI.

     ii) The appellant's submission on  ground  1  (i)  strayed  beyond  its
         terms, which did not assert there had been evidence the CMI checked
         all hospital records.  That suggestion of error  of  fact  was  not
         supported by provision of the appellant's record of proceedings, or
         by a request for the tribunal's record.  The issue  should  not  be
         entertained at this late stage.

    iii) Ground 1 (i), as stated, acknowledged that the judge was correct to
         see it as speculative that the CMI would know about  the  appellant
         from her hospital records.

     iv)  On ground 1 (ii), the age of the interviews was a matter open  for
         the judge's comment.  Her consideration of the report referred also
         to the expert's later visits and contacts,  and  was  detailed  and
         thorough (�42 - 59).

      v) Ground 1 (iii) made too much of the judge's comment on  absence  of
         reference to other  reports.   All  she  said  was  that  this  was
         "slightly surprising".

     vi) Ground 2 did not show a misunderstanding of the evidence.  It was a
         fact that the appellant said she did not know the identities of her
         assailants.  The impunity enjoyed by the CMI was  sensibly  capable
         of interpretation as a reason for them to have no  further  concern
         about her, rather than to be  on  the  alert  for  her  return  and
         worried about any complaint she might make.

    vii) Ground 3 (on which the appellant had made  no  further  submission)
         did not show that there was anything in �58  to  suggest  that  the
         judge decided the case on a  misapprehension  of  the  standard  or
         burden of proof.

10. Mr Bradley in reply said that he could confirm his note of the evidence
    about the CMI checking hospital records.  The judge said not only  that
    absence  of  reference  to  more  well-known   sources   was   slightly
    surprising, but also that it "affects the weight I am prepared to place
    on his report".  Reference  to  the  reports  showed  that  they  added
    nothing.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. The treatment of the expert report in the FtT's decision  includes  the
    following:

      �44-45, full narration of  how  Dr  Laker  keeps  abreast  of  current
      affairs in Uganda, including the security sector and the CMI;

      �47, acceptance of his suitability as  an  expert  (having  accurately
      canvassed certain omissions at �42 and 43);

      �48-51, detailed narration of Dr Laker's evidence, written and oral;

      �52, record of the judge's question about how the CMI would  know  the
      appellant escaped, his response that they carry out surveillance,  his
      inability to explain satisfactorily how they would know she was  alive
      and had been taken  to  hospital,  and  a  finding  of  "a  degree  of
      speculation in this aspect of Dr Laker's evidence";

      �53, a note that the report is based in large part on interviews  some
      years before the hearing; no interview referred to in  the  report  of
      later date; oral evidence of sporadic discussions since, but these are
      not referred to in the report; followed by the comments submitted upon
      above;

      �54, relating to the general background reports, as submitted upon;

      �55, a dispute over whether the CMI was likely to  re-detain  someone,
      resolved in the appellant's favour;

      �56, Dr Laker's statement that  the  appellant's  survival  means  she
      could expose the brutality of the CMI coupled with his next  sentence,
      stating that their veil of secrecy makes  it  impossible  for  her  to
      identify and prosecute her attackers; passage of 13  years  since  the
      incident; no evidence of trying to track her down e.g. by  enquiry  at
      her family home; no suggestion from the appellant  she  would  try  to
      bring her  attackers  to  justice;  inability  to  identify  "somewhat
      undermines" Dr Laker's conclusion CMI would see her as a threat to  be
      silenced; appellant is a witness  to  their  brutal  tactics  but  not
      someone who would seek to hold them to account or in  whom  they  have
      any current interest;

      �57, Dr Laker's evidence of risk due to  return  as  a  failed  asylum
      seeker rejected;

      �58, appellant's evidence her attackers may since have  been  promoted
      speculative; perfectly possible they have moved on from CMI;

      �59, for these reasons, little weight placed on Dr Laker's  conclusion
      appellant would be at risk from CMI.

13. In that context, there is considerable force in the argument  that  the
    grounds and submissions for the appellant do not fairly  represent  the
    decision as a whole.

14. The submission that there was evidence of the CMI checking all hospital
    records was not foreshadowed in the grounds, and no  proper  basis  was
    laid for it.

15. In any event, there is little in this issue.  The  judge  at  �52  went
    painstakingly into the question whether  the  CMI  would  know  of  the
    appellant's  survival  and  hospital  admission,  examined  Dr  Laker's
    evidence about it, and went no  further  than  to  find  "a  degree  of
    speculation".  There is no error in that.

16. Further, it would be  a  greater  leap,  indeed  far-fetched,  to  find
    material error of fact by overlooking that the CMI might  keep  records
    based on hospital admissions and cross-check these against  details  of
    nationals entering the country many years later.

17. The judge's comments on the age of the interviews  and  on  absence  of
    reference to other  reports  were  moderate.   She  attached  to  those
    matters no more weight than was well within her rational scope.

18. Ground 2 does not show that the judge misunderstood  the  evidence,  or
    that she gave lack of  knowledge  of  individual  identities  any  more
    weight than that matter could bear.  It was not an irrelevant  feature.
    The evidence was at least equally capable of being interpreted to  show
    no real risk of ongoing interest, on which the  judge  was  correct  to
    note that the expert evidence verged on self-contradiction.

19. Ground 3 also loses any apparent force once  placed  in  context.   The
    judge's observation about persons leaving  the  CMI  was  part  of  her
    response to evidence  and  submissions  about  their  likely  promotion
    within the CMI.  She identified an equally rational possibility.   That
    has nothing to do with applying the  correct  burden  and  standard  of
    proof to the overall decisive issue in the case.

20. The grounds do not show (1) that the judge's treatment  of  the  expert
    report is undermined by taking account of irrelevant matters, (2)  that
    she  misunderstood  the  expert's  evidence  about  identification   of
    individuals or (3) that  she  inverted  the  standard  of  proof.   The
    grounds on full examination are no more than selective disagreement  on
    the facts.  No error on any point of law is disclosed.

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

22. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity has been maintained herein.
