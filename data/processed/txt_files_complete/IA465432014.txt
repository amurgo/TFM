                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Sullivan) dismissing the appellant's appeal against  a  decision
    taken on 28 October 2014 to refuse to grant further leave to remain and
    to remove the appellant from the UK.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 5  November  1986.  He
    came to the UK as a student on 8 May 2009  and  was  granted  leave  to
    enter until 30 June 2010. His leave was subsequently extended until  23
    December 2012. The appellant states that he asked  for  extra  time  to
    submit a CAS when he applied on 22 December 2012 and then  submitted  a
    valid CAS from Bell's College on 8 March 2013.  On  31  July  2014  the
    respondent advised the appellant about  concerns  regarding  his  TOEIC
    test results and then on 1 October 2014 an English  language  test  was
    cancelled because  the  test  centre  rejected  the  identity  document
    provided to the appellant by  the  respondent.  He  then  received  the
    refusal.

 4.  The  Secretary  of  State  accepted  the  appellant's   identity   and
    nationality but concluded that  his  CAS  had  been  withdrawn  by  the
    sponsor college by 28 October 2014  and  there  was  no  valid  English
    language test certificate. The requirements of paragraph 245ZX  of  the
    Rules were not met.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  his  appeal  was
    eventually determined on the papers on 25  August  2015.  He  submitted
    that he was not informed that the  CAS  had  been  withdrawn  and  only
    learned about it from the refusal. The respondent should have  informed
    him and given him an opportunity to find a new sponsor. The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that the appellant had not  submitted  a  CAS  with  his
    application form and rejected his claim that he did not know  that  the
    CAS had been withdrawn. He knew on 28 February  2013  that  the  London
    School of Technology was no longer licensed to  issue  a  CAS,  he  had
    taken the opportunity by 8 March 2013 to seek a CAS from Bell's College
    instead and he was aware by 25 September 2014 that Bell's  College  was
    no longer a Tier 4 sponsor. The appellant said that he was informed  on
    31 July 2014 that he  had  an  opportunity  to  provide  a  replacement
    English language test certificate and made arrangements to take  a  new
    test on 11 October 2014. His test was cancelled on 26  September  2014.
    The judge found that the appellant had a three month period to take  an
    English language test and to provide the required evidence. He had  not
    done so. The respondent waited 10 months to make a decision  and  there
    was no unfairness.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  because  the
    appellant had found himself unable to take any  English  language  test
    with the identification provided by the respondent. That was not  fair.
    The appellant had not been given any  opportunity  to  provide  further
    documents when he changed his oral hearing to a paper hearing.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ford  on
    24 January 2016 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  judge  may
    not have appreciated that the reason for the appellant  not  re-sitting
    the English language test was that the test providers  were  unable  to
    accept the only form of ID provided to the appellant by the respondent.
    The other grounds were not arguable because directions were sent to the
    appellant on 9 July 2015 notifying him that he had the  opportunity  to
    file and serve any additional evidence by 4 August 2015.

 8. In a rule 24 response dated 8 February 2016  the  respondent  submitted
    that the judge had considered the common law fairness grounds and  made
    adequate sustainable findings that whilst the English language test was
    cancelled on 26 September 2014 the appellant had not  said  whether  he
    had informed the respondent of that cancellation.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

10. Mr Waheed submitted that the appellant was set up to fail. The CAS  was
    not obtained because the certified copy of the passport  given  to  the
    appellant was not adequate to undertake the IELTS test. The  respondent
    acknowledged on 31 July 2014 that the appellant  had  taken  the  IELTS
    test but his test scores had been cancelled. He then got more  time  to
    sit the test on 11 October 2014 but was required to bring his  original
    passport. The respondent was saying that  a  certified  copy  would  be
    sufficient but that was not the case. A further  attempt  to  take  the
    IELTS test on 27 June  2015  also  failed  because  the  appellant  was
    required to produce his original passport and  could  not  do  so.  The
    reality was that the  appellant  required  an  original  passport.  The
    appellant confronted a brick wall and  there  is  no  evidence  that  a
    certified copy of a passport is accepted  by  any  college.  Mr  Waheed
    conceded that there was no evidence that the appellant  had  asked  for
    his passport but he was told that a certified copy would be enough. The
    respondent should have been aware that a certified copy was not enough.

11. Mr Kandola submitted that the appellant never had the required  English
    language certificate. Everything else follows from  that  defect  which
    lay with the appellant who then spent two years trying to  rectify  the
    deficiency. The CAS was assigned in 2013 but the  college  licence  was
    then surrendered. The respondent' letter of 31 July 2014  gave  another
    opportunity to cure the defect. The respondent was not legally required
    to give the many opportunities that were  given.  The  application  was
    always dependent upon the English language certificate and  was  doomed
    to  fail  because  it  was  submitted  without  all  of  the  necessary
    documents.

12. The events set out in  this  appeal  took  place  over  a  considerable
    period. The crucial  pieces  of  correspondence  are  the  respondent's
    letter of 31 July 2014 and the  letter  from  AK  Solicitors  dated  25
    September 2014. The respondent's letter set a deadline of 25  September
    2014 for submission of a new English  language  test  certificate.  The
    solicitor's letter of 25 September 2014 stated that the  appellant  was
    undertaking the IELTS test on 11 October 2014 and expected  to  receive
    the result by 25 October 2014. The appellant was then notified  by  the
    British Council on 26 September 2014 that  his  identity  document  was
    rejected and on 1 October 2014 was informed that his test date had been
    cancelled. Nothing further was submitted to the respondent  before  the
    decision was made on 28 October 2014  and  there  was  no  request  for
    return of the original passport after the appellant became  aware  that
    the certified copy of his passport was not adequate proof of identity.

13. I have considered Patel (consideration of Sapkota -  unfairness)  India
    [2011] UKUT 00484 (IAC) and Thakur (PBS decision - common law fairness)
    Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC). I find that the respondent did  not
    ignore any request for further time made on behalf  of  the  appellant.
    The judge correctly found that the applicant was given three months  to
    submit a new English language test certificate (from 31 July 2014 to 28
    October 2014). He  failed  to  do  so  and  there  is  nothing  in  the
    correspondence from the solicitors to indicate to the  respondent  that
    there was a difficulty in taking the test because the appellant did not
    have his original passport.

14. Given the absence of any request for the original passport  or  further
    time after 25 October 2014, Mr Waheed was obliged to fall back  on  the
    submission that the appellant was set up to fail  by  the  respondent's
    letter of 31 July 2014. However, there was no evidence before the judge
    that it was impossible to undertake the English language  test  without
    the original passport. Nor did the appellant do anything to assist  his
    own cause by way of requesting  further  time  or  the  return  of  the
    original passport or both. In those circumstances, I find it impossible
    to identify any substantive unfairness in the respondent's decision. It
    follows that the judge correctly found at paragraphs 15 and 18  of  the
    decision that there was no breach of the common law duty of fairness.

15. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal did not involve the making of an error of law and  its  decision
    stands.

Decision

16. Consequently, I dismiss the appeal of the appellant.
