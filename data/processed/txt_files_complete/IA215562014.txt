                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pacey, promulgated on 14th October 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 6th  October  2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  Uththamy  Jegatheswaran.    The   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was born 6th May 1990.  She
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 26th  March  2014
    refusing her application for leave to  remain  in  the  UK  as  Tier  4
    Student.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she complies  with  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX(d) in that she had furnished the relevant letters  from
    her bank confirming that funds were available to her (see paragraphs  6
    to 9 of the determination).  For example, in the witness statement  she
    explains  that  she  had  provided  relevant  evidence,  not  only  her
    Nationwide account statement, but also two  bank  statements  from  the
    Bank of Ceylon and Bartleet Finance in Sri  Lanka  (see  paragraph  7).
    She maintains that an early letter from  Bartleet  Finance,  dated  5th
    March 2014, confirmed that she had 1,000,000  rupees  on  deposit  from
    29th June 2013 until the maturity date of 29th September 2014.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge concluded that the Appellant had not been able to comply with
    the Rules.  She had not been able to send the  necessary  documentation
    confirming the availability of  funds  at  the  applicable  date.   The
    application was dated 6th  March  2014.   The  Appellant  had  to  show
    availability of funds of ï¿½2,100 with her application.  It is true  that
    there was a letter of 5th March, but as the  judge  observed,  "I  note
    from the covering letter dated 22nd March  that  she  sent  a  Bartleet
    Finance letter on 22nd March, although it was dated  5th  March.   This
    was after the date of her application and hence cannot  be  taken  into
    account.

 5. The date of the application was 6th March, over a fortnight before  the
    Bartleet Finance letter was sent.  Section 19(4) makes it clear in  the
    phrase "at the time of making" that documents must  be  sent  with  the
    application when it is made.  Paragraph 245AA refers to "documents that
    have been submitted with the application" and the reference  to  "with"
    is conclusive that the documents must accompany  the  application  (see
    paragraph 12).  Second, and in  any  event,  the  Nationwide  statement
    dated 6th March shows the current activity between 8th February and 6th
    March and "it therefore falls short, admittedly by only one day, of the
    necessary period" but that "in any event  it  clearly  shows  that  the
    lowest balance in that period was 01 pence.  It cannot therefore  serve
    as evidence of material value of the availability of funds"  (paragraph
    14).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge  failed  to  apply  the
    relevant Rules, failed to consider the relevant case law, and that  the
    discretion should have been exercised differently.  In particular,  the
    judge failed to consider the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

 7. On 1st December 2014, permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis
    that the judge should have considered the Appellant's Article 8  rights
    as well because, "while it might be said that the case under Article  8
    is not a strong one, the Appellant is entitled to a decision on  it..."
    (paragraph 4).

 8. On 4th December 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered.  This states that
    the judge went to considerable length to deal with the inadequacies  of
    the evidence.  It states that, "the Respondent has had regards  to  the
    Presenting Officer's hearing note and there is nothing to indicate that
    Article 8 was relied upon at  the  hearing".   The  note  does  however
    confirm that:

         "It was not in dispute that the financial documents provided by the
         Appellant at the time of the application  were  not  sufficient  to
         meet the Rules.  The reps position was that if the  documents  were
         insufficient, then the Secretary of  State  should  have  contacted
         either the Appellant or financial institution concerning to rectify
         any omission".

    Second, and in the alternative, if Article  8  was  a  live  issue  the
    requirements of Article 8 were not met because there was nothing in the
    grounds of application or the determination to  demonstrate  what  good
    arguable case could have been relied upon by the Appellant.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me, Mr  Aghayere,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, explained that Article 8 was put as an argument  before  the
    judge.  It was made clear that the Appellant had been  in  the  UK  for
    five years, she had been  here as a student, she had worked for  twenty
    hours a week, she was married to a partner who had discretionary  leave
    until December 2015, and that she was pregnant.  My attention was drawn
    to a letter from the Hillingdon Hospitals dated 23rd September 2014  to
    the effect that the Appellant had an antenatal  clinic  appointment  on
    21st October 2014 for a scan.  She is pregnant with her child.

10. Second, even if it was not raised the judge should have  considered  it
    because the Notice of Appeal clearly referred  to  Article  8.   Third,
    permission had been granted now to argue  all  matters,  and  not  just
    confined to Article 8, but that if an error of law  were  to  be  found
    with respect to Article 8 not being considered, the  matter  should  be
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal so that all arguments  can  be
    put before the judge again.

11. For her part, Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no  error  of  law.
    She had relied upon the well-known case of Patel [2014] AC 651  in  the
    Supreme Court, where the Supreme Court made it clear that, "a near miss
    under the rules cannot provide substance to a human rights  case  which
    is otherwise lacking in merit".  (Paragraph 56).   Furthermore,  it  is
    made clear that,

         "It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power...  The opportunity for  a  promising  student  to
         complete his course in this country, however desirable  in  general
         terms, is not in itself a right protected  under  Article  8"  (see
         paragraph 57).

    The only proper course for the Appellant, submitted Miss Isherwood, was
    now to make an Article 8  application  directly  to  the  Secretary  of
    State.  She was still able to do so.  She could rely upon  her  current
    circumstances and set out a proper Article 8 application.

12. Second, insofar as it was alleged  that  paragraph  245  had  not  been
    complied with Ms Isherwood relied upon  the  recent  Tribunal  case  of
    Akhter (paragraph 245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 297.  This makes  it
    clear that,

         "A bank letter, which does not specify the postal address, landline
         telephone number and email address of the account  holders  is  not
         thereby 'in the wrong format' for the purposes of  paragraph  245AA
         of  the   Immigration   Rules   (documents   not   submitted   with
         applications)".

    This was the position argued for by the Appellant.  The case of  Akhter
    made it clear that it was unsustainable.  In any event, paragraph 245AA
    makes it clear at sub-paragraph B that, "if the applicant has submitted
    (i) a sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the  sequence
    have  been  omitted.....the  UK   Border   Agency   may   contact   the
    applicant....".  The language here was "may" and not "must".

    However, it had to be remembered that the judge at paragraph 11 made it
    clear that there was "missing information" and this was  not  a  "wrong
    format" point.  The grounds are alleging that there was  a  absence  of
    "fairness" but this was hard to understand if  no  necessary  documents
    have  been  submitted.   The  grounds  referred  to  the  existence  of
    "exceptional  circumstances"   but   nothing   exceptional   had   been
    identified.  But most importantly, the grounds  of  application,  which
    had been drafted only in October 2014, do not refer to the  partner  or
    the child.

13. In his reply, Mr Aghayere submitted that the  fact  remained  that  the
    judge had simply failed to consider Article 8 at  all.   There  was  an
    error in this.

Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  error  is  a
    material error such that I should set aside the decision.

15. The judge was correct in stating that  the  Appellant  could  not  have
    succeeded  under  paragraph  245AA  because  documents  had  not   been
    "submitted with the application" (see paragraph 16) and a letter of 5th
    March had not been sent out until 22nd March.

16. The judge should have considered Article 8,  although  it  does  appear
    that it was not properly argued orally before the judge,  and  this  is
    confirmed in the Respondent Secretary of State's note of  the  hearing,
    being confined to the Notice of Appeal.  That trend has continued  even
    with the latest application of October 2014.

17. Nevertheless, if the judge were to consider what was at the time before
    her, she would have dismissed the appeal because the essential argument
    before the judge was that of the Appellant having made a  "near  miss".
    The case of Patel [2014] AC 651 is clear that, "a near miss  under  the
    rules cannot  provide  substance  to  a  human  rights  case  which  is
    otherwise lacking in merit" (paragraph 56).  As put before  the  judge,
    the human rights claim was otherwise lacking  in  merit.   Accordingly,
    this is a case where it is  appropriate  to  conclude  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal may (but need not) set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (see Section 12(2)(a)).  No other decision was possible on the
    evidence.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity order is made.
