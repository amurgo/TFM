                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Sri Lanka  date  of  birth  15th  March
    1994. Although he was recognised as a refugee in 2008 the Secretary  of
    State has made a decision to deport him under s32 of the UK Border  Act
    2007.  The reason for that action is that  on  the  6th  May  2016  the
    Respondent was convicted of Actual  Bodily  Harm  and  sentenced  to  a
    period of imprisonment of 54 months.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    the Respondent successfully argued that notwithstanding his criminality
    he  should  not  be  deported  because  he  continues  to  require  the
    protection of the United Kingdom.  His appeal was accordingly  allowed.
    The Secretary of State  now  has  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision.
 2. The foundation of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  was  the  4th
    September 2008 determination of Immigration Judge Bryant in case number
    AA/05802/08.  Judge Bryant heard live evidence  from  the  Respondent's
    mother, and from the Respondent himself. Judge Bryant was impressed  by
    that evidence and found that both were at a real risk of  serious  harm
    should they be returned  to  Sri  Lanka.  In  particular  Judge  Bryant
    accepted that:

              i) The Respondent's father was a  member  of,  or  'associated
                 with' the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  from  at
                 least 2001;


             ii) Between 2007 and 2008 the Sri Lankan security  services  in
                 Jaffna repeatedly questioned the Respondent, his mother and
                 brothers about the father's whereabouts;

            iii) In March 2008 the family were all detained and questioned;

             iv) The Respondent and his brother were held in detention, ill-
                 treated, photographed, fingerprinted and forced to  sign  a
                 document before they were released on bail;

              v) They thereafter failed to comply with  the  terms  of  that
                 bail;

             vi) The family then moved to Negombo in order to avoid  further
                 arrest;

            vii) When the Respondent and his brother  failed  to  answer  to
                 their bail conditions the security services were  searching
                 for them at the family home in Jaffna;

           viii) The family subsequently fled Sri Lanka and  claimed  asylum
                 in the United Kingdom;

             ix) Having regard to the fact  that  they  skipped  bail,  that
                 "there is a reasonable likelihood that  there  are  records
                 relating to [the Respondent] which would be held either  on
                 computer or other records at the airport" as  a  result  of
                 which the Respondent  would  be  reasonably  likely  to  be
                 detained upon arrival at Colombo airport.   Given that such
                 detention would give rise to a real risk of  serious  harm,
                 the Respondent had made out his case that he was a refugee.

 3. Judge Cohen treated those findings as his  Devaseelan  starting  point.
    He then said this, and allowed the appeal:


         "35. The [Secretary of State]  does  not  appear  to  have  engaged
         sufficiently with these findings and has produced  no  evidence  to
         impugn the  findings  of  Immigration  Judge  Bryant  and  has  not
         discharged the burden of proof.


         36. The appellant [the Respondent] has provided  an  expert  report
         from Dr Chris Smith supporting his appeal and finding that  it  was
         reasonably likely that the appellant would be on a Stop List, or at
         the very least the Watch List upon return to Sri Lanka.


         37. I find that the appellant is reasonably likely to appear on the
         records at the airport  based  upon  his  own  perceived  political
         opinion and imputed political opinion based on  his  LTTE  familial
         affiliation. The appellant clearly has a number of significant risk
         factors as identified in the case of GJ


         38. The appellant will be returned on an Emergency Travel  Document
         and the Sri  Lankan  High  Commission  will  pass  details  of  the
         appellant to the Sri Lankan authorities and the appellant  will  be
         asked questions upon his arrival in  Sri  Lanka.  This  conjunction
         with his name being on the database means  that  it  is  reasonably
         likely that the appellant will be arrested and detained".


 4. The Secretary of State submits that these findings are unsustainable in
    light of the country guidance case of GJ and Others [2013]  UKUT  00319
    (IAC), which post-dated the decision of Judge Bryant, and indeed  armed
    hostilities in Sri Lanka, which reached their apogee  in  Spring  2009.
    It is the Secretary of State's case that the guidance in  GJ,  properly
    understood, could not support a finding that the Respondent 's fear  of
    return to Sri Lanka is currently well-founded.   Particular reliance is
    placed upon the findings at paragraph 311:


         311. The LTTE was the de facto government of  large  areas  of  Sri
         Lanka during the conflict and all residents of those areas at times
         of LTTE governance would have LTTE connections. The majority of the
         examples which the parties produced of those who  were  ill-treated
         on return, were of persons who had significant LTTE links  (whether
         direct or familial). The evidence is that although LTTE cadres were
         screened out  and  rehabilitated  in  May  2009,  the  government's
         concern now is not with  past  membership  or  sympathy,  but  with
         whether a person is a destabilising  threat  in  post-conflict  Sri
         Lanka.


 5. It is the Secretary of State's case that there  is  nothing  about  the
    Respondent which  would  lead  the  Sri  Lankan  security  services  to
    conclude that he is  a  "destabilising  threat"  in  post-conflict  Sri
    Lanka.   He was only 14 when he was detained, he has spent ten years in
    the United Kingdom and there is no evidence of any diaspora  opposition
    activity.






    Discussion and Findings

 6. As a preliminary observation I would note that the submission that  the
    Secretary of State makes before me is the same submission made  before,
    and considered by, the First-tier Tribunal: see paragraphs 5, 6, 18, 31
    and 37 of the determination where GJ is  specifically  addressed.    It
    cannot therefore be said that the First-tier Tribunal  was  unaware  of
    the country guidance, failed  to  consider  it,  or  the  Secretary  of
    State's submissions about its effect.


 7. The question then is whether the approach taken by the Tribunal  is  an
    irrational or otherwise  impermissible  application  of  the  guidance.
    The ratio of the decision is as follows.

 8. There is an undisturbed finding of fact by a Judge that the  Respondent
    was arrested in 2008 in connection  with  an  investigation  into  LTTE
    activity. Along with his brother he was detained, beaten, and forced to
    sign a blank document.   Before they were  released  on  official  bail
    they were photographed and fingerprinted. The Respondent  then  skipped
    bail. He failed to comply with his reporting conditions and this led to
    the security services searching for him and his brother - they attended
    the family home and questioned the boys' grandmother. These  facts  led
    Judge Bryant to conclude, in September 2008, that there was a real risk
    that their names would be on a computer or other record at the airport,
    and that this  would  lead  to  the  Respondent's  detention  and  ill-
    treatment upon return.

 9. That, quite properly, was Judge Cohen's starting  point.  Because  this
    was a cessation case he then proceeded to consider [at ï¿½31] whether the
    Secretary of State had submitted any evidence to demonstrate  that  the
    Respondent would no longer face a real risk of harm.  He recorded  that
    the Secretary of State had produced no such evidence.   The  Respondent
    had however produced a report from  Dr  Chris  Smith  (an  acknowledged
    expert on the security situation in Sri Lanka) who upon examination  of
    the Respondent's  current  circumstances  had  concluded  that  it  was
    reasonably likely that his name would be on a  'Stop  List'  today.  At
    paragraph 356 of GJ the Tribunal had concluded  that  those  who  found
    themselves on a 'Stop  List'  would  be  detained  upon  arrival;  such
    detention was reasonably likely to lead to ill-treatment and could  not
    therefore be returned to Sri Lanka.  It was on that  basis  that  Judge
    Cohen allowed the Respondent's appeal.

10. Before me Mr Melvin  acknowledged  that  the  HOPO  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing had not submitted any country background material:  he
    had simply relied upon GJ.  Mr Melvin nevertheless  urged  me  to  find
    that the Tribunal had erred in concluding that the  Respondent  was  at
    risk because he would be on a 'Stop List'. In  GJ  the  Tribunal  found
    that this list comprised of individuals subject to an arrest warrant or
    court summons. Mr Melvin submitted that since  there  was  no  evidence
    that the Respondent was the subject of  either,  it  followed  that  he
    could not be at risk: the  2008  findings  of  Judge  Bryant  that  the
    Respondent's name would be on  a  computer  at  the  airport  did  not,
    without more, justify the conclusion in 2019 that his name would appear
    on a 'Stop List' today.

11. I find the Secretary of State's grounds not to  be  made  out  for  two
    principle reasons. First because the Secretary of State did not, at any
    point, challenge the conclusions of Dr Smith. Dr Smith had opined  that
    the Respondent's name was reasonably likely to be on a  Stop  List.  He
    knew and understood the guidance in GJ: in  fact  he  was  one  of  the
    experts that the  Upper  Tribunal  relied  upon  to  give  the  country
    guidance.   The First-tier  Tribunal  was  entitled  to  rely  on  that
    unchallenged evidence. Second because the absence of evidence does  not
    amount to evidence of absence. The fact that  the  Respondent  had  not
    managed to show that he is  subject  to  an  arrest  warrant  or  court
    summons is not at this stage sufficient to demonstrate that the risk to
    him has abated. He skipped official bail whilst under investigation for
    LTTE association. That was sufficient for Dr Smith to consider  him  to
    be at ongoing risk of  being  on  the  list,  and  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to accept those conclusions.    I can find no irrationality or
    other error in the Tribunal's decision, which  appears  to  follow  the
    guidance in GJ.

12. The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly dismissed.

    Anonymity

13. The Respondent is entitled to international protection. As  such  I  am
    satisfied,  having had regard  to  the  guidance  in  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it  would  be
    appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Decisions


14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.


15. There is an order for anonymity.
