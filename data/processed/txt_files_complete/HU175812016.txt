                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Saudi Arabia, date of  birth  11  November
    1986, appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 4 July 2016, to
    refuse leave to remain under the Immigration Rules  and  on  Article  8
    ECHR grounds.  His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Watson
    who on 31 August 2017 dismissed his appeal.  Permission to  appeal  was
    given and on 27 June 2018 my decision was promulgated in which I  found
    there was an error of  law  in  the  determination  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge of the Appellant's claim particularly on the issue  that
    the judge had not sufficiently dealt with the issue of  the  impact  of
    the Appellant's removal to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  (KSA)  and  the
    potential impact on his wife.  It was clear that his wife  has  entered
    into a marriage with the Appellant but that she is not a  Muslim  or  a
    practitioner of the Muslim faith and there  are  questions  raised  but
    unresolved as  to  whether  or  not  such  a  marriage  would  even  be
    recognised in KSA.

2.   I concluded therefore that it was appropriate  for  the  matter  to  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal.

3.   The evidence before me  was  not  substantively  challenged  being  the
    statements made by the Appellant  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  bundle
    dated 21 July 2017 and the evidence  of  the  Appellant  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal bundle dated 7 August 2018.  In addition I had two letters one
    before the First-tier Tribunal written by the Appellant's wife,  Hayley
    Morris, dated 8 June 2017 which was  extensive  and  a  further  letter
    dated 7 August 2018 adding to the contents of the  earlier  letter  she
    had written.  The Appellant and his wife gave  evidence.   I  find  the
    Appellant, whilst being a national of KSA, had not  lived  there  since
    the age of 3.  Whilst he has brothers and sisters who still live  there
    he is not in contact with them and effectively contact ended  with  the
    death of his father which has left behind  confused  property  disputes
    which are unresolved and in which the Appellant knows virtually nothing
    of  his  father's  estate  and/or  property  if  he  had  any  in  KSA,
    particularly when his father's company was effectively either  bankrupt
    or in liquidation.

4.   The fact was that if returned to the KSA the Appellant would  go  there
    with no job, no home and no evident means of support  in  the  interim.
    His wife was not in employment at the moment and it was hard to see how
    were she to be employed in the UK there would be  sufficient  funds  to
    support the Appellant from the UK.

5.   The Appellant in  his  first  statement  indicated  that  his  reading,
    writing and numeracy skills are nominal in  Arabic  and  he  had  never
    needed to learn it properly.

6.   He said in his evidence  to  me  that  he  does  not  effectively  read
    Arabic, can speak some Arabic and has no work experience in  Arabic  or
    with the Arabic language.

7.    The  judge,  when  considering  the  matter  previously,  reached  the
    conclusion that the Appellant speaks good Arabic and can  read  Arabic.
    On what basis and evidence that view could have been arrived at I could
    not find from the papers nor any Record of Proceedings and I prefer the
    evidence before me.

8.   So far as the issue of return is  put,  it  is  said  by  reference  to
    paragraph EX.1 of  Appendix  FM  that  that  illustrates  the  kind  of
    considerations   which    show    the    Respondent's    decision    is
    disproportionate.

9.   Thus it needs consideration whether there are insurmountable  obstacles
    which the Appellant and/or his wife would face living outside of the UK
    in the KSA.   The  position  is  that  the  first  consequence  of  the
    Appellant and his wife returning is that she would  be  separated  from
    her grandmother with whom she lives and with whom she has a complicated
    emotional relationship.  Her grandmother  has  effectively  become  the
    child in the relationship and the Appellant's wife,  the  mother.   The
    grandmother simply cannot make decisions without  effectively  recourse
    to Ms Morris.  She will not make decisions and does not react  well  to
    others perceived as usurping that role Ms Morris plays.   This  problem
    has been illustrated by the fact that the Appellant's  sister  and  her
    husband with children have moved into the  home  and  attempts  by  the
    Appellant's sister have been rejected vigorously and unpleasantly  such
    that the sister and her husband with children wish to leave the home.

10.  The grandmother simply does not like any intervention by  anyone  other
    than Ms Morris.  A further illustration of this level of  irrationality
    is when in considering the change of a GP, the GP suggested referral to
    a local mental health team.  This led to the  grandmother  refusing  to
    attend that GP and reverting back to her original one.   She  does  not
    countenance any change.



11.  I do not find the Appellant faced the same difficulty with  his  mother
    with  whom  he  lives  and  with  whom  he  cares.   I  find  that  her
    circumstances are a responsibility that he has taken  on  but  not  one
    which would render his return to the KSA an insurmountable or even very
    significant obstacle.

12.  More particularly it seems to me the difficulties faced  by  Ms  Morris
    go to show why there  are  actually  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her
    making a life for herself in the KSA, even if she was prepared  to  go,
    which she is not because she will  not  abandon  her  grandmother.   Ms
    Morris's view was that as it may and there was forced separation so  be
    it but they will  be  living  apart  but  married  and  wishing  to  be
    reunited.  It is clear in the short term  Ms  Morris  simply  will  not
    contemplate going to the KSA but, I conclude  there  are  a  number  of
    significant difficulties she would face.  First, she does not speak the
    language, has no background in Arabic  and  would  be  subject  to  the
    limited lifestyle which is acknowledged to be imposed on women  in  the
    KSA.  She would therefore be restricted on being outside of the home on
    her own, she would not have a male relative to accompany her other than
    the Appellant and would not be able to leave the  home.   Secondly,  Ms
    Morris has no background in the practice of the Muslim faith, she  does
    not attend a mosque in the UK and would simply be  unable  to  publicly
    participate in any religious ceremony.  As the  background  information
    provided in the HRW report for 2017 to which I do not understand  there
    to be any material change the KSA does not tolerate public  worship  by
    adherents  of   religions   other   than   Islam   and   systematically
    discriminates against Muslim religious  minorities  including  in  such
    areas as public education, the justice system,  religious  freedom  and
    employment.

13.  The rights  of  women  are  limited  and  mean  an  adult  woman  needs
    permission from a male guardian to travel, marry  or  exit.   They  are
    required to provide  guardian  consent  in  order  to  work  or  access
    healthcare and women regularly face difficulties conducting a range  of
    transactions without a male relative,  from  renting  an  apartment  to
    filing legal claims.  All women remain  banned  from  driving  cars  in
    Saudi Arabia though it would seem that  neither  the  Appellant  or  Ms
    Morris actually drive.

14.  The freedoms  of  expression  for  women  are  therefore  noted  to  be
    limited.  Women and girls continue to face discrimination in law and in
    practice and are inadequately protected against sexual and other  forms
    of violence.  Women remain legally subordinate and inferior  in  status
    to men in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance,
    and could not access higher education, take paid employment  or  travel
    abroad without the approval of their male guardian.

15.  There is nothing to suggest the likelihood of any  material  change  in
    that position in relation to women's rights.

16.  Ms Morris is interested in health issues and is doing private  research
    into a number of issues and hopes  one  day  to  find  sponsorship  and
    funding for further research and/or work.  She currently is not working
    in paid employment but is undertaking her  studies  and  investigations
    which will form the backbone of her skills to deal with  medical/mental
    health issues.

17.  It is said that quite simply those aspects could  not  be  pursued  and
    similarly  publishing  and  promoting  her   views   in   writing   and
    publications would similarly be constrained were she to be in the  KSA.



18.  In addition the Appellant is concerned that one of  their  hobbies  and
    pastimes is the collection of figurines and images  which  he  believes
    would be regarded as offensive in the Muslim faith.  Whether that is so
    and whether it might be regarded as idolatry and  offensive  to  Sharia
    law I  do  not  know  on  the  evidence  before  me  but  that  is  his
    understanding.

19.  In addition Ms Morris has Asperger's syndrome and to some extent  there
    is a lesser degree of tolerance towards her and  she  fears  that  that
    would not assist her in making a life were she to have to in KSA.

20.  So far as  the  Appellant  is  concerned  in  terms  of  insurmountable
    obstacles they are  really  that  he  goes  there  with  no  meaningful
    background of life in KSA and that he has no contact with his  brothers
    and two sisters in the KSA.  The last contact he  had  was  around  the
    time his father died and little if any approach has been made by  those
    in the KSA to have contact with him or to involve him in the resolution
    of his father's estate and liabilities.  In addition the Appellant  and
    Ms Morris have what to some might seem an unusual relationship in  that
    they spend some time together each week but it is limited either by her
    work activities or her care for her grandmother or  his  care  for  his
    mother.

21.  Ms  Morris's  grandmother  is  able  and  fit  but  it  is  her  mental
    dependency and emotional dependency upon Ms Morris that is the  binding
    quality of the relationship.  So far as the mother of the Appellant  is
    concerned, the position is that she does not have any status in the  UK
    as yet and such appeals as she has exercised have failed.  She is not a
    national of KSA.

22.  It seemed to me that the theoretical issue of the  Appellant  making  a
    life for himself in KSA is just that but the reality of doing so  as  a
    total stranger without  support,  without  a  family  network,  without
    employment opportunities obviously available shows just  how  difficult
    life would be and whilst insurmountable obstacles do not as a fact have
    to be insurmountable it is clear that they have to be  serious,  severe
    and intrusive.  I find to me the way of life that is being required  to
    be visited  upon  the  Appellant  is  to  seek  to  make  him  overcome
    insurmountable obstacles.  I do not find that  that  is  proportionate.
    His adverse immigration history is a material factor in the sense  that
    the purpose for which he came to the UK and stayed here came to an  end
    with the death of his father and of itself staying on did not have  any
    realistic basis to do so.  There can be no criticism of the  fact  that
    Ms Morris became aware early  on  as  to  his  history  and  her  hopes
    unsurprisingly that he would be able to resolve those matters.

23.  I accept that they are in an enduring relationship  which  they  intend
    to continue.   I  find  that  the  public  interest  in  this  case  is
    outweighed by the complex personal circumstances,  particularly  of  Ms
    Morris, not just with the difficulties spoken to  in  her  evidence  as
    arose in relation to her own health which the Appellant has helped  her
    with but more in terms of their plans and wishes to be here as  husband
    and wife.  In the circumstances I  find  that  the  evidence  shows  on
    balance that there are insurmountable obstacles for them as husband and
    wife going to KSA and that plays into the issue of proportionality.   I
    conclude on the evidence referred to above and the reasons  given  that
    the Respondent's decision is disproportionate.

DECISION

The appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

ANONYMITY ORDER

No anonymity order was sought nor is one required.

FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was paid but in this case the  appeal  has  succeeded  on  the
strength of additional evidence coming forward to support the claim  and  in
these circumstances I do not find a fee award is appropriate.
