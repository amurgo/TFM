|Done at Field House                  |Decision & Reasons Promulgated       |

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant was given permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    because his grounds raised an arguable case that the hearing  had  been
    procedurally unfair.

 2. On 15 March 2019 the Respondent was directed to serve a Rule 24  Notice
    by 29 March 2019 and told that in default the Tribunal  may  allow  the
    appeal without a hearing.

 3. There has been no response to those Directions.

 4. I find that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  by  relying  on  a
    document that had not been provided to the Appellant. I set  aside  its
    decision and I order that the appeal be determined again in the  First-
    tier Tribunal.




    Notice of Decision

    The appeal is allowed. The appeal will be decided again in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 3 April 2019                   |
