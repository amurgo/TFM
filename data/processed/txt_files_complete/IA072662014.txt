                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the  rest
       of this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Handley, promulgated on 12 May 2014, allowing the  appellant's
       appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  The grounds  correctly  identify  that
       the judge gave no reasons for  considering  this  case  outside  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules.


    3. In course of submissions on remaking the decision, it became  common
       ground that the terms of the Rules for leave to remain as  a  fianc�
       are  satisfied,  apart  from  the  requirement  to  make   such   an
       application from abroad, and that the case is truly one which  turns
       on whether it is proportionate in all the circumstances to insist on
       that formality;  on  which  the  authority,  even  since  the  major
       amendments to the Rules on family and private life, is  Chikwamba  v
       SSHD [2008] Imm AR 700.

    4. I think both representatives also accepted that the position in that
       light is finely balanced.  There would be  some  delay  and  further
       expense but no great inconvenience to the appellant and his  fianc�e
       if he had to apply again from Pakistan; but there is nothing adverse
       in his immigration history, and no significant public interest to be
       served by keeping to the very letter of the Rules on this one point.
        I find that the balance falls in his favour.


    5. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside;  but  the
       appellant's appeal, as brought to the First-tier Tribunal, is  again
       allowed.
