Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms D Qureshi, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar who, in a determination promulgated on
    6 February 2014, dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  decision
    made by the respondent on 5 December 2012 to refuse her entry clearance
    to the United Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 281 HC 395.

 2. The appellant's case is that she is lawfully married to Mr Imran  Abbas
    ("the sponsor") and, having met all the requirements of  paragraph  281
    of the Immigration Rules, ought to be granted entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom.  Given that in this  case  the  application  for  entry
    clearance  was  made  on  5  July  2012,  the  relevant  paragraph  for
    consideration is paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules; by  virtue  of
    the transitional provisions set out in HC 194, this is not  a  case  to
    which the provisions of Appendix FM or Appendix FM-SE apply.

 3. The respondent refused the application on the basis  that  he  was  not
    satisfied, given the lack of evidence submitted, that the sponsor would
    be able to adequately maintain the  appellant  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without recourse to public funds.

 4. Subsequent to that decision the  couple  have  had  a  child,  born  in
    Pakistan, on 21 November 2013.  As the sponsor  was  at  that  point  a
    British citizen it appears that the child is a British citizen.

 5. The appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khawar  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 30 January 2014.  He heard evidence  from  the  sponsor
    and submissions from both representatives.  Judge Khawar found:-

      i) that the sponsor was employed as a taxi driver with a net income of
         �7,316 [15];

     ii) that, notwithstanding some doubts, that he was satisfied  that  the
         sponsor owns his own home and has let out part of the property to a
         lodger since 2007 [17] from whom he now  receives  �600  per  month
         [18] and that that money had been paid to the  sponsor  as  at  the
         date of decision;

    iii) in fact the figure of �600 could not be a net figure as it did  not
         include any deduction for income tax which would have been  payable
         nor payments towards utility bills [19];

     iv) that the relevant level of income support applicable  in  assessing
         whether there would be additional recourse to public funds would be
         �193.84 per week excluding housing costs;  that  on  an  annualised
         basis this amounts to �10,079.68 to which mortgage costs of  �3,660
         per annum and council tax of �1,111.90 to be added making  a  total
         of �14,851.58 [14]; that this was well in excess of  the  sponsor's
         income even before the deductions from the lodger's rent were taken
         into account [21] and  accordingly,  the  maintenance  requirements
         could not be satisfied.

      v) that the refusal of entry clearance was not in breach of the United
         Kingdom's obligations pursuant to Article 8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention [26].

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that:-

      i) that the judge had erred in his calculation of the relevant  income
         support payments given that he had taken into account a  child  who
         had not been born as at the date of decision and thus  had  adopted
         an incorrect figure of benefits the relevant  annual  figure  being
         �5,795.40 not �10,079.68;

     ii) that the judge had erred  in  taking  the  appellant's  child  into
         account yet not taking into account the subsequent increase in  the
         sponsor's income;

    iii) that the judge had erred in his assessment of the  sponsor's  total
         income when making deductions in respect of the lodger;

     iv) that on a proper  calculation  of  the  sponsor's  income  and  the
         relevant threshold of benefits, that there was surplus  income  and
         thus the conclusion that the appellant would need to have  recourse
         to public funds was incorrect; that the judge's approach to Article
         8 of the Human Rights Convention was incorrect.

 7. On 7 April 2014 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lloyd  granted  permission
    stating that it was arguable that the judge had taken into  account  in
    the maintenance assessment a child who had not been born at the date of
    decision.

 8. When the matter came before me Mr Tufan very fairly conceded  that  the
    judge had erred when assessing the relevant level of benefits by taking
    into account a child who not only had not been  born  at  the  date  of
    decision but had not even been conceived.  He submitted that,  however,
    this error was not material because the judge's findings  with  respect
    to the income from the lodger were unsafe and inconsistent.  Ms Qureshi
    submitted that whilst the judge had clearly been troubled by  the  late
    production of the evidence in respect of the lodger, he had nonetheless
    come to a sustainable finding of fact that  the  sponsor  did  in  fact
    receive that income from him.  She submitted that the sponsor  had  now
    made enquiries and had learned that he ought to have paid tax  on  some
    of his income although it is accepted that  there  is  a  specific  tax
    relief in respect of income earned from lodgers  of  �4,250  per  annum
    which has been in place since tax year 2009/10.

 9. I noted from the determination that it  appears  the  lodger  has  only
    being paying �700 a month since June/July 2013 [17].   Ms  Qureshi  did
    not dispute that and it was agreed  that  in  assessing  the  sponsor's
    income a figure of  �4,800  would  be  applicable  when  added  to  his
    earnings as a self-employed taxi driver.

10. I am satisfied that the judge did  err  in  assessing  the  appropriate
    level of income  support  given  that  the  child  had  not  even  been
    conceived at the date of birth.  It therefore follows that there  is  a
    significant error in his evaluation as to whether there was  sufficient
    funds available to the appellant and sponsor.

11. It is not disputed that the sponsor  received  �7,316  from  his  self-
    employment as a taxi driver.  Whilst I note that there were submissions
    made to Judge Khawar that the evidence relating to  the  rental  income
    from Mr Afzar was lacking credibility, the judge notes [17] that  there
    were a substantial volume of documents in relation to  this  indicating
    that he had lived at the sponsor's property since at least 2011;  there
    were two tenancy agreements and whilst the judge does refer  [22]  that
    even allowing for the very late production of evidence,  that  that  in
    any way undermines his clear finding at paragraph 18:

        On the totality of  evidence  produced  I  am  satisfied  that  the
        sponsor does in fact receive �600 per month from the said Mr Afzar.
         I am satisfied that he was in receipt of such sum of  money  on  a
        monthly basis as at the date of Entry Clearance Officer's  decision
        [December 2012].

12. Viewing the  determination  as  a  whole  together  with  the  evidence
    adduced, I am satisfied that Judge Khawar did make a clear  finding  of
    fact that the sponsor was in receipt of income from Mr Afzar who lodges
    with him albeit that the correct figure should  be  �400  a  month  the
    reference in paragraph 18 to the said sum being it appears a mere slip.



13. On that basis I am satisfied that as at the relevant date the sponsor's
    income was �12,116.  The relevant level of income support was �5,795.40
    to which has to be added the housing  costs  of  �3,660  and  �1,109.90
    giving a total of �10,567.30 which leaves a surplus of �1,549 over  the
    applicable level  of  income  support  once  housing  costs  have  been
    deducted.

14. It must, however, be  borne  in  mind  that  there  would  be  expenses
    incurred in respect of the tenant.  The additional payment  in  respect
    of council tax, as the sponsor would not  be  entitled  to  the  single
    person discount, is already factored in.

15. It is of  course  difficult  to  assess  in  any  meaningful  way  what
    additional expenditure by way of utility bills will  be  caused  by  an
    additional person living in the property.  It still has  to  be  heated
    and lit and water bills are not calculated  according  to  usage.   The
    surplus is  over  �100  a  month.   It  has  been  suggested  that  the
    additional expenses would be in the region of �600 and I see no  reason
    to doubt that.

16. It should be borne in mind also that the cost of utility bills is not a
    factor taken into account in assessing levels of income support;  these
    are bills which need to  be  met  in  any  event.   Accordingly,  I  am
    satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, that even allowing for
    a tax bill of �300 payable in respect of the income received  from  the
    lodger over and above the �4,250 limit (should  that  even  be  payable
    given the very low level of the sponsor's taxable income) but as at the
    date of decision the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  sufficient  income
    whereby income available to him and the appellant was greater than  the
    applicable level of income support and accordingly  the  appellant  has
    shown that she would  be  maintained  without  additional  recourse  to
    public funds.  I therefore allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    on that basis.

Summary of Conclusions

 1) The determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar did  involve  the
    making of an error of law and I set it aside.

 2) I re-make the appeal by allowing it under the Immigration Rules.
