                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Anstis, who on 25 March 2015 dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against
    the refusal by the Secretary of State to issue  him  with  a  residence
    card as the family member of an EEA  national.   The  EEA  national  in
    question is the appellant's uncle.  He is  an  Italian  national.   The
    appellant himself comes from a relatively remote village, we gather  in
    Pakistan.  He said that he had been supported by  his  uncle  following
    the death of his father and he came to this country in May of 2011  and
    it is clear that two days after his arrival he  entered  into  a  joint
    tenancy agreement of premises in which he is we gather,  still  living.
    Certainly it  was  the  address  that  was  given  and  his  uncle  was
    originally in Italy, not resident in this country, albeit would come on
    visits we gather, to this country from time to time,  but  has  been  a
    permanent resident here since 2013.

2.   The application was as we  say,  based  upon  that  relationship.   Now
    originally the Secretary of State refused on two grounds.  One was that
    it was said that  a  birth  certificate  was  necessary  to  prove  the
    relationship.  That particular ground was abandoned and rightly so  and
    so the only issue  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    appellant met  the  dependency  criteria  which  are  set  out  in  the
    Directive as applied in the relevant  Directive,  which  is  2004/38/EC
    dealing with free movement of citizens as put into domestic law by  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, S.I. 2003.

3.   It is  we  think  desirable,  that  we  should  set  out  the  relevant
    provisions both of the Directive and of the  Regulations,  because  the
    two do not entirely coincide in the sense that there are provisions  in
    the Directive which are not found in the Regulations.

4.   The appellant is treated as an extended family member and thus he  must
    be in order to qualify within  Article  2(2)(c)  of  the  Directive,  a
    direct descendant who is a  dependant  of  the  spouse  or  partner  in
    question.  The proof of such  dependency  and  indeed  relationship  if
    established entitles the individual to a residence  card  and  that  is
    dealt with by Article 10 of the Directive which provides:

         "1.  The right of residence of family members of  a  Union  citizen
             who are not nationals of a member state shall be evidenced  by
             the issuing of a document called 'Residence card of  a  family
             member of a Union citizen' no later than six months  from  the
             date on which they submit the application."

5.   Then by 10.2 it is provided:

         "2.  For the residence card  to  be  issued,  member  states  shall
             require presentation of the following documents:

             (a)  a valid passport;

             (b)  a  document  attesting  to  the  existence  of  a  family
                  relationship or of a registered partnership;

             (c)  the registration certificate or,  in  the  absence  of  a
                  registration system, any other proof of residence  in  the
                  host member state of  the  Union  citizen  whom  they  are
                  accompanying or joining;

             (d)  in cases falling under points  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article
                  2(2), documentary evidence that the conditions  laid  down
                  therein are met."

6.   And as  we  say,  2(2)(c)  is  the  relevant  provision  and  thus  the
    Directive requires documentary evidence that the conditions are met and
    one of the conditions is a condition of dependency.

7.   One goes then to the 2006 Regulations and finds that it  is  Article  8
    that deals with extended family member and provides by 8.2  so  far  as
    material

         "a person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the  person
         is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his  civil  partner
         and -

         (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a)",

    that is to say that he is or was residing in a country other  than  the
    United Kingdom and was dependent upon the EEA national or a  member  of
    his household,

             "has joined  the  EEA  national  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
             continues to be dependent upon him or to be a  member  of  his
             household."

8.   There is no question here of being a member of  household  and  so  the
    question is whether, not only that he is  dependent  upon  him  in  the
    United Kingdom, but that he was dependent upon him when he was residing
    in a country other than the United Kingdom, and so that in  this  case,
    what has to be established, is that there was prior  dependency  before
    he arrived  in  this  country  in  May  2011  and  there  is  continued
    dependency since his arrival here.

9.   Paragraph 17 of the Regulations deals with the  issue  of  a  residence
    card and that requires that essentially by paragraph 17(4)  that  there
    be proof.  Paragraph (4) reads:

         "(4) The Secretary of State  may  issue  a  residence  card  to  an
             extended family member",

    for the purposes of this case,

             "who is not an EEA national on application if -

             (a)  the relevant EEA national in  relation  to  the  extended
                  family member is a qualified person  or  an  EEA  national
                  with a  permanent  right  of  residence  and  in  all  the
                  circumstances  it  appears  to  the  Secretary  of   State
                  appropriate to issue the relevant card.

         (5)  Where the Secretary of State  receives  an  application  under
             paragraph (4) he shall undertake an extensive  examination  of
             the personal circumstances of the applicant and if he  refuses
             the application shall  give  reasons  justifying  the  refusal
             unless  this  is  contrary  to  the  interests   of   national
             security",

    which is not material for the purposes of this case, and it  is  to  be
    noted  that  there  is  no  specific  requirement  that  there  be  the
    production of documentary evidence, merely that there be proof.

10.  However, it is clear, that as a matter of law, the  Directive  prevails
    over any domestic law and therefore it would be  open  clearly  to  the
    Secretary of State to refuse on the basis of a lack of any  documentary
    evidence simply relying on that and not accepting that the  say  so  of
    either the applicant or the sponsor was sufficient.  Equally, if  there
    is documentary evidence produced, it is clearly material to consider if
    there are gaps in the documentary evidence and whether nonetheless  the
    proof exists, proof of course being on the balance of probabilities  in
    the circumstances of a case such as this.

11.  Now there was documentary material produced and before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and both the appellant and his uncle attended  and  gave
    evidence.  However, the documentary material produced did not cover the
    whole of the necessary period and there were undoubtedly  gaps  in  it.
    So far as the approach is concerned  that  the  judge  was  obliged  to
    apply,  he  sets  out  under  the  heading  "Discussion  Law"  in  four
    paragraphs his approach and he notes two  decisions  of  this  Tribunal
    which first indicate that the test he has to run is purely factual, and
    a case from the European Court of Justice that  makes  the  point  that
    material support, is support in order to meet the  essential  needs  of
    the individual which would amount to dependency and a decision of  this
    Tribunal in Moneke [2011] UKUT 00341 which made the  point  that  where
    able-bodied  people  of  mature  years  claimed  to  have  always  been
    dependent upon remittances from a  sponsor,  then  that  should  invite
    particular close scrutiny as to why this should  be  the  case  and  we
    gather from Mr Bramble, who led us further in that  decision,  that  Mr
    Justice Blake, who  gave  that  judgment,  referred  to  the  issue  of
    documentary evidence.

12.  In paragraphs 19 to 23, the judge considered the  documentary  evidence
    that existed and also referred to  that  which  was  absent  and  whose
    absence was in his view material.  Mr Hossain accepts that his  summary
    of the payments shown  in  the  documentary  material  is  correct  and
    essentially those payments showed that in relation to the  time  before
    the appellant came to the United Kingdom,  there  were  three  payments
    amounting to between �400 and �500 each and once he was in  the  United
    Kingdom there were payments documented which showed a total under  some
    �500.  He did say in  paragraph  23,  that  there  was  no  documentary
    evidence of any payment by Mr Ali of school or other education fees  in
    Pakistan or of tuition fees in the United Kingdom.  So far as school or
    other education fees in Pakistan is concerned that is correct.  So  far
    as tuition fees in the United Kingdom is concerned that is correct,  in
    the sense that there is no direct payment. However, it is  possible  to
    marry up a payment on 24 February to the  appellant's  account  with  a
    payment from that account to the educational establishment which he was
    then attending.  However, the fact is that that  is  the  only  payment
    which can be married up.  So there is a factual error it would seem  in
    paragraph 23.  However, it is not in our judgment an error which is  of
    any real substance in the context  of  the  consideration  of  all  the
    material.

13.  The judge summarised his conclusions, by saying that there was  a  need
    for close scrutiny and that is undoubtedly correct and there  was  very
    little documentary evidence while the appellant was  in  Pakistan.   He
    goes on in paragraph 28, that he was conscious that in a case involving
    family arrangements, people might not keep full records and in addition
    he and his uncle had both moved countries and that might also mean that
    there no records.  But he said nevertheless, if it had  been  the  case
    that his uncle was supporting the appellant and his family  with  their
    essential needs during this time, he would have expected  there  to  be
    more documentary evidence showing that this was done and he  then  went
    on to indicate in paragraph 29, why he was not persuaded, because there
    had not been an explanation for gaps during the period that  he  was  a
    student here and he concluded that he had not  heard  evidence  of  any
    dependency that the appellant might  have  on  his  uncle,  other  than
    provision of finance to meet essential needs.

14.  Reliance has been placed by Mr Hossain on the existence  of  a  tenancy
    agreement which was entered into  jointly  by  the  appellant  and  his
    uncle, as we have  indicated,  on  5  May  2011,  two  days  after  the
    appellant arrived in this country, and that was  a  document  that  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, but it does not seem to have been
    relied on specifically as an indication of dependency and certainly  it
    is not referred to at  all  in  the  very  lengthy  grounds  that  were
    submitted on the appellant's behalf on his  application  for  leave  to
    appeal to the Tribunal.

15.  In itself, it goes no further than indicating that there was  indeed  a
    joint tenancy, but it does not show that his uncle was responsible  for
    the whole of the rent which  in  fact  amounted  to  �700  a  month  in
    accordance with the agreement and it may well be that it was  for  that
    reason that it  was  not  relied  on  specifically  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant below or indeed in the grounds  of  appeal,  because  it  was
    recognised that  in  itself,  it  could  not  establish  the  necessary
    dependency.

16.  In granting leave to appeal, the First-tier Tribunal Judge stated  that
    given the fact that the judge accepted corroboration of some support in
    Pakistan prior to coming to the UK and in the UK after arriving, it was
    arguable that sufficient reason had not been given  for  rejecting  the
    evidence of the appellant and the sponsor that this  support  continued
    despite a lack of corroboratory evidence.  With great  respect  to  the
    judge, that is not a proper approach for considering  that  the  appeal
    should have been granted and that there was an error of law.  The judge
    does explain why he rejected the evidence of dependency or  rather  why
    he did not accept that the evidence of dependency showed the  necessary
    level of dependency.  That was in our judgment an issue of fact  and  a
    conclusion which cannot be shown to have been an irrational conclusion,
    because that is the test that has to be applied in showing  that  there
    was an error of law.  The fact is regrettably, that  permission  should
    not have been granted and the additional costs incurred and indeed  the
    hopes given to the appellant were not properly given.

17.  One other matter we would mention although it does not  arise  directly
    in the context of our decision, is that Mr Bramble pointed out that the
    appellant's uncle's residence card in  Italy  and  passport  both  were
    dated in 2011, indeed one in August, the  other  in  September  and  so
    after the appellant had come to this country,  and  he  suggested  that
    this might indicate on the face of things that his  uncle  was  not  an
    Italian citizen or Italian national at  any  material  time  while  the
    appellant was in Pakistan or indeed when he arrived  in  this  country.
    If that is indeed correct, then he could  not  qualify  in  any  event,
    because he could not show that his uncle was an Italian national at any
    material time.

18.  However, that was not an issue that was  raised  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  It was not an issue taken before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    and the fact that those two documents have those  dates,  does  not  of
    itself establish that that reflects the time when the uncle  became  an
    Italian citizen.  They may  simply  have  been  necessary  renewals  of
    previous acceptances of citizenship and nationality but as we say,  and
    Mr Bramble accepted this, it is not a matter that we can directly  take
    into account in deciding this appeal and we have not done so,  but  for
    the reasons that we have given this appeal must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law material to the outcome of the appeal.

We therefore do not set aside the decision

No anonymity direction is made.
