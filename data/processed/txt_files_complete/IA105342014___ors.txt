                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Khan, Counsel (instructed by Simon Noble
Solicitors)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted on 27 October 2014  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge Baird against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge Hindson allowing the Respondents' linked  appeals  against
           the Secretary of State's refusal to issue them with Registration
           Certificates pursuant to regulations 6 and 7 of the  Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended) ("the EEA
           Regulations").  The determination was promulgated on  1  October
           2014.


      2.    The Respondents are all nationals of Italy, save for the  Second
           Appellant who is a national of Bangladesh.  They are  a  family.
           Their applications had been refused  because  the  Secretary  of
           State had been unable to verify that  the  First  Appellant  was
           employed as claimed.  He had not proved that he was a  qualified
           person with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
           2006.


      3.    Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  Designated  Judge  Baird
           because she considered that it was  arguable  that  the  judge's
           findings in  favour  of  the  First  Respondent  were  based  on
           inadequate evidence.


      4.    Mr Staunton for the Appellant indicated  at  the  start  of  the
           error of law hearing that, having reviewed the appeal papers and
           permission  to  appeal  application,  he  wished  to   make   no
           submissions.


      5.    Mr Khan for the Respondent asked  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
           should be dismissed.


      6.    In the tribunal's view, it had been open to the judge  to  reach
           his decision.  The evidence put forward by the  Respondents  was
           not perhaps of the strongest and perhaps the  judge's  reasoning
           at [17] of his determination  might  with  advantage  have  been
           fuller.  But it was sufficient, bearing  in  mind  that  he  had
           received oral evidence. The Secretary of State was right to make
           no submissions today.  There was no material error of law.   The
           appeal is dismissed.


      DECISION


      There was no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      determination.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.


      The original decision stands unchanged.


      Signed                                  Dated
