                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant  appeals  with  permission  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ferguson which was signed on 25  July  2018  promulgated
    shortly thereafter,  in  which  the  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal to issue a  permanent  residence  card  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 was refused.   The  appellant
    had applied for permanent residence on the basis  that  she  had  spent
    five years in the United Kingdom as the dependant of an  EEA  national,
    namely her brother-in-law, and had sought recognition of that from  the
    respondent.

 2. The initial application  was  refused  on  the  basis  that  there  was
    evidence showing that the appellant had lived at  a  different  address
    from the sponsor and although the sponsor's exercise of  treaty  rights
    had been accepted, there was no evidence of  continuing  dependency  or
    membership of the same household.  The appellant had relied on problems
    within the marriage between her sister and the sponsor to  explain  the
    use of different addresses but there had  been  no  evidence  that  the
    application could be put  forward  on  the  basis  of  retained  rights
    following divorce as there was no evidence that a divorce had  actually
    taken place.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant had not established dependency  or  membership  of  the  same
    household for the requisite period.  That was essentially on the  basis
    of a lack of cogent evidence before the Tribunal to  show  either.   At
    the hearing, it was not actively pursued on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    that she had been dependent on the sponsor for  the  entire  five  year
    period and there was a dispute as to membership of the same  household,
    as the appellant accepted that she had permanently  moved  out  of  the
    address where the sponsor resided at the latest on 1 April 2014.  There
    was also an issue before the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  the  relevant
    start date for the qualifying period, whether that was  from  when  the
    appellant entered the United Kingdom  with  the  benefit  of  a  family
    permit, following which she applied for an EEA residence card which was
    not issued until some eighteen months later, or whether the  five  year
    period ran from 31 August 2010, when a residence  card  was  ultimately
    issued following a successful appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal found that the Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006, in particular  Regulation  7(iii),  were  clear
    that the intervening periods between the family  permit  ending  on  28
    December 2008 and the residence card being issued  on  31  August  2010
    could not be counted as part of a period of five years for the purposes
    of permanent residence.  The start date was therefore 31 August 2010.

 5. In paragraph 22 of the decision, the appellant's evidence and  position
    as to whether she was a member of the sponsor's household was  set  out
    with findings as follows:

         "... the Appellant accepted in her oral evidence that she moved out
         of [sponsor's address] permanently on 1 April 2014.  She also moved
         her GP services and notified  her  employer  of  her  new  address.
         Whatever the position was before that date, the Appellant certainly
         ceased to be a member of [the sponsor's] household from that  date.
         There is also no evidence of dependence  at  any  time,  let  alone
         after that date.  Apart from a  vague  assertion  that  her  sister
         would give her cash from the joint account, there is no evidence of
         any financial support and it is difficult to see  why  any  support
         would be required for the appellant's basic needs  given  that  she
         had stable employment and was earning more than ï¿½1,000 a month net.
          The appellant's sister did not attend to give evidence but even if
         her letter was taken at face  value  it  does  not  come  close  to
         establishing dependency."

 6. The conclusion followed therefore that the appellant had not  satisfied
    the conditions of being treated as a family member for  the  continuous
    period of five years and the appeal must be dismissed.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal did however deal with the alternative dates  in
    an argument put on behalf of  the  appellant  in  paragraph  24,  which
    states:

         "Even if I am wrong about the start date and the correct date was 5
         July 2008 when the appellant arrived in the UK, the  appellant  has
         not established that she remained dependent on [the sponsor]  or  a
         member of his household for a continuous  five  year  period  after
         that date.  Having been issued with  a  residence  card  in  August
         2010, there is evidence of the appellant having resided at at least
         three different addresses other than the [sponsor's address] before
         moving  to  [new  address].   The  appellant  has  not  provided  a
         satisfactory explanation for this.   She  has  not  explained  what
         these addresses were, how long  she  lived  in  each  or  what  her
         relationship was with her  sister  and  the  sponsor  during  those
         periods.  The assertion that she directed correspondence  to  these
         addresses in order to ensure she received them does not support her
         argument that she remained a member of  the  household  throughout.
         She was also employed from July 2011 onwards.  I note that  neither
         the appellant's sister nor the sponsor attended  to  give  evidence
         and the appellant's sister's letter does not address the  issue  of
         whether the appellant was part of the household prior to 2014.   No
         proper explanation was given for their absence."

 8. The appellant's grounds of appeal to this  Tribunal  were  first,  that
    there was an error in law in the start date to be  considered  for  the
    five-year period  for  permanent  residence.   The  intervening  period
    between the expiry of the family permit and issue of a  residence  card
    should have been counted as part of the qualifying period given in part
    the passage of time between the application for a residence card whilst
    the family permit was still valid and it being issued some considerable
    time later following a successful appeal.  The second ground of  appeal
    is essentially that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  as  to  the
    assessment of dependency by reference  to  the  cases  of  Lim  (EEA  -
    dependency) [2013] UKUT 437 in the Upper Tribunal  and  Moneke  (EEA  -
    OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341 (IAC) in the Upper  Tribunal,  although
    that is not expanded upon in the grounds at all.  The grounds of appeal
    make no challenge to the factual findings about the lack of evidence of
    dependency and membership of the household.  They are not criticised or
    even mentioned in the grounds of appeal at all.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission in this case  on  the  basis
    that both grounds were arguable with no further comment or interaction.
     In my view, that grant of permission to appeal was erroneous as  there
    was no challenge to the clear factual findings on the  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, such that neither ground of appeal could  even
    arguably be material to the outcome of the appeal.

10. In relation to the first ground of appeal, whether  or  not  the  start
    date was 2008 or 2010, the Tribunal  made  clear  factual  findings  on
    either premise that the appellant simply had not established dependency
    or membership of the household for the continuous  requisite  five-year
    period.  Similarly, in relation to dependency, the First-tier  Tribunal
    did not ask a specific question as suggested in the grounds  of  appeal
    as to whether the appellant could support herself,  that  was  not  the
    reasons for the finding in paragraph 22.  The findings were  made  that
    there was no  dependency  because  there  was  simply  no  evidence  of
    financial support for the requisite period.  The vague  assertion  from
    the appellant's sister being far from sufficient to establish any  such
    claim.   On  this  factual  basis,  the  appeal  had  to  be  dismissed
    regardless of any of the further  matters  raised  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  For these reasons the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    stands, it contains no errors of law that  could  be  material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
