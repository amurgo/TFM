                                            DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. These are   appeals by Rabia Banu Ilyas Patel and  her  four  children,
    Masira Ilyas Musa Patel, Munira Ilyas Patel, Mahmedhuzaifa Ilyas  Patel
    and Hanzlah Ilyas Patel, all citizens of India. The dates of  birth  of
    the Appellants are, 27th October 1972, 17th October 1992, 4th May 1994,
    21st July 1996 and 26th July 2000 respectively. They    appeal  against
    the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies  issued  on  18th
    October 2011 dismissing their  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent made  on  30th  November  2010  to  refuse  to  grant  entry
    clearance to the appellants as the spouse  and  children  of  a  person
    present and settled in the UK.

 2. No request was made for anonymity and since none of the children are in
    the UK we do not consider an Anonymity Direction to be necessary.

 3. On 15th December 2011  a  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  granted
    permission to appeal against the  determination  of  Judge  Davies.  He
    said,

         "The appeals were dismissed because the IJ was not  satisfied  that
         the first Appellant and her husband intended to live  together  and
         he was not satisfied  that  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules were met.

         Permission to appeal was sought on the basis that the IJ had made a
         mistake  of  fact  in  that  he  mixed  up   two   visitor's   visa
         determinations in finding that there was an  inconsistency  in  the
         First Appellant's case about whether she and her husband were in  a
         relationship or not. Paragraphs 4  to  6  of  the  grounds  seeking
         permission refer to this and they are arguable.

         It is also arguable that the IJ fell into error of law in  that  he
         made no findings on certain  aspects  of  the  evidence  that  were
         before him. There appears to have been evidence of contact and  the
         Appellant's husband was himself in work. The IJ does not appear  to
         have taken into account the husband's income in calculating whether
         adequate maintenance would be available and he does not  appear  to
         have made any findings on the evidence of  telephone  contact  that
         was before him.   It  is  also  arguable  that  the  IJ's  findings
         concerning the ability of the third party sponsor family to provide
         some support are irrational. "

 4. Judge Davies found that the first appellant's marriage to  the  sponsor
    was not subsisting. He dismissed the claim that third party support  is
    available.  He rejected the claim that the First Appellant had arranged
    employment in the UK that would give her an income sufficient to  cover
    the deficit, estimated at  that  time  to  be  around   �57  per  week,
    required to make up the difference between the funds available and  the
    relevant Income Support Level.

 5. At the start of the hearing before us Mr  Harrison  conceded  that  the
    marriage is subsisting and that there is no issue of accommodation.  We
    do not therefore propose to deal  with  the  grounds  relative  to  the
    confusion over the two visit visa determinations which  relate  to  the
    subsistence of the marriage.

The issue of maintenance

 6.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  dealt  with  the  applications   under
    Paragraphs 281 and 297 of the Immigration Rules (HC395  (as  amended)).
    The maintenance requirements insofar as relevant to  this  appeal   are
    set out at Paragraphs 281 (iv) and (v) and are,

         281 (v) the parties  will be able to maintain  themselves  and  any
         dependants adequately without recourse to public funds;

         297(v) can, and will,  be  maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents, or relative  the    child  is  seeking  to  join,  without
         recourse to public funds; and

 7. The Entry Clearance Officer  did not give any detailed reasons for  his
    refusal of the application on maintenance  grounds but  relied  on  the
    fact that the appellants had not established a  relationship  with  the
    sponsor so  had not established that they could  be maintained  without
    recourse to public funds.

 8. In KA  and Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065
    the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal said,

         'The requirement of adequacy is objective. The level of income  and
         other benefits that would be available if the family  were  drawing
         income support remains the yardstick.'

 9. It was agreed before us that the appellants were  required  to  show  a
    total  weekly income of �473.18, (income support level of  �102.75  for
    the sponsor and his wife and �57.57 for each of four  children  plus  a
    Family Premium of �17.40 and Council Tax of �20 per week).It  was  also
    accepted that the sponsor had a weekly income of  �279.15 resulting  in
    a shortfall of �91.28 per week.

10. The sponsor had savings in his account with Santander Bank at the  date
    of decision and these can be taken into account.  The  bank  statements
    before the Entry Clearance Officer were  up to 16th November  2010  and
    at that date the savings amounted to  �3268.97.  Additional  statements
    provided subsequent to the decision, show that the balance  as  at  the
    date of decision, 30th November,  was only  �2328.69. Mr Stone  adopted
    the higher figure and we accept that the calculation should be based on
    that higher level of savings. There was no objection to  this  from  Mr
    Harrison.

11. In Jahangara Begum and others (maintenance - savings) Bangladesh [2011]
    UKUT 00246 (IAC) the Tribunal said,


         "Where the likely income of a  family  falls  below  the  level  of
         adequacy as established in the case of KA and others  (Adequacy  of
         Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 the shortfall can  be  met
         where  there  are  sufficient savings .  The  assessment  of  the
         appropriate level of savings  is not an arbitrary calculation  and
         the proper reference is to the length of the initial  visa.  If  an
         appellant is able to meet the  requirements  of  adequacy  for  the
         period of the initial visa, and there is no reason to believe  that
         he will not be able to meet the  maintenance  requirements  in  the
         longer term, then he is entitled to entry clearance."

12. In this case the period of the initial visa would be  2  years  or  104
    weeks so dividing �3268.97 by 104 would add �31.43 to the weekly income
    of the sponsor and reduce the shortfall to �59.85 per week.

13. Judge Davies heard and rejected evidence that a job would be  available
    to the first appellant on entry to the UK. Although  that  finding  was
    challenged by Mr Stone Judge Davies gave sound reasons for reaching his
    finding and the challenge by Mr Stone was no more than  a  disagreement
    with that finding. We do not disturb that finding.

14. Judge Davies heard evidence  from Mr Dalal who had  offered  third-part
    support. In accordance with Mahad [2009] UKSC 16 the provision of third
    party support has to be considered  very  carefully  in  terms  of  the
    credibility of the offer, the availability of the funds and the  likely
    duration that such support is available. Mr Dalal has a wife and  three
    children to support. He is in receipt  of  tax  credits.  Judge  Davies
    rejected his evidence that he was willing and  able  to  provide  third
    party support, taking the view  that  although  he  could  supply  free
    accommodation to the appellants he was not in  a  position  to  provide
    funds for their maintenance.  Judge Davies did  not  take  account,  in
    reaching his findings, that Mr Dalal  had  produced  a  bank  statement
    showing funds of over �107,000 on 14th September 2010, albeit  dropping
    to �692.90 by 15th November 2010 (the date of decision the  subject  of
    the appeal is 30th November 2011). There was no explanation what  those
    funds were, why they appeared in the account or why they fell by such a
    degree in such a relatively short period of  time.  It  was  not  clear
    whether and to what extent the sum of money shown in  the  account  had
    been taken into account in calculating the tax credit paid to Mr Dalal.
    Even though we have not  been  provided  with  an  explanation  of  the
    provenance of the funds we are not satisfied that the funds  that  were
    available on the date of decision were available  for  the  appellants;
    whatever the funds were, Mr Dalal clearly required  them  for  his  own
    purposes, hence the substantial and significant drop over a period of 2
    months. We have paid no regard to the existence of those sums of  money
    because we do not accept  that  they  are  available  to  Mr  Dalal  to
    distribute to the appellants.

15. Bearing in mind the careful scrutiny to  be  given  where  third  party
    support is proposed, we cannot be satisfied  that  Mr  Dalal  is  in  a
    position in any event to provide  such  support.  His  savings  do  not
    amount to a sum of great significance on the date of the decision;  his
    own personal income is clearly insufficient to enable  him  to  support
    his own family, never mind contribute to the support of  another,  even
    for a short period of time. If he  were  to  provide  funds  for  these
    appellants his own finances would be reduced and his own  family  would
    fall below what is deemed by the government to be an  acceptable  level
    of income (otherwise he would not have been in receipt of tax credits).
    We therefore do not accept  that  Mr  Dalal  is  able  to  provide  the
    proposed third party support.

16.  Mr Stone sought to persuade us that  the shortfall   in the  sponsor's
    income could be made up by the first appellant finding work before  the
    sponsor's savings ran out and that any deficit  could  be  made  up  by
    third party support.  There was no evidence before Judge Davies and  no
    evidence before  us  that  supported  the  submission  that  the  first
    appellant would be able to find work; the job  offer  was  rejected  by
    Judge Davies. For the reasons ([15]-[16]) above we do not  accept  that
    there is possible third party support. We reject these submissions.

Decision

17.  Although there was an error of law by the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    such that the  decision  is  set  aside,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
    appellants will not be supported adequately without recourse to  public
    funds; we therefore dismiss the appeal.

Application to withdraw two appeals by Mr Stone

18. At the commencement  of  the  hearing  Mr  Stone  stated  that  he  had
    instructions to seek our consent to the withdrawal of  the  appeals  of
    the  fourth  and  fifth  Appellants,  the  two  youngest  children.  He
    submitted that if these appeals were withdrawn, it  would  be  possible
    for the maintenance  requirements to be recalculated on the basis  that
    there were only two children to support and it would then be open to us
    to find  that  the  maintenance   requirements  were  met  because  the
    available funds would have to maintain only two children and not  four.
    We were of the view that at that  time  Mr  Stone  did  not  have  such
    instructions, the sponsor being then on the phone to his  wife  seeking
    her agreement to this course of action. We reminded  him  that  he  was
    acting for the appellants and that his instructions had  to  come  from
    them.  After a brief adjournment he was able  to tell us  that  he  had
    the  direct  instructions  of  the  first   appellant   together   with
    instructions from his instructing solicitors to withdraw   the  appeals
    of the two youngest children and arrangements had been made  for  their
    care. He was hopeful that successful applications for  entry  clearance
    could be made for these two children at a later date. It  was  apparent
    that Mr Stone sought withdrawal of these two appeals on the basis  that
    with two fewer appeals  the  money  available  could  be  redistributed
    between the remaining three  appellants  and  the  appeals  would  thus
    succeed.

19. We informed Mr Stone that it was our view,  for  the  reasons  set  out
    below, that if the appeals of the two youngest children were  withdrawn
    it would not make any difference to the calculation of monies available
    for maintenance. We asked  if  in  those  circumstances  he  still  had
    instructions  to  request  withdrawal  of  those  two  appeals  and  he
    confirmed he did. We agreed to their withdrawal. We have  prepared  and
    shall issue with this determination  Notices in the prescribed form  in
    accordance  with  paragraph  17  of   The  Tribunal  Procedure   (Upper
    Tribunal)  Rules 2008 confirming the withdrawal of the appeals of:

         Appeal no. OA/01869/2011 - Mahmedhuzaifa Ilyas Patel

         Appeal no.  OA/01876/2011 - Hanzlah Ilyas Patel

         (b) the Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining
         at the time of the decision to refuse.


FINDINGS

23. All five applications were decided by  the  ECO,  refused  and  appeals
    submitted. The decisions the subject of this appeal were taken together
    on the basis of evidence put forward by the applicants at that time  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer, such evidence to be considered to apply to
    all of the applicants. The appealable  decisions  are  the  refusal  to
    issue entry clearance. The grounds upon  which  the  appellants  relied
    were that the decisions were not in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules. The evidence to be considered at the appeal is the evidence that
    was before the ECO together with evidence submitted later provided that
    the subsequent evidence appertains to circumstances at the time of  the
    decision to refuse.  Of particular relevance here is s85(5)(b).

24. The withdrawal of two appeals does not alter the fact that  a  decision
    was taken by the ECO on the basis of the applications and the  evidence
    before him/her ie that the five  applicants  failed  to  meet  all  the
    criteria set out in the Immigration Rules. It is those  decisions  that
    were the subject of the appeal before Judge  Davies  and  it  is  those
    decisions that are the subject of the appeal before us. That two of the
    appellants are no longer appellants does not alter the decision  to  be
    taken by us (or Judge Davies had they withdrawn before him) namely were
    the decisions taken by the ECO that the appellants  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules correct.  The  withdrawal  of  an
    appeal does not withdraw the decision of the ECO or the application.

25. At  the  time  of  the  decision  the  funds  were  available  for  all
    applicants. To redistribute those existing funds to the remaining three
    appellants requires a post decision change in evidence because the need
    to do so  was  not  apparent  until  the  decision  had  been  made,  a
    circumstance not appertaining to the date of decision  as  required  by
    s85(5)(b). In the appeal before the Tribunal, the funds in existence at
    the date of decision are allocated  to  all  applicants.  If  there  is
    insufficient money to finance all applicants at the date  of  decision,
    that  remains  the  case  post  decision  because  there  can   be   no
    reallocation.

26. It was not submitted to  us  that  had  the  ECO  taken  his  decisions
    sequentially then three of the appellants would have succeeded  because
    there  would  have  been  adequate  funds   available.   However   that
    submission, if it had been made, is in any  event  flawed:  it  is  not
    possible to state in what order  the  ECO  would  have  approached  the
    applications and decision making and thus it cannot be  said  that  the
    two appellants who have withdrawn their appeals would have been the two
    appellants whom the ECO would have found there  were  inadequate  funds
    available; they could have been the subject of decisions 2 & 3 and  not
    decisions 4 & 5. Furthermore on reaching decision 3, the ECO would have
    been aware that there was only adequate finance available for one  more
    applicant.  At  that  stage,  unless  the  applicants  had   themselves
    indicated that they wished the applications considered in a  particular
    order there would be no rational basis on which to choose to allow  one
    of the remaining three over the other two. To choose  one  outwith  any
    rational basis would render the ECO open to sustainable accusations  of
    irrationality. This would particularly be  the  case  where  there  are
    minor children given that the specific application was for  the  family
    to travel together to join the sponsor in the UK. If the order  is  not
    indicated then each applicant would have to be treated as the last  one
    given the finite funds available and the knowledge that  there  were  a
    number of applications for the same group of dependants.

27. The ECO was not asked to make a decision on  the  money  available  for
    five in fact being available for three. There has been no decision made
    on the basis upon which the appellant sought to argue and there  is  no
    appeal before us on that.

28. Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
    and Fundamental Freedoms was not raised either  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or before us.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does contain an error  of  law  such
that the decision is set aside to be remade.

The appeals are dismissed under the Immigration Rules save  for  Appeal  no.
OA/01869/2011 - Mahmedhuzaifa Ilyas Patel and Appeal  no.   OA/01876/2011  -

No Anonymity Direction is made.
