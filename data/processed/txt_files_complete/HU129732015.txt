Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Ahmed, Counsel instructed by Jj Law Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the Respondent as "the Appellant"  as  he  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  His  date  of  birth  is  2
    February 1973.  He made an application for entry clearance to join  his
    partner, Safia Sayed, (the Sponsor) here.  That application was refused
    by the ECO on 10 August 2015.  The Appellant appealed  and  his  appeal
    was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Boyes.

3.       The ECO was granted permission by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Ford on 16 August 2017, but on 2 September sought renewal, based on the
    interpretation of Judge Ford's decision that he had refused  permission
    on grounds 1 and 2 and granted permission on ground 3 only.

4.       Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan, in his decision on 29 September  2017,
    concluded, on a proper construction of the grant of  permission,  Judge
    Ford did not limit the grant of permission. He decided that the ECO was
    entitled to argue ground 1. In any event, Judge Jordan  concluded  that
    in his view ground 1 is arguable.  There was no specific  reference  to
    ground 2. However, in the  light  of  paragraph  1  of  Judge  Jordan's
    decision, it is clear he concluded that Judge Ford  decision  was  that
    all grounds are arguable.  There was no issue  taken  by  Mr  Ahmed  in
    respect of the grant of permission and Judge Jordan's decision.

 5.  It is necessary to set out the salient parts of the ECO's decision;

         "With your application you have provided an employment  letter  and
         payslips from Tactical Finishing Solutions Ltd  and  an  employment
         letter and pays slips from Completely Care.  Official  checks  made
         wither Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK regarding
         your sponsor's income have revealed the following:


         For the 2014/2015 tax year HMRC records show the following


      1)  Completely Care Total Pay �9,351.90 Total tax �0.00
      2)  Tactical Finishing Solutions Ltd - Total Pay �4,678.26  Total  tax
         �935.60

     You state on your Appendix 2 that  your  Sponsor  earned  �20,762  from
         employment with Tactical Finishing Solutions Ltd.  The HMRC  checks
         have revealed that your Sponsor  actually  earned  only  �9,351.90.
         You made no mention on your  Appendix  2  of  any  employment  with
         Completely Care.  However, the HMRC checks have revealed that  your
         Sponsor earned �4,678.26, making a total of  �14,030.16.   This  is
         below the income threshold.  Given this I am satisfied  that  false
         representations have been made in your application."

6.   The judge heard evidence from the Sponsor, her father and brother.  The
    Sponsor's evidence was that she was, at the material time, employed  by
    Completely Care Ltd and Tactical Finishing Solutions Ltd.  Her evidence
    in respect of Completely Care Ltd was not  in  dispute  and  the  judge
    accepted that during the material tax year the Sponsor earned �9,351.90
    from this employment.  However, her evidence  was  that  she  was  also
    employed by Tactical Finishing Solutions and received a gross salary of
    �20,762.00. She submitted documentary evidence in support of this.

7.   In relation to this aspect of the case, the judge  made  the  following
    findings;

         "19. There is no  force  in  the  Respondent's  argument  that  the
             Sponsor's claimed income  with  Tactical  Finishing  Solutions
             Limited is not reflected in the records held by HM Revenue and
             Customs.  As asserted by the Appellant, the claimed employment
             only began on the 1 September 2014 and so the recorded  income
             of �4678.26 would only be for a  7  month  period.   The  only
             basis upon which the  Respondent  asserts  that  there  was  a
             misrepresentation at the time of the application is in respect
             of the amount that the Sponsor earned in that employment.  The
             burden of proof is on the Respondent where  an  allegation  of
             deception is made.  The Respondent  has  not  shown  that  the
             Appellant made that particular misrepresentation.


         20.  However, that is not the  end  of  the  matter,  even  if  the
             Respondent is unable to demonstrate deception, the  burden  of
             proving that the Sponsor was in the  employment  concerned  at
             the time of application falls upon the Appellant  because  the
             Respondent does not accept that the financial requirements are
             met.


         21.  The Respondent has produced  a  document  verification  report
             dated the 16 June 2015.  In that report HM Revenue and Customs
             recorded a nil turnover and trading profits for 2013  Tactical
             Finishing Solutions Limited and that the company was  recorded
             as 'Company Dormant'.


         22.  Checks were also on the history of the company.  The following
             website link was checked:


       https://companycheck.co.uk/company/07891456/TACTICAL-FINISHING-
                                SOLUTIONS-LTD


         23.  The checks found that the company was listed as a non  trading
             company with Companies House and that the latest returns  were
             overdue.  It can also be seen from the link concerned that the
             nature of the business is listed  as  'packaging  activities'.
             The last accounts were made up to the 31 December  2013.   Two
             directors are listed, Mr Mukhtar Ahmed, who was  appointed  on
             23 December 2011 and  resigned  on  9  January  2013,  and  Mr
             Mohammed Hussain who was appointed as  a  Director  on  the  9
             January 2013.


         24.  The Appellant has provided two letters from Tactical Finishing
             Solutions dated 23 March 2015 and 23 April 2015.  The  letters
             are signed by Mr Mukhtar Ahmed, Director.   According  to  the
             above link he was not a Director of the company in 2015.


         25.  On the wage slips provided it records that Tactical  Finishing
             Solutions Limited paid the Sponsor by BACs.  There are no bank
             transfers from Tactical Finishing Solutions to  the  Sponsor's
             account, only credits which it is claimed  are  from  Tactical
             Finishing Solutions.  I asked the Sponsor how her salary  from
             Tactical Finishing Solutions was credited to her  account  and
             she  said  that  the  credits  could  be  seen  on  the   bank
             statements, but she did not know how the money  got  into  her
             account.


         26.  The Sponsor stated that Tactical Finishing  Solutions  Limited
             provides business and accounting advice, which is contrary  to
             the stated purpose of the company as recorded  with  Companies
             House.  She found out about the employment through  a  friend.
             The business has two employees, a father  and  his  son.   She
             does not remember the son's name  but  the  father's  name  is
             Mohammed Naeem.  I asked who Mukhtar Ahmed was  and  she  said
             that she did not know.  She stated that she worked  full  time
             at the beginning and part time from March 2015.  I  asked  her
             what her role was and she stated that she set up appointments,
             sent emails and replied to telephone  calls.   It  was  mainly
             Mohammed Naeem working there with her.


         27.   In  respect  of  this  particular  employment,  I  found  the
             Sponsor's evidence to be very lacking in detail and externally
             inconsistent.  I do not consider it credible  that  she  would
             not know how the funds were  credited  to  her  account.   Her
             evidence regarding her role was vague.  She knew little  about
             who worked in the company.  If this is coupled with the issues
             that arise in relation to the  two  letters  provided  by  the
             company, which were signed  by  a  person  claiming  to  be  a
             director, even though it is clear that  he  was  no  longer  a
             director by that point, and the fact that  it  states  in  her
             wage slips that she was paid by BACs when her own evidence  is
             that het funds were  deposited  into  her  account,  then  the
             evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that she was  employed
             as claimed, or that she earned sufficient  to  take  over  the
             financial threshold at the date of the application.


         28.  In addition, there is  no  evidence,  from  the  website  link
             provided at least, that the company was actively trading after
             December 2013.  I also  note  that  the  Sponsor  stated  that
             Mohammed Naeem worked for the company.  I note that the letter
             form Rosemount Accountancy  South  is  signed  by  a  Mohammed
             Naeem, who is a director of that business.


         29.  Taking into account all of the above, the  Appellant  has  not
             shown that the Sponsor  was  employed  by  Tactical  Finishing
             Solutions Limited as claimed. The evidence falls far short  of
             demonstrating that she is.


         30.  As the Sponsor has  not  demonstrated  that  she  was  earning
             �18,600 the (sic)  date  of  the  application,  the  Appellant
             cannot meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM  as  a  partner,
             because none of the exceptions to the maintenance requirements
             apply in this case, there is  no  provision  for  third  party
             support within the rules, and section EX is not applicable  to
             applications for entry clearance."

8.   The judge considered Article 8  outside  of  the  Rules  and  made  the
    following findings:-

         "33.  The  Sponsor  is  a  British  citizen.   She  was   born   in
             Afghanistan.  The Appellant and Sponsor became engaged in 2013
             and married in  Afghanistan  in  2015.   The  Sponsor  visited
             Afghanistan in  2016.   The  Sponsor's  parents  and  siblings
             reside in the UK.  She has one brother and four sisters.   She
             lives with her parents and brother.  She has  uncles  residing
             in Afghanistan as well as her parent's in law  (sic)  who  the
             Appellant is currently residing with.
         ...


         35.   A  letter  has  been  provided  from  Doctor  Charles  Roher,
             Consultant Neonatologist at Oxford University Hospitals  dated
             19 April 2017.  He states that he is currently concerned  with
             the care of the Appellant's son, who was critically  ill  from
             birth and is a long-term patient on their  Neonatal  Intensive
             Care Unit at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.  He states  that
             'the condition of the child, as  well  as  the  need  fro  the
             child's mother [sic], would make it necessary for Mr Sharif to
             be in Oxford as soon as possible.'


         36.  The  Appellant's  son  had  not  been  born  at  the  date  of
             application, decision or  entry  clearance  manager's  review.
             There has therefore been  no  consideration  of  the  family's
             current circumstances by the Respondent.  Consequently, as the
             Respondent  was  not  represented  at  the  hearing,  I   have
             considered  whether  the  birth   of   the   Appellant's   son
             constitutes a new matter for purposes of section 85(6) of  the
             Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   I  do  not
             consider that it does.  For a matter to be a 'new matter'  for
             the purpose of section 85(6) it must, inter alia,  'constitute
             a ground of appeal of a kid listed in section 84...'.


         37.  In this case the Respondent treated the application as a human
             rights claim taking into account the impact of  that  decision
             upon the couple's family life.   In  essence,  even  though  a
             child has now been born, that child was born as a  consequence
             of the relationship between him and his wife.   The  Appellant
             continues to rely upon the same ground, that is Article  8  of
             the ECHR (family life), as considered by the Respondent.   The
             Appellant does not argue that  he  falls  within  a  different
             category of the rules as a consequence of  the  birth  of  his
             son.  The birth of the Appellant's  son  is  relevant  to  the
             assessment of whether the  Sponsor  can  presently  reside  in
             Afghanistan.   The  change  in  the  factual   matrix   as   a
             consequence of an addition to the family unit is,  of  course,
             relevant to the assessment of proportionality, but it  is  not
             discrete (sic) claim that can be  separated  from  Appellant's
             claim based upon the relationship with his wife.


         38.  I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before me that the
             couple have a child together.  I am satisfied  their  son  was
             born very prematurely at 28 weeks and that, as at the date  of
             the hearing, he remained in neonatal intensive care.


         39.  The Respondent does not dispute that the Appellant and Sponsor
             are in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and  that  they
             intend to live together permanently.  At the present  time  at
             least, it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  Sponsor  to
             relocate to Afghanistan to be with the Appellant because their
             son is in hospital in the UK and she visits  him  daily.   The
             Respondent's decision therefore interferes with the  enjoyment
             of family life between the Appellant and the Sponsor  and  the
             Appellant and his son.  Article 8(1) is therefore  engaged  on
             family life grounds.


         ...


         43.  The Respondent does not dispute that the Sponsor is a  British
             citizen.  According to the application form,  she  was  issued
             with a British passport on 6 February 2015.  This is prior  to
             when her son was born.  Therefore, as he was born in  the  UK,
             by virtue of section 1(a) of the British Nationality Act 1981,
             he is a British citizen.


         44.  At the date  of  the  hearing,  the  Appellant's  son  was  in
             neonatal intensive care.  Whilst the medical evidence does not
             specifically address it, I am  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities that the Appellant's  son  could  not  presently
             travel to Afghanistan and reside there with his  parents.   It
             is clearly in his best interests  that  he  has  both  of  his
             parents present in his life during his early  development  and
             at key milestones in his life, which in view of his  premature
             birth and the need  for  extensive  medical  intervention,  is
             likely to be a difficult time for both him  and  his  parents.
             He cannot realistically be expected to leave the UK,  less  so
             could it be said to be reasonable to expect him to do so.


         45.  However, whilst what is in the child's  best  interests  is  a
             primary consideration, it is not the  only  consideration.   I
             have also had  regard  to  the  other  factors  identified  in
             section 117B when assessing proportionality.


         46.  There is no suggestion by the Respondent  that  the  Appellant
             does not meet the English  language  requirements  so  section
             117B(2) is of no relevance.  The Appellant is outside  the  UK
             and so section 117B(4) and (5) have no application.
         ...


         54.  Section 117B (6) refers to  a  person's  removal  rather  than
             exclusion from entry, so is not applicable in strict terms  as
             this is an entry clearance  case.   However,  the  Appellant's
             inability to enter the UK will result in an  ongoing  physical
             separation between him and his son, who is a British  citizen,
             unless his son becomes fit to travel  to  Afghanistan  in  the
             future.  I have had regard to this and what  is  in  his  best
             interests when undertaking  the  balancing  exercise  in  this
             case.


         55.  I have not been provided with any details regarding  the  long
             term prognosis for the Appellant's son and so I  do  not  know
             whether or not he is likely to be medically fit to  travel  in
             the future.  However, the position  as  at  the  date  of  the
             hearing was that he was in neonatal  intensive  care.   It  is
             clear from the consultant's report that he has been very  ill.
             Unless the Appellant is granted entry clearance he will not be
             able to see his son in person or physically bond with him.   I
             consider that this amounts to very  strong  and  compassionate
             circumstances  in  favour  of  granting  the  Appellant  entry
             clearance that outweighs the public  interest  in  this  case,
             because if the Appellant is not able to enter the UK  to  join
             his wife and son  then  he  will  not  be  able  to  have  any
             meaningful family life with his son at the present time."


9.   The judge considered maintenance and made the following findings:-

         "48. I am  not  satisfied  that  the  Sponsor's  earnings  met  the
             financial threshold of �18,600 when she was last working.   On
             the face of it, the couple  have  therefore  not  demonstrated
             that they will be self sufficient.  The public  interest  that
             requires that persons who seek  to  enter  or  remain  in  the
             United  Kingdom  be  financially  independent  therefore  does
             weight against them.


         49.  However, offers of third party support have been made  by  the
             Sponsor's father and  brother.   Both  gave  evidence  at  the
             hearing.  Both are British citizens.  The  Sponsor's  father's
             evidence is that he is  the  president  of  Alhayat  Equipment
             Limited and has an annual income from this business of �21,000
             as well as a (sic) roughly �5000 from the rental of a  car  as
             private hire.  He stated that his daughter lives with  him  in
             the family home and that a  room  will  be  provided  for  the
             Appellant and Sponsor's use.  The Appellant will be maintained
             and accommodated without recourse to public funds.


         50.  However, no  evidence  has  been  provided  of  the  Sponsor's
             father's income.  I am therefore  (sic)  cannot  be  satisfied
             that he can provide cash  support  to  the  Appellant  on  the
             evidence before  me.   However,  I  accept  that  the  Sponsor
             presently lives in the family home, so if the Appellant  joins
             her in the same room there will be no  significant  additional
             accommodation and utility costs.  I therefore accept  that  he
             can accommodate the Appellant, Sponsor and their  son  without
             the Appellant needing to have recourse to public funds  (which
             is not disputed by the Respondent).


         51.  The Appellant's brother also lives in the  family  home.   His
             evidence is that he will provide any financial support  needed
             until the Appellant has established himself  in  the  UK.   He
             stated in live evidence that he works  as  a  receptionist  at
             Almond Tree Hotel and earns gross around  �19,000  per  annum.
             He has provided a Barclays bank statement covering the  period
             14 April to 16 May 2017.  This shows a payment on  the  3  May
             2017 of �1,350.05 from the  Almond  Tree  Hotel.   This  would
             equate to �16,200.26  per  annum  net.   There  is  a  closing
             balance �3,821.18  on  the  account.   I  accept  that  he  is
             employed as claimed and earns around �19,000 per annum  gross.
             As he lives in the family home I accept that it is likely that
             he has some disposable monthly income and savings  with  which
             he can provide financial assistance to the Appellant.


         52.  The evidence provided of third party support in this  case  is
             just about sufficient to demonstrate that the Appellant can be
             supported within the Sponsor's family home, also  taking  into
             account that the Sponsor is in receipt of  child  benefit  and
             child tax credit which she is entitled to in  her  own  right.
             However, no undertakings have been provided and the supporting
             documentary evidence is limited.  The evidence  before  me  is
             not comprehensive enough for me to make a finding  as  to  the
             specific additional funds that are  available  to  the  couple
             each week.  Therefore whilst I have  taken  into  account  the
             availability of this support when carrying out  the  balancing
             exercise, I attach less weight to this factor than finding the
             evidence before me had been stronger and more specific.


         ...


         54.  Section 117B(6) refers  to  a  person's  removal  rather  than
             exclusion from entry, so is not applicable in strict terms  as
             this is an entry clearance  case.   However,  the  Appellant's
             inability to enter the UK will result in an  ongoing  physical
             separation between him and his son, who is a British  citizen,
             unless his son becomes fit to travel  to  Afghanistan  in  the
             future.  I have had regard to this and what  is  in  his  best
             interests when undertaking  the  balancing  exercise  in  this
             case."

Grounds of Appeal

10.  The  first  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  judge  made  a  material
    misdirection in law, having taken into account the child of the  family
    who was born post the date of the decision. Paragraphs 85(4) and (5) of
    the 2002 Act relied on which read as follows:-

         "(4)     On an  appeal  under  ...  section  82(1)  ...  against  a
             decision [the Tribunal] may consider any matter which ... [it]
             thinks relevant to the substance of the decision, including  a
             matter arising after the date of the decision.


          (5) But the Tribunal must not consider a  new  matter  unless  the
             Secretary of State has given the Tribunal consent to do so.


          (6)  A matter is a 'new matter' if -


             (a)  it constitutes a ground of appeal of  a  kind  listed  in
                  section 84, and (b)


             (b)  the Secretary of State has not previously considered  the
                  matter in the context of -


                  (i)  the decision mentioned in section 82 (1), or


                  (ii) a statement made by the appellant under section 120".

11.  In  respect  of  this  matter  Mr  Melvin  made  an  application  under
    paragraph 11 of the Practice Direction of the  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chambers of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  of  10
    February 2010 (as amended on 13 November 2014) to  cite  an  unreported
    determination, namely the decision of Ali Rasuli Mahmud  PA/05465/2016.
    Mr Melvin informed me that the case is to be reported.

12.  The second ground of appeal is that the  judge  failed  to  make  clear
    findings in relation to the issue of deception.

13.  The third ground of appeal relates to the judge's findings in  relation
    to third party financial support. It is argued that  Section  117B  (3)
    was not given adequate consideration when assessing proportionality.

Error of Law

14.  It is beyond doubt that the judge attached significant  weight  to  the
    child when assessing proportionality who was not born at  the  date  of
    the decision. Following  AS (Somalia) & Anor v SSHD [2009] UKHL 32,  as
    this is an application for entry clearance, the judge was not  entitled
    to take into account events postdating the refusal.  In respect of  the
    whether the position has changed since the enactment of section 85  (5)
    and (6) of the 2002 Act, the judge engaged with whether  the  birth  of
    the child was a "new matter" and concluded, for  reasons  explained  at
    paragraphs 36  and  37  that  it  was  not.   The  judge  reached  this
    conclusion finding that,  "For a matter to be a 'new  matter'  for  the
    purpose of section 85(6) it must, inter alia, constitute  a  ground  of
    appeal of a kind listed in section 84 ...".  The judge considered  that
    the ECO had treated the application as a human rights claim. Although a
    child had been born, that child was a consequence of  the  relationship
    between the Appellant and his wife. The  Appellant  continued  to  rely
    upon the same ground, namely Article 8 of the ECHR.   The judge said:

         "The change in the factual matrix as a consequence of  an  addition
         to the family unit is, of course, relevant  to  the  assessment  of
         proportionality, but it is not discrete (sic)  claim  that  can  be
         separated from Appellant's claim based upon the  relationship  with
         his wife".

 15. The judge concluded that the birth of the child was not  a  new  matter
    because the change in the facts was not a "discrete claim".  The  judge
    took the view that it did not give rise to  a  new  ground  of  appeal.
    However, in my view the judge erred in the interpretation of Section 85
    (5) and (6).  A new matter is not defined in the legislation as a "new"
    ground of appeal, but, with reference to section 85 (5), the  issue  is
    whether it "constitutes a ground of appeal of a kind listed in  section
    84." Here the matter raised is undoubtedly a ground of appeal listed in
    section 84 and, in addition, it is one that  has  not  previously  been
    considered (85 (6) (b)). The birth of the child is a new  matter  which
    was not a matter that the judge was entitled to take into account.  The
    unreported case relied on by Mr Melvin is not binding, but there was no
    objection (by Mr Ahmed) to Mr Melvin citing the case.  I have  read  it
    and independently reach the same conclusions as the Tribunal in respect
    of the analysis of section 85. For this  reason  alone  the  judge  has
    materially erred and the decision to allow the appeal under  Article  8
    is set aside.

16.  In relation to the issue  of  deception.  Judge  Jordan,  in  my  view,
    concluded that all grounds were arguable. In any  event,  this  is  not
    material because the decision to allow the appeal has  been  set  aside
    and it is incumbent on me to consider the totality of the  decision  to
    decide how best to proceed. In any event, it was not an issue raised by
    Mr Ahmed. Whilst, I accept that  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the
    Secretary of State, the findings of  the  judge  appear  to  me  to  be
    irreconcilable in respect of the issue of deception.  The  decision  of
    the ECO was made under S-EC 2.2 (a) which reads as follows:-
         "S-EC.2.2. Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -
         (a)  false information, representations or documents have been
             submitted in relation to the application (including false
             information submitted to any person to obtain a document used
             in support of the application); or
         ...".
17.      The judge was not satisfied the Sponsor was  employed  by  Tactical
    Finishing Solutions as asserted, not because of insufficient  evidence,
    but because she was not credible (see paragraph 27).  In addition,  the
    judge attached weight to the  DVR  (see  paragraph  19).  The  DVR  was
    evidence that the company is not trading and there was a  website  link
    relied on which the judge considered.   On  a  proper  reading  of  the
    ECO's decision, the misrepresentation was not  (as  was  argued  by  Mr
    Ahmed) confined to whether  the  income  claimed  by  the  Sponsor  was
    accurately reflected in the HMRC records. The misrepresentation alleged
    went beyond this narrow issue. By the time of  the  hearing,  when  the
    Respondent produced the DVR, the Secretary of State's position was very
    clear; namely, that the Sponsor was not employed  by  the  company  and
    false information has been given and false documents produced.   It  is
    not clear to me when the DVR was produced, but there was no application
    made for an adjournment before the First-tier Tribunal.  There  was  no
    counter challenge made by the Appellant before me,  raising  issues  of
    fairness, or indeed challenging the findings made by the FtT.  The case
    as advanced by the Secretary of State, corroborated  by  the  DVR,  was
    accepted by the judge.  The judge accepted the DVR, taking into account
    all the evidence including letters relied  on  by  the  Appellant.  The
    letters were purportedly written by the director of the company, whilst
    the judge concluded that the website link revealed that he was not  the
    director at the time the letters were written. In addition,  the  judge
    concluded that the link established there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    company was trading after 2013. The judge found  the  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor to be vague,  inconsistent  and  not  credible.  There  was  no
    challenge to findings made by the judge in respect of the  Sponsor  and
    Tactical Finishing.
18.  I reserved my decision at the hearing, and discussed  the  hypothetical
    position of the decision being set aside and the possibility of  a  re-
    hearing (and remittal) in respect of this issue. However, it  is  clear
    on a proper  reading  of  the  decision  this  is  not  necessary.  The
    Appellant's case was that the Sponsor was employed and earned an income
    from Tactical Finishing Solutions. The Sponsor  was  found  not  to  be
    credible. It was not the Appellant's case that there was a  mistake  or
    misunderstanding. Whether the Appellant was aware of the  deception  is
    not material. The conclusion reached by the  judge,  at  paragraph  19,
    focuses on a very narrow aspect of the ECO's decision and does not take
    into  account  all  material  matters.  The   decision   is   perverse,
    considering the findings made by the judge.  From the findings  of  the
    judge, the conclusion that the Respondent has discharged the burden  of
    proof is inescapable.  The Appellant could  not  meet  the  suitability
    requirements of the Rules because he submitted  false  information  and
    made false representations.
19.  There is no purpose to be served in a re-hearing. The Appellant  cannot
    meet the requirements of the Rules. No further evidence was produced by
    either party in accordance with the direction of the Upper Tribunal.
20.   I have taken into account paragraph 41  of  the  judgement  in  R  (MM
    (Lebanon)) v Home Secretary [2017] UKSC 10;
     "There is no general obligation to respect a  married  couple's  choice
    of country in which to reside or to authorize family reunification.  It
    will depend upon the particular circumstances of the persons  concerned
    and the general interest. Factors to be  taken  into  account  are  the
    extent to which family life would effectively be ruptured;  the  extent
    of the ties in the host  country;  whether  there  are  'insurmountable
    obstacles' (or, as it has sometimes been put  in  other  cases,  'major
    impediments'...) in the way of the family living in  the  alien's  home
    country; and whether there are factors of immigration control (such  as
    a history of breaches of immigration law) or public order  weighing  in
    favour of exclusion".
21.    The Appellant and the Sponsor married on 26 March 2015 when  she  was
    on holiday in Afghanistan. The Sponsor is a British citizen  of  Afghan
    descent. Article 8  (1)  is  engaged.  I  attach  significance  to  the
    implications of the decision and the  rupture  to  family  life.    The
    determinative issue is proportionality. The child is new matter that  I
    cannot factor into  the  assessment.  There  is  no  challenge  to  the
    findings of the judge in respect of the  lack  of  credibility  of  the
    Sponsor and the findings in respect of the evidence of her earnings and
    the documents produced to support this. The  inevitable  conclusion  is
    that there has been deception in respect of the Sponsor's earnings  and
    this weighs very heavily in  favour  of  the  Respondent,  whether  the
    Appellant was aware of it or not.  The Sponsor is  a  British  citizen,
    but she does have familial ties to Afghanistan. However, I do not under
    estimate the difficulties she would face leaving her  family  here  and
    the practical difficulties that would ensue should she chose to live in
    Afghanistan. I attach weight to this.  However, I do not find  that  on
    the evidence at the date of the decision, prior to  the  birth  of  the
    child, the refusal would result in  unjustifiably  harsh  circumstances
    that refusal would not be proportionate (Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11).
22.  I am not persuaded the judge erred in respect of  third  party  support
    in the light of MM (20170 UKSC 10. He accepted that  the  evidence  was
    insufficient.  There was no challenge made by the Appellant in  respect
    of the findings.  The  judge  found  that  it  likely  the  Appellant's
    brother has "some" disposable income (he earns �19,000 per annum gross)
    which he can provide to the Appellant, but  there  was  no  attempt  to
    quantify this. There was no analysis of  his  outgoings  and  financial
    responsibilities. The judge found  no  evidence  was  provided  of  the
    Sponsor's father's income or that he could provide  cash  support.   He
    accepted the Sponsor lives with him in the family home and that a  room
    will be provided for the Appellant. The Appellant will be  accommodated
    and this is a factor that weighs in  his  favour.  However,  the  judge
    accepted that the evidence  was  limited  in  respect  of  third  party
    support and this is undeniably the  case.  The  Sponsor's  earnings  as
    accepted by the judge are �9,351.90, per annum, which  falls  short  of
    that required under the Rules. The evidence is not such that would lead
    to a conclusion that the Appellant, in practice,  would  not  become  a
    burden on the state. There were no findings  made  in  respect  of  the
    prospect of the Appellant earning an income and no evidence  relied  on
    in this respect. Presumably because the Appellant's case was  that  the
    Sponsor's earnings were sufficient to meet the Rules.
23.      Should the Appellant make another application for entry  clearance,
    the birth of his son (and any health issues) can be taken into account.
     However, there are no compelling or exceptional circumstances in  this
    case, at the relevant time, that would materially reduce the weight  to
    be attached to the public interest. This  is  particularly  so  in  the
    light  of  the  Appellant  having  relied  on  false  information   and
    documents.  Considering the specific facts in  this  case  and  section
    117B of  the  2002  Act,  I  conclude  that  the  interference  to  the
    Appellant's family life is proportionate.
24.  No anonymity direction is made.
