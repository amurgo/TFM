                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan born  on  10th  September
    1978.  She first arrived in the UK on 7th April 2005 when she was given
    leave to enter as a  student  until  9th  March  2005,  and  thereafter
    successive grants of leave to remain in the same  capacity  until  31st
    March 2009.  Thereafter the Appellant was granted successive periods of
    leave to remain as the dependent spouse of a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
    until 13th August 2013.  The Appellant then applied for  further  leave
    to remain on the same basis.  That  application  was  refused  for  the
    reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated 12th  February  2014.   The
    Appellant appealed, and her appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Crawford (the Judge) sitting at Stoke on 18th June  2014.   He
    decided to dismiss the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  for  the
    reasons given in a decision dated 19th June 2014.  On 27th October 2015
    I decided that that decision contained  no  error  of  law  as  regards
    paragraph 319E of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395.
     However, I decided that the Judge had erred in law by not  considering
    the Appellant's human rights either under Appendix  FM  of  HC  395  or
    under Article 8 ECHR.  I set aside that part of the  Judge's  decision,
    and directed that the case be adjourned for that  decision  to  be  re-
    made.  That is the matter which comes before me today.

Evidence

 2. At the hearing, the Appellant appeared represented by her husband,  the
    Sponsor, Zia Ullah.  He had no legal representation, but confirmed that
    he was happy for the hearing to proceed nonetheless.

 3. The evidence before Judge Crawford was supplemented by what the Sponsor
    told me at the hearing.  None of that  evidence  was  disputed  by  the
    Respondent.  I therefore find that the Appellant married  her  husband,
    the Sponsor, sometime prior  to  2008.   Since  then  they  have  lived
    together as man and wife.  Their marriage is  genuine  and  subsisting.
    They have four children, namely [MrZ] born on [ ] 2007, [AH] born on  [
    ] 2009, [ASZ] born on [ ] 2011, and finally [MhZ] born on [ ] 2015.

 4. The Appellant's husband was granted indefinite leave to remain  in  the
    UK on the basis of long residency on 25th November 2011.  On 17th  June
    2014 he became a British citizen by naturalisation.  He is  a  graduate
    in  telecommunications  engineering  from  Aston  University,  and   is
    employed by the Royal Mail earning approximately ï¿½56,000 per annum.

 5. The Appellant's three elder children have commenced their education  in
    the UK.  All the Appellant's children were born in the  UK  where  they
    have lived for all of their lives.  They have no experience of life  in
    Pakistan.

Decision

 6. I find that the  Appellant  satisfies  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    EX.1.(a) of Appendix FM of HC  395.   The  Appellant's  youngest  child
    [MhZ] is a British citizen having been born in the UK after her  father
    had become a British citizen.  There is no reason  for  me  to  believe
    that the Appellant does not have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with that child.  The child is under the age of  18  years
    and is resident in the UK.  On the evidence before me, it would not  be
    reasonable to expect that child to leave the UK.  It would therefore be
    a  breach  of  the  Appellant's  right  to  a  family  life  under  the
    Immigration Rules to refuse her leave to remain in the UK.  The  appeal
    is therefore allowed.

Notice of Decision

I allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

I was not asked to make an anonymity order.  I have  considered  whether  to
do so but find that in this case it is not necessary.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered making a fee award.  As the appeal has been  allowed  upon
evidence which was not before the Respondent when the Appellant applied  for
leave to remain, I decide not to make any fee award.
