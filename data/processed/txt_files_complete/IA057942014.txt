                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Prior promulgated on 5 June 2014 allowing Mr Riyaz's appeal.


   2. Although before me the Secretary of State  is  the  appellant  and  Mr
      Riyaz is  the  respondent,  for  the  sake  of  consistency  with  the
      proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter refer  to
      Mr  Riyaz  as  the  Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
      Respondent.



Background

   3. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 24 February  1988.  The
      relevant chronology of his immigration history is as follows:

      4 Nov 2009:      Appellant granted leave to enter the UK as a  Tier  4
                       General Student valid until 29 December 2010.

      24 Dec 2010:           Appellant applied for further leave  to  remain
                       as a Tier 4 migrant. His  application  was  initially
                       refused on 1 March 2011.

      17  May  2011:            Determination   promulgated   allowing   the
                       Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  1  March
                       2011 (ref IA/10544/2011).

      24 Jun 2011:           Appellant granted further leave to remain as  a
                       Tier 4 migrant valid until 7 June 2014.

      16 Apr 2012:           Respondent  purportedly  curtailed  Appellant's
                       leave on basis that his course provider had  reported
                       that he was not attending his studies. There  was  an
                       in-country right of appeal attaching to the decision,
                       but no appeal was made.

      17 Jan  2014:            Appellant  encountered  by  the  Respondent's
                       arrest team; arrested and detained as an  overstayer.
                       Removal decision issued to the Appellant with out-of-
                       country right of appeal attaching.

      30  Jan  2014:            Appeal  lodged  with  IAC.  Notices  of  the
                       immigration decisions of both 16 April  2012  and  17
                       January  2014  included  with  the  covering   letter
                       enclosing   the    Notice    of    Appeal.    Written
                       representations  also  included  headed   'Right   of
                       Appeal' asserting that the decision of 16 April  2012
                       was not duly served on the Appellant until after  his
                       detention in January 2014, and seeking to appeal  the
                       decision of 16 April 2012  either  'in-time'  because
                       the decision had only recently  been  served  on  the
                       Appellant, or alternatively seeking an  extension  of
                       time in all the circumstances.

      4 Feb 2014:      Issue of validity of appeal considered by Duty Judge.
                       A note on the Tribunal's  file  identifies  that  the
                       Appellant wishes to appeal the decision of 2012 which
                       he claimed had not  previously  been  served.  Appeal
                       accepted as valid. 'Notice of In Time Appeal'  issued
                       by the Tribunal.

      12 Feb 2014:           Respondent withdraws  decision  of  17  January
                       2014.

23 May 2014:           Appeal hearing before First-tier Tribunal.


   4. The Appellant's appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Prior
      for reasons set out in the determination promulgated on 5 June 2014.


   5. The Respondent applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
      which was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth on 16 July
      2014.


No appearance

   6. There was no appearance by or on behalf of the Appellant today.  I  am
      satisfied that due notice of the hearing was given. The Tribunal is in
      receipt of a letter from Addison & Khan Solicitors (who are on  record
      as the Appellant's representatives) dated 3 September 2014. The letter
      indicates that they have been unable to make contact with their client
      and in the circumstances will not themselves be in attendance.


   7. I was satisfied that the Appellant had been afforded an opportunity of
      attending the hearing and/or sending any written  representations  and
      materials upon which he might wish to rely to the Tribunal. In all  of
      the circumstances, including the absence of any  explanation  for  his
      non-attendance, I was satisfied that it  was  appropriate  to  proceed
      with the appeal in the Appellant's absence.


Consideration

   8. The Respondent has raised one issue of challenge  in  the  grounds  in
      support of the application for permission to appeal. It was  contended
      therein that in light of the withdrawal of the decision of 17  January
      2014 on 12 February 2014, there was no appealable immigration decision
      before the Tribunal and the Judge accordingly lacked any  jurisdiction
      to consider the Appellant's  case,  and  in  particular  to  make  any
      assessment of the curtailment decision of 16 April 2012.


   9. I note as an unsatisfactory feature the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
      failure properly to identify the immigration decision that founded his
      jurisdiction.  Indeed  the  Judge  refers  at  paragraph  2   of   his
      determination to the Appellant appealing  against  a  decision  of  28
      November 2013.


  10. Be that as it may, Mr Jarvis acknowledged before me that in  light  of
      the decision of the Duty Judge the Tribunal had accepted  jurisdiction
      on the basis of the  Appellant's  Notice  of  Appeal  challenging  the
      Notice of Immigration Decision of 16 April 2012. The withdrawal by the
      Respondent of the decision of 17 January 2014 - a decision that  could
      not in any event have founded an in-country  right  of  appeal  -  was
      therefore not material to the jurisdiction exercised by the Tribunal.


  11. Further, it is to be noted that notwithstanding the failure adequately
      to identify the immigration  decision  under  appeal  in  the  opening
      paragraphs of his determination, the Judge addressed the substance  of
      the curtailment decision which was the decision that was  the  subject
      of the appeal.


  12. There being no other basis of challenge to the decision of the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge raised by the Respondent, Mr  Jarvis  acknowledged
      that the decision could not be impugned for error of  law  and  should
      stand.


  13. The Appellant should note that  this  does  not  resolve  his  current
      immigration situation. The effect of the decision is no more than that
      the leave that was due to expire on 7 June 2014 was not  curtailed  on
      16 April 2012. 7 June 2014 has, of course, now passed. The Appellant's
      leave is currently only by virtue of the statutory extension  pursuant
      to section 3D of the Immigration  Act  1971  because  of  the  current
      pending appeal proceedings. Upon completion of the appeal process - in
      effect upon expiry of the time period for the Respondent  to  make  an
      application for permission to appeal against my decision (see  section
      104(2)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002)  -  the
      appeal will no longer be pending and the Appellant's leave will lapse.
      If the Appellant has any doubts as to the  implications  of  this,  he
      should seek  independent  legal  advice  concerning  regularising  his
      immigration status or making arrangements to depart the UK.


Decision

  14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  no  error  of
      law and stands.


  15. Mr Riyaz's appeal against  the  decision  of  16  April  2012  remains
      allowed.
