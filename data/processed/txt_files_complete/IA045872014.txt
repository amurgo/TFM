For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is an error of law in the  determination  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Traynor) promulgated on 5 August 2014.

2.   The appellant was born on 1  January  1981  and  he  is  a  citizen  of
    Nigeria.

Background

3.   The appellant applied for a residence card by way of confirmation of  a
    right to reside in the UK as the family member of a  European  Economic
    Area (EEA) national under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

4.   The respondent  refused  the  application  on  10  January  2014.   The
    appellant's marriage had been conducted and presided over  by  Reverend
    Shipside on 8 October 2009 at All Saints  Forest  Gate.   The  marriage
    fell between the period of May  2009  and  July  2010  where  193  sham
    marriages had been identified having been  conducted  by  the  Reverend
    Shipside.   Reverend  Shipside  was  charged  and  pleaded  guilty   to
    presiding over sham marriages.

5.   The respondent took into account that the appellant previously made  an
    application on 18 March 2008 claiming to be the extended family  member
    of a German national.  That application was refused on 27  April  2009.
    In that application he failed to mention that he had a fiancï¿½e  or  was
    involved in a long-term  relationship  with  anyone  else.   Some  five
    months later the appellant entered into a marriage and made  a  further
    application on 1 November 2009.

6.   The respondent invited the appellant to  attend  an  interview  but  he
    failed to do so because of illness.  He  made  no  further  attempt  to
    rearrange  an  appointment.   The  appellant  submitted   the   present
    application  on  28  March  2012.   He   failed  to  respond   to   the
    respondent's letter dated 7 June 2012 expressing concerns regarding the
    marriage and giving him the opportunity to respond and substantiate the
    claim that he was involved in a genuine marriage.

7.   The respondent considered further evidence submitted regarding the  EEA
    spouse's  employment  and  concluded  that  the  appellant  failed   to
    demonstrate the family member was currently economically active in  the
    UK.

8.   The respondent noted that official records  failed  to  show  that  the
    sponsor had ever been resident at the address 5 Rosedale Road London.

9.   The determination set out findings from  [36-58].  The  Tribunal  found
    the appellant lacking in credibility and that he had failed  to  adduce
    evidence  to  show  that  he  had  not  entered  into  a  marriage   of
    convenience.

10.  At [46] the Tribunal found that the appellant had adduced  no  evidence
    to suggest  he  was  ever  related  to  a  German  uncle  or  that  the
    applications he had made previously were in any way justified. It found
    that the appellant,  realising  that  such  an  application  could  not
    succeed, took steps to enter into a marriage arranged by others.

11.   The Tribunal placed  weight  on  the  appellant's  failure  to  adduce
    evidence that the marriage arrangements had been made by a priest other
    than Reverend Shipside.  The Tribunal placed weight on  the  fact  that
    Reverend Shipside was not simply convicted of an isolated  offence  but
    there were almost 200 sham marriages over a period of fourteen months.

12.  The Tribunal found it highly relevant that there was not one  shred  of
    evidence from the appellant's spouse and the appellant  has  failed  to
    address the clear and serious doubts concerning the spouse's occupation
    in documents submitted by  the  appellant  as  compared  with  official
    records.  [50].

13.  The Tribunal found the evidence of other witnesses  either  lacking  in
    credibility or failing to support the account given by  the  appellant.
    [51, 52, 54, 56].

14.  At [39] the determination considered the concerns  as  to  evidence  of
    the spouse's address and referred to the appellant's witness statement.
     It found that "he had  never  addressed  this  point  but  had  merely
    recited addresses and has not in any way  challenged  the  respondent's
    assertion that there is no evidence of her residing at that address".

15.  At [41] the Tribunal found the appellant's evidence  that  he  did  not
    know where his spouse was living, to be fundamentally undermined by his
    witness Ferdinand Okeke "who told me that until a matter  of  only  two
    months before the appeal hearing the appellant's wife continued to live
    in the same  building  in  the  accommodation  it  was  said  that  the
    appellant and she had occupied prior to the  appellant  moving  out  of
    that accommodation in December 2013".

Grounds for Permission

16.   The  appellant  alleges  that  the  determination  failed  to  reflect
    accurately what transpired at the hearing.  "Short of suggesting  bias,
    the judge appeared to have indulged in  'cherry  picking'  of  evidence
    taking what he is inclined to believe and rejecting those that did  not
    support the appellant's case."

17.  Ground 1 - the appellant was provided minimal opportunity in  which  to
    read papers served at the hearing by the respondent who had  failed  to
    comply with Rule 13, which was unfair.

18.  Ground 2 - the Tribunal [39] was wrong to suggest  that  the  appellant
    had failed to address the issue of his spouse's residence at 5 Rosedale
    Road.   This  was  addressed  in  the  appellant's  witness  statement,
    skeleton argument and documentary evidence at pages 119  to  134,  168,
    169 and 194.

19.  Ground 3 - the judge was wrong to find it relevant that  the  appellant
    had  failed  to  attend  the  respondent's   interviews   in   previous
    applications.

20.  Ground 4 - the Tribunal  erred  by  finding  the  appellant's  previous
    application as a dependant of a German uncle to be relevant.

21.  Ground 5 - it was  unreasonable  to  have  expected  the  appellant  to
    adduce further evidence of his marriage  being  arranged  by  a  priest
    other than Reverend Shipside.  The finding regarding Reverend  Shipside
    and Operation Silverhill was not supported by facts but based  on  mere
    unwarranted speculation.  The appellant was not implicated in any way.

22.  Ground 6 - it was unfair of the judge to draw  adverse  inference  from
    the non-attendance of the appellant's spouse in circumstances that  the
    parties had  divorced  based  on  adultery.   The  respondent  had  not
    challenged the validity  of  the  divorce  and  it  was  not  therefore
    relevant for the judge to raise queries regarding the same.

23.  Ground 7 - the judge  failed  to  consider  the  appellant's  right  to
    private and family life.

Permission

24.   Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Nicholson on 18 September 2014.  She found little merit in many of  the
    grounds.  She stated that in the event of making a  serious  allegation
    of bias this should be properly documented and supported  by  evidence.
    Otherwise such general unsubstantiated innuendo  has  no  place  in  an
    application.

25.  Permission was  granted  with  regard  to  ground  5  in  which  it  is
    contended that the judge erred by stating at [39] the appellant  failed
    to address the contention that there was no evidence to  show  his  ex-
    wife had been living at 5 Rosedale Road.  There was evidence before the
    judge in the appellant's bundle showing this to be the address  of  the
    appellant's wife, specifically letters to her at the address  and  bank
    statements in her name.  In light of the fact that the Tribunal  placed
    weight on the absence of evidence, it is arguable that a factual  error
    was made which could have affected the outcome of the decision.

Error of Law Hearing

26.  I heard submissions from Mr Ikegwuruka and Mr Shilliday the details  of
    which are set out in the Record of Proceedings.

27.  The main ground pursued by Mr Ikegwuruka was the issue of the  evidence
    showing the address for the  appellant's  spouse  at  5  Rosewood  Road
    (ground 2). I am satisfied that  the argument pursued on behalf of  the
    appellant and as drafted in the grounds of  appeal  lacks  clarity  and
    does not accurately reflect  the  precise  issue  in  relation  to  the
    spouse's residence at the address.  Mr Ikegwuruka  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal failed to take into account the evidence  showing  the  spouse
    was living at 5 Rosewood Road.  He cited  specific  references  in  the
    grounds of appeal to evidence showing that the  spouse  was  living  at
    that address.

28.  The issue is a narrow one and  relates  specifically  to  the  concerns
    raised by the respondent that the evidence adduced by the appellant  of
    the spouse's residence at 5 Rosewood Road  was  not  supported  by  any
    evidence of her residence at that address in any official records.  Put
    another way it was not  simply  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  her
    residing at that address but that there was no evidence in any official
    records revealed in enquiries pursued by the  respondent  (see  Reasons
    for Refusal Letter page 3 paragraph 8).

29.  As is apparent from the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  the  respondent
    pursued enquiries through UKVI which confirmed  that  the  sponsor  was
    employed as a hairdresser and was economically  active.   However,  the
    respondent found that the information revealed in those  enquiries  did
    not tally with that relied on by the appellant and did not in fact show
    that the spouse was resident at that address.

30.  This point was clearly made by the First-tier Tribunal  at  [39].   The
    Tribunal was well aware of  the  evidence  produced  by  the  appellant
    showing the spouse's residence at 5 Rosewood Road and had taken it into
    account. However, the issue that the appellant failed  to  address  was
    the concern raised by the  respondent,  namely  that  the  evidence  in
    official records of the spouse's residence did not show  that  address.
    The Tribunal clearly had this in mind  in  reaching  its  findings  and
    decision.

31.  I find no error of law disclosed in the determination  with  regard  to
    ground 2.

32.  As to the remaining grounds I am satisfied that there is  no  merit  in
    any of the points raised, which  amount  to  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal and which were not pursued  by
    Mr Ikegwuruka.

33.  The First-tier Tribunal carefully considered all of  the  evidence  and
    made clear and sustainable findings of fact which are fully reasoned in
    the determination.

34.  In short  the  Tribunal  found  the  entire  claim  to  be  lacking  in
    credibility and took into account the lack of evidence from the spouse,
    the appellant's immigration history,  his  avoidance  of  the  marriage
    being scrutinised, the inconsistencies in the evidence in particular of
    the witnesses called, the appellant's failure to adduce any evidence to
    counter  that  the  ceremony  was  conducted   by   Reverend   Shipside
    subsequently convicted of fraud and in addition to which the  appellant
    failed to address the narrow issue that official records did  not  show
    the spouse's address as 5 Rosewood Road.  Further I find  no  error  of
    law in the judge's dealing of Article 8.  There was no evidence  relied
    on by the appellant in support of an Article 8 claim and in view of the
    conclusion reached by the Tribunal that the marriage  was  not  genuine
    there was no basis on which any Article 8 family life  claim  could  be
    pursued.
