For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Piratheepan Thillainathan, was born on 26 June 1991  and
    is a male citizen of  Sri  Lanka.   The  appellant  had  applied  under
    paragraph 317 of HC 395 (as amended) for entry clearance to the  United
    Kingdom as an adult child living alone outside the  United  Kingdom  in
    the most exceptional compassionate circumstances.  His application  was
    refused by the respondent by a  decision  dated  18  April  2012.   The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Herwald) which, in
    a determination promulgated on 23 January 2013, dismissed  the  appeal.
    The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The sponsor of the appellant's application is  his  father,  Thambiraja
    Thilainathan (hereafter referred to as  the  sponsor).   The  sponsor's
    wife and two daughters have been granted entry clearance to join him in
    the United Kingdom.  The sponsor and other members of  the  appellant's
    family attended the Upper Tribunal hearing on 6 June 2013.

 3. Mr Paramjorthy, for  the  appellant,  submitted  that  there  were  two
    challenges to the First-tier Tribunal's determination.   First,  it  is
    asserted that the judge has made a mistake in fact by finding at  [21e]
    when he wrote that, "the appellant was said to be  living  in  a  house
    where the family have lived with him for many  years".   In  a  witness
    statement dated 7 January 2013, which appears  not  to  have  been  put
    before the First-tier Tribunal, the sponsor at [13] states  that,  "the
    former family home in Sri Lanka was sold in anticipation of  my  family
    joining me in  the  UK".   The  appellant  is,  in  fact,  residing  in
    temporary accommodation with a family in Colombo.  Mr Wilding, for  the
    respondent, submitted that the sponsor's  earlier  statement  dated  31
    January 2012 had made no reference to the sale of the family home.  The
    judge had, therefore, been given no indication in the evidence that the
    property had been sold.

 4. I find that any error of fact it is not material in this instance.   At
    the time of the decision (as now) the appellant was  not  living  alone
    but with a family in Colombo.  He could not, as a consequence,  satisfy
    paragraph 317, notwithstanding the circumstances in which he  may  have
    been living at the date of decision.  In any event, it was clearly open
    to the judge to find that the circumstances in which the appellant  was
    living were not "most exceptional".  The Immigration Rules appeal  was,
    therefore, bound to fail because the appellant was not living alone  or
    in the most exceptional circumstances. The alleged error fact  concerns
    a matter which, even if corrected, could not save the Immigration Rules
    appeal.  Consequently, nothing would be achieved by setting  aside  the
    determination.

 5. I have considered the relevance of the judge's possible mistake in  the
    Article 8 ECHR appeal.   The  grounds  assert  that  the  judge,  as  a
    consequence  of  his  mistake,  has  failed  adequately   to   consider
    proportionality.  I disagree.  Applying the familiar test  set  out  in
    Razgar, the judge  found  that  the  appellant  would  not  suffer  any
    interference with his right to respect for private or family life  and,
    even if he did suffer such interference, the consequences were  not  of
    such gravity as potentially to  engage  the  operation  of  Article  8.
    Applying Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31,  he  found  that  there  were  no
    "further elements of dependency" which would justify invoking Article 8
    to assist an adult child separated from his adult family  members.   At
    [28], the judge went on, notwithstanding his earlier findings under the
    Razgar test, to consider proportionality.  He found that  the  decision
    of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision   would  not   cause   a
    disproportionate interference to  the  appellant's  private  or  family
    life. Again applying the principles of Kugathas, the judge  found  that
    the relationship between the appellant and his adult family members  in
    the United Kingdom would continue, undisturbed and by the same means as
    before the date of the immigration decision.

 6. I find that those findings were  clearly  open  to  the  judge  on  the
    evidence before the Tribunal.  It is inconceivable that the judge would
    have reached a different decision in respect of Article  8  if  he  had
    been aware that the appellant was living in accommodation with a family
    in Colombo rather than the former family home; the  rationale  for  the
    judge's decision concerned the lack of ties of dependency between adult
    family members rather  than  the  precise  nature  of  the  appellant's
    accommodation in Sri Lanka.

 7. The second ground of appeal also concerns the Article  8  ECHR  appeal.
    The  grounds  assert  that  the  judge  failed  to  "engage  with   the
    appellant's particular circumstances.  The appellant had not ever  left
    the family home,  had  not  ever  become  financially  and  emotionally
    dependent [independent?] upon his family  and  the  granting  of  entry
    clearance to the appellant's mother and sisters would have  the  effect
    of leaving the  appellant  on  his  own,  in  temporary  accommodation,
    without the support  of  his  mother  and  sisters  and  the  sponsor's
    evidence that he was paying ï¿½100 towards the appellant's  accommodation
    costs here in the UK".  The grounds also assert that the  judge  failed
    to have proper regard to "the nature of south Asian familial tradition"
    which was "to the effect that the child remained a family member  until
    marriage".

 8. I have no doubt that the sponsor and other family members in the United
    Kingdom dearly wish for the appellant to  join  them.   They  indicated
    their concern for his welfare by attending the Upper Tribunal  hearing.
    However, I find that the ground  pleaded  does  not  have  merit.   The
    sponsor and other family members chose to leave Sri  Lanka  and  cannot
    have been certain that the appellant would have been able to join them.
     Any disruption in the close family bonds which they no  doubt  enjoyed
    with the appellant in Sri Lanka has occurred as a consequence of  their
    own decision to come to the United Kingdom.  Further, whilst the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge may have concentrated to too  great  an  extent  on
    quoting from jurisprudence relating to Article 8 at the  expense  of  a
    close analysis of the facts, I find that he did not err by  failing  to
    make any specific reference to the close nature of relationships within
    South Asian families.  The judge did draw attention to  the  fact  that
    the appellant is an adult and, whilst financial ties continue,  he  was
    also right to find, on the face of the evidence before him, there  were
    no special ties of dependency which should bring this appellant  within
    the ambit of Article 8.  There is also some force in the point made  by
    Judge French (refusing permission to appeal in the First-tier Tribunal)
    that, if the appellant had wished to argue this point before the First-
    tier Tribunal, he should have adduced  expert  evidence  regarding  the
    nature of ties within South Asian families; he chose not do so and  the
    judge was entitled to determine the case on the evidence he had  before
    him.

 9. I find that the First-tier Tribunal did not err in law  such  that  its
    determination falls to be set aside.  The appeal is dismissed.
