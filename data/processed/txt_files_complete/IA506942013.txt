Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Garrod, Counsel instructed by Justice and Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Ghana who applied for a  residence  card
    as confirmation of a right to reside here in respect of her marriage to
    her partner who holds Ghanaian and Italian nationalities.  The case has
    a  long  procedural  history  which  I  will  summarise  briefly.   Her
    application was refused in a decision dated 29th November  2013  and  a
    subsequent appeal  to  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Boyd  dismissed.
    Grounds of application were lodged against that decision, permission to
    appeal granted and sitting on 22nd October 2014 I found errors  in  law
    in that decision, set the decision aside in its entirety and directed a
    second stage hearing which took place on 14th January 2015.

 2. It is helpful to set out in brief terms the evidence of  the  Appellant
    and her Sponsor.

Witness statement of the Appellant

 3. She is a Ghanaian national born in Accra, Ghana who entered the  United
    Kingdom on 18th June 2015 with the benefit of a student dependent visa.
     She met her partner, Mr Aaron Adotey Allotey around  2009  in  Ashford
    (England).  In March  2012  they  decided  to  get  married  and  after
    informing her family their marriage took place by proxy  on  13th  July
    2012 in Accra, Ghana.  They could not personally attend their  marriage
    ceremony due to their financial circumstances as she was unemployed  at
    the time and her husband was the only breadwinner.

 4. In accordance with their customs  and  traditions  their  marriage  was
    registered on 19th September 2012.

 5. Her husband works at Exclusive Contract Services Limited as  a  cleaner
    and has been employed there since 18th November 2013 earning about �933
    a month.  They plan on having children in the near future.

 6. She maintains that all the necessary rites pertaining to  the  validity
    of the customary marriage were complied with.  She  loves  her  husband
    dearly.

Witness statement of Mr Aaron Allotey

 7. He is also Ghanaian and met the Appellant around 2009 and in March 2012
    decided to get married and the marriage took place  by  proxy  on  13th
    July  2012  in  Accra,  Ghana.   His  statement  mirrors  that  of  the
    Appellant.  He loves his wife dearly and they intend to live in the  UK
    as husband and wife and are in a durable and subsisting relationship.

The Burden and Standard of Proof

 8. The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the standard is  a  balance
    of probabilities.

Preliminary Matter

 9. A report from Francesca Oliosi was lodged, albeit late. Ms Everett took
    no objection to its lodgement.



The Oral Evidence

10. The Appellant gave oral evidence as noted in my Record  of  Proceedings
    and adopted her witness statement as truthful.

11. In cross-examination she explained that she was  not  working  and  she
    lived on what her husband earned.  He worked a 42 hour  week  full-time
    and started at 7:00pm and would come back at 3:00am.  He worked  Monday
    to Saturday and earned around �299 per week.  Asked why  they  had  not
    married in the UK they did not have enough money.  She was  a  Catholic
    and sometimes went to church but not to any particular or local church.
     Her husband did  attend  church  but  not  regularly.   They  had  not
    discussed having a religious wedding and as to whether they would  like
    to have children she  said  "if  it  happens".   They  had  not  really
    discussed it.  Her husband would be working  today.   Nothing  material
    emerged in re-examination.

12. Her husband, Aaron Allotey gave evidence  as  noted  in  my  Record  of
    Proceedings and also adopted his evidence as true.

13. In cross-examination when asked if they wanted to have children he said
    'yes' and he had discussed this with her.  They  were  trying  to  have
    children.  He worked 42 hours a week.  He started  in  the  evening  at
    7:00pm and finished at midnight.  He worked six days a  week.   He  had
    Saturday off.  He supported his wife and gave her money  for  shopping.
    He would give her �100 weekly on a Monday.  He would be working  today.
    Asked why they had not married in the UK they had  decided  to  have  a
    customary marriage in Ghana.  He would go to a Pentecostal  church  and
    his wife would come with him.  She was also Pentecostal.  Asked if  she
    had any other religion he said only  Pentecostal.   There  was  no  re-
    examination of the witness.

Submissions for the Home Office

14. Reliance was placed on the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter.   The  parties
    were  not  in  a  durable  relationship.   There  were  a   number   of
    discrepancies  which  were  significant.   In  terms  of  finance   the
    Appellant had said she received money from time to time but the Sponsor
    was specific  that  it  was  �100  per  week.   The  parties  were  not
    consistent about working hours and the  Appellant  was  clear  she  was
    Catholic but he said that both  went  to  a  Pentecostal  church.   The
    Appellant  was  ambivalent  about  whether  they  were  going  to  have
    children.

15. In terms of Kareem (proxy marriages - EU law) [2014] UKUT  00024  (IAC)
    it was necessary for the Appellant to produce "independent and reliable
    evidence" (paragraph 68(g)) which the "expert"  did  not  possess.  Her
    expertise seemed to be very much in ecclesiastical law.  In  short  the
    expert did not have the required expertise.

16. I was asked to dismiss the appeal on all grounds.



Submissions for the Appellant

17. The starting point was the expert  report.   There  was  no  particular
    reason for the expert to go into detail about whether the marriage  was
    valid in Ghana but the expert had given an opinion that it  was  -  see
    page 6.  The report was quite detailed and should be  accepted.   There
    was also a letter at page 29 of the  bundle  which  said,  albeit  very
    briefly, that Italian law recognised Ghanaian customary marriages.

18. In addition, while  there  were  discrepancies  in  the  oral  evidence
    between the Appellant and her Sponsor many of these  matters  would  be
    matters  of  perception.   Persons  perceived  what  had  happened   in
    different ways.  There was no real difference  in  the  working  hours.
    There was a tenancy  agreement  at  page  322  of  the  bundle  and  an
    insurance policy at page 167 to 171 of  the  bundle  from  Aviva  which
    provided the plan details in joint names.

19. The application had been made on 4th February 2013 and accordingly  the
    parties had been together for nearly two years.

20. The primary submission was that the marriage was valid  under  Ghanaian
    law (see my previous decision and paragraph 13 of the 1985 Act) and the
    appeal should be allowed on that basis.

Conclusions

21. I have an expert report from Francesca Oliosi who sets out her academic
    career, academic background, research and publications etc. towards the
    end of her report.  It identifies the documentation  which  she  looked
    at.  Page 3 of the report notes at heading No.  2  "General  Principles
    and Recognition of Foreign Marriages" that Italian  law  considers  the
    right to marry as a fundament right and, in  addition,  recognises  the
    key principle of favor matrimonii according to which a particular favor
    iuris is reserved to marriage so that, in case of doubt,  the  marriage
    is deemed valid until proven otherwise.  She goes  on  to  say  that  a
    foreign marriage celebrated abroad is still valid  when  celebrated  in
    compliance with the law of the state where  the  marriage  took  place,
    namely in this case Ghana.

22. At page 6, paragraph 3.1, she says that it follows  from  the  document
    submitted by the spouses that the "marriage is valid  in  Ghana".   She
    goes on to say that the Ghanaian customary marriage, which is valid and
    recognised in Ghana, is valid in Italy as well.

23. Under paragraph 3.2 she says that  the  proxy  marriage  is  "certainly
    valid under Italian law".  Further details are given.   Her  conclusion
    at page 9, paragraph 5,  is  that  on  the  basis  of  the  information
    provided it is clear that the Ghanaian customary marriage  between  the
    Appellant and her partner  "would  be  regarded  as  a  valid  marriage
    according to Italian law".

24. The expert opinion chimes with the submission of Mr Garrod in  relation
    to paragraph 13 of the Customary Marriage  and  Divorce  (Registration)
    Law 1985 which says that in any proceedings a true copy of the entry in
    the register certified  under  the  hand  of  the  registrar  shall  be
    admissible in evidence as "sufficient proof" of the registration of the
    marriage.  The Appellant relies on paragraph 13 and it was not disputed
    by the Home Office that the paragraph applied and the words "sufficient
    proof" would strongly suggest that the marriage was validly  contracted
    under Ghanaian law.

25. The burden is on the Appellant to prove by sufficient evidence that the
    marriage is recognised under the law  of  the  EEA  country  concerned.
    That evidence is said to have to be "independent and reliable" per what
    is said in Kareem.  Looking at  the  CV  of  Ms  Oliosi  who  described
    herself   as   an   "expert"   in   ecclesiastical   law,   comparative
    ecclesiastical law, canon law, history of  canon  law  and  comparative
    religious law it appears that she completed her LM with a  particularly
    high mark and as I understand  the  CV  she  will  finish  her  PhD  in
    February 2015.

26. She declares in paragraph 1, on page 3, that she has no vested interest
    in the outcome of this case and is able to declare her impartiality  in
    providing her opinion.  She is clearly "independent" and  is  obviously
    qualified to give expert evidence on the subjects  with  which  she  is
    familiar.  There is no contradictor to the fact that she is a  reliable
    expert and I am prepared to accept her as such.

27. Her evidence is clear on both  whether  the  marriage  is  valid  under
    Ghanaian customary law and also that marriage is recognised  under  the
    laws of the EEA country concerned, in this case Italy.  It seems to  me
    this therefore meets the test of Kareem.

28. The remaining issue before me was whether or not the  discrepancies  in
    the evidence offered by the Appellant  and  her  Sponsor  are  material
    enough to doubt the genuineness of the relationship.  It can  often  be
    difficult to know how much weight should be attached  to  discrepancies
    when there may be a reasonable explanation which has  not  had  emerged
    given the fact that the Home Office were relying not on differences  in
    the written statements  but  differences  in  oral  evidence.   It  was
    notable that the Sponsor was clear he gave his wife �100 per week while
    she said the arrangement was not as precise as  that  although  he  did
    give her money.  There was a difference in the working hours as to when
    the Sponsor finished his work although, on reflection, it seems  to  me
    that that difference may arise from when  the  Appellant  did  actually
    finish work and when he came home.  The Appellant was  very  clear  she
    was a Catholic although, as Ms Everett fairly pointed out, this did not
    preclude her from attending the Pentecostal church which  he  said  she
    did.  There was a slight difference as to whether they wanted  to  have
    children - the Sponsor making it clear  that  they  did  want  to  have
    children and the Appellant was more ambivalent on that although I noted
    in her statement she expresses a desire to have children (paragraph  15
    on page 17 of the Appellant's bundle).

29. On the other hand, as Mr Garrod pointed out,  the  initial  application
    was made some two years ago and there is documentary evidence that they
    are living together in addition to what they both said  in  their  oral
    evidence confirming the terms of the written statements.

30. On balance, I accept that this is a genuine marriage  and  the  parties
    have the intention to continue to live together.

31. For the foregoing reasons this appeal must be allowed.

32. There is no need for anonymity.  I was not asked to make  a  fee  order
    and since much of the evidence which came to hand postdates the refusal
    letter I am not making a fee order.

Decision

33. The appeal is allowed under The Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.
