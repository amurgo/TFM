                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss T Starr (counsel instructed by Sasdev & Co) for the appellant
Miss J Webb for the respondent

   This  is  an  appeal  from  a  decision  of  an  adjudicator   (Mr   TRP
   Hollingworth), sitting at Nottingham on 8 April,  dismissing  an  asylum
   and human rights appeal by a citizen of Burma.  Leave  was  given  on  a
   number of  points,  mainly  challenging  the  adjudicator's  credibility
   findings. There are others, with which we shall begin.

2. This appellant's history is somewhat unusual.  He  gave  an  account  of
   trouble with the military r�gime (the same then as  now),  resulting  in
   detention and ill-treatment in 1989-90, when he was only 15-16. Then  in
   1994 he left Burma on an apparently  valid  passport  to  study  at  his
   father's expense in Turkey, where he  remained  till  he  came  to  this
   country, again on an apparently valid Burmese  passport,  on  5  October
   2002, claiming asylum on the 19th.

3. The appellant is a Sunni Muslim: though he raised no personal  complaint
   about how he was able to practise his religion  in  Burma,  there  is  a
   point taken on  that  in  the  grounds  of  appeal,  at  ground  8.  The
   adjudicator did not  need  to  deal,  as  he  did  at  �  33,  with  the
   appellant's freedom to worship in Turkey, which was  perfectly  obvious:
   however this (ground 8.1)  was  no  more  than  a  negative  point.  The
   "country expert" (Mr Win Soe, to whom  we  shall  return)  says  nothing
   about any religious persecution. The adjudicator would clearly have been
   wrong (see ground 7), if he had regarded "sustained persecution" on this
   basis as essential, though it is by no means clear from � 33 that he  is
   to be read as doing so. The question for us is whether there is anything
   to show a real risk at all for this appellant as a Muslim in Burma.

4. When we looked at the State Department  report  (for  2001,  the  latest
   provided by the appellant's solicitors), it became  clear  that,  though
   Muslims in Arakan province (bordering on Bangladesh) have  in  the  past
   had, and may continue to have serious problems, and  though  there  have
   been a number of incidents elsewhere, there is  nothing  in  general  to
   prevent Muslims in Rangoon (the capital, and this appellant's home town)
   from practising  their  religion  in  peace.  Miss  Starr  realistically
   acknowledged that, in the light of this,  no  point  based  on  religion
   could succeed.

5.  The  other  point  which  arises,  independently  of  the   appellant's
   credibility or otherwise, is whether he would  face  any  real  risk  on
   return as  a  failed  asylum-seeker.  This  is  based  on  the  "country
   expert"'s report at � 20, though it is not expressly raised in ground 9,
   which deals with the adjudicator's attitude to that. Unfortunately  that
   gentleman did not have before him, as do we, the copy of the appellant's
   passport retained by his solicitors. Instead of asking whether  one  was
   available (and, having interviewed the appellant himself - see � 12 - he
   could easily have found out that it was), he chose to speculate in  this
   way:

   20.  The  Military  Intelligence  have  boasted  that  they  would   get
       information of an asylum application within weeks of the  application
       and await the return of the applicant to  punish  the  failed  asylum
       seeker. I can say with  a  certain  degree  of  confidence  that  the
       Military Intelligence  would  ask  questions  of  a  person  who  has
       overstayed in the West and would  suspect  that  person  of  claiming
       asylum and  defaming  the  present  authorities  -  punishment  would
       inevitably follow Further, and in any event, the US State  Department
       Report indicates that the Burmese authorities do not  accept  Burmese
       deportees. Mr Abdul will have a passport which was illegally obtained
       and that would be apparent on the face of it.  Any  travel  document,
       which  could  be  given  to  hum  to  facilitate  his  return,   will
       immediately identify him as a deportee from the West as he has failed
       to fulfil asylum requirements.


   21. The authorities would carry out checks on Mr Abdul and it  would  be
       apparent that his father is in detention, that he exited the  country
       illegally and claimed asylum in the  UK.  In  the  circumstances,  Mr
       Abdul would be detained and thereafter, ill-treated.

6. Not only is there nothing on the face of the passport to show that it is
   other than regularly obtained, but the appellant himself says in his own
   statement at � 6 that his father had been released, after  three  months
   in detention in 2001. We shall come back to that point on its own merits
   later; but its importance for the moment relates to Mr Win Soe's  status
   as a "country expert". Although the appellant's statement was signed  on
   3 April 2003, and Mr Win Soe's report on the 8th, it  is  apparent  from
   the papers before us that both had been  in  existence  unsigned  before
   that. Nevertheless, Mr Win Soe  had  interviewed  the  appellant  before
   drafting his report, and ought not to have made such a mistake  on  what
   might have been a crucial aspect of the case. Nor ought he to have  made
   the assumption he did about the appellant's passport without  asking  to
   see it.

7. Those factors,  in  someone  who  himself  gives  a  history  of  actual
   involvement in Burmese politics,  in  our  view  require  Mr  Win  Soe's
   evidence to be treated with the very greatest caution, in  this  or  any
   other case where it may be relied on. If there is anything in the  point
   about this appellant's passport at ground 6, or  the  consequential  one
   about his inevitably being treated as  a  failed  asylum-seeker  on  his
   eventual return to Burma, it must depend on his own evidence,  to  which
   we shall now come.

8. Miss Starr realistically accepted  that,  in  the  light  of  latter-day
   Tribunal jurisprudence, the point taken at ground 5,  and  mentioned  in
   the grant of leave, about the adjudicator's use of "convinced"  was  not
   one which could succeed. While adjudicators would  do  better  to  avoid
   this  expression,  once  automatically  taken  to   imply   a   mistaken
   importation of the criminal standard of proof, the context in this  case
   is clear. When the adjudicator said (at � 30) "... but,  frankly,  I  am
   not convinced in any way about this", it is quite clear that he meant to
   indicate a comprehensive disbelief of the appellant  (to  at  least  the
   Karanakaran [2000] Imm AR 271 standard) on this point, as on others. The
   question for us is whether he is shown on grounds 1  -  4  or  6  to  be
   clearly wrong in that approach, or not.

9. There was an attempt by the solicitors to file  further  grounds,  which
   reached us only during the course of the hearing;  but  Miss  Starr  had
   already wisely disclaimed any such attempt to elaborate the  appellant's
   case any further. One point mentioned in the further grounds relates  to
   the appellant's age during what are said to have been  his  troubles  in
   1989-90. While Miss Starr was able to refer us  to  background  evidence
   (quite apart from Mr Win Soe's) about someone as  young  as  14  getting
   into trouble in this way, we do not think the adjudicator at � 23 is  to
   be read as regarding it as impossible that this  appellant  should  have
   been detained for a year at that age. (In fact he would  have  been  15,
   but nothing turns on that). He was on the other hand perfectly justified
   in taking the appellant's age at the time into  account  as  a  relevant
   factor.

10. The other points which arise on the events of 1989-90 appear at  grounds
   1 and 4. We do not think  the  adjudicator  was  entitled  to  draw  the
   conclusions he did (see ground 4) from what he thought was the  lack  of
   any claimed injury on the part of the appellant's father in  the  course
   of his detention during that same time. However, even if one  ground  is
   made out on the events  of  that  time,  12  years  elapsed  before  the
   appellant found it necessary to seek asylum in this country, and  it  is
   his situation on possible return now which mainly concerns us, and  with
   which we shall deal at 12 onwards.

11. On the other hand, the appellant's  inability  to  name  the  group  for
   which he suffered so much at such  an  early  age  (see  ground  1)  was
   certainly a relevant factor.  While  innominate  opposition  groups  may
   exist or have existed at  some  points  in  the  political  history  and
   geography of the world, Miss  Starr  was  unable  to  refer  us  to  any
   evidence of their flourishing in Burma.  Both  the  well-known  internal
   movement of Aung San Suu Kyi (the National League  for  Democracy),  and
   overseas groups, such as Mr  Win  Soe's  "Solidarity  for  Democracy  in
   Burma" and the others he  mentions,  have  their  names.  As  Miss  Webb
   pointed out, the  adjudicator  did  no  more  at  �  23  than  note  the
   appellant's inability to give one for his group as a relevant point, not
   one which was fatal to his credibility.

12. The only point of any real potential significance in this  case  is  the
   one which appears at grounds 2 and 3, and is specifically noted at  �  1
   of the grant of leave. This turns on events during the appellant's  stay
   in Turkey, and specifically his claim at � 6 of his statement  that  his
   father had been arrested in 2001, and detained for three months. That is
   something the adjudicator was clearly wrong (at � 26) to pass over  with
   the words "Nor, for what it is worth, did anything of great significance
   happen to the  Appellant's  family  on  the  Appellant's  account".  The
   question  for  us  is  whether  that  three  months'  detention  of  the
   appellant's father in 2001 could reasonably be seen as  leading  to  any
   real risk for himself on return in 2003.

13. That in turn requires discussion of  the  point  about  the  appellant's
   passports at ground 6. The adjudicator dealt with this at some length at
   �� 30-31. The appellant has throughout accepted that  Burmese  passports
   are not issued without a check  by  the  authorities  on  the  political
   reliability of the holder. However he says that, when  his  father  sent
   him to study in Turkey in 1994, he got his passport  through  an  agent.
   There is nothing to show that  this  passport  was  not  issued  in  the
   appellant's own name, and in an apparently regular  way  by  the  proper
   authorities in Burma, though, it is said, contrary to the  duty  of  the
   officer concerned to make proper inquiries. No doubt it would have  been
   officially stamped when the appellant  left  for  Turkey,  so  that  the
   authorities would have had an official record of his departure.  He  has
   never been back to Burma; so they must be well aware that  he  has  been
   continuously out of the country for the last nine years.

14. That passport, according to the  appellant,  ran  out  in  1998.  He  is
   silent about how he managed to  live  in  Turkey  without  a  valid  one
   between then and 2000. Whether the 1994 passport was or was not regarded
   by the Burmese authorities as a genuine one, it would no doubt, like any
   other passport, have been impossible to renew it, once  it  had  already
   expired; so the copy before us is of a new  passport,  declaring  itself
   issued in Yangon (Rangoon) on 14 August 2000, and valid for four  years.
   The appellant's case is that this was obtained, not by him  through  the
   usual channels (which would have been the nearest  Burmese  Embassy,  in
   Cairo); but by his father, again "under the counter" in Burma, and  sent
   to him in Turkey by hand of another student.  There is no indication  of
   why this should all have been done two  years  after  the  old  one  had
   expired; but two years before the appellant decided to leave Turkey  for
   this country.

15. The current passport bears the  appellant's  full  name,  and  a  serial
   number. It bears a British visit visa, issued on 23 May 2002; then there
   are Turkish entry  and  exit  stamps  dated  2  and  4  September,  with
   corresponding Greek stamps on a visa, showing that the appellant made an
   excursion to that country between those dates. Next  there  are  Turkish
   entry and exit stamps for 2 and 5 October: it is  not  clear  where  the
   appellant had been in between 4 September and 2 October; but  the  stamp
   for 5 October  must  show  the  appellant's  final  departure  for  this
   country, where he is said to have arrived on that day.  He  had  already
   been given leave to enter on the visit visa on 27 May, as shown  by  the
   arrival stamp for Heathrow  of  that  date,  on  what  he  said  at  his
   screening interview (A6, Q2.16) was a one-week training course. Needless
   to say, there is no record of when he left this country.

16. What is  clear  is  that  the  appellant's  current  passport  has  been
   accepted as genuine by the immigration authorities  of  three  different
   countries on various occasions. The appellant  was  already  a  seasoned
   traveller when he arrived here on 5 October, and it is  clear  (see  15)
   that that was not his first arrival. We regard both the Home Office  and
   the adjudicator as well justified in the point  they  took  (see  �  32)
   about the appellant's failure to claim on 5 October, or before the 19th;
   and what he says about how he got the passport has to  be  seen  in  the
   light of that.


17. It also has to be seen in the light of his failure to mention, at  Q  53
   of his interview on 27 November, that this  was  not  a  properly-issued
   passport at all. Miss Starr suggested that he might have been under some
   confusion, when he answered that question by saying  that  his  passport
   and visa had been valid at the  time  he  arrived  here,  as  between  a
   passport which was valid, and  one  merely  apparently  so.  However  we
   cannot see why someone of his experience should not  have  mentioned  at
   that point that his passport had been obtained by his father "under  the
   counter", if that had been true. In our view, the adjudicator was  fully
   justified in rejecting that account.

18. It follows that there is nothing to show that  the  Burmese  authorities
   had anything against the appellant when they issued his passport  on  14
   August 2000. Whether or not his father was detained for a time in  2001,
   it would have been clear  to  them,  and  would  remain  so,  that  this
   appellant, in Turkey seven years already by then, had nothing to do with
   whatever he had got into trouble for.  Nor,  as  Miss  Starr  suggested,
   would  there  be  anything  suspicious  when  the  appellant  eventually
   returned to Burma, in his passport not having an exit stamp from  there,
   since there is nothing to show they were not well aware  he  was  abroad
   when they issued it. Despite the adjudicator's failure  to  mention  the
   appellant's father's 2001 detention, we have no doubt that he was  right
   in the result he reached on the appeal as a whole.
