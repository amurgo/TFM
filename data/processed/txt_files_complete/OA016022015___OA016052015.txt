                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




    Introduction

    1.     The Appellants appealed with permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Brunnen on 29 June 2016  against  the  decision  and
         reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart who had dismissed
         their appeals against the Entry Clearance Officer's decisions dated
         17 December 2014 to refuse to grant them leave  to  settle  in  the
         United Kingdom under paragraph 297 of the  Immigration  Rules.  The
         decision and reasons was promulgated on 7 January 2016 following  a
         hearing on 1 December 2015.

    2.     The Appellants, sisters, are nationals of  Pakistan,  both  born
         there respectively on 10 February 1999 and 27 January 1998.   Judge
         Bart-Stewart found that there were credibility  problems  with  the
         evidence presented to her and  in  consequence  that  their  United
         Kingdom settled mother did not have  sole  responsibility  for  her
         daughters and there were no reasons to find  that  the  Appellants'
         exclusion from the United Kingdom would be undesirable.

    3.     Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
         Appellants was granted by Judge Brunnen because he considered  that
         it was arguable that the judge had (a) failed to  take  account  of
         material evidence relating to the sole  responsibility  issue;  (b)
         erred as to the residential address on the Second Appellant's birth
         certificate; and (c)  also  failed  to  take  account  of  material
         evidence relating to the desirability of exclusion issue.

    4.     Standard directions were made by the Upper  Tribunal  indicating
         that the appeals would be reheard immediately if a  material  error
         of law were found. A rule 24 notice was  filed  on  behalf  of  the
         Respondent opposing the appeals.

    Submissions - error of law

    5.     Mr Bazini for the Appellants relied on the grounds and the grant
         of permission to appeal.  In summary he submitted that the  judge's
         errors were so  significant  cumulatively  that  the  decision  and
         reasons could not stand and should be set  aside  and  remade.   At
         [38] of the determination it was accepted by  the  Appellants  that
         the judge had intended to refer to the Second Appellant rather than
         the First Appellant.  The sense was plain enough.  But at [33]  the
         judge  had  confused  the  residential  addresses  on   the   birth
         certificates  on  which  she  had  in  part  reached  her   adverse
         credibility findings.  That was significant.  At [34] the judge had
         drawn a false and unsustainable  inference  about  the  Appellants'
         father's continued presence, when finding  that  the  date  of  the
         registration of the Second Appellant's birth was 10 November  2010.
         That was simply the date the copy was issued.  The error had formed
         part of the adverse credibility assessment.

    6.     Miss Ahmad for the  Respondent,  who  had  participated  in  the
         discussion which Mr Bazini's submissions generated,  conceded  that
         there  was  an  error  of  fact  at  [33],  which   had   potential
         consequences if the inference drawn at [34] was not sustainable.

    The error of law finding

    7.     At the conclusion of  submissions,  and  the  useful  discussion
         mentioned above, the tribunal indicated that accepted  Mr  Bazini's
         submissions and found that the judge had inadvertently fallen  into
         material error of law, such that the decision and reasons could not
         stand.  The transposition of the Appellant's names at [38] did  not
         affect the point  the  judge  sustainably  made  about  the  Second
         Appellant's  independence,  but  the  misunderstanding   at   about
         addresses at [33] also  had  a  direct  bearing  on  the  incorrect
         inference drawn at [34].  It is important that  any  findings  made
         about foreign documents are either supported  by  objective/country
         background evidence, i.e., as to official practice, or are based on
         plain and obvious facts, e.g., impossible conflicts of dates within
         the same document.

    8.     A key issue surrounding sole responsibility was the  Appellants'
         father's rï¿½le in their lives, about which the  judge  made  adverse
         credibility findings, one of which was based on her analysis of the
         Second Appellant's birth certificate.   There can in the tribunal's
         view be little doubt that the evidence presented to  the  judge  in
         support of the two appeals left much  to  be  desired.   There  was
         obvious potentially available  evidence  missing,  such  as  family
         photographs,  as  the  judge  rightly  noted   at   [35]   of   her
         determination.  It is clear from the determination that the sponsor
         was not an impressive witness.  The  school  letter  produced  (see
         [36]) gave rise to further doubts.  But the inference drawn at [34]
         was an important element of the judge's analysis.  The judge  erred
         by  failing  to  consider  whether  there  might  be  an   innocent
         explanation  of  the  date  on  the  relevant  birth   certificate,
         particularly as there was  very  little  evidence,  if  any,  which
         suggested that the Appellants' father,  said  to  be  long  absent,
         might have still taken some interest in them.   His abandonment  of
         his family long ago was far from implausible in itself.

    9.     In some ways the dubious inference might to  be  said  to  be  a
         borderline error of law in view of the stronger  adverse  findings.
         As the tribunal has already indicated, the judge cannot  be  blamed
         given the poorly presented case put to her.  Nevertheless, there is
         a real possibility that a different conclusion might be reached  by
         another tribunal.  The error of law is material.  The appeals  must
         therefore be reheard.

    10.    Although the tribunal stated that it was  ready  to  rehear  the
         linked appeals immediately, this proposal was reluctantly  declined
         by Mr Bazini.  Further relevant and admissible  evidence  had  been
         obtained on which he wished to rely.  An essential witness was  not
         available.  The Appellants were not in apposition to proceed.  Miss
         Ahmad made no  submission  to  the  contrary.   The  rehearing  was
         accordingly adjourned and the appeals remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal given the further evidence requiring consideration.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of  a  material
    error on a point of law.  The tribunal allows the onwards  appeals  and
    sets aside the original decisions.

    The tribunal directs that the linked appeals must be reheard at  Taylor
    House by a  differently  constituted  First-tier  Tribunal,  i.e.,  not
    before Judge Bart-Stewart.
