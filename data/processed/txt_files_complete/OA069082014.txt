                                                                  Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss N Nnamani, Counsel, instructed by Trott &
                    Gentry Solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I see no need for and do not make any order  restricting  reporting  in
    this case.

 2. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of the respondent, who I
    identify as "the claimant", against the decision of the Entry Clearance
    Officer and refusing her entry clearance to the United Kingdom to  join
    her husband. The application was  refused  because  she  did  not  have
    enough money or rather she had not proved in the required way that  she
    had sufficient money.

 3. When the case came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  allowed  the
    appeal.  The Tribunal was satisfied that there was sufficient money but
    it misdirected itself. The misdirection is identified very  clearly  at
    paragraph 2 of  the  grounds  which  refers  to  paragraph  28  of  the
    Determination. There the Tribunal found that the sponsor's  income  met
    the required income threshold of �18,600 even though the actual payment
    into the bank account amounted to �18,330.62. The Tribunal  found  that
    the sponsor kept some cash back and did not pay it all  into  his  bank
    account.

 4. The Rules contemplate people being paid in that slightly untidy way but
    Appendix FM-SE.A1.3(n) requires as follows:

         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount on their payslips (or in  the  relevant
         specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
         statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only
         the net amounts shown of  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
         counted."

 5. In other words, the Tribunal did  precisely  what  the  Rules  said  it
    should not do.

 6. Ms Nnamani sought to defend the decision but there really is nothing to
    be said on this point except that the Tribunal was wrong. I  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. I must now decide how to proceed with the case.

 8.  Ms  Nnamani  argued  that  the  claimant  did  in  fact  satisfy   the
    requirements of the Rules and I adjourned so that she and Mr  Parkinson
    could discuss the case to see what could be agreed.  I am  grateful  to
    them for taking the sensible  approach  but  it  did  not  produce  the
    results that  the  claimant  wanted.   The  bank  statements  showed  a
    correlation between the payslips for the period  September  -  February
    which is the relevant period, save for (I think) three occasions  where
    there was an apparent deficiency that was  explained  by  reference  to
    payment by cheque rather than cash.

 9. The difficulty lies not in the method of payment but in the money  paid
    that way not being sufficient.  The appellant relied  on  a  six  month
    period so needed to show payment in  excess  of  �9,000  to  reach  the
    �18,600 threshold.  In fact the sums identified in  this  way  came  to
    only �8,264 and perhaps some pence.  This is just not enough money.  It
    is right that there was before the  First-tier  Tribunal  a  P60  which
    assisted the claimant but this on its own is not  sufficient  evidence.
    Reference has to be made to the bank accounts and that line of evidence
    just does not work.

10. I have sat back and reflected a little on this case  because  it  is  a
    matter of concern that the Entry Clearance Officer's figures cannot  be
    traced in the sense that neither Mr Parkinson nor Ms Nnamani could work
    out how the Entry Clearance Officer got the figures that  he  did.   It
    might be something Entry Clearance Officers will want  to  think  about
    because it is frustrating in the extreme that time is taken  up  trying
    to follow these things through.  Although there  are  many  exceptions,
    lawyers, in my experience, are frequently not good accountants and need
    all the help they can get.

11. I have to say that on a proper analysis of the evidence  the  applicant
    has failed to show that her husband earned sufficient money to meet the
    requirements of the Rules and the appeal must be  dismissed  under  the
    Rules. I have reminded myself that  the  standard  of  proof  that  the
    appellant must achieve is the balance of probabilities but this is  not
    really a "standard of proof case". The evidence,  literally,  does  not
    add up.

12. Miss Nnamani properly  reminds  me  that  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights has been raised and I agree that a  decision
    that prevents a wife joining her husband is an  interference  with  the
    private and family lives of those concerned.  However a  decision  that
    is in accordance with  the  Rules  is  almost  always  going  to  be  a
    proportionate decision. The Rules are part of  a  scheme  that  enables
    immigration control to be predictable and regulated and this  appellant
    does not satisfy them.

13. If I were to allow the appeal on human  rights  grounds  then  I  would
    allow the appeal because the sums were close to  the  required  amount.
    Put that way it is obviously the wrong thing to do.  I cannot  see  any
    way in which the appeal could  be  allowed  responsibly  on  Article  8
    grounds and so I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and
    I substitute a decision dismissing the claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision for the reasons I have given above.

14. I appreciate this is going to be disappointing for the people concerned
    but the Rules are there and it  is  for  applicants  to  satisfy  their
    requirements.

Notice of Decision

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal is allowed. I set  aside  the  decision
of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  the
claimant's appeal.
