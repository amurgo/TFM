For the Appellants:    Mr Bandegani, Counsel instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born in 1973. He appeals  with
    permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Bowler)  to
    dismiss his appeal on protection and human rights  grounds.  Permission
    to appeal to this tribunal was granted on the 10th June 2019 by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Osbourne.




 2. The protection claim advanced before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    the Appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri  Lanka  for
    reasons of his political opinion. He has been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 2010 but believes that if returned to Sri Lanka  today  he  would
    face a real risk of serious harm because the authorities there  believe
    him to have been involved in supplying  and  assisting  the  Liberation
    Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the period of armed conflict in Sri
    Lanka.  The crux of the Appellant's case is that  he  helped  a  family
    friend from Vavuniya by inter alia permitting him to store vehicles  at
    his premises in Colombo. One of these vehicles was subsequently used to
    carry a truck bomb. The Appellant asserts that  officers  investigating
    this bombing came to his home in February 2009 and arrested him. He was
    detained for  approximately  five  months  during  which  time  he  was
    subjected  to  serious  and  sustained  torture.    Whilst   undergoing
    hospital treatment for his injuries  he  managed  to  escape  following
    payment of a bribe, and  after  a  period  of  recuperation  in  hiding
    managed to travel to the United Kingdom.


 3. The Respondent had rejected the  Appellant's  account  for  a  want  of
    credibility and refused to grant protection.

 4. When the matter came before the  First-tier  Tribunal  there  were  two
    matters in issue. First, was the  'historical  account'  given  by  the
    Appellant true.  Second, did it give rise to  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Sri Lanka today. The burden in respect of  both  matters
    lay with the Appellant, and the lower  standard  of  proof  applied  in
    respect of each: the question was whether it 'reasonably likely'.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept that the account  was  true.  It
    gave the following reasons for that conclusion:

              i) There were inconsistencies arising from the evidence  given
                 in the screening and asylum interviews;


             ii) It was not  plausible  that  the  Appellant,  a  person  of
                 Sinhalese ethnicity, would have supplied goods to the Tamil
                 areas in the manner described;


            iii) It was not plausible that the Sri Lankan security  services
                 would have transferred the Appellant to hospital after they
                 had tortured him;


             iv) Little weight could be given  to  the  medico-legal  report
                 submitted (prepared by a Dr Briggs) because the author  was
                 not qualified to evaluate scars;

              v) The doctor had further failed to consider  the  possibility
                 that the scars borne by the Appellant  were  self-inflicted
                 /self-inflicted by proxy, in accordance with  the  decision
                 of the Upper Tribunal in KV (Scarring -  medical  evidence)
                 [2014] UKUT 230 (IAC);

             vi) The weight to be attached to the  claimed  subjective  fear
                 was diminished by  the  failure  to  claim  asylum  at  the
                 earliest opportunity: Section 8 of the  Asylum  Immigration
                 (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 applied;

            vii) It was not plausible that family homes  in  Sri  Lanka  had
                 been recently visited by the security services,  since  the
                 person responsible for the bombing  had  been  arrested  in
                 2009.

 6. Applying the extant country guidance in GJ & Ors [2013]  Sri  Lanka  CG
    UKUT 319 (IAC) the Tribunal rejected Mr  Halim's  contention  that  the
    Appellant would be on a 'stop list' or that he would be regarded  as  a
    threat  to  the  unitary  integrity  of  the  Sri  Lankan  state.   The
    determination concludes with a finding in the alternative: even if  the
    account given were true the  Appellant  would  not  be  at  risk  today
    because he is not, and never has been, a Tamil activist.



    The Grounds of Challenge

 7.  The Appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
    flawed in the following material respects:


              i) Legal Misdirection. In particular:


                 The Tribunal erred in its application of the guidance in KV
                 (scarring  -  medical  evidence)  on  the  possibility   of
                 scarring having been self-inflicted or  'self-inflicted  by
                 proxy'.  The  Tribunal  failed  to  apprehend   that   that
                 Tribunal's guidance on this point had  been  overturned  by
                 both the Court of Appeal and the  Supreme  Court  in  KV  v
                 Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] UKSC 10.


             ii)  Failure  to  consider  material  facts/evidence  (I).   In
                 particular:


                 The Tribunal  drew  adverse  inference  from  a  number  of
                 discrepancies arising from the records  of  both  screening
                 and asylum interviews. At paragraphs 23-24 of its decision,
                 the First-tier Tribunal notes that the  Appellant  had  not
                 requested that any changes be made to those records and  on
                 that basis  the  Tribunal  found  that  the  weight  to  be
                 attached to  those  records  should  not  be  reduced.  The
                 Appellant submits that in so finding the Tribunal failed to
                 have regard to correspondence in  the  file  in  which  the
                 Appellant's  representatives  had  a)  requested  that  the
                 interview be recorded b) repeatedly requested a copy of any
                 such tape and c) raised concerns about errors in the  typed
                 record concerns that arose from the fact that the Appellant
                 has mental health issues, that the record  was  never  read
                 back to him and that at one at least one  occasion  he  did
                 not even have an interpreter.


            iii) Failure to consider  material  facts/  evidence  (II).   In
                 particular:


                 The Tribunal finds  the  account  to  be  implausible,  and
                 current risk not made out, because the Appellant is not  an
                 ethnic Tamil. It is submitted that in so finding the First-
                 tier Tribunal failed to have regard  to  objective  country
                 background  material  to  the  effect  that  there   is   a
                 political/social group in Sri Lanka pejoratively  described
                 as the 'Sinhalese Tigers' or the 'Sinhala Kotiya', and that
                 there have been documented instances of Sri Lanka nationals
                 of Sinhalese ethnicity being detained and ill-treated  upon
                 suspicion of assisting the cause of Tamil separatism.




    The Respondent's Defence


 8. By his Rule 24 response dated the 12th July 2019 the Secretary of State
    submits that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  no
    material error of law and that it should be upheld.   The  first  point
    made is that the Tribunal in the alternative rejected the claim at  its
    highest, and so any deficiencies in its assessment  of  the  historical
    claim are immaterial.    In  respect  of  the  interview  records,  the
    Secretary of State submits that the Appellant has  to  date  still  not
    requested that any  changes  should  be  made  to  those  records.  The
    Tribunal acknowledges in the determination that they  did  request  the
    tapes of the interview.  Overall the Secretary of  State  submits  that
    this was a carefully  worded  determination  in  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal reached a conclusion open to it on the evidence.




    Discussion and Findings


    Ground (i):  Scarring


 9. We are satisfied that there is a clear error of law at paragraph 50  of
    the determination where the Tribunal reduces the weight to be  attached
    to the medico-legal report of  Dr  Briggs  because  he  has  not  given
    consideration to whether the injuries he observed  on  the  Appellant's
    body might have been self-inflicted, or self-inflicted by proxy. It  is
    first an error of fact  because  Dr  Briggs  does  in  fact  so  direct
    himself, but moreover it is a legal misdirection: the  UKUT  case  upon
    which the First-tier Tribunal relies, KV, had in  fact  by  that  time,
    been overturned by the Supreme Court, the decision  being  handed  down
    the week before the First-tier Tribunal decision.


10. We are further satisfied that there was a second error in  approach  to
    the medical report. At paragraph 49 the First-tier Tribunal finds  that
    the HOPO  on  the  day  was  correct  to  have  challenged  Dr  Briggs'
    qualifications to evaluate the Appellant's  scars.  Two  problems  here
    arise. The first is that in his detailed supplementary  refusal  letter
    of the 12th March 2019 the  Respondent  nowhere  takes  issue  with  Dr
    Briggs' qualifications or expertise. Had issue been taken in advance of
    the hearing, Dr Briggs would have had an  opportunity  to  address  any
    concerns raised. The second difficulty is that the CV attached  to  the
    report manifestly demonstrates that Dr Briggs is "qualified". He  is  a
    doctor of some 40 years  standing,  with  experience  in  Accident  and
    Emergency medicine and General Practice. He is  a  surgeon  and  was  a
    member of teaching staff at the Royal Free Hospital for  30  years.  He
    has also received specialist training  from  Medical  Justice  and  has
    prepared reports for that organisation and the Helen Bamber Foundation.
    It is hard to see what other  qualification  the  Tribunal  thought  he
    should have.


11. We find that this ground is therefore made out.




    Ground (ii): the Interviews


12.  When  the  Appellant  was  called  for  interview  in  June  2018  his
    representatives wrote to the UKVI at Harmondsworth, where the interview
    was due to be conducted,  and  requested  that  in  their  absence  the
    interview be taped.  Four days after the interview, on  the  26th  June
    2018, they wrote again, requesting a copy of the tape as  a  matter  of
    urgency. In that email they said this:


         "We have gone through the interview with our client and  there  are
         numerous errors but unfortunately we could not go  through  all  of
         the interview. It should be noted that as our client  suffers  from
         mental health  problems  it  has  been  difficult  to  obtain  this
         correction from him due to the fact  that  every  time  the  client
         discusses what he has been through, he becomes emotional and it  is
         extremely difficult because he is in  a detention centre".


13. It would appear that the Respondent wrote back on the 27th June stating
    that no recording was available. On  that  same  date  the  Appellant's
    representatives wrote again pointing out that had  they  been  informed
    that recording facilities were not available, they would have  attended
    the interview. They reiterated their concerns about the record, and the
    lack of interpreter.    A further letter of complaint was sent  on  the
    20th February 2019 in which the firm again  raised  the  issue  of  the
    recording of the interviews, and the failure to provide an  interpreter
    at the screening interview.


14. It was against this  background  that  the  Tribunal  was  tasked  with
    evaluating  the  evidence  recorded  in  both  screening   and   asylum
    interviews.  This it does by stating, between  paragraphs  22  and  24,
    that the Appellant has not sought to amend any of the  records  and  so
    the weight to be attached to them cannot  be  regarded  as  diminished.
    With respect, that rather misses the point.  The  point  was  that  the
    representatives had stated that they  were  having  difficulty  working
    from the typed record and taking instructions from a client with mental
    health difficulties. They wanted  the  recording  so  that  they  could
    better understand what had been said, and take instructions on it.

15. Mr Bandagani concentrated his submissions  on  the  commentary  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Diirshe  [2005]  1  WLR  2685  to  the  effect  that
    fairness  requires  that  interviews  conducted  in  the   absence   of
    representatives be taped. We would endorse those  comments.  Where,  as
    here, an interview record forms the centrepiece of  a  decision-maker's
    assessment  on  whether  a   claimant   qualifies   for   international
    protection,  it  is  obviously  important  that  such  interviews   are
    conducted fairly, and that they contain an accurate  representation  of
    the claim.  Whether that is so in this case we cannot know, since there
    does not appear to have been any such recording.     Whilst  the  Judge
    was obliged to take those records into account, he was also in our view
    obliged to have regard to the concerns that had been repeatedly  raised
    about the contents of the transcripts. At the very  least  they  should
    have been approached with some caution, and with  the  history  of  the
    correspondence in mind.

16. We find that ground (ii) is also made out.



      Ground (iii): Ethnicity

17. In the written grounds Mr R. Halim of Counsel asserts that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal failed to have regard to country background material when
    it found it to be unlikely that someone of  Sinhalese  ethnicity  might
    get involved in assisting the Tigers in the manner claimed. He cites  a
    Human Rights Watch report, an article from the  Colombo  Telegraph  and
    the report of the Special Rapporteur, Ben Emmerson QC,  to  the  effect
    that there is a grouping referred to as 'Sinhalese  Tigers'.   We  were
    unable to find either the article or  the  HRW  report  in  the  papers
    before us. The Ben Emmerson  report  was  handed  in  with  Mr  Halim's
    skeleton at the First-tier Tribunal hearing, but having read it we  can
    find no reference to Sinhalese individuals facing harm as a  result  of
    association with the Tamil cause.  It is therefore unfortunate, to  say
    the least, that the grounds are drafted in the way that they are.


18. That said, we are satisfied  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  apparently
    rejecting the account given on the grounds that the  Appellant  himself
    is not a Tamil. As his claim makes clear, the alleged  difficulties  he
    faced arose from association  with  the  Tamil  cause  arising  from  a
    personal friendship and  business  arrangement.  We  can  find  nothing
    inherently improbable in that.  We would also note that  the  Secretary
    of State saw nothing implausible in this aspect of the claim:  it  does
    not feature in either of the refusal letters, nor  in  the  submissions
    made on the day.    If it was a matter that  concerned  the  judge,  it
    should have been put to the Appellant.



    Conclusions

19. We accordingly find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  err  in  its
    assessment of the 'historical claim'. Whilst adverse findings were made
    that were arguably open to it  on  the  evidence  (see  �5  above)  the
    Tribunal's overall findings were infected by the errors in approach  to
    the  medical  evidence,  the  inter-parties  correspondence  about  the
    interviews and  the  issue  of  the  Appellant's  ethnicity.    We  are
    satisfied that these errors are  such  that  none  of  the  credibility
    findings can stand.

20. As to the question of current risk, Mr Melvin understandably pointed to
    the  findings  from  paragraph  70  of  the  decision,  the   'in   the
    alternative' risk assessment. We are satisfied that this  too  must  be
    set aside. This part of the determination is infected with the error at
    ground (iii), but also a failure to consider this  claim  with  anxious
    scrutiny. In the case of a man who claims to  have  been  detained  and
    tortured for five months for his alleged role in a  huge  bomb  attack,
    and who  escaped  from  detention  after  the  conclusion  of  military
    hostilities in 2009, it is not sufficient to conclude  without  reasons
    that he would not today be at risk. Applying the criteria in GJ  it  is
    at least arguable that there may be a warrant outstanding against  him,
    or that his name is on a 'stop list', and  those  matters  should  have
    been given careful consideration.


    Anonymity


21. This appeal concerns a claim made under the Refugee Convention.  Having
    had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity  Orders
    we therefore consider it appropriate to make an order in the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Decisions

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.


23. The hearing is to be re-made de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

24. There is an order for anonymity.
