MRS JUSTICE FOSTER:
INTRODUCTION

     1. This is an application for judicial review of a decision  dated  30
        May 2019 in which the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO")  refused  the
        Applicant Mrs [G] entry clearance from Iran  to  enter  the  UK  to
        visit her two daughters.

     2. The applicant's solicitors applied on 26 March 2019 on  her  behalf
        for a visit visa to the Entry Clearance  Office  in  Istanbul.  The
        application explained that  the  applicant  was  a  retired  school
        administration and teaching support assistant  then  aged  55,  she
        received a state retirement pension  paid  into  her  Iranian  bank
        account; the pension  payslips  were  enclosed  and  relevant  bank
        statements. Also enclosed  was  a  bundle  of  financial  materials
        evidencing health insurance in Iran,  and  also  property  held  in
        Iran: her own dwelling and 2 rental properties which were let  out.
        It was further explained the sponsor daughter  worked  for  British
        American Tobacco earning an annual  salary  of  �33,370  and  would
        support her mother's visit three months including  payment  of  her
        return flight tickets and UK expenses.  The  sponsor  undertook  to
        ensure her mother would return at the end of her visit.

     3. The application indicated Mrs [G] had travelled to Turkey  in  2015
        and that she had visited Iraq once a year over the last  few  years
        for a religious pilgrimage and had always returned to her  home  in
        Iran. Her next travel to Iraq was planned for October  2019,  again
        on pilgrimage.

     4. She explained that there had been a 12 -year  separation  from  her
        daughters for exceptional reasons because the daughters had  joined
        her ex-husband in 2007, he having been granted [pic]asylum  in  the
        UK, under the family reunion provisions. The father would not allow
        the mother to see the daughters following the divorce.

     5. This application was refused on 7 May 2019.

     6. The terms of that refusal were the following:

        "you have applied for entry clearance to the UK for two months  and
        30 days to visit your two daughters you have not seen for 12 years.
        I acknowledge the supporting documents from your daughters and from
        RP Singh Solicitors in the UK  but  must  be  satisfied  that  your
        circumstances in Iran are  such  that  you  will  comply  with  the
        conditions of the visa.

        You state that you have an income from pension amounting to �5440 a
        year.  In  support  of  this  you  have   provided   some   pension
        certificates that detail that your pension is 20,417,514 IRR (�102)
        a month. I also acknowledge your 2 bank statements from Bank  Melli
        and Bank Mellat. However,  both  of  these  statements  show  large
        deposits and it is not clear where the deposits come from.  Indeed,
        the bank statement from Bank Melli shows a loan on 19 January 2019.
        I am therefore not  satisfied  that  these  documents  are  a  true
        reflection of your financial circumstances. This causes me to doubt
        that your circumstances in Iran are as stated  and  therefore  your
        intentions of seeking entry to the UK.

        For the reasons above I am not satisfied  that  you  are  genuinely
        seeking entry for a purpose that is permitted by the visitor  route
        (Appendix 4.2 (c)). Nor have you shown that your circumstances  are
        such that you will leave the UK at the end of your visit  (Appendix
        V 4.2(a).

        I have therefore refused your application on the grounds  that  I'm
        not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that you meet all  of
        the requirements of the relevant Appendix  of  the  United  Kingdom
        Immigration Rules."

     7. The refusal was challenged by a Pre-Action Protocol ("the first PAP
        letter") letter dated 22 May 2019.  The  refusal  appeared  to  the
        applicant's advisors to be based on a misunderstanding of  some  of
        the financial documentation and the ECO's consequent belief she was
        not being truthful about her financial circumstances in Iran.

     8. The first PAP letter pointed out factual inaccuracies in the  ECO's
        refusal of 7 May and  explained  that  the  ECO  appeared  to  have
        ignored the evidence of property ownership valued at 10,000 million
        IRR, a pension income and income from one leased property in [pic]5
        million IRR and another in 3 and a half million IRR. The  deposits,
        about which the ECO had commented that they were large and  he  did
        not know their source were, they explained, interest payments  from
        the bank, and into her account and cash deposits. They pointed  out
        one of them was in the sum of �8.01 and  another  in  �54.00.  Also
        erroneously, the ECO appears to have seen a loan to her account; in
        fact this was his misunderstanding.

     9. Further details were given in the first PAP letter of  the  settled
        life the Applicant lived in Iran explaining how on a  weekly  basis
        she visited her mother and father's grave but had not explained the
        fact earlier believing that her financial details  and  her  strong
        economic ties to Iran  were  sufficient  evidence  of  her  genuine
        intention to return. Documentation including the title  deeds,  and
        lease  arrangements  on  her  property  together  with  her  health
        [pic]insurance et cetera were sent with the letter.

    10. Following this letter the decision of 7 May 2019 was  withdrawn.  A
        new entry clearance decision was made: it was  a  further  refusal,
        dated 29 May 2019. This later decision letter said as follows

        "You applied for entry clearance to go to the UK for  three  months
        "your initial application for a UK visit Visa ... [it] was  refused
        on 7/5/2019. Following  the  submission  of  a  [PAP]  letter,  the
        decision has been reviewed and revoked for a  fresh  assessment  to
        reconsider the documents and information provided and take  account
        of the content of the submissions.

        However, I have  re-refused  your  application  for  a  visit  Visa
        because I am not  satisfied  that  you  meet  the  requirements  of
        paragraph (s) V 4. 2 (10) Appendix V because

        You applied for entry clearance to go to the UK for three months to
        visit your two daughters who relocated to the UK themselves to join
        their father in 2007. I acknowledge supporting documents from  your
        daughters and I am satisfied that they  could  adequately  maintain
        and accommodate you for the proposed visit.

        The PAP letter submitted has sought to clarify the issues raised in
        the previous refusal letter regarding the  origins  of  funds  into
        your bank accounts in Iran and your financial  circumstances  there
        although the documents  still  do  not  make  clear  what  is  your
        disposable income. Nevertheless, I have  taken  into  consideration
        the calculations offered by your solicitor  of  a  monthly  pension
        income ... and two rental incomes ... Respectively making  a  total
        monthly income of  ...  Equivalent  to  an  annual  income  of  ...
        According to the bombast exchange rate on the  date  of  assessment
        (�l = 198250, as quoted from the previous refusal notice*) that  is
        an equivalent annual income in Iran, from all sources of  �l525  to
        support yourself and meet the cost of your  own  accommodation  and
        the maintenance of the spaces you rent. However, this  position  is
        the same whether or not you are in Iran or in the UK and  does  not
        demand your presence there to continue. Given this is your  income,
        I am not satisfied that your circumstances are such that  you  will
        leave the UK. You are divorced and retired with no  other  children
        or family in Iran. Your children are permanently settled in the  UK
        and have no intention to leave themselves.

        I  have  therefore  refused  your  application  because  I  am  not
        satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that  you  are  seeking
        entry to the UK only to visit or that you will leave the UK after a
        limited period. V4.2 (a) (c).

        *I am aware  from  information  in  the  public  domain  and  other
        currency conversion tools, such as wuw.bombast.com that  while  the
        OANDA website shows the official exchange rate, it is not  possible
        to exchange currency at the official rate and that he  actual  rate
        you are likely to receive is around 198250 IRR(�1)."

    11. Following receipt of this refusal the applicant's advisors wrote to
        the respondent challenging the 29 May 2019 decision with  a  second
        Pre-Action Protocol letter on 20 June 2019 containing a  number  of
        further details about the applicant's ties  to  her  home  country,
        emphasising the amount received by the applicant  was  adequate  to
        support her comfortably in  Iran  and  that  all  her  evidence  of
        economic ties had been submitted already.

    12. The Secretary of  State  ("SSHD"),  decided  on  27  June  2020  to
        maintain the refusal of leave to enter. The SSHD's defence  of  the
        application is shortly put and to  the  effect  that  the  ECO  was
        entitled to conclude she would not leave after  her  visit  as  she
        said she would because she had a modest annual income and her close
        family were all resident in the UK  (Detailed  Grounds  of  Defence
        paragraph 12).

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Immigration Rules

    13. The SSHD under section 3(2) of the 1971 Act,  has  promulgated  the
        Immigration Rules  Paragraph  V4  of  which,  provides  insofar  as
        relevant the requirements for entry clearance as a visitor:

           V 4.1 The decision maker must he that the applicant meets all of
           the eligibility requirements in paragraphs V 4.2 - V  4.10.  The
           decision maker must be satisfied that the  applicant  meets  any
           additional eligibility requirements, where the applicant:

        a) is a child at the date of application, they must also  meet  the
           additional requirements at V 4.11 - V 4.13; or

        b) is coming to the UK to receive private medical  treatment}  they
           must also meet the additional requirements at V 4.14 -  V  4.16;
           or

        c) is coming to the UK as an organ donor, they must also  meet  the
           additional requirements at V 4.17 - V4.20; or

        d) is coming to the UK under the ADS agreement, they must also meet
           the additional requirements at V 4.21; Of

        e) is an academic seeking a 12 month visit  visa,  they  must  also
           meet the additional requirements at V 4.22

           V 4.2 applicant must satisfy the decision maker that they are  a
           genuine visitor. This means that the applicant:

        a) will leave the UK at the end of their visit; and

        b) will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent of
           successive visits, or make the UK their main home; and

        c) is genuinely seeking entry for a purpose that  is  permitted  by
           the visitor routes (these are listed in Appendices 3, 4 and  5);
           and

        d) will not undertake any prohibited activities set out in V  45  V
           4.10, and

        e) must have sufficient funds to  cover  all  reasonable  costs  in
           relation to their visit  without  working  or  accessing  public
           finds. This includes the cost o/ the return or  onward  journey,
           any costs relating  to  dependants,  and  the  cost  of  planned
           activities such as private medical treatment

           V 4.3 A visitor's travel, maintenance and accommodation  may  be
           provided by a third party where the decision maker is  satisfied
           that they:

        a) have a genuine professional or personal  relationship  with  the
           visitor; and

        b) are not, or will not be, in breach of UK immigration laws at the
           time of decision or the visitor's entry to the UK; and

        c) can and will provide support to the  visitor  for  the  intended
           duration of their stay.

           V 4.4 The third party may be asked to  give  an  undertaking  in
           writing to be responsible for the  applicant's  maintenance  and
           accommodations In this case paragraph 35  of  Part  1  of  these
           Rules applies also to Visitors. An applicant  will  normally  be
           refused where, having been requested to  do  so,  the  applicant
           fails to provide a valid written undertaking from a third  party
           to be responsible for their maintenance  and  accommodation  for
           the period of any visit.

Policy Guidance:

    14. The Respondents policy guidance, "Visit  Guidance  Version  6.0  14
        June 2017" is in the following terms:

           Visit: genuineness and credibility

           Assessing an applicant's genuine intentions to visit
           See: paragraph V 4.2 of appendix V: visitor rules.

           .     You must be satisfied that the  applicant  meets  all  the
              requirements of V 4.2 to V 4.10 of the visitor rules and is a
              genuine visitor, See also V 8.4 for extensions  of  stay.  If
              you are not satisfied, you must refuse their  application.  A
              visitor can enter, or  extend  their  stay  to  do  different
              permitted activities but they should be expected  to  have  a
              main reason or reasons for visiting, example for business  or
              a  holiday,  and  be  able  to  provide   details.   However,
              particularly where a  visitor  holds  a  long-term,  multiple
              entry visit visa valid for 2, 5 or 10  years,  it  is  likely
              that their reasons for  visiting  will  over  time.  This  is
              permissible, provided they continue to  intend  to  undertake
              one or more permitted visitor activity. See  suitability  for
              further details.

           Assessing an applicant's personal circumstances
           See: paragraph V 42 of appendix V: visitor rules?

           The following factors will help you assess if an applicant is  a
           genuine visitor:

         . Their previous immigration history, including visits to  the  UK
           and other countries

         .  the  duration  of  previous  visits  and   whether   this   was
           significantly longer than they originally stated on  their  visa
           application or on arrival if this is the case,  you  should  not
           automatically presume that the visitor is not genuine, but  this
           may be a reason to question the applicant's overall Intentions

         . their financial circumstances as well as  their  family,  social
           and economic background

         . their personal and economic ties to their country of residence

         . the cumulative period of time the applicant has visited  the  UK
           and their pattern of travel over the last 12 month  period,  and
           whether this amounts to 'de facto' residence in the UK

         . whether, in your judgment, the information and the  reasons  for
           the visit or for extending their stay provided by the  applicant
           are credible and correspond to their  personal,  family,  social
           and economic background

         . other information that is relevant to assessing the  applicant's
           intentions, such as:

               . the applicant's country  of  residence  and/or  country  of
                 nationality - this can include the political, economic  and
                 security situation - you may  use  any  reputable  publicly
                 available  information  to  identify  these   factors   for
                 example,  Home  Office  country  information  reports,   UN
                 reports, EU reports, factual media reporting

               . where publicly available  information  indicates  that  the
                 political and/or economic and/or security situation in  the
                 country (or part of the country) in which the applicant has
                 the right  to  reside  permanently  is  unstable  or  is  a
                 conflict zone  because  it  has  significant  political  or
                 social unrest, this will form  an  important  part  of  the
                 assessment of whether the applicant is  a  genuine  visitor
                 who has the intention and ability to leave the  UK  at  the
                 end of their visit- an example of this scenario is  in  the
                 next bullet

               . where information indicates that the country or part  of  a
                 country is a conflict zone, this information, if it is  not
                 outweighed by the particular circumstances of the applicant
                 - for example, that they also have legal  right  to  reside
                 permanently in  another,  more  stable  country  -  can  be
                 sufficient reason for you not  to  be  satisfied  that  the
                 applicant is a genuine visitor

               . information on immigration  non-compliance  by  individuals
                 who applied for a visit visa  from  the  same  geographical
                 region as  the  applicant  -  this  can  include  published
                 statistical information on immigration  non-compliance  and
                 any other locally held information  Home  Office  published
                 statistical reports may help with your assessment

           Travel/ immigration history

           You must check the applicant's travel history in their  passport
           (and, for visa applications, listed on the form). A  pattern  of
           travel that shows the applicant has previously complied with  UK
           immigration law may indicate the applicant is a genuine visitor.
           As might travel to other countries, especially the USA,  Canada,
           Australia,  New  Zealand,   Ireland,   Schengen   countries   or
           Switzerland

           If an applicant has previously failed  to  comply  with  another
           country's immigration law, for example if they have been removed
           from another country, or if they  have  been  refused  entry  to
           another country, this may that an applicant  is  not  a  genuine
           visitor (depending on the circumstances).

           Travel history should not be the only consideration in  deciding
           whether you are satisfied an applicant is a genuine visitor.  In
           particular there may have been a change in  circumstances  since
           previous travel. You should consider  all  relevant  information
           for each application including any social and  economic  factors
           and any locally held information.

           Where the applicant is a first-time traveller, you will need  to
           rely on other evidence to satisfy you they have a genuine intent
           to visit.

           Frequent or successive visits: how to assess if an
           applicant is making the UK their main home or
           place of work
           See: paragraph V 4.2(b) appendix V: visitor rules.

           You should check the applicant's travel history,  including  how
           long they ace spending in the UK and  how  frequently  they  are
           returning. You must assess if they are, in effect, making the UK
           their main homes You should look at:

         . the purpose of the visit and intended length of stay stated

         . the number of visits made over the past 12 months, including the
           length of stay on each occasion, the time elapsed since the last
           visit, and if this amounts to the individual spending more  time
           in the UK than in their home country

         . [pic] the purpose of return trips to the visitor's home  country
           and if this is used only to seek re-entry to the UK

         .  the  links  they  have  with  their  home  country  -  consider
           especially any long term commitments and where the applicant  is
           registered for tax purposes

         . evidence the UK is their main place of residence, for example:

            o if they have registered with a general practitioner (GP)

            o if they send their children to UK schools

         . the history of previous applications, for example if the visitor
           has  previously  been  refused  under  the  family   rules   and
           subsequently wants to enter as a visitor [pic]you must assess if
           they are using the visitor route to avoid the rules in place for
           family migrants joining British or settled persons in the UK

           There is no specified maximum period  which  an  individual  can
           spend in the UK in any period such as '6 months in  12  months'.
           However, if it is clear from an individual's travel history that
           they are making the  UK  their  home  you  should  refuse  their
           application.

           Grounds for doubting the applicant's intentions to visit the
           [pic]UK See: paragraph V 4.2 of appendix V: visitor rules.

           This is not an exhaustive list but may help with your assessment
           if

            . The applicant has few or no family and economic ties to their
              country of [pic]residence, and has several family members  in
              the UK - for example a person with most of  their  family  in
              the UK and no job or  study  in  their  own  country  may  be
              considered to have few ties

            .  the  political,  economic  and  security  situation  in  the
              applicant's country of [pic]residence, including  whether  it
              is politically unstable, a conflict zone or at  risk  [pic]of
              becoming one, which may lead to doubts about their  intention
              to leave the UK at the end of their visit see  "Assessing  an
              applicant's personal circumstances"

            . the applicant, their sponsor (if they are visiting  a  friend
              or relative) or other immediate family  member  has,  or  has
              attempted  to,  deceive  the  Home  Office  in   a   previous
              application for entry clearance, leave to enter or  leave  to
              remain

            . there are in discrepancies between the statements made by the
              applicant  and  the   statements   made   by   the   sponsor,
              particularly on points where the sponsor could reasonably  be
              expected to know the facts but does not

            . it has not been possible to verify  information  provided  by
              the applicant despite attempts to do so

            . the information that has been provided or the reasons  stated
              by the applicant are not credible

            . a search of the applicant's baggage and vehicle at the border
              reveals items which demonstrate they intend to work  of  live
              in the UK

           Credibility and intentions: borderline decisions
           See: paragraphs V 4.2 and V 8.4 of appendix V: visitor rules

           For visa applications, if you are satisfied that  the  applicant
           meets all the visitor rules you should grant the  visa,  but  if
           some aspects remain of concern, you should consider  whether  to
           grant a short duration visa.

           At the border, you must use code 3 if the  applicant  meets  all
           the visitor rules. but some aspects remain of concern."

CONSIDERATION

    15. It was argued before me that there were material public law  errors
        in the decision making process: in effect  that  the  decision  had
        ignored  material  evidence  and  was  irrational   and   therefore
        unlawful, alternatively the ACO had  not  properly  considered  and
        applied the relevant Immigration Rules. Various  other  allegations
        of  illegality  including  a  failure  properly  to  consider   the
        provisions of Article 8 ECHR were made but in essence the challenge
        is one of rationality and involving the obligation to  have  regard
        to material factors.

    16. In my judgement this is essentially a simple case and  that  whilst
        the burden of  showing  that  she  comes  within  the  rules  falls
        squarely upon Mrs [G], the ECO must apply the Immigration Rules and
        Guidance in a rational manner and  apply  the  standard  of  proof,
        namely the  balance  of  probabilities  lawfully  when  making  his
        assessment. The ECO must reach a  conclusion  which  is  rationally
        supported by the materials in order to be defensible.

    17. The judicial review jurisdiction is not lightly exercised  in  this
        context and it will be an unusual case in which the decision of the
        ECO is held to be unlawful, but in my  judgement  this  is  one  of
        those cases. The decision cannot be defended and must be quashed

    18. The operative part  of  the  second  decision  appears  to  be  the
        following, (emphasis added):

        "I have taken into consideration the calculations offered  by  your
        solicitor of a monthly pension income... and two rental  incomes...
        Respectively making a total monthly income of... Equivalent  to  an
        annual income of... According to the bombast exchange rate  on  the
        date of assessment (l pound  equals  198250,  as  quoted  from  the
        previous refusal notice) that is an  equivalent  annual  income  in
        Iran, from all sources of �1525 to support yourself  and  meet  the
        cost of your own accommodation and the maintenance  of  the  spaces
        you rent. However, this position is the same whether or not you are
        in Iran or in the UK and does not demand  your  presence  there  to
        continue. Given this is your income, I am not satisfied  that  your
        circumstances are such that you will leave the UK. You are divorced
        and retired with no other children or family in Iran. Your children
        are permanently settled in the UK and have no  intention  to  leave
        themselves."

    19. Whilst. of course, an Entry Clearance Officer must be astute not to
        be persuaded by the dishonest or the unqualified applicant, against
        this background it is, in my judgement, not possible rationally  to
        say,  that  the  applicant  has  not  shown  on  the   balance   of
        probabilities that she is likely to leave at the end of her visit,

    20. The ECO was particularly concerned about the economic  position  it
        appears, and the incontrovertible evidence was that  the  applicant
        had substantial economic ties: not only her own house,  but  rental
        properties situated there.  She  was  an  independent  woman,  with
        property and an income. She had lived independently (there  was  no
        evidence her daughters in UK supported her). She also had relations
        whom she saw regularly: this evidence and the  reiteration  of  the
        position (not expressly denied by the respondent) that she had done
        and would be able to fend for  herself  adequately  in  Iran,  were
        reinforced in the second PAP letter.

    21. The evidence also  suggested  there  was  a  good  reason  for  any
        previous estrangement between herself and her  daughters:  she  was
        divorced from their father, who had obtained asylum in the UK.  The
        evidence from  the  daughters  spoke  of  a  previously  oppressive
        relationship with their father who had forbidden contact  with  the
        mother. This was substantiated by medical evidence from one of  the
        daughters. The evidence also showed the sponsoring daughter,  (both
        daughters are established UK citizens), had a good job and her  own
        accommodation, undertook to ensure their mother would leave at  the
        end of the visit, and would be accommodated and  sustained  in  the
        course of its

    22. The Rules and the Guidance direct the Officer to considerations  of
        ties to the home country, and to personal ties.  There  was  in  my
        judgement no cogent  reason  for  rejecting  the  material  he  was
        presented with as showing that it was more likely than not that she
        would leave at the end of her visit.

    23. The basis of the second decision from the ECO would  appear  to  be
        (although it is unclear in my judgement):

           a. I reject the proposition that you have shown  me  significant
              ties to your home country by demonstrating  that  you  own  a
              property and you rent out 2 units  because  you  can  receive
              rental income internationally, and

           b. Your income is less than a person would live on in the UK and
              your daughters are here so I think you are unlikely to leave.

    24. As to  (a)  this  is  in  my  judgement  irrational.  The  evidence
        proffered was of substance, was by its  nature,  immovable  assets,
        and common sense dictates, requires input from the applicant or  at
        the very least is most unlikely to be abandoned  by  her  which  an
        intention not to leave at the end of a visit implies.

    25. As to (b), this is also, without more, without logical  foundation.
        It would in my judgement, otherwise be impossible  for  any  mature
        person to visit their  children  settled  abroad  in  circumstances
        where, although financially independent and with not  insignificant
        property in the home country, he/she could not say,  as  the  rules
        perhaps suggest that they  ought,  that  he/she  was  returning  to
        employment, or studying on some course.

    26. In my judgement the correct analysis is that  the  Entry  Clearance
        Officer made an error of law in  that  he  was  applying  too  high
        standard of proof: it is the balance of probabilities,  he  is  not
        required to be persuaded so that he is "sure". The ECU has to judge
        whether the Applicant has shown him it is more likely than not that
        they are a genuine visitor who [pic]will leave the UK at the end of
        their proposed visit.

    27. This was not a case with an adverse  immigration  history  to  take
        into account. Nor was it a case that suggested  the  applicant  had
        little or nothing to return for to her home country.

    28. By the time the second decision had been made,  and  the  SSHD  had
        maintained it, it could not rationally consider that the applicant,
        a first-time visitor, did not have long-term commitment to her home
        country. She had by that stage produced evidence of

           a. her ownership of her own home property

           b. two additional revenue producing properties,

           c. an adequate income, which included a pension, in Iran

           d. health insurance in Iran

           e. apparent solvency - as demonstrated by her bank accounts

           f. emotional/religious attachments to her  home  country,  where
              her parents were buried, whose grave she visited weekly

           g. 7 sisters and a number of nieces living there  whom  she  met
              regularly.

    29. There was, further, nothing in the applicant's past nor  pertaining
        to her family here to suggest that her claim to be  a  visitor  was
        merely  a  lie.  The  applicant  had  previously  made  one  failed
        application for entry clearance in 2016 but  that  application  was
        refused on 19 September 2016,  at  a  time  when  she  was  legally
        unrepresented  and  had  been  told  she  had  failed  to   include
        supporting documentation to evidence her life in Iran  and  produce
        appropriate evidence of her ties to the country.

    30. I share the approach taken to this matter at the  permission  stage
        where it was said succinctly by UTJ Hanson as follows, after having
        set out that the relevant part of the guidance:

        "The only example relevant to this applicant is  that  she  has  no
        family in Iran, but it was demonstrated the applicant has an income
        sufficient to meet her needs together with property  and  therefore
        has economic ties. This is not a mandatory ground for  refusal  and
        reflects earlier jurisprudence of the tribunal in  Ogun  Koehler  v
        ECU [2002] UK IAT 2238 in which  it  was  found  that  if  lack  of
        economic incentive to return to the country of origin sufficient to
        found the refusal of the visit application "then no  person  living
        overseas  where  the  standard  of  living  was  lower  than   that
        prevailing in the UK could ever come on holiday here,  or  visit  a
        relative settled here. That is not the law".

        In relation to strength of ties it was found in A (Nigeria)  [2004]
        UK IAT 19 that it was not a requirement to the rules that a  person
        should have strong ties with their country of nationality  but  was
        simply a fact that could be taken into account when determining the
        applicant's intentions although decision-maker had to show  why  he
        or she thought it was an important  point  of  that  was  the  case
        (sic).

        The decision appears to be predicated upon suspicion in the mind of
        the ACO without [pic]more. In  Mohammed  Olly  TH/13048/86  it  was
        found that simple suspicion, itself, is not enough to undermine the
        credibility of an applicant but the cumulative effect of  a  series
        of such matters, each only suspicions, may give rise to  more  than
        "mere suspicion"."

    31. I agree, in particular with the observation  that  if  and  to  the
        extent that the differential between standards of  living  in  Iran
        and the UK was the foundation or part of it of this decision, it is
        on its own insufficient to impugn this applicant's credibility.

    32. It is the case that that no other reasons  for  refusal  have  been
        cited by the ECO, and a properly reasoned decision would  have  set
        out what other matters were relied  upon  if  any  were.  One  must
        deduce there were no other substantive reasons for the refusal.

    33. I asked the SSHD's representative at the  hearing  of  this  matter
        what other evidence it would have been possible for an applicant in
        this position to produce in order to persuade the ECO that she  was
        genuine, and in fairness to him,  he  was  unable  to  suggest  any
        [pic]material. Whilst that is not, in logic, an answer to the legal
        question of whether there was a reviewable error, that answer  does
        prompt closer investigation of the decision-making in this case.

CONCLUSION

    34. I agree with the SSHD that the foundation of the decision  was,  in
        truth, a failure to be satisfied that this applicant  would  return
        to Iran. However, that conclusion had to be justified in  the  face
        of the evidence of the financial and property position as shown him
        in Iran and in light of the Guidance  which  illustrates  how  such
        matters may be illustrated by an applicant. As explained above,  in
        my judgement the ECO made an error of law which  may  be  variously
        expressed:

           a. His decision was on the evidence, irrational and/or

           b. He failed properly  to  take  into  account  the  substantial
              evidence of the applicant's incentives to return to Iran

           c. He applied too high a standard of proof when judging  whether
              she had satisfied him that she would return after a visit  to
              the UK

    35. The Application for Judicial Review is granted.

Singh Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicant and  Mr  Benjamin  Seifert,  of
Counsel, instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, on behalf of the  Respondent,

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal[pic]

      I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because this  was
a straightforward decision based on  its  own  facts,  raising  no  separate

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
