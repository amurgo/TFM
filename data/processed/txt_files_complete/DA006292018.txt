Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Nathan
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Poland who was born on  6  September  1980,
    appeals against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  was
    promulgated on  6  January  2020.  By  that  decision,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed the appellant's appeal against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to deport the appellant to Poland in accordance with
    Regulation 23 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

 2. At the initial hearing on 24 February 2021, I indicated to the  parties
    and to the appellant that I intended to allow the appeal, set aside the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and return the appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the  decision.  I  shall  now
    briefly give my reasons.

 3. The appellant claimed to have lived and worked in  the  United  Kingdom
    from 2006. The appeal turned on the question of whether he was entitled
    to protection at the 'higher' level afforded  by  Regulation  27(4)  on
    account of his length of residence/exercise  of  Treaty  Rights  whilst
    having regard also to the  effect  the  appellant's  three  periods  of
    imprisonment (none longer than 9 months) may have had on the  level  of
    integration he had achieved in United Kingdom society. At  the  initial
    hearing, both representatives agreed that, in her analysis,  the  judge
    had failed to carry out an assessment as  described  by  the  Court  of
    Justice of the  European  Union  in  B  v  Land  Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  (C-
    316/16)/Secretary of State for the Home Department v Franco Vomero  (C-
    424/16) at [83]:

         In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to  the  first  three
         questions in Case C-316/16 is that Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
         2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of a Union
         citizen who is serving a custodial sentence  and  against  whom  an
         expulsion decision is adopted, the condition of having 'resided  in
         the host Member State for the previous ten years' laid down in that
         provision may be satisfied  where  an  overall  assessment  of  the
         person's situation, taking into account all the  relevant  aspects,
         leads to the conclusion that, notwithstanding that  detention,  the
         integrative links between the person concerned and the host  Member
         State have not been broken. Those aspects include, inter alia,  the
         strength of the integrative links forged with the host Member State
         before the detention of the person concerned,  the  nature  of  the
         offence that resulted in  the  period  of  detention  imposed,  the
         circumstances in which that offence was committed and  the  conduct
         of the person concerned throughout the period of detention.

 4. In the circumstances, I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and return the appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  that
    Tribunal to remake the decision at or following a hearing de novo. None
    of the findings of fact shall stand.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside.  I  return  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for  that  Tribunal  to  remake  the
    decision at or following a hearing de novo. None  of  the  findings  of
    fact shall stand.




    Signed                              Date 25 February 2021
