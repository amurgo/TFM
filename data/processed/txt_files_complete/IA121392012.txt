                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

   1. This is an appeal that has, on any view, a lengthy history.

   2. The appellant, an Indian citizen, entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  9
      September 2010 on a tier 4 general student visa. In November 2010, not
      long after his arrival, he was diagnosed with kidney failure.

   3. In November 2011, citing his medical condition, the appellant  applied
      for leave to remain. That application was refused by the respondent on
      8 May 2012.

   4. The appellant thereafter appealed under section 82 of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  By  the
      time of his hearing on 9  July  2012,  the  appellant  was  undergoing
      dialysis  treatment  three  times  a  week  and  awaiting   a   kidney
      transplant.  He maintained that article 3 of the  European  Convention
      on Human Rights ('ECHR')  would  be  breached  (inhuman  or  degrading
      treatment), if he was to be returned to India without giving  him  the
      opportunity to take up the donor offer and to remain in  the  UK  long
      enough to recuperate.

   5. The judge at  first  instance,  while  acknowledging  the  appellant's
      condition was 'undoubtedly very serious', found that the appellant was
      not close to death and that the appellant had failed to demonstrate he
      could  not  be  guaranteed  nursing  or   medical   care   in   India.
      Consequently, the judge found no breach of article 3.

   6. It is from the above decision that the history of this  appeal  flows.
      The Upper Tribunal concluded in  November  2012  that  the  First-tier
      decision did not involve the making of an error of  law,  finding  the
      judge had taken full account of the relevant case law in  relation  to
      health when removal is contemplated.

   7. From there  the  matter  proceeded  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  where
      permission to appeal was granted on 24 March 2014 as part of a  series
      of linked appeals, all concerning  applicants  suffering  from  'grave
      medical conditions being effectively treated in the United Kingdom'.

   8. The Court of Appeal found that the appellant had major kidney  disease
      (otherwise  known  as  end-stage  kidney   disease),   together   with
      depression and evidence of a risk of suicide. The appellant's hospital
      had indicated their willingness to assess the  appellant  for  a  live
      donor transplant. On 1 July  2014,  the  Court  of  Appeal  found  the
      proposed donor was compatible.

   9. At that stage, the Secretary of State  consented  to  the  appellant's
      appeal being allowed and for the case to  be  remitted  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal for further consideration of his claim under article 8 of the
      ECHR. The Court of Appeal also indicated that the further  development
      relating to the possible transplant might touch upon article 3 and the
      appellant could therefore make a fresh article 3 claim. As  a  result,
      the removal decision was quashed.

  10. On 29 January 2015, the day before the Court of Appeal handed down its
      approved  judgment,  the  appellant  underwent  a  kidney   transplant
      operation. The operation was successful, and he was  discharged  on  6
      February 2015.

  11. Although the appellant's appeal was remitted pursuant to article 8  of
      the ECHR, the appellant's article 3 claim,  although  acknowledged  as
      above, was dismissed.

  12. In common with the appellants in the other appeals before the Court of
      Appeal, the appellant sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court
      on the article 3 aspect of his claim. Permission in  that  regard  was
      refused on 30 July 2015. The parties then  appealed  to  the  European
      Court of Human Rights ('ECtHR').

  13. His case by this stage  had  evolved  to  the  following  extent:  the
      appellant argued that if he was now to be returned to India, where  he
      would not have access to the ongoing, post-transplant  expert  medical
      supervision and medication that he required, the consequences would be
      catastrophic.

  14. On 13 July 2017, the appellant's representatives were informed by  the
      ECtHR that a single judge had examined  the  application  and,  having
      regard to the UK Government's undertaking to reconsider the  complaint
      in the light of the Grand Chambers judgement in Paposhvili  v  Belgium
      [GC] [2016] ECHR 1113 ('Paposhvili'), the ECtHR had decided to  strike
      out the application.

  15. In short, the ECtHR did so because both parties agreed that the  scope
      of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal would  include  consideration
      of both article 3 and article 8 of the ECHR.

  16.  On  26  January  2018,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  stayed  the
      appellant's case pending a decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AM
      (Zimbabwe) and others (C5/2016/4178, C5/2016/4677  and  C5/2017/0755).
      Various case management directions have since been given.

  17. Subsequently, AM (Zimbabwe) has been decided and now appealed  to  the
      Supreme Court. It is due to be heard in December 2019.  As part of the
      case management in this matter, the decision was taken that this  case
      could now proceed, notwithstanding that outstanding appeal. Nothing in
      the course of the instant proceedings has changed  our  view  in  that
      regard for the reasons set out herein.


The present proceedings

  18. On 16 February 2018, the respondent wrote to the appellant providing a
      supplemental letter, as requested by the Upper Tribunal, to be read in
      conjunction with the original decision of  8  May  2012.  That  letter
      states it is neither a fresh decision to refuse a human  rights  claim
      nor the rejection of further submissions as  a  fresh  claim.  It  was
      essentially a letter to  assist  the  parties  in  the  current  Upper
      Tribunal proceedings.

  19. This matter was listed before us originally on 28 May  2019  and  then
      adjourned for further directions,  which  included  that  the  parties
      provide a summary of the issues they are now asking the Upper Tribunal
      to resolve.

  20. In a statement of agreed issues, dated 28 May 2019, the appellant  and
      the  respondent  indicated  the  following   legal   issues   required
      resolution:

              i. Article 3 - medical;
             ii. Article 3 - suicide;
            iii. Paragraph 276 ADE (1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules;
             iv. Article 8 - private life.


  21. Additionally, the appellant and the respondent agree the following new
      factual issue requires resolution, which it  was  submitted,  impacted
      upon the above legal issues:

         Whether or not the appellant is gay.

  22. In order to resolve these issues,  and  because  this  is  a  remitted
      appeal, we are also charged with making findings of fact.

  23. In coming to our decision, we have been greatly assisted  by  both  Mr
      Kotas and Mr Eaton  and  their  respective  submissions  and  skeleton
      arguments.


Preliminary issues

Sensitive witness

  24. On the basis  of  the  medical  evidence  available,  the  appellant's
      representative submitted that the appellant should  be  treated  as  a
      sensitive or vulnerable witness in order to reduce any  distress  when
      giving evidence. We accept that.  There is evidence  of  mental  well-
      being issues sufficient for us to state at a  preliminary  stage  that
      the appellant is vulnerable. We have made  appropriate  allowances  in
      the appellant's evidence, pursuant to the 'Joint Presidential Guidance
      Note no. 2 of 2010 - Child, vulnerable adult and sensitive witnesses'.

  25. Further, we implemented the  adjustments  suggested  by  his  counsel,
      including ensuring that the appellant had  regular  breaks  throughout
      the hearing, pauses for relevant documentation  to  be  shown  to  the
      appellant, we sat in camera while he gave his  evidence,  and  it  was
      explained that if there were any matters that he did not understand he
      should indicate.

Anonymity

  26.  The  appellant's  representative   requested   that   anonymity   was
      maintained. We were content to extend the  anonymity  direction  given
      previously.

The evidence

  27. We do not intend to index every piece of evidence we  have  considered
      in coming to our decision. We  acknowledge  the  helpful  consolidated
      bundle provided on behalf of the appellant, which  includes  not  only
      the appellant's witness statements, but statements  and  letters  from
      those supporting  him,  together  with  a  medico-legal  psychological
      report from Mary Robertson, dated 25 April 2018, together  with  other
      medical documents. The same bundle helpfully  includes  the  documents
      referred  to  in  the  case  history  set  out  above,  including  the
      judgements and determinations that have been given in this matter thus
      far, the supporting documentation served on the Court of  Appeal,  the
      further  medical  evidence  available  at  that  time;  and  documents
      pertaining to the appellant's education,  including  his  first  class
      honours degree from the University of Madras, dated April 2008.

  28. Also included within the appellant's bundle was a medico legal  report
      by  Dr  E  Zapata-Bravo,  dated  5   December   2013,   a   consultant
      psychiatrist, and further  reports  relating  to  dialysis  treatment.
      Finally, the bundle includes evidence in support of what is said to be
      the appellant's private life and the main authorities relied  upon  by
      the appellant's representative.

  29. The respondent's bundle is subsumed within the appellant's bundle  for
      these purposes. We underline  that  in  a  comprehensive  bundle  that
      extends to over 966 pages, we have considered the  contents  in  their
      entirety when coming to our decision.

  30. In addition to the above, we were provided with,  both  prior  to  the
      hearing  and  during  it,  five  further  bundles  of   evidence   and
      submissions:

              i. Bundle A - a further consolidated bundle on behalf  of  the
                 appellant containing evidence relating to  the  appellant's
                 financial affairs, a bank  statement  in  relation  to  his
                 father, an email from his landlady,  and  evidence  of  the
                 cost of medication in India, all  of  which  were  provided
                 pursuant to further directions given by us.
             ii. Bundle B - a clip of  supplementary  evidence  provided  on
                 behalf  of  the  appellant,  which   includes   a   further
                 medicolegal report  on  the  appellant,  prepared  by  Mary
                 Robertson, consultant and chartered clinical  psychologist,
                 on  18  July  2019,  setting  out  her   further   opinion,
                 recommendations and prognosis. This also includes a  letter
                 from the appellant's  solicitors  explaining  some  of  the
                 difficulty they encountered when requesting information  as
                 to the availability of immunosuppressant medication and the
                 cost of regular kidney checkups in India.
            iii. Bundle C - a response to  the  directions  set  by  us,  on
                 behalf of the respondent. This includes an extract from the
                 Secretary of State's extant guidance on  arranging  removal
                 and further email  enquiries  regarding  the  cost  of  the
                 required medication and the cost of  private  treatment  in
                 India.
             iv. Bundle  D  -  an  Internet  printout  in  relation  to  the
                 appellant's medication, and in  particular  Tacrolimus,  as
                 published by the National Institute  for  Health  and  Care
                 Excellence, (NICE).
              v. Bundle E - a further response from  one  of  the  hospitals
                 contacted in Chennai by the respondent.

  31. We heard oral testimony from the appellant,  and  thereafter  evidence
      from one witness, Ms R  (otherwise  R  H,  a  British  national).  The
      appellant spoke good English and  there  was  no  apparent  difficulty
      during the proceedings with comprehension. On 10  September  2019,  we
      heard submissions from the parties before reserving our decision.

      The standard and burden of proof



  32. Where an application is made under article 3, the burden of proof  for
      establishing the claim rests upon the appellant. The standard of proof
      is the so-called lower standard, namely that  there  is  a  reasonable
      chance or substantial grounds for thinking that the applicant would be
      at risk upon return.


  33. The appellant also submits that the respondent's decision to refuse to
      grant him leave to remain breaches the UK's obligations under  article
      8 of the  ECHR.  The  burden  of  establishing  this  rests  upon  the
      appellant and the standard of proof is the usual civil  standard,  the
      balance of probabilities.




   The first issue: whether the appellant is gay



  34. We deal with the appellant's sexuality first as our finding in this
      regard is likely to impact on our subsequent discussion.

  35. This is a new aspect of the case that emerged after  remittal  by  the
      Court of Appeal, (on which the appellant was not  interviewed  by  the
      respondent). The respondent does not accept  the  appellant's  claimed
      sexual orientation.

  36. The respondent maintains that the appellant has been  in  the  UK  for
      some nine years and has litigated extensively to seek  to  extend  his
      stay here. His witness statement, submitted for the hearing on 28  May
      2019, was the first time he put before any tribunal (or the  Secretary
      of State) his fear of return to  India  based  on  his  sexuality.  In
      short, the respondent advances that it appears  strikingly  convenient
      to raise sexuality as a reason to remain at this late stage.

  37. The appellant, on the other hand, states that he has been attracted to
      the same sex from an early age and although  his  parents  and  family
      were unaware he is gay, he had had same-sex sexual relations  both  in
      India and the UK, although he chooses to keep  these  private.  He  is
      concerned about how his family and others might react, in part due  to
      his Muslim faith.

  38. The appellant states that he did not talk to  his  previous  solicitor
      about his homosexuality because he was scared how she might react,  as
      she too was from a Muslim Indian background. The appellant  maintained
      that while he had not discussed this with his previous solicitors,  he
      had mentioned it to his psychologist.

  39. In submissions, Mr Kotas rejected the appellant's explanation in  this
      regard, commenting that he was a highly educated man  who  would  have
      realised the importance of such a claim, and that his solicitors would
      have been aware of their duty in terms of client  confidentiality.  He
      observed that there was little probative value in what he had told the
      psychologist, as those reports were based  upon  the  appellant's  own
      self-reporting; and further adds that there has not been any  evidence
      adduced from other men to support this claim.

  40. Mr Eaton referred us to  the  UNHCR  handbook  on  Credibility,  which
      addresses the reluctance  of  asylum  applicants  to  disclose  issues
      arising  out  of  sexual  orientation  and  the  inability  of  trauma
      sufferers to disclose past trauma.

    Our findings in relation to the appellant's sexuality

  41. We agree that the timing of the disclosure raises legitimate concerns,
      bearing  in  mind  the  appellant,  who  has  been  ably   represented
      throughout these appeals, made no mention  of  his  sexuality  in  the
      extensive proceedings that preceded this matter.

  42. Another difficulty we find is that the appellant's own  disclosure  of
      his sexuality in his witness statement is somewhat  piecemeal.  It  is
      plain that his family believe he is heterosexual. His  claim  that  he
      has had 'sex with a lot of guys in India and the UK,  but  not  proper
      intercourse', was not developed beyond the generality of  his  witness
      statement, with no information, for example, about what age he started
      having consensual relationships of this type or in what circumstances.
       While  the  appellant  maintained  that  he  watches  a  lot  of  gay
      pornography, there was little further explanation, with  no  reference
      to which websites he visited, and although in  evidence  he  told  the
      tribunal he used a gay phone app and had had physical relations 'every
      week' since 2011 or 2012, there was no corroboration of either.

  43. The appellant's disclosure about his sexuality also has to  be  viewed
      in the light of what he had told  the  psychologist,  Mary  Robertson,
      during their first meeting  in  2018.  He  gave  her  a  portrayal  of
      somebody who was embarrassed and shy about discussing  his  sexuality,
      confirming that he had never felt attracted to women, but was 'getting
      attracted to some men', although he felt bad about this.  This  hardly
      aligned with the more promiscuous account he now gave to us.

  44. The psychologist concluded the appellant was  struggling  with  issues
      relating  to  sexuality  and  had  had  deep  feelings  of  shame  and
      worthlessness as a result. She found that he was  confused  about  his
      sexual orientation. It is apparent the appellant  did  not  explicitly
      tell her that he was gay, although  he  alluded  to  this  possibility
      several times, adding that  being  gay  was  a  taboo  in  India.  His
      reluctance to give her what he claims to be the true  account  dilutes
      to a large extent the opinion she gives in this regard -  a  theme  we
      return to below.

  45. The disclosure that the appellant had been to  the  London  gay  pride
      festival a couple of months prior to the  hearing  first  surfaced  in
      oral evidence before us, and on one  view,  bearing  in  mind  he  had
      experienced representation, was a notable omission from any  statement
      he might have prepared.

  46. Mr Kotas was correct to identify that the appellant's  previous  legal
      representation was not limited solely to a  Muslim  Indian  woman  and
      that in another medico legal report prepared  by  Dr  Zapata-Bravo  (a
      consultant psychiatrist) in 2013,  the  appellant  was  identified  as
      heterosexual.

  47.  These  factors,  taken  together,  caused  us  to  have  considerable
      reservations about the  evidence  that  the  appellant  now  advanced.
      However, each of the above concerns needed to  be  balanced  with  the
      evidence in the round and the appellant's most recent account.

  48. In terms of Dr  Zapata-Bravo's  2013  report,  while  the  appellant's
      sexual orientation was identified as heterosexual, it was  added  that
      he had had no sexual experience and had never  had  a  girlfriend.  We
      have looked at previous statements and the  evidence  provided  to  us
      within the bundle, including the judgments of previous courts, and  at
      the extensive medical evidence, but found no  firm  reference  to  the
      appellant's sexuality therein. It is not an issue that appears to have
      been considered, and importantly for these purposes, we could find  no
      evidence  that  contradicted  the  appellant's  account.   While   the
      appellant's organ donor had commented in his  witness  statement  that
      they had talked about  the  appellant  meeting  a  woman  and  getting
      married, the donor added that as far as he was  aware,  the  appellant
      had not looked for women in the UK and did not socialise  a  lot  with
      women. The appellant stated he had lied in this regard to his  friends
      in order to avoid embarrassment.

  49. Further, when he saw Mary Robertson, he appeared  uncomfortable  about
      discussing his sexual identity and told her that he did not  want  her
      to disclose his worries about his sexuality to his solicitor. This  to
      an extent is consistent with what he has told us.

  50. We also accept that the nature  of  the  appellant's  encounters  with
      other men, if true, were likely to be difficult to prove. He explained
      that he might meet them casually in the street or at a  train  station
      and often would not even get their name. He said he had asked  an  18-
      year-old to come along and give evidence, but  he  had  declined.  The
      appellant maintained he had never been in a long-term relationship.

  51. In this regard, we also heard from his only witness to give  evidence,
      RR. She had known the appellant since 2011, they  having  met  because
      her maternal grandmother was also having dialysis  at  the  time.  She
      confirmed that the appellant had confided in her  at  an  early  stage
      that he was gay and that his concern was that her  grandmother,  as  a
      practising Muslim, would find out. In evidence, she said she  had  had
      an instinctive feeling about his sexuality and had been  with  him  in
      July when they went to London gay pride. Her general  sense  that  the
      appellant was gay was based on the fact  that  he  had  made  comments
      about men who were attractive and that he had confided  in  her  about
      this. He had also confided in her about a sexual assault on  him  when
      he was younger. We found she gave  a  credible  account  for  why  she
      believed the appellant was gay.

  52. We are satisfied that any feeling of embarrassment combined  with  his
      religious concerns may have been sufficient for him to  avoid  wishing
      to discuss  or  disclose  the  nature  of  his  sexuality  with  those
      previously dealing with his appeals.

  53. Having considered the evidence in the round, both on  balance  and  to
      the lower standard, we answer  the  factual  issue  we  are  asked  to
      consider in the following way: the appellant is gay. We return to  the
      ramifications of this in terms of our judgment below.



The appellant's credibility generally

  54. While we accept that the appellant is gay, we think it appropriate  to
      express a view about the credibility of other aspects of the  evidence
      dwelt on before us.

  55. The appellant maintained he was indebted to a  moneylender  in  India.
      His case was that he had not been able to repay the moneylender due to
      difficulties he had had working in the UK  and  that  if  returned  to
      India, he would not be able to raise sufficient money to  service  his
      debt there. It was advanced that the moneylender had  threatened  both
      the appellant and his parents.

  56. The appellant has been employed in the UK on  a  part-time  basis  for
      Pizza Hut since the end of 2011. In October 2017, he  was  encountered
      working as a shift manager during an enforcement visit. At that  point
      he was viewed as an overstayer by the Home Office and this led to  his
      work ending for a period. By Christmas  2018,  however,  he  was  back
      working at the restaurant. His duties  include  being  a  'meeter  and
      greeter'.

  57. His employment there has to be contrasted with what the appellant says
      about his indebtedness. The appellant maintains he comes from  a  very
      poor family in India. Statements from his father  and  others  confirm
      this to be the case: 'We are living in extreme poverty'.

  58. In order for the appellant to be able to come to the UK, the appellant
      had to fund his trip. He maintains he did this in a  number  of  ways:
      first, he borrowed a sum of around �1070 from a moneylender at a  rate
      of interest of 5% per month (according to  his  father's  undated  and
      unsigned statement [p366 of the bundle]). Second, it is said  that  he
      pledged about 40 sovereigns of gold with a private pawnbroker.  Third,
      it is claimed the appellant received jewellery from his family,  which
      he took to the pawnbroker.

  59. According to the written  evidence  of  the  appellant's  father,  the
      moneylender has been making  threatening  phone  calls  and  this  has
      caused him and his wife to change address  'very  often'.  His  father
      states  that  the  moneylender  has  threatened  them  with   'extreme
      consequences' and also threatened that if the appellant were  to  'set
      foot in India he would face the music'; and that they  are  scared  of
      making any complaint against the moneylender as they do  not  want  to
      invite any police trouble.

  60. The appellant's sister-in-law states that the sovereigns of gold  came
      from her and her  husband  to  fund  the  appellant's  expenses  going
      abroad. She also says she has not received back the  jewels.  She  had
      expected the appellant to do well and take care  of  his  family  once
      abroad. That expectation was not fulfilled she says. According to  the
      appellant's brother, these gold  jewels  have  been  sold  by  way  of
      auction, leading to tension within the family.

  61. We found the overall account to be deficient in a number of  respects.
      There does not appear  to  be  any  mention  of  moneylenders  in  the
      appellant's  parents  first  statement,  dated  10  August  2012.  The
      appellant was less than clear in his evidence about what had occurred,
      invariably switching from talking about the money  lender  to  talking
      about the pawnbroker. While according to his  brother  and  sister-in-
      law, not a single rupee had been paid to the money lender (or lenders)
      towards the loan, the appellant said that his  mother  had  paid  some
      money.

  62. The pawnbroker receipts provided were equally difficult to follow. One
      was dated 8 June 2011 and one 8 October 2011, but  the  appellant  had
      arrived in the United Kingdom on 9 September  2010.  One  was  in  the
      first name of this appellant and one was in the name  of  his  mother.
      They did not mention gold sovereigns, but  instead  referred  to  what
      appears to be largely gold jewellery, including rings and  chains.  It
      was  difficult  to  reconcile  these  receipts  with  the  unspecified
      evidence of the relatives. While the appellant  suggested  that  these
      were in some way duplicates, we found little by  way  of  evidence  to
      demonstrate that.

  63. In our judgment, the appellant's account lacks proper  explanation  in
      terms of the detail of what had taken place  in  India.  He  estimated
      that he now owed about �7000.

  64. A curious feature of his account was that the appellant also  accepted
      that if he had �100 or �200 in his pocket, left over from his earnings
      in the UK, then he would spend it on himself. He readily  accepted  he
      had lent money to  close  friends  during  this  period,  including  a
      holiday payment for �278. He said it was something  that  he  and  his
      friends often did. He added he had an iPhone and that his mobile phone
      was costing �100 per month. His bank statements revealed that  he  had
      bought the latest phone,  visited  the  Watchstation,  and  there  was
      evidence of  him  contributing  towards  various  sundries,  including
      petrol. He also had a Movieworld subscription for a year and there was
      evidence in his bank statements (as recently as  April  2019)  showing
      him going out to restaurants where  he  appeared  at  times  to  spend
      greater sums than, according to  some  of  the  evidence,  his  family
      members earned in a week.  He explained that �200  did  not  make  any
      difference to the debt and that he had not sent 'a penny back  to  his
      parents'.

  65. We found his apparent disregard for the claimed debts to be  difficult
      to reconcile with statements made by him elsewhere and  those  we  had
      read from his family. It appeared incredible that, on the one hand, it
      was claimed his family did not have running water and could not afford
      meat; and yet on the other, he maintained that �50 or �200 would  make
      no difference. It was apparent to us that  the  appellant  was  either
      being untruthful or was not providing the complete picture.

  66. Similarly, in the  documentary  evidence  that  was  provided  by  the
      appellant (Bundle B) there was a transcript of a conversation  between
      a male and female. We were told that this was between the  moneylender
      and the appellant's mother. There was no confirmation of this. It  was
      unclear when this recording had taken place, but  it  was  adduced  as
      evidence to show the appellant was  being  threatened.  There  was  no
      explanation for how or why  the  mother  came  to  be  recording  this
      conversation, where it was recorded or on what.

  67. We could place  very  little  weight  on  this  recording  because  it
      appeared to materialise without any proper evidential  foundation.  No
      precise sums of money were identified in the recording and the  female
      appears to suggest at one stage that the caller will only have to wait
      a few days if they  want  their  money  back  and  that  her  son  was
      returning. That was inconsistent with the appellant's case.

  68. The purpose of this audio evidence was said to demonstrate that if the
      appellant was to return, his life would be at risk and  that  somebody
      was essentially targeting him as a result of the debt he owed. We  are
      unpersuaded, even to the lower standard, about this. The fact  remains
      that he had made no attempt to send any money back in the eight  years
      he has been in the UK and (if any of it was true) was prepared to  see
      his mother, who had supported him throughout his  medical  procedures,
      subjected to hostile conversations and threats, being forced  to  move
      to a new house and living in extreme poverty, while he was earning and
      living relatively comfortably in  the  UK.  The  whole  account  lacks
      credibility on a number of levels, to the point of disbelief,  and  we
      find accordingly.

  69. To complete the picture, the appellant also  maintained  that  he  had
      been borrowing money in the UK. The appellant accepted he had borrowed
      money off a Mr K, who he described as 'being like a  brother'  and  as
      being 'well off'. The  appellant  told  us  that  he  had  been  in  a
      desperate situation and really struggling to complete his studies,  so
      as a gesture of goodwill Mr K had lent him �6000 towards  his  tuition
      fees. Mr K had done this by paying the college directly (although  the
      appellant said he had no proof of the amount being paid). There was no
      record of any loan or agreement in this regard.  It  later  transpired
      that Mr K ran some form of immigration consultancy, and that this  was
      an open-ended loan with no interest - the main condition  appeared  to
      be that it would be paid back when the appellant found a good job.  It
      later  transpired  that  Mr  K  was  now  serving  a  prison  sentence
      (although, notwithstanding Mr K being like a  brother,  the  appellant
      did not know what for).

  70. We again found this account to lack credibility. If there was money to
      be borrowed, one might have thought the appellant would have begun  by
      furnishing the debt in India that was ruining his parents and  leading
      to threats on their lives.

  71. We conclude the appellant  has  fabricated  his  claim  to  have  been
      financially supported here by Mr K in the light of his confusing 'open-
      ended' explanation and we place little weight on the letter from Mr K,
      whose motives or source of funding could not be explored.

  72. It also appears  that  the  appellant  owes  his  landlady  money,  an
      individual he refers to as 'auntie'. His bank statements  show  random
      amounts of money being paid to individuals who he maintains he paid at
      auntie's request. It was again difficult to reconcile this  aspect  of
      the appellant's evidence. There was  no  proper  explanation  for  why
      auntie would ask the appellant to  pay  his  rent  to  third  parties,
      instead of her, or why she could not have then paid the third  parties
      herself.

  73.  While  we  have  been  careful  to  bear  in  mind  the   appellant's
      vulnerability in terms of his depression, anxiety  and  low  mood  and
      that for some of this period he was undergoing surgery, together  with
      the supporting evidence from his family members and  others  who  know
      him, we are nonetheless driven to the view  that  the  appellant   has
      embellished his account concerning the debt in India and the  UK;  and
      painted a false picture of his relationship with his indigent  parents
      whom he has not supported financially despite their  alleged  problems
      and his lengthy period of employment and apparent lifestyle in the UK.






The second issue: Article 3 - health

  74. The appellant submits that his  removal  to  India  would  breach  his
      rights under article 3 of the ECHR on medical grounds. It is  advanced
      that in Paposhvili, the Grand Chamber  found  that  there  were  other
      exceptional circumstances that may give rise to an issue under article
      3, in addition to the circumstances considered in N  v  UK  (2008)  47
      EHRR 39. In  this  regard,  it  is  maintained  that  the  appellant's
      circumstances are very exceptional,  as  without  the  post-transplant
      care and treatment he requires, he is at risk of decline to the extent
      that it  would  result  in  intense  suffering  and/or  a  significant
      reduction in life expectancy.

  75. Reports were produced from two individuals, Ms L  Kumaraswami  and  Dr
      David   Game,   (the   latter   being   the   appellant's   consultant
      nephrologist), to explain the treatment the appellant  requires  post-
      transplant and to help confirm that this would not be available to him
      should he be returned to India.

  76. It was further maintained that the appellant  would  not  be  able  to
      afford immunosuppressant medication in India.  This  was  due  to  the
      appellant's major depressive disorder and him having  moderate  levels
      of anxiety, which, it was said, would impact on his ability to  access
      work and services in India; and that his family  would  not  be  in  a
      position to provide any more than the most basic level of support as a
      result of their impecunious circumstances and the debts owed in  India
      and the UK.

  77. Taken together, it was submitted this would lead to a potentially life-
      threatening rejection of his kidney transplant.

  78. Mr Kotas, on the other hand, maintained that the Court of Appeal in AM
      (Zimbabwe) has made clear that for domestic  purposes,  the  N  v   UK
      standard still applied when considering article 3 medical  cases,  and
      that the appellant's case came 'nowhere near' that standard:  he  does
      not face an imminent risk of death if removed to India.

  79. Mr Kotas further argued that the  appellant's  kidney  transplant  had
      been  successful  and  that  he  was  in  good  overall  health.   The
      appellant's  own  expert,  it  was  suggested,  confirmed   the   main
      immunosuppressant drug  (Adoport  Tacrolimus  or  an  equivalent)  was
      available  in   India   (it   was   conceded   that   the   brand   of
      immunosuppressant  the  appellant  took  was  not  available,  but  an
      alternative brand was). There were several hospitals  in  Chennai,  it
      was said, with specialist nephrology departments  that  the  appellant
      would be able to approach. Therefore, there  would  be  no  breach  of
      article 3. The lack of monitoring of the appellant's health would  not
      entail a breach of article 3.



Our preliminary findings:  Article 3 - health

  80. The first relevant finding we make  in  this  regard  is  that  on  29
      January 2015 the appellant received a kidney from his donor  and  that
      that operation was described by Dr Game as 'straightforward for  donor
      and recipient', that the kidney worked immediately, and the  appellant
      was discharged on 6 February 2015.

  81. We further find that there were no post-operative  complications.  His
      transplant function was described as 'excellent' and at the time of Dr
      Game's letter of 9 March 2017, it was  remarked  that  there  were  no
      other major health issues. It was estimated that the kidney would last
      him about 15 - 20 years, although it could be longer or  much  shorter
      than this.

  82. The appellant continues to have regular follow-up treatment  following
      his kidney  transplant,  involving  quarterly  appointments  with  his
      consultant and a regular prescription of  immunosuppressants.  Failure
      to take this medication post-transplant, it was  stated  by  Dr  Game,
      would lead to a risk of rejection. We find accordingly.

  83. It was accepted by Mr  Eaton  that  the  medication  required  by  the
      appellant (or a generic alternative) was available in India.  We  also
      find accordingly.

  84.  In  terms  of  physical  health,  the  issues  between  the   parties
      essentially came down to how the appellant would afford the medication
      and secondly, how accessible or available that treatment would  be  to
      him.




      The law: Article 3 - health

  85. In AM (Zimbabwe) &  Anor  v  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2018] HRLR 9, [2018] Imm  AR  737,  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  64,
      [2018] 1 WLR 2933, [2018] WLR(D) 56, [2018] WLR 2933 ('AM  (Zimbabwe')
      the Court of Appeal considered the application of  article  3  in  the
      context  of  individuals  who  were  suffering  from  serious  illness
      following the judgment in Paposhvili. The Grand Chamber in  Paposhvili
      had concluded the application of article 3 in  cases  only  where  the
      person facing expulsion is close to  death  (the  practice  since  the
      judgment in  N.  v.  UK),  had  deprived  some  individuals  who  were
      seriously ill, but whose condition was less critical, of  the  benefit
      of article 3.

  86. The Chamber found that the "other very exceptional  cases"  identified
      in the judgment  of  N.  v.  UK  should  be  understood  to  refer  to
      situations involving the removal of a seriously ill  person  in  which
      substantial grounds had been shown  for  believing  that  he  or  she,
      although not at imminent risk of dying, would face  a  real  risk,  on
      account of the absence  of  appropriate  treatment  in  the  receiving
      country or the lack of access to such treatment, which extended to the
      need to consider the cost of medication and treatment,  the  existence
      of a social and family network, and the distance to  be  travelled  in
      order to have access to the required care, to avoid being exposed to a
      serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of  health
      resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction  in  life
      expectancy.

  87. The above conclusions however need to be read  in  the  light  of  the
      Court of Appeal's decision in AM Zimbabwe. In considering  the  extent
      of the change in the law following  the  judgment  in  Paposhvili,  as
      compared with the judgments in D v UK (1997) 24 EHRR 423, and N v  UK,
      Sales LJ found it was clear  that  Paposhvili  relaxed  the  test  for
      violation of article 3 in the case of removal of  a  foreign  national
      with a medical condition, but 'only to a  very  modest  extent'  (para
      38). The scope of the  phrase  "very  exceptional  circumstances"  had
      previously been settled  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  N  (Uganda)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 31; [2005] 2 AC
      296 ("N"), where the House  of  Lords  held  that  the  protection  of
      article 3 against removal in medical cases is  confined  to  so-called
      "deathbed" cases where death  is  already  imminent,  with  Lord  Hope
      stating [50]:
        ".... For the circumstances to be ... 'very exceptional'  it  would
        need to be shown that the applicant's medical condition had reached
        such a critical  stage  that  there  were  compelling  humanitarian
        grounds for not removing him to a place which  lacked  the  medical
        and social services which he would need to prevent acute  suffering
        while he is dying...".

  88. This test was endorsed by the Grand Chamber in N v UK.

  89. The consequences of Paposhvili for medical cases  in  which  there  is
      reliance on article 3 has been considered by the Court  of  Appeal  in
      not only AM (Zimbabwe), but also SL (St Lucia) v  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1894  ("SL  (St  Lucia)");  MM
      (Malawi) and MK (Malawi) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
      [2018] EWCA Civ 2482 and Secretary of State for the Home Department  v
      PF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 1139 ("(PF  (Nigeria)").   These  endorse
      the general principles set out in the  judgment  of  Sales  LJ  in  AM
      (Zimbabwe).

  90.  In  PF  (Nigeria),  the  Court  of  Appeal  set  out  the   following
      propositions to be drawn from the cases (para 19):
          "i) Despite the guidance given in Paposhvili, as a result  of  the
         principle of stare decisis (i.e. the usual rules  of  precedent  in
         this jurisdiction), the test in N remains binding  on  this  court,
         and indeed all tribunals and courts in this  jurisdiction,  subject
         only to the Supreme Court using its power to overrule  it  (see  AM
         (Zimbabwe) at [30], MM (Malawi) at [9(i)] and the aptly entitled UT
         judgment in EA and Others (article 3 medical cases - Paposhvili not
         applicable) [2017] UKUT 445 (IAC)).
         ii) Paposhvili at [183] relaxes the test for violation of article 3
         in the case of  removal  of  a  foreign  national  with  a  medical
         condition (see AM (Zimbabwe)  at  [37]-[38],  and  MM  (Malawi)  at
         [9(i)]). Having quoted the relevant part of  [183]  of  Paposhvili,
         Sales LJ put it thus in AM (Zimbabwe) at [38]:
         "This  means  that  where  the  applicant  faces  a  real  risk  of
         experiencing intense suffering (i.e. to the article 3 standard)  in
         the  receiving  state  because  of  their  illness  and  the   non-
         availability there of treatment which is available to them  in  the
         removing state or faces a real risk of death within a short time in
         the receiving state for  the  same  reason.  In  other  words,  the
         boundary of article  3  protection  has  been  shifted  from  being
         defined by imminence of death in the removing state (even with  the
         treatment available there) to being defined by the imminence  (i.e.
         likely 'rapid' experience) of intense suffering  or  death  in  the
         receiving  state,  which  may  only  occur  because  of  the   non-
         availability in that state of the treatment  which  had  previously
         been available in the removing state."
         In that passage, Sales LJ was  expressly  paraphrasing  Paposhvili,
         not seeking to redefine it in any way.
         iii) Whilst Paposhvili marks a relaxation of  the  test,  Sales  LJ
         considered "it does so only to a very modest extent": the article 3
         threshold in medical cases remains high (see AM (Zimbabwe) at [41]-
         [42], and MM (Malawi) at [9(iii)]).
         iv) There is a switching burden of  proof  (see  AM  (Zimbabwe)  at
         [16], and MM (Malawi) at  [9(iv)]).  As  Sales  LJ  put  it  in  AM
         (Zimbabwe):
         "It is common ground that where a foreign national  seeks  to  rely
         upon article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a state to remove  him
         to another country, the overall legal burden is on him to show that
         article 3 would be infringed in his case by showing that that there
         are substantial grounds for believing that he  would  face  a  real
         risk of being  subject  to  torture  or  to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment in that  other  country:  see,  e.g.,  Soering  v  United
         Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439 at  [91],  which  is  reflected  in  the
         formulations in Paposhvili at [173] and [183].... In Paposhvili, at
         [186]-[187]..., the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR has  given  guidance
         how he  may  achieve  that,  by  raising  a  prima  facie  case  of
         infringement of article 3 which then  casts  an  evidential  burden
         onto the defending state which is seeking to expel him."

  91. On any clear reading of the above authorities, the legal test  remains
      aligned to N v UK with the Strasbourg Court only relaxing the test  to
      a very modest extent. As explained at the  outset,  we  are  conscious
      that AM (Zimbabwe) has yet to be decided by the Supreme Court, but  we
      are content to proceed on the basis of the approach outlined above.

      Our further findings: Article 3 - health

  92. In the evidence before us there is reference  to  country  information
      for India and medical issues, (Kidney  Failure:  dialysis  17  October
      2016), which states, according to  the  website  of  the  India  Renal
      Foundation, that there are about 500 hemodialysis centres in India and
      about 3000 dialysis  machines.  It  also  states  there  is  extensive
      nephrology treatment facilities and  that  the  medication  is  widely
      available. This reflects the first tribunal judge's  finding  in  July
      2012  that  the  country  guidance  at  the  time   demonstrated   the
      availability of treatment.

  93. This accords in part with the evidence provided by Ms  L  Kumaraswami,
      in a letter dated 19 June 2015, supplied as part  of  the  appellant's
      bundle. Ms Kumaraswami is a founder of a charitable trust  set  up  to
      help  underprivileged  people  suffering  from  kidney  problems.  She
      confirms that the appellant would not be able to access free treatment
      in a government hospital, something we accept. She adds, however, that
      the appellant will be able  to  access  the  medication  he  requires,
      although this will have to be bought and paid for. We accept this. She
      also confirms that free dialysis is possible if the appellant  gets  a
      health insurance card issued by the government for below poverty  line
      patients and should there be a vacancy for a  new  patient.  She  adds
      that posttransplant care is available in major  hospitals  in  Chennai
      and Mumbai.

  94. The evidence from the Home Office confirms  that  the  medication  and
      nephrology support would be available in India. For the above reasons,
      we find accordingly.

  95. We are therefore satisfied  that  the  post-transplant  treatment  the
      appellant requires is  available  and  that  there  are  hospitals  in
      Chennai and elsewhere where  he  could  receive  treatment.  It  would
      require the appellant to make appropriate enquiries, but on the  basis
      that he is an intelligent functioning individual,  currently  working,
      and with a Master's degree, we find he would be able to do so.

  96. The refined test in Paposhvili requires consideration of  whether  the
      appellant would be able to afford his immunosuppressant medication  in
      India  and  the  post-operative   treatment   available.   While   the
      appellant's representative maintains he would not, we find  that  this
      assertion  requires  further  explanation.  The  additional   evidence
      provided by the appellant's solicitors is  disappointing  in  that  it
      fails to give the tribunal a clear indication of  what  they  say  the
      cost would be  in  comparison  to  any  estimate  of  the  appellant's
      potential earnings. We return to this below.

  97. The costings we have been supplied with, from both  sides,  vary,  but
      there are some similarities as seen below:

        a. One response suggest that 1 mg tablet may cost 30  -  50  Indian
           rupees (50IR = 58p), and regular checkups 'should not cost much'
           although the figure was not provided.

        b. The respondent also provided evidence that the approximate  cost
           of 3 mg capsules of 100 is 13,000 Indian rupees  and  the  basic
           blood  tests  would   cost   between   1800-2000   rupees.   The
           consultation fee would be ?1000 per visit  While  we  were  only
           able to work on approximates, at an exchange  rate  of  1  rupee
           equaling �0.012 (source: google, as quoted before us), the above
           figures equate to �149.68 for 100 3mg  capsules;  �23.03  for  a
           blood test; �11.51 for a consultation.

        c. The Net-meds evidence  provided  by  the  appellant  showed  the
           medication to be in stock and  to  be  around  ?397  for  5  x10
           capsules (�4.35)

        d. In a letter of  28  July  2017,  his  previous  solicitors,  had
           suggested that 10 tablets would cost ?255, equivalent to  �2.94.
           They  estimated  that  he  would  also  have  to  pay  ?255  for
           Mycophenolate (a  drug  used  with  other  medications  to  help
           prevent the body from rejecting kidney transplants).  They  also
           estimated that he would  have  to  pay  ?1000  to  meet  with  a
           specialist and  that  separate  posttransplant  tests  would  be
           between ?2000 and ?5000. ?5000 is �57.57.

        e. Ms L Kumaraswami states she  estimates  transplant  checkups  to
           cost between ?20,000-?22000. After which a  person  has  to  pay
           ?8000-?10,000  per  month.  These  figures  were  not  reflected
           elsewhere, but ?22,000 amounts to �253.30 on the  exchange  rate
           we were given.

  98. The letter of Dr Game, dated 9 March  2017,  confirms  that  the  only
      medication the appellant is on in relation to his  immune  suppression
      is Adoport, twice daily, lifelong. We understand the appellant takes 6
      mg per day. Dr Game also  confirmed  that  the  maximum  time  between
      appointments is four months. We accept these elements of his evidence.

  99. Doing the best we can, we therefore estimate  that  the  cost  to  the
      appellant for a quarterly checkup would be the sterling equivalent  of
      �12.00 based on two of the estimates  we  received  (�48  per  annum);
      accepting the figure of �149.68 for 100 3mg capsules (50 days supply),
       the cost of 6 mg of  tablets  a  day  would  be  approximately  �2.99
      (�149.68/50 (�2.99) x 365) = �1092.66 per annum. Plus, we calculate  a
      further amount for post-transplant tests, 3 times a  year  at  �57.57,
      totaling �172.71.

 100. While we accept that these figures are approximates,  we  estimate  an
      annual cost of something akin to �1313.37, which we round  up  in  the
      appellant's favour to �1400 or �116.66 per month. We find accordingly.
      The appellant's counsel estimated the cost of  the  medication  to  be
      over �100 a month.  It  was  suggested  that  this  was  prohibitively
      expensive.

 101. In terms of the appellant's  potential  income,  we  were  given  very
      little by way of information.  We were taken to one statement where  a
      relative doing contract work was earning between  �100  and  �132  per
      month. It was suggested this was a benchmark in terms of earnings.  We
      were told there was no country  guidance  information  on  income  for
      graduates.

 102. We were not persuaded about the  comparison  with  the  relative.  The
      appellant is fluent in English, having been  to  an  English  speaking
      school and having lived in the UK and studied in the  UK  for  several
      years. He has hospitality and other  business  experience;  he  has  a
      first class honours degree and a masters  degree;  and  he  has  shown
      himself to be a resourceful individual in terms  of  work  and  making
      contacts while in the UK. He has an offer to stay with his parents. He
      is therefore well  placed  to  source  gainful  employment  in  India.
      Indeed, the appellant's home area is a large  and  populous  city.  He
      previously worked for a multinational company,  earning  �100-130  per
      month, according to his statement of 6 March 2014. If correct, we were
      entitled to assume that with his improved qualifications his  earnings
      would be higher and these could be used to pay for his medication  and
      monitoring.

 103. We agree with Mr Kotas that there is no reason to assume  these  costs
      will be prohibitive. The burden was on the appellant in this regard.

 104. While the appellant suggests that he has debts  in  the  UK  and  owes
      money in India, and  therefore  could  not  give  his  medication  and
      treatment priority we reject that proposition. First, if true, he  has
      hardly given these debts priority until now. Second, we  have  already
      explained in some detail why we rejected his account relating to debt.
      It lacked credibility.

 105. We also reject the suggestion that the appellant's mental health would
      prevent him from working or finding work  in  India.  It  has  not  so
      prevented him from doing so in the UK. Part of his mental health issue
      was said to be linked to his immigration status and these proceedings.
      This would, in our view, be alleviated  on  his  return.  Further,  he
      would have family support and a social  network.  We  return  to  this
      aspect of his claim below.

 106. We  are  therefore  satisfied  that  the  medication  he  requires  is
      affordable and that there are hospitals in Chennai and elsewhere where
      he could receive treatment.  Bearing  in  mind  he  has  not,  on  his
      evidence, had a check-up for eight months, he could take steps now  to
      ensure he did not require an immediate checkup upon  return.  Further,
      he could have planned for any return through accumulating some savings
      (from his permitted work in the UK).

 107. It was not advanced before us that the distance  to  be  travelled  in
      order to have access to the required care would be prohibitive, and we
      find it would not be. There is treatment  available  in  Chennai.  The
      transplant went well and there were no signs of any  acute  rejection.
      As a result, we did not find it necessary to consider what may happen,
      possibly at some future point, as that would require us to speculate.

 108. In our judgment, while taking into account as  we  do  the  underlying
      mental health issues and the  difficulties  any  person  returning  to
      India may face initially in establishing their medical care,  we  find
      no prospect of the appellant being exposed to  a  serious,  rapid  and
      irreversible decline in his health resulting in intense  suffering  or
      to a significant reduction in  life  expectancy  or  to  acute  mental
      suffering.

 109. The article 3 threshold in our judgment is still very  high;  and  the
      appellant's case falls far short of it. Dr  Game  expressed  the  view
      that the appellant's health and life expectancy are likely to be  best
      served by him remaining in the UK, but added that if the appellant had
      access to an appropriately trained transplant team and  all  the  same
      medications,  investigations  and  treatments   that   are   currently
      available to him that this would be reasonable. We find that  this  is
      the case here. There  is  no  imminence  of  death  and  there  is  no
      imminence of death due to lack  of  treatment  or  medication  in  the
      receiving state.  We respectfully adopt Sales LJ  reasoning  that  the
      Grand Chamber at para. [183] in Paposhvili,  used  the  rubric  "other
      very exceptional cases", to indicate how rarely the test in article  3
      will be found to be satisfied in medical  cases,  emphasising  in  the
      final sentence that it was still intending to indicate that there  was
      "a high threshold for the application of article 3" in medical  cases.
      We do not consider the appellant meets the threshold in N(Uganda)  nor
      the more "relaxed" test in Paposhvili.



 110. It follows that, having regard to the treatment available in India and
      the evidence in the round, the removal of the appellant to India would
      be proportionate.





The third issue: Article 3 - suicide



The respective submissions

 111. Mr Eaton relied upon the  medicolegal  report  of  Mary  Robertson,  a
      chartered and consultant clinical psychologist,  who  found  that  the
      appellant suffered from  a  major  depressive  disorder  and  suicidal
      ideation, and that in her view, the appellant 'will be  at  very  high
      risk of suicide if faced with return to India'. It was  advanced  that
      the appellant had recurrent suicidal thoughts  and  had  enunciated  a
      clear plan for executing this, namely an intention to  bite  or  sever
      the fistula in his arm to cause a fatal  hemorrhage.  It  was  further
      suggested he had made one previous attempt on his  life  and  that  he
      would not resist taking his own life if he was required to return.

 112. It therefore followed, it was advanced, that  the  appellant  faced  a
      very real risk of an article 3 breach due to the risk of suicide;  and
      that the evidence would strongly suggest that, at least initially, the
      suicide risk would be domestic. Mr Eaton cited case law  including  SP
      (risk, suicide, PTSD, IFA, medical facilities) Kosovo CG  [2003]  UKTI
      80 00017 and Y and another (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 362.

 113. Mr Kotas acknowledged that Ms Robertson had put the appellant at  high
      risk of suicide should he be removed to India and that  she  took  the
      view the risk would be high at all stages of the removal  process.  He
      contended, however, that the high threshold for a  suicide  claim  was
      not made out;  the appellant's fear of  return  to  India  was  always
      based upon, and was inextricably linked to, his belief that  he  would
      not be able to access medical treatment in India. Mr  Kotas  submitted
      such a belief was wholly without  foundation.  It  was  one  based  on
      perception or assumption.

 114. Further, Mr Kotas maintained that the claimed fear of having to return
      as a gay man and having the inability to repay debts were not  matters
      that could themselves give rise to  a  successful  claim  of  risk  of
      suicide.

 115. It was also argued before  us  that  we  could  be  satisfied  to  the
      requisite standard that the  respondent  had  adequate  mechanisms  in
      place to ensure the appellant could be safely escorted back to  India,
      pursuant to the evidence provided by the Home Office to  support  this
      (Bundle C 'Arranging removal', version 2, 4 October 2018).

The law: Article 3 - suicide:


 116. The Court of Appeal in J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 ('J'),  considered
      the approach to a claimed risk of suicide, setting out the application
      of the 'real risk' test.  That provides that if  there  is  a  suicide
      risk, it must be a real risk, (more than 'not fanciful').

 117. Having regard to the  way  the  ECtHR  has  applied  it  in  different
      circumstances, the following guidance was provided in J-
          26.  First, the test requires an assessment  to  be  made  of  the
           severity of the treatment which it is said  that  the  applicant
           would suffer if removed. This must attain  a  minimum  level  of
           severity. The court has said on a number of occasions  that  the
           assessment of its severity depends on all the  circumstances  of
           the case. But the ill-treatment must  "necessarily  be  serious"
           such  that  it  is  "an  affront  to  fundamental   humanitarian
           principles to remove an individual to a country where he  is  at
           risk of serious ill-treatment": see Ullah paragraphs [38-39].
        1. Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between  the  act
           or threatened act  of  removal  or  expulsion  and  the  inhuman
           treatment relied on  as  violating  the  applicant's  article  3
           rights. Thus in Soering at paragraph [91], the court said:
           "In so far as any liability under the Convention is  or  may  be
           incurred,  it  is  liability   incurred   by   the   extraditing
           Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has
           as a  direct  consequence  the  exposure  of  an  individual  to
           proscribed ill-treatment."(Emphasis added).
           See also paragraph [108] of Vilvarajah where the court said that
           the examination of the  article  3  issue  "must  focus  on  the
           foreseeable consequences of the removal of the applicants to Sri
           Lanka..."
        1. Thirdly, in the  context  of  a  foreign  case,  the  article  3
           threshold is particularly high simply because it  is  a  foreign
           case. And it is even higher where the alleged inhuman  treatment
           is not the direct  or  indirect  responsibility  of  the  public
           authorities of  the  receiving  state,  but  results  from  some
           naturally occurring illness, whether physical or mental. This is
           made clear in paragraph [49] of D and paragraph [40] of Bensaid.


        1. Fourthly, an article 3 claim  can  in  principle  succeed  in  a
           suicide case (paragraph [37] of Bensaid).
        1. Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a real risk of a breach of
           article 3 in a suicide case, a question of importance is whether
           the applicant's fear of ill-treatment  in  the  receiving  state
           upon  which  the  risk  of  suicide  is  said  to  be  based  is
           objectively well-founded. If the fear is not well-founded,  that
           will tend to weigh against there being  a  real  risk  that  the
           removal will be in breach of article 3.
        1. Sixthly, a further question of considerable relevance is whether
           the removing and/or the receiving state has effective mechanisms
           to  reduce  the  risk  of  suicide.  If  there   are   effective
           mechanisms, that too will weigh heavily against  an  applicant's
           claim that removal will violate his or her article 3 rights.
 118. We further remind ourselves of the analysis on the mechanism of return
      in J -
            61.   As regards the risk of suicide en route to Sri Lanka, the
           IAT's finding was not perverse... They made it  clear  that  the
           authorities in the UK would be involved in the arrangements. The
           IAT were entitled to infer that the  Secretary  of  State  would
           take all reasonable steps to  discharge  his  obligations  under
           section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("the 1998 Act"). As  the
           IAT said in AA v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  at
           paragraph [39]:
           "Third stage-transit: there are no reasons to suppose  that  the
           Secretary of State would  not  provide  appropriately  qualified
           escorts. This is known to be done. Other measures in other cases
           may include accompanying family members."
           62.    In our judgment, the IAT were entitled to  take  judicial
           notice of the arrangements  that,  no  doubt  conscious  of  his
           obligations under section 6 of the 1998 Act,  the  Secretary  of
           State makes to escort vulnerable  persons  who  are  removed  to
           their countries of origin. This is reflected in a document  that
           we were shown which sets out Home Office policy for dealing with
           claimants who threaten suicide.
           63.    As regards the criticisms made of the finding in relation
           to the risk upon arrival in Sri Lanka, the IAT were entitled  to
           conclude on the evidence before them that  the  appellant  would
           have family support on his return to Sri Lanka. Having regard to
           the very high threshold for article 3 in foreign cases  of  this
           kind, the IAT's decision cannot be characterised as perverse. In
           particular: (i) the adjudicator had found  that  any  subjective
           fears  which  the  appellant  might  have  on  return  were  not
           objectively justified; (ii) he would have family support on  his
           return; and (iii) he would have access to medical  treatment  in
           Sri Lanka which it was conceded was adequate...

Our findings: Article 3 - suicide

 119. The appellant's alleged suicide risk is based on a number of  factors:
      concerns over the nature of the medical treatment he would receive  in
      India; concerns about the debts he has accrued and any risk  that  may
      be  involved  in  his  return;  fears  and  concerns  surrounding  his
      sexuality; and concerns about his mental health and memory loss.

 120. In considering the above, we return to the appellant's credibility and
      his propensity to mislead.

 121. While we should be slow to distance ourselves from  the  views  of  an
      expert psychologist, in the instant matter we find the 2018 report  of
      Mary Robertson to be based on a real misapprehension of the facts.

 122. First, we have already commented on what we find to  be  a  misleading
      account given  by  the  appellant  about  his  sexuality.   While  the
      appellant discloses that he was becoming attracted to men, he makes no
      reference  to  the  men  he  apparently  saw  every  week  for  sexual
      relations. His account that he believed his lower  testosterone  level
      might be causing him to become attracted to other men is, to  say  the
      least, economic, if what he told the tribunal  in  other  respects  is
      true. The appellant was fully aware of his sexuality. To  that  extent
      the conflict  and  difficulties  that  Ms  Robertson  refers  to  when
      considering the appellant's sexuality do not arise;  and  her  opinion
      concerning the need to resolve them is misplaced.

 123. Second, Ms  Robertson  referenced  the  appellant's  previous  suicide
      attempt as a factor.  The  evidence  given  to  us  of  the  appellant
      attempting to drown (in an undated letter found at  page  336  of  the
      bundle) suggests the suicide attempt occurred at a time the  appellant
      was not working, and so had decided to go to the nearest swimming pool
      to bathe. His friend records what happens as follows, although  cannot
      recall the date:

         He was swimming in the pool, after a few minutes of swimming he was
         trying to close his nose and going down the pool which I thought he
         was playing initially, after a few minutes  he  wasn't  coming  out
         from the pool, so I tried to call him and ask him to come out which
         he don't listen and continue staying inside the pool. So then I got
         scared and used my both hands to lift him up. (sic.)

         Later, I took him out and went out to the  nearest  McDonald's  for
         snacks and to speak to him why would he try to do that. So  then  I
         found he had many problems in back home and his  personal  problems
         which he wasn't explaining to me very clearly, so  tried  to  drown
         himself in the pool. I got scared and advised him to speak  to  his
         solicitor or his GP regarding this so they can advise him  and  not
         to do this kind of silly thing in the future for  the  problems  he
         facing now. (sic.)


 124. This was not an incident that  required  medical,  hospital  or  major
      intervention. There was no attempt at biting his fistula.  We  do  not
      know what Mary Robertson would have drawn from this had she been given
      the complete picture.

 125. Third, Mr Kotas also raised a question about the alleged suicide plan.
      His GPs notes suggest that  in  February  2016  the  appellant  had  a
      fistula removed from his arm. The appellant said that was not  correct
      and it was still held. It was not clear to  us  to  what  extent  Mary
      Robertson had investigated this, or whether she  simply  accepted  the
      appellant's account.

 126. Fourth, while it is apparent that Ms Robertson was aware the appellant
      had a social life and had made friends in the UK, it is unclear if she
      was aware how extensive it was, and that at least one of  his  friends
      refers to being introduced to the appellant through a group of friends
      who regularly meet each other with a common interest to participate in
      social debates, charitable work  and  'a  generic  desire  for  having
      influence on society to make it a better place'. Another friend states
      the appellant is always willing  to  help  people  and  does  domestic
      chores and shopping for a friend. Further, it is now apparent that the
      appellant felt sufficiently confident to be able to pick up men in the
      street on a regular basis and attend London gay pride. Mary  Robertson
      may  have  come  to  very  different  opinion  about  his  behavioural
      disengagement had she been fully aware of these factors.

 127. Fifthly, we had concerns about the way the appellant's  self-reporting
      was reflected in Ms Robertson's report. While he self-reports  feeling
      restless and agitated, that his appetite is not good and that  he  had
      low mood and feelings of guilt, scoring  on  the  Beck's  Hopelessness
      Scale 18, indicative of severe  hopelessness  and  suggesting  a  high
      suicide risk, however reliable these tests were said to be, we need to
      approach these results with considerable caution in the light  of  the
      appellant's propensity to mislead.

 128. Sixth, the appellant relied on family debt  as  an  additional  stress
      factor, but here too we have found his evidence not credible.

 129. In short, we found the appellant's account of his mood  and  emotional
      state to Mary Robertson, and indeed to us, to be often untruthful  and
      therefore unreliable. It did not properly reflect other aspects of his
      life and we are not satisfied, even to the lower standard and  bearing
      in mind as we do the sensitive nature of this evidence, that he gave a
      truthful account to Ms Robinson about his  feelings  and  any  suicide
      risk.  This leads us to place little weight on the conclusions of  the
      report in this regard.

 130. We gained a similar impression from Ms Robertson's subsequent  report,
      dated 18 July 2019. Again, she appears to accept  statements  made  by
      the appellant, such as that he did not recognise or remember her  from
      the previous year, without particular challenge; and she was accepting
      of his self-assessment for a major depressive  disorder  in  the  very
      severe range, on the basis the  test  was  reported  as  being  highly
      reliable. Ms Robertson does not adequately explain how it is that  the
      appellant has made such progress in acceptance of his sexuality in one
      year (based on the misleading  presentation  in  2018)  nor  does  her
      report appear to give appropriate mention of the positive  changes  in
      his life, such as his re-employment  or  the  active  social  life  he
      leads. On occasion she strays into advocacy, rather  than  a  critical
      analysis of the appellant's mental  state  e.g.  she  suggests  it  is
      likely that the appellant would show significant clinical  improvement
      with the appropriate treatment and if granted permission to remain  in
      the UK. Her prescription in both reports appears to turn to an  extent
      on the grant of leave.

 131. There was little or no evidence to suggest the  appellant  has  sought
      the further counselling  or  psychiatric  support  recommended  by  Ms
      Robertson. Although we accept that people who are withdrawn  tend  not
      to engage, and thus perhaps stop going  to  their  doctor,  or  taking
      medication and pursuing alternative treatments, these factors also had
      to be weighed in the light of what has since happened.  Following  the
      suggested attempted suicide  incident  and  the  first  report  of  Ms
      Robertson, the appellant had taken a job meeting and greeting  diners,
      socialises regularly, uses public transport, dines out,  goes  to  the
      cinema and on trips and attended the gay pride event.  As a result  of
      Ms Robertson being given an incomplete picture, there  was  no  proper
      consideration in the 2019 report of the possibility that the appellant
      was not submitting to counselling because he did not feel the need.

 132. While Ms  Robertson  recommended  psychological  treatment,  cognitive
      behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy for his  depression  once
      his immigration matter was resolved, we could not see, if there was  a
      real risk of suicide, why there needed to be a delay. Until  then  she
      had recommended a combination of  supportive  counselling  and  crisis
      intervention 'if the suicide risk escalates', but there is no evidence
      that that has taken place.


 133. As stated above and for the reasons  provided  we  give  only  limited
      weight to Ms Robertson's reports . We  accept  that  elements  of  the
      account the appellant gave to Ms Robertson in 2018  and  2019  bear  a
      semblance to the truth, including his success at school, and we accept
      that the appellant does have some mental health issues, including  low
      mood and anxiety linked in part to his immigration  status,  which  we
      take appropriately into account for the purposes of  this  appeal.  We
      also make allowance for the appellant's claimed reluctance to disclose
      the full nature of his sexuality due to embarrassment or judgement and
      his vulnerability and other well-being issues.

 134. The propensity to mislead had  arisen  in  a  previous  encounter  the
      appellant had had with a healthcare professional. In  September  2013,
      the appellant had  seen  Dr  Zapata-Bravo,  a  psychiatrist.   In  our
      finding, the appellant once again failed to give the complete  picture
      when it came to his sexuality. If he  had  done  so,  Dr  Zapata-Bravo
      would not have recorded the appellant as being heterosexual.  Further,
      the appellant reported in 2013 that he had had a happy  childhood  and
      his extended family always 'lived together in  happiness  and  peace'.
      This has to be contrasted with the account he gave to Mary  Robertson,
      where she recorded an unsettled and  unpleasant  childhood,  with  him
      witnessing regular beatings of his mother, and where he also  suffered
      serious beatings during which his father would hit him and  throw  him
      across the room 'like an animal'. Both accounts cannot be correct.

 135. A similar tension arises in relation to the appellant's claimed sexual
      abuse as a child. While we do not need  to  resolve  that  issue,  and
      would be slow to do so as a result of the sensitive nature of  such  a
      claim, we simply note that on the one hand the appellant maintained to
      one healthcare professional he had had a happy childhood and that  the
      relationship in his parental family 'was harmonic' and that this  also
      applied to his extended family, while he relayed to Mary Robertson  an
      incident of rape by a distant cousin when he was aged 10  and  regular
      beatings.

 136.  Although  there  were  a  number  of  references  to  the   appellant
      complaining about memory loss, not only to Mary Robertson, but  to  Dr
      Game and Dr Zapata-Bravo,  we  are  unpersuaded,  even  to  the  lower
      standard, about the appellant's assertions  in  this  regard.  It  was
      apparent that he had a clear recall of certain events, but his  recall
      became less clear when points of tension in the  evidence  arose  e.g.
      over the debts or his sexuality. We found this to be  significant.  We
      did not accept that it was as a result of a rare side  effect  of  his
      medication.  There  was  little  evidence  for  that.  Dr  Game,   his
      consultant nephrologist, in a letter dated September 2018, wrote  that
      the appellant's memory difficulties are more likely to be due  to  his
      mental state rather than his  medication  or  physical  condition.  We
      accepted this to a degree, but still saw scope for  the  appellant  to
      exaggerate any claims in this regard.

 137. We do not believe that the alleged debt  and  associated  problems  is
      such a determinative factor in terms of the risk of suicide.  We  have
      already explained that we do not find the appellant's account credible
      in this regard. The appellant appears to have managed to  live  fairly
      well without attempting to service this  debt  to  date.  We  did  not
      accept that 'his chickens would come home to roost' in  terms  of  the
      debt. Nor did we accept that this in  some  way  combined  with  other
      factors, such as any inability to find work  or  pay  for  medication,
      would raise the prospect of a suicide attempt either in  this  country
      or on arrival for the reasons already given.

 138. Having considered Ms Robertson's reports  in  terms  of  the  risk  of
      suicide and what we considered to be the flaws in her conclusions,  we
      also looked elsewhere for support for the article 3 claim. The risk of
      suicide had been identified by Dr Zapata-Bravo in 2013. This  provided
      some consistency, but also left some issues unresolved.  In  2013  the
      appellant's risk of completed suicide was said to be low because  that
      was a quiet period pending  Home  Office  decisions.  Dr  Zapata-Bravo
      identified that the appellant had a well meditated suicide plan to  be
      activated in case of an adverse decision, including impending removal.
      Part of the issue was that  Dr  Zapata-Bravo  believed  the  appellant
      would rather die in the UK than  in  India  because  of  the  lack  of
      medical  care  available  in   India,   as   dialysis   centres   were
      predominantly in the private sector there. Dr Zapata-Bravo  felt  this
      would lead to an exacerbation of the appellant's depressive  disorder,
      which together with his prepared suicidal plan, would make the risk of
      suicide quite high. Further, Dr Zapata-Bravo found that if he were  to
      be removed, his mental health would also deteriorate.

 139. In our finding, the appellant has had no experience  of  medical  care
      relating to dialysis/post-transplant treatment in India,  which  means
      his perception is based on an assumption. We have already  found  that
      the appellant's misgivings about the health care  available  in  India
      lack foundation, and therefore the concerns raised  in  2013  are  not
      objectively well-founded.

 140. We also found his claimed fear on return in terms of his sexuality was
      not objectively well-founded. It would not be unreasonable  to  expect
      the appellant to relocate to another  part  of  India  away  from  his
      family or indeed another urban city if he felt unable to live as a gay
      man in Chennai itself. This is especially so given that the  appellant
      was prepared to leave his family behind  and  relocate  to  a  foreign
      country.

 141. We also agree with Mr Kotas's submission in this regard. The appellant
      maintains that he is not especially close to  his  family  and  is  no
      longer in regular contact with his mother, making internal  relocation
      more reasonable still. We can find nothing unreasonable  or  for  that
      matter harsh in the appellant internally relocating,  either  to  find
      better paid employment (to cover rent, living and  medical  treatment)
      or to avoid any perceived discomfort or unpleasantness from his family
      because he was gay.  We accept that  considering  the  extant  country
      guidance case MD (same-sex orientated males:  risk)  India  CG  [2014]
      UKUT 65 (IAC), there is no prospect of the appellant showing his  fear
      on return was objectively well-founded in this regard.

 142. In our judgment, any suicidal ideation is not genuinely held and is no
      more than an assertion.  It previously has been linked to decisions to
      decline leave to remain. The appellant has no history of having harmed
      himself as a result of the decisions issued thus far.  On  15  October
      2014, the Department of Psychological Medicine at Guy's Hospital wrote
      to the  appellant's  then  consultant  nephrologist.  The  conclusions
      drawn, albeit five years ago, resonated with the tribunal:

         Since the diagnosis, he has had two applications to remain  in  the
         country rejected by the UK Border Agency.  On  both  occasions,  he
         felt that he was given false hope by his legal representative. When
         he received the news that his application  had  been  rejected,  he
         recalled having thoughts about ending his life. He  had  considered
         cutting open his arteriovenous fistula. He also recalled that  part
         of him wanted to  continue  living,  which  overrode  his  fleeting
         suicidal thoughts. It was around  the  time  of  one  of  his  visa
         application  rejections  that  he  was  referred  to   a   clinical
         psychologist through your service, whom I believe,  explored  these
         feelings further. He was later discharged by the psychologist  once
         his mood improved.

 143. Also in 2014, Dr Humphrey, a hospital psychologist, gave the following
      similar report to the appellant's then nephrologist:

         [The  appellant]  has  no  past  history  of  any   mental   health
         difficulties.  His  periods  of  low  mood  and  fleeting  suicidal
         ideation seem to be in the context of  coming  to  terms  with  his
         diagnosis and the UKBA decisions to decline visa extension or leave
         to remain. He has no history of having harmed himself or  attempted
         suicide in the past.  This was confirmed through liaison  with  his
         GP.
         ...
         He stated that he was  a  somewhat  naughty  and  funny  child.  He
         described having a very happy childhood.
         ...
         There is no current evidence  that  [the  appellant]  is  currently
         suffering from a mood  or  anxiety  disorder.  It  seems  that  his
         documented suicidal ideation in the past seems to be  very  clearly
         in the context of his application to remain in  the  country  being
         rejected. In addition, at this time he was not aware that he  would
         be eligible for a living donor renal transplant. [The appellant] is
         very keen to point out that the  situation  is  very  different  at
         present in that he has a  stronger  application  and  better  legal
         support.
         ...
         ...There is certainly no current evidence of an  underlying  mental
         disorder. His future risk of self-harm, however, may change if [the
         appellant's] appeal to remain in the country is rejected given  the
         dire consequences that this may have on his future health....In the
         unlikely event that his appeal  is  rejected  [the  appellant]  has
         agreed to be urgently reviewed in our clinic in order to assess his
         mental state and formulate a risk management plan...

 144. These two opinions in our judgment,  notwithstanding  the  passage  of
      time, portray a greater objectivity; and undermine to an  extent  Mary
      Robertson's conclusion, which we have already explained attract little
      weight. We have already indicated that future health provision  should
      be available to this appellant.

 145. Our duty is to assess the risk of suicide on the date of the  hearing.
      The appellant had no previous history of mental health problems  prior
      to his immigration claim. He has had a successful  transplant  and  is
      now, on one view, in a position to move forward with his life. Dr Game
      reports that otherwise medically 'things  are  rather  good'  and  his
      kidney function is 'excellent'. We nonetheless accept he is  depressed
      but not seriously so. We accept he has anxiety, which  inevitably  his
      immigration status has contributed to; but these subjective fears  are
      not objectively well-founded.  While we recognise that  an  article  3
      claim can in principle succeed in a suicide case, this is not a matter
      where a real risk exists  to  the  extent  that  removal  will  breach
      article 3.

 146. In so concluding, we have considered Y & Anor (Sri Lanka) v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 362 (29  April  2009)
      and what the Court of Appeal say about the evaluation of suicide  risk
      in that matter. This is not a case where we are striving to  look  for
      reasons to doubt the experts' views. We  have  attempted  to  approach
      this matter in a measured way. However, we have simply not  found  the
      account to be credible, thus undermining much of what has followed  in
      terms of the medical opinion provided. We remind ourselves there is no
      room for emotional blackmail of the kind referred to by Sedley LJ.  We
      are required to consider the authenticity of such claims with  anxious
      scrutiny.

 147. Following J, we are also entitled to take account of the Secretary  of
      State's obligation to provide appropriately qualified escorts  and  of
      the available  family  support  in  India.   We  have  regard  to  the
      Secretary of State's  published  guidance  in  relation  to  arranging
      removal in medical cases and what will happen  if  it  transpires  the
      appellant requires medical escorts due to any perceived risk.  In  our
      finding, the Secretary of State has a process in place to ensure  that
      the appellant can be  escorted  if  there  are  any  serious  concerns
      regarding his medical or health issues. He would  also  have  familial
      support upon his initial return, as confirmed by his father.

 148. It follows that, having regard to both article 3 claims,  the  broader
      picture,  and  the  United  Kingdom's  obligations   to   ensure   the
      appellant's safety during the  return  journey,  the  removal  of  the
      appellant to India would be proportionate.



The fourth issue: paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi)



The respective submissions

 149. It was advanced by Mr Eaton that the appellant qualified for leave  to
      remain on the grounds that there would be very  significant  obstacles
      to him returning to India.  He  submitted  that  the  appellant  would
      suffer significant physical and/or mental suffering  if  returned.  We
      were invited to take into account that the  appellant  was  struggling
      with his sexuality. In relation to this, it was said to return him  to
      India would likely exacerbate his mental health problems,  given  that
      he maintained that his family and  community  were  not  accepting  of
      homosexuality.

 150. We were referred to  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  MD  (same-sex
      orientated males: risk) India CG [2014] UKUT 65 (IAC),  where  it  was
      submitted that while, as a general rule, homosexuality  in  India  did
      not amount to persecution, homosexual males did suffer  ill-treatment,
      extortion, harassment and  discrimination  from  the  police  and  the
      general populace. Mr Eaton maintained that the appellant's family  did
      not know that he was gay and that he had  a  clear  belief  that  they
      would behave violently towards him if they found out.

 151. In relation to his private life and sexual orientation, we  were  also
      referred  to  the  respondent's  policy  regarding  very   significant
      obstacles (Family Migration: Appendix FM section 1.0b family life  (as
      a partner or parent) and private life:  10-year  route  version  4.0),
      this maintains:

         ...Very  significant  obstacles  will  exist  where  the  applicant
         demonstrates that they would be unable to establish a private  life
         in the country of return, where establishing a private life in  the
         country of return  would  entail  very  serious  hardship  for  the
         applicant.

         ...

         ...A very significant obstacle may arise where the applicant  would
         be at  real  risk  of  prosecution  or  significant  harassment  or
         discrimination as a result of their sexual or political orientation
         or faith, or where the rights and freedoms would  otherwise  be  so
         severely restricted as to  affect  their  fundamental  rights,  and
         therefore their  ability  to  establish  a  private  life  in  that
         country.

         ...

         The decision-maker must consider  the  degree  of  difficulty  that
         would be faced that is  as  a  result  of  the  applicant's  faith,
         political or sexual orientation or gender  identity  based  on  the
         situation in practice in the country of return and not  necessarily
         solely what is  provided  for  in  law.  The  applicant's  previous
         experience of  life  in  that  country  and  any  difficulties  the
         applicant claims to have experienced as a result  of  their  faith,
         political  or  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity  must   be
         considered.

 152. Conversely, it was advanced by Mr Kotas that  the  appellant  did  not
      face significant obstacles to reintegration. His sexuality  would  not
      preclude him from developing a private  life  in  Chennai  or  another
      large city, pursuant to extant country guidance.


The law: 276ADE

 153. Paragraph 276 ADE of the Immigration Rules provides:
        Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
        grounds of private life
              276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by  an  applicant  for
              leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are
              that at the date of application, the applicant:
                 1. (i) does not fall for refusal under any of  the  grounds
                    in Section S-LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1. to  S-
                    LTR.4.5. in Appendix FM; and
                 2. (ii) ...
                 3. (iii) ...
                 4. (iv) .....
                 5. (v) ......
                 6. (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18  years  or
                    above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20
                    years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there
                    would be very significant obstacles to  the  applicant's
                    integration into the country to which he would  have  to
                    go if required to leave the UK.
 154. The test articulated by Sales LJ in Kamara v Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department 2016 EWCA Civ 813 found the concept of integration
      to be a broad one:


              '14... The idea of 'integration' calls for a broad evaluative
             judgement to be made as to  whether  the  individual  will  be
             enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the
             society in that other country is carried on and a capacity  to
             participate in it, so as to have a reasonable  opportunity  to
             be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis
             in that society and to build up within  a  reasonable  time  a
             variety of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to  the
             individual's private or family life'.

 155. In MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India CG [2014] UKUT 00065 (IAC)
      ('MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India')  the  court  held,  inter
      alia (adopting the headnote):


              c. Some persons who are, or  are  perceived  to  be,  same-sex
                 oriented males suffer ill treatment, extortion,  harassment
                 and  discrimination  from  the  police  and   the   general
                 populace; however, the prevalence of such incidents is  not
                 such, even when taken cumulatively, that there can be  said
                 in general to be a real risk of an openly same-sex oriented
                 male suffering treatment  which  is  persecutory  or  which
                 would otherwise reach the threshold required for protection
                 under  the  Refugee  Convention,  article  15(b)   of   the
                 Qualification Directive, or article 3 ECHR.

              d. Same-sex orientation is seen socially, and within the close
                 familial  context,  as   being   unacceptable   in   India.
                 Circumstances for same sex orientated males are  improving,
                 but progress is slow.

              e. It would not, in general, be unreasonable or  unduly  harsh
                 for an open same-sex oriented male  (or  a  person  who  is
                 perceived to be such), who is able to  demonstrate  a  real
                 risk  in  his  home  area   because   of   his   particular
                 circumstances, to  relocate  internally  to  a  major  city
                 within India.

              f. India has a large, robust and accessible LGBTI activist and
                 support network, mainly to be found in the large cities.


Our findings: very significant obstacles

 156. We have already found  that  that  his  medication  and  treatment  is
      available in India. He has not sought any recent mental health care or
      medication in the UK. One of the earlier reports suggests  social  and
      community-based care would assist. We are satisfied  that  his  family
      and friends in India would be able to offer such  support.  They  have
      offered support to him in these proceedings  and  we  have  no  proper
      reason to conclude that would not continue.  His father, for  example,
      has offered him accommodation for when he returns.

 157. The appellant was awarded a masters degree in business  administration
      from Staffordshire University in April 2014, which includes  strategic
      management and leadership. This  suggests  a  certain  skillset.   His
      level of education and interest in business is  likely  to  serve  him
      well in terms of employment prospects in India.

 158. We  are  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  family  would  behave
      violently towards him if they found out he was gay.  There  is  little
      evidence for such an assertion. While there appears to be some form of
      expectation that he will marry, we are not prepared to speculate about
      whether he would be required to do so. We bear in  mind  that  he  has
      lived in the UK for almost 10 years and has not felt pressured  to  go
      back to India and get married. Per MD (same-sex oriented males:  risk)
      India, we find that there is no real risk of persecutory treatment  in
      India. He has been sexually active with men in India before  his  move
      to the UK and there is a large, robust  and  accessible  LGBT  support
      network should he require it.

 159. We  reject  the  suggestion  that  the  appellant's  or  his  family's
      financial position impact on the appellant's return to India. There is
      nothing out of the ordinary about owing money. Any debts that  he  may
      have place him  in  a  no  different  position  to  most  people.  His
      aunt/landlady in her recent email expressed the view she was  flexible
      in terms of the payments owed to her and his other UK borrowing (where
      there is evidence for the same) also appears  flexible  and  will  not
      impinge on his ability to integrate into life in his home country.

 160. We are  less  than  clear  about  his  evidence  in  relation  to  the
      moneylender(s) in India, and on balance we  are  less  than  satisfied
      that the threats that he  claims  have  been  made  are  credible.  We
      observe that when the appellant talks about his fears that he will  be
      at risk from moneylenders, or that he has no means  to  pay  back  his
      debts, or that his parents are being harassed and threatened, or  that
      he feels deeply embarrassed about having borrowed  money  from  family
      and not being able to pay this back, those concerns,  individually  or
      otherwise, do not appear to have impacted very much on  his  lifestyle
      in the UK. We  have  already  expressed  our  reservations  about  the
      evidence concerning the debt.

 161. The appellant is 'an insider' in terms of how life in India is carried
      on. He grew up there and had lived there all his life until  his  move
      to the UK. He speaks the language. The appellant worked there and  has
      family there he can stay with. These are all relevant findings to  the
      conclusion we come to which is that if there are obstacles,  they  are
      not significant, and certainly not very significant.

 162. It follows, in making a broad evaluative judgement, as per Kamara,  we
      are  unable  to  find  any  very  significant  obstacles.   While   we
      acknowledge that there are likely  to  be  some  obstacles,  including
      arranging employment  and  medical  care,  we  did  not  see  this  as
      amounting to either a significant or a very significant  obstacle  for
      the reasons outlined. The obstacles we did identify were  largely  not
      dissimilar to any person relocating and could be generally overcome by
      a resourceful, intelligent individual (such  as  the  appellant)  with
      some planning.  Their  significance  was  considerably  diluted  as  a
      result.

    The fifth issue: Article 8 - private life

 163. It was suggested that  the  appellant  had  established  a  meaningful
      private life in the UK, and the engagement with article  8  should  be
      considered  in  the  round  with  the  proportionality  of  the  whole
      decision. Therefore, it was submitted, the existence of  obstacles  to
      his private life existing elsewhere was a factor to be considered when
      assessing the correctness of the overall decision.  It  was  contended
      that manifestly,  the  appellant's  removal  would  disproportionately
      interfere with the appellant's private life developed in the  UK;  and
      viewed collectively, it was said that  the  appellant's  physical  and
      psychological condition; his sexuality and lack of meaningful  support
      on return to India,  amounted  to  compelling  circumstances  for  the
      purposes of article 8.

The law - article 8

 164. The assessment of the likely interference in terms of article 8 is not
      whether the appellant could establish a private  life  elsewhere,  but
      rather whether his removal would interfere with the  private  life  he
      currently enjoys. In so doing, we  must  have  regard  to  the  public
      interest considerations applicable in all cases, pursuant to  Part  5A
      of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:


         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

         (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)are better able to integrate into society.

         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

         (a) a private life, or

         (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.


Our findings: Article 8

 165. At page 639 of the bundle, the Home Office accepts that the  appellant
      has established a private life in the  United  Kingdom.  He  has  been
      studying here. We accept this and that he  speaks  English,  has  been
      largely financially independent and has flourished in the UK in  terms
      of his social activity (reflected in the broad range of friends he has
      met, evidenced by the letters and statements in support and  his  bank
      account).

 166. However, the respondent says, and we also accept,  the  appellant  has
      only been granted leave in a temporary capacity and should always have
      intended to return to India, therefore interfering  with  his  private
      life is a justifiable and proportionate course of action in pursuit of
      the legitimate aim of effective immigration control. Pursuant to  117B
      (5), little weight must therefore be given to that private life.

 167. We find, on the appellant's own evidence, that  he  does  not  have  a
      partner in the UK.  He does not have  children.  His  activities  with
      other men are transient, and there is no  proper  reason  to  conclude
      that that element of his private life would be interfered with  if  he
      were to be removed.

 168. While we accept that the appellant has medical needs, which until  now
      have been served in the UK, we have already  found,  pursuant  to  his
      article 3 claim, that he would  have  access  to  the  same  types  of
      medication and treatment in India. If he were not to return, in  terms
      of the public interest,  it  is  likely  he  will  continue  to  be  a
      significant financial burden on the resources of the NHS.

 169.  In terms of article 8 and proportionality, we note  that  in  SL  (St
      Lucia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
      1894, the court held:
         27: However, I am entirely  unpersuaded  that  Paposhvili  has  any
         impact on the approach to article 8 claims. As I have described, it
         concerns the threshold of severity for article 3  claims;  and,  at
         least to an extent, as accepted in AM  (Zimbabwe),  it  appears  to
         have altered the European test for such threshold.  However,  there
         is no reason in logic  or  practice  why  that  should  affect  the
         threshold for, or otherwise the approach to, article  8  claims  in
         which the relevant individual has a medical condition.  As  I  have
         indicated and as GS (India) emphasises, article  8  claims  have  a
         different focus and are based upon entirely different criteria.  In
         particular, article  8  is  not  article  3  with  merely  a  lower
         threshold: it does not provide some sort  of  safety  net  where  a
         medical case fails to satisfy the article 3 criteria. An absence of
         medical treatment in the country  of  return  will  not  in  itself
         engage article 8. The only  relevance  to  article  8  of  such  an
         absence will be where that is an additional factor in  the  balance
         with other factors which  themselves  engage  article  8  (see  (MM
         (Zimbabwe) at [23] per Sales LJ). Where an individual has a medical
         condition for which  he  has  the  benefit  of  treatment  in  this
         country, but such treatment may not be available in the country  to
         which he may be removed, where (as here) article 3 is not  engaged,
         then the position is as it was before  Paposhvili,  i.e.  the  fact
         that a person is receiving treatment here which is not available in
         the country of return  may  be  a  factor  in  the  proportionality
         balancing exercise but that factor cannot by itself give rise to  a
         breach of article 8. Indeed, it has been  said  that,  in  striking
         that balance, only the most compelling humanitarian  considerations
         are likely to prevail over legitimate aims of  immigration  control
         (see Razgar at [59] per Baroness Hale).
 170.  The above reasoning is confirmed in PF (Nigeria) at para 20:

             As I described in SL (St Lucia) at  [22]  and  following,  the
             relationship between the article 3 criteria and the article  8
             criteria in the context of healthcare cases was considered  by
             this court in MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the  Home
             Department [2012]  EWCA  Civ  279  ("MM  (Zimbabwe)")  and  GS
             (India) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2015]
             EWCA Civ 40; [2015] 1 WLR 3312 ("GS (India)"), which,  in  the
             words of Sales LJ in AM (Zimbabwe) at [6], "brought  the  test
             under article 3 and the approach under article  8  into  close
             alignment" in the sense that, if a medical claim  fails  under
             article 3, it is unlikely to succeed under article 8. ....

 171. As a result, we  find  that  article  8  is  not  engaged  within  the
      Immigration Rules, that pursuant to 117B(1)  the  public  interest  in
      maintaining immigration control must prevail, and that the appellant's
      removal would be  proportionate  in  all  the  circumstances  outlined
      herein.

 172. In considering article 8 outside of the Rules, Mr Eaton  urged  us  to
      consider whether exceptional circumstances exist, namely whether there
      are other good grounds for granting this appellant leave to remain.

 173. The appellant advances that he has a meaningful private  life  in  the
      UK. In the bundle there  is  evidence  of  him  attending  an  Islamic
      resource centre on a regular basis for Friday prayer, volunteering and
      statements from friends who he has met, (some of whom clearly know him
      better than others).

 174. While we accept that the appellant has  integrated  socially  into  UK
      society in the last 10 years, he has  made  friends,  found  work  and
      assisted others, we see no reason why such a life cannot be replicated
      in India where he grew up. He was educated in India and he will  still
      have connections there. But for the advanced kidney disease  that  led
      to his operation, it is more  likely  than  not  that  he  would  have
      returned to India.

 175. We can find nothing exceptional  in  the  appellant's  case.   In  our
      finding, he would be able to keep in  contact  with  his  UK  friends,
      including his kidney donor, through modern methods  of  communication,
      like the Internet. He can continue to worship  and  help  others  less
      fortunate in India. While the decision to remove  him  might  cause  a
      degree of inconvenience and disappointment, this was not decisive from
      the viewpoint of article 8.

 176. Whilst Mr Eaton submits that the removal of the appellant would not be
      proportionate, following R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the  Home
      Department [2004] UKHL 27, we disagree for the reasons already  given.
      While we would accept that the threshold assessment of  whether  there
      is likely to be any interference with article 8 is not a high one,  we
      have struggled to find any proper reason for article 8  being  engaged
      in the current matter. In our view, any interference is in  accordance
      with the law and proportionate to the legitimate public end sought.

 177. Even through the lens of considering this  matter  in  the  round  and
      taking into account the myriad of objections raised to the appellant's
      return, as we have done at each step of the process;  and  having  the
      proportionality of the decision as a whole in mind,  we  do  not  find
      that any of his personal circumstances are 'exceptional' and certainly
      not 'truly exceptional'.



      Conclusion

 178. We are not satisfied that the  appellant  has  proved,  to  the  lower
      standard, that he would be at risk either on article 3 medical grounds
      or that there is a serious suicide risk engaging article 3, nor  that,
      on balance, 276ADE or article 8 ECHR are engaged, such that to  return
      the appellant would be disproportionate.


Notice of Decision


For the above reasons, we dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
