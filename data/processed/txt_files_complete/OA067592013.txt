Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The Sponsor in person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hillis made following a hearing at Bradford on 8th January 2014.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He applied for come to  the  UK
    to join his wife, Sobia Ahmed, but was refused on the grounds  that  he
    had failed to show that his Sponsor's annual  income  met  the  minimum
    level required by paragraph E-ECP 3.1, namely �18,600.

 3. The judge recorded that the contract of employment dated  2nd  February
    2010 shows that the Sponsor's starting gross annual income was �16,845.
      The Appellant made his application on 21st  November  2012,  and  one
    month later the Sponsor received a promotion and increase in salary  to
    a figure in excess of the required minimum.

 4. The annual salary which she was receiving at the time that the decision
    was made, namely 21st February 2013, was �19,260.

 5. The judge wrote as follows:

         "The relevant date of the Sponsor's income to be  assessed  is  the
         date of decision and, therefore, her income on 21st  February  2013
         met the requirements of ECP 3.1 as set out above.

         It is in my judgement significant that, due to local  difficulties,
         there was no Entry Clearance Manager  Review  of  the  application.
         Additionally the delay between the application being made  on  21st
         November 2012 (wrongly stated as 2011) and the date of decision  of
         20th February, namely, fifteen months, is due to no fault  of  this
         Appellant.

         Given the long delay between application and decision I  find  that
         reliance on the fact that the Appellant had not  submitted  a  full
         six months of bank statements immediately prior to the  application
         date  is  inadmissible  in  this  appeal.  In  my   judgement   the
         requirement of six months bank statements is to show consistency in
         the claimed earnings and it was not envisaged in  this  requirement
         that such a long period between application and decision would take
         place. It is more important in the context of this appeal that  the
         bank statements and wage slips for the six month period immediately
         prior to the date of decision is more helpful to the Respondent  in
         assessing the validity and merits of this application.

         In  reaching  this  conclusion  I  have  taken  into  account   the
         Respondent's discretion to exercise evidential flexibility and  can
         find no valid reason for it not being extended  to  this  Appellant
         given the length of the delay in deciding his application."

 6. On that basis he allowed the appeal both  under  the  Rules  and  under
    Article 8.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had erred in law in concluding that the  relevant  date  from
    which to assess the case  was  the  date  of  the  ECO  decision.   For
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE the significant  date  is  the  date  of
    application and the significant evidence is from the  specified  period
    before that date, and not the date of decision.  The Tribunal  has  not
    addressed the relevant evidence for the period of six months  prior  to
    21st November 2012 (the  date  of  application)  and  has  produced  an
    incorrect finding.

 8. Furthermore the Rules of specific evidence are comprehensively set  out
    in Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules which set out what types  of
    evidence are required, the periods  they  cover  and  the  format  they
    should be in.  The Tribunal  decided  to  disregard  the  requirements,
    which is quite wrong.  It is clear that at the specified evidence shows
    that at the date of the application the Appellant could not satisfy the
    income threshold of the requirements of the Rules.

 9. The appeal was also allowed under ECHR.  It was made clear  in  Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 00640 that the Article 8 assessment should only be  carried
    out when there are  compelling  circumstances  not  recognised  by  the
    Rules. The Tribunal did not identify any such  circumstances.   Gulshan
    also makes it clear that an appeal should only be allowed  where  there
    are exceptional circumstances, namely ones where refusal would lead  to
    an unjustifiably harsh outcome.  The ECO applied the law  as  it  stood
    and treated this case in the same way as any other.  Given that,  post-
    decision, it would appear that the Sponsor  met  the  income  threshold
    requirements a fresh application may now  be  successful,  the  outcome
    could not be considered to be unjustifiably harsh.

10. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Brunnen  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds on 20th February 2014.

The Hearing

11. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds.

12.  The  Sponsor  relied  on  submissions  prepared  for  her  by   Global
    Immigration and said that from her understanding  the  out  of  country
    applications are usually assessed as at the date of decision.    As  at
    the date of application she provided a letter from her  employer  which
    confirmed that she was receiving a gross salary  of  �17,474  increased
    upon promotion to �19,260 on 30th November 2012.  She also  asked  that
    consideration be given to the case of MM  (R  on  the  application  of)
    [2013]  EWHC  1900  when  it  was  held  that  �18,600  was  a  grossly
    disproportionate interference with the right  of  affected  persons  to
    live their family life in the UK.

Findings and Conclusions

13. The judge erred in two respects.  Firstly Appendix FM -SE sets out  the
    specified evidence, in respect of salaried employment in the UK,  which
    must be provided. It includes  inter alia, wage slips covering:

    (i)  a period of six months prior to the date  of  application  if  the
         applicant has been  employed by their current employer for at least
         six months, or

    (ii)     in respect of  any period of salaried employment in the period
         of twelve months prior to the date of application if the  Appellant
         has been employed by their  current  employer  for  less  than  six
         months.

14.  It  is  clear  therefore  that  the  relevant  date  is  the  date  of
    application.  As at that date the sponsor was not in a position to meet
    the requirements of the Rules because her salary was not at a level  of
    �18,600.

15. It was therefore not open to the judge to allow the  appeal  under  the
    Rules.

16. So far as Article 8 is concerned, it is difficult to  see  how  it  can
    properly  be  said  that  the  decision   is   disproportionate.    The
    requirements of the Rules are   not  met  and  only  if  there  may  be
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is  it
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them  (R  on
    the application of Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)).  MM  did  not
    strike down the Rules as being incompatible with the  UK's  obligations
    under the ECHR although it did suggest a number of  alternative  levels
    of income which might mitigate their effect.

17. No compelling circumstances have been cited other than the obvious one,
    namely that the Appellant was in a position to meet the requirements as
    at the date of decision and still is now. Article 8 is not a  mechanism
    for disregarding the effect of the Immigration Rules as clearly set out
    in Appendix FM . The appropriate course for this Appellant is to make a
    fresh application which on the basis of the facts as found by the Judge
    and not disputed by the Respondent, ought to succeed.

Decision

18. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is  set  aside.   It  is
    remade as follows.  The claimant's appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
