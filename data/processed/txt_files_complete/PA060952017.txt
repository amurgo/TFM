For the Appellant:     Ms Wilkins of Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis &
                    Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Jordan born on the 10th  December  1983.
    He appeals with permission the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Mark Davies) to dismiss  his  appeal  on  protection  and  human
    rights grounds.

 2. The substance of the Appellant's claim was that he faces a real risk of
    harm in Jordan  for  reasons  of  his  ethnicity  (Palestinian)  and/or
    membership of a particular social group (refugee).  He  avers  that  in
    2006 he met a Jordanian woman who was a customer at his clothing store.
    They embarked on a relationship and in 2007 she fell pregnant. He  went
    to her family home to propose marriage but when her  family  discovered
    that he was Palestinian, they refused  him.  By  April  2007  they  had
    realised that she was pregnant. The girl's father, brother  and  uncles
    arrived at the Appellant's home and took him  away  at  gunpoint.   The
    police were in attendance but they joined in beating  the  Appellant  -
    the mob believed that he had raped his girlfriend. He was taken  to  an
    unknown place and severely beaten. He lost consciousness. After two  or
    three days the Appellant managed to approach a tribal leader for help -
    a man from the Bani Hassan. There was a subsequent negotiation in which
    the Appellant agreed to give his girlfriend's family his home, ï¿½100,000
    and his  business.  That  agreement  notwithstanding  the  threats  and
    animosity continued and by May  2007  the  Appellant  was  forced  into
    hiding when the leader of the Bani Hassan sentenced him to death.  That
    was, the Appellant claims, the reason that he left Jordan.  He  arrived
    in the United Kingdom in June 2007 and has lived here ever  since.   He
    avers that since his arrival he has been threatened over the  telephone
    and told not to return to Jordan.

 3. The Respondent rejected  the  claim  on  credibility  grounds  and  the
    Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  When  the  matter  came
    before Judge Mark Davies  in  January  2019  the  Appellant  gave  oral
    evidence.

 4. Judge Davies found it to be significant that the  Appellant  spent  ten
    years  living  in  the  United  Kingdom  illegally  before  he   sought
    protection. He only claimed asylum after he was encountered working  in
    a restaurant, in possession of a French passport to which  he  was  not
    entitled.   The Tribunal was not prepared to accept, in the absence  of
    any documentary evidence, that the Appellant had  tried  to  regularise
    his position earlier.  As to the actual claim the Tribunal found:

          i) There was no "extraneous evidence" to support the  Appellant's
             contention that he had a relationship with a Jordanian woman;

         ii) There was no evidence to indicate that he had  been  sentenced
             to death by the Bani Hassan;

        iii) It was "wholly incredible" that the Appellant would  go  to  a
             Bedouin tribe to seek  protection  when  he  was  not  himself
             Bedouin;

         iv) The very nature of the Appellant's application  for  a  United
             Kingdom visa  (i.e.  the  requirement  to  produce  documents)
             indicates that he is not under threat of death from Bedouins;

          v) Although the Appellant has produced a report stating  that  he
             has a scar on his hand, "taking into account his  credibility"
             the Tribunal was not prepared to accept that it was  inflicted
             during the assault on him in Jordan;

         vi) There is no supporting evidence from his mother, who is  still
             in Jordan;

        vii) The psychology report stating that the Appellant has PTSD  and
             depression is of "no value" when weighed against the  findings
             that the Tribunal has already made;

       viii) The report is in  any  event  severely  lacking  in  that  the
             psychologist  fails  to  take  into  account  the  Appellant's
             immigration history - the diagnosis could have arisen from the
             Appellant's circumstances in the United Kingdom.

 5. For those reasons  the  Tribunal  concluded  that  the  account  was  a
    fabrication and dismissed the appeal.

    Error of Law

 6. Permission was granted on the 27th March 2019  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bristow.

 7. The grounds are that the First-tier Tribunal erred:

          i) In its assessment of the scarring and psychology  report.  The
             Tribunal failed to weigh this evidence in the round  with  the
             Appellant's account, instead rejecting their  probative  value
             on the grounds that the Appellant's evidence had already  been
             found to be non-credible. This was contrary to the guidance in
             Mibanga v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2005]
             EWCA Civ 367;

         ii) In respect of the psychologist's report the Tribunal erred  in
             fact in stating that the author failed to consider  the  nexus
             between the diagnosis and the account given, and in  doing  so
             exclude  other  possible  causes.  That  matter  is   squarely
             addressed. That the Tribunal failed to notice that  betrays  a
             lack of anxious scrutiny.

 8. Before me Mr McVeety offered no resistance to  the  grounds,  accepting
    that the errors alleged were made out. I agree.

 9. I would add that the findings that are made are unhelpfully couched  in
    bald terms with no reference to the country background material. It may
    be that it is 'incredible' that a Palestinian refugee in  Jordan  would
    seek help from a Bedouin tribe,  but  without  some  support  for  that
    statement it is very difficult for the reader to  understand  why  that
    should be the case.  It is trite asylum law that decision-makers should
    be cautious about  characterising  something  as  "incredible"  without
    having any idea whether,  in  the  particular  cultural  context,  they
    actually are.  Similarly evidence given  by  an  asylum  seeker  cannot
    lawfully be discounted simply on the basis that it is not  corroborated
    by documentary evidence.

10. Regrettably there are no  findings  that  can  be  salvaged  from  this
    decision. In light of that I agree with Ms Wilkins that the just course
    would be remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    Anonymity

11. This is a live protection appeal. Having had regard to Rule 14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  am  satisfied  that  it
    would be appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Decisions

12. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error
    of law and it is set aside.

13. The decision in the appeal will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal by
    a Judge other than Mark Davies.

14. There is an order for anonymity.
