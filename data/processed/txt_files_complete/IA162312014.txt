                      DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE ALIS


                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                            MR MALIK FARRUKH AZAM
                        (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)
    For the Respondent:     Miss Qureshi, Counsel.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh. The appellant is  married  to
    Atiqa Kauser and on February 21, 2014 he applied for a variation of his
    leave to remain due to his continuing family and private life with  his
    wife. The respondent refused his application on March 17, 2014  on  the
    basis the Immigration Rules were not met and took a decision  to  issue
    directions for his removal pursuant to Section 47 of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and nationality Act 2006.

 3. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (hereinafter  called  the
    2002 Act), as amended, on April 3, 2014. The matter came  before  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Shamash (hereinafter called "the  FtTJ")  on
    November 17, 2014  and  she  allowed  his  appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on January 5, 2015.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on January 12, 2015. Permission
    to appeal was granted Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Robertson  on
    February 12, 2015.

 5. The matter came before me on the date set out above. The appellant  was
    in attendance and represented by his counsel.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. Miss Qureshi acknowledged that the Tribunal  in  SD  -v-  Secretary  of
    State for the Home  Department  (Treatment  of  post-hearing  evidence)
    [2008] UKAIT  00037  made  it  clear  that  if  relevant  material  was
    submitted after the hearing and the FtTJ  was  satisfied  it  could  be
    admitted then the hearing should be reconvened or  written  submissions
    requested.

 7. In this appeal the FtTJ received evidence of income after  the  hearing
    date  but  neither  reconvened  the  hearing  nor   requested   written
    submissions. She in fact simply  remitted  the  decision  back  to  the
    respondent so she could consider the evidence further.

 8. I indicated to Ms Qureshi that this amounted to an error in law because
    of what the Tribunal stated in SD and there had been no basis to  remit
    the decision back to the  respondent  because  a  lawful  decision  had
    already been taken. Neither Miss Qureshi nor Mr Tarlow objected to this
    finding.

 9. I considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement.

10. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

11. Both parties agreed that the appeal should be remitted back to the FtTJ
    for her to deal with the matter. In light of the Practice  Direction  I
    agreed the case should be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I
    issued directions to ensure the speedy conclusion of the appeal.

12. The parties should ensure compliance  with  any  directions  issued  in
    light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply to  this  appeal
    from hereon.

Decision

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

14. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

15. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made to date and I see no reason to make an order now.
