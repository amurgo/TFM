For the Appellant:     Ms V Dirie of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan and  his  recorded  date  of
    birth is 1 January 1997.  He appealed against the respondent's decision
    dated 29 July 2011 refusing his application for asylum and humanitarian
    protection in the United Kingdom. First-tier Tribunal Judge Eldridge in
    a decision promulgated on 30 November 2016  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal but granted him discretionary leave for a period of three  years
    until 1 July 2014 by which time it would be age 17 � years.

2.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ramsay
    on 12 June 2017 stating that it is arguable that the  Judge  failed  to
    take into consideration material evidence in the report of the  Refugee
    Support Network entitled "After Return" dated 2016 regarding the  risks
    facing  care  leavers  returning  from  the  United  Kingdom,   despite
    attention being drawn to the report in the appellant skeleton  argument
    at the hearing. The Judge decision at paragraph 16 indicates  that  the
    Judge might have conducted his own research into the  position  of  the
    Hizibi-i-Islami in Afghanistan after the  hearing  and  without  giving
    notice to the parties, contrary to the guidance in  AM  (fair  hearing)
    [2015] UKUT 656 (IAC). It is also arguable that  the  Judge  failed  to
    take into account material evidence regarding  the  appellant's  asylum
    claim which might have made a material difference to the outcome of the
    appeal.

3.    The First-tier Tribunal Judge  in  his  decision  made  the  following
    findings which I set out  in  summary.  In  his  protection  claim  the
    appellant relies on two aspects. First, he  says  (and  has  maintained
    throughout) that he is a risk from his father because his father was  a
    member of Hezbi-i-Islami and wanted to induce his son  to  be  part  of
    that group and possibly as a suicide bomber. That was the basis of  his
    asylum claim made in 2011 but this was not made this  explicit  in  the
    letter from his solicitors or his further application for further leave
    to remain apart from the single sentence. It did not feature in  either
    of his two statements made for the hearing and  nor  was  any  evidence
    given concerning this aspect. Counsel on his behalf  did  not  seek  to
    address this aspect of the claim either his skeleton argument or in his
    oral submissions, other than to ask to consider the appellant's age and
    communication skills at the time he made his claim for  asylum.  Taking
    this claim at face value, it cannot be found that the appellant  has  a
    well-founded fear of persecution for these reasons.

 4. The second reason that the appellant claims protection  in  the  United
    Kingdom is his profile on return which is as follows. The appellant  is
    a 19-year-old national of Afghanistan who will be 20 in  January  2017.
    He has lived in this country since he came here when he was about 14 or
    12 years old. He has been educated in the State system in this  country
    and obtained a number of qualifications. He  has  an  uncle  and  other
    relatives in this country. This uncle was in Afghanistan  in  Jalalabad
    at the date of  the  hearing  making  arrangements  for  his  wife  and
    children to settle in the United Kingdom. The  appellant  continues  to
    speak Pushtu which is the language in which he gave his evidence. He is
    not financially dependent upon his uncle  or  anyone  else  because  he
    works in this country and has no health problems.

 5. An important aspect of this claim is the appellant's claim that he  has
    had no contact with his family in the Nangarhar province since he  came
    to this country more than five years ago. The appellant has  not  shown
    that he has no family to return to in Afghanistan as the only  evidence
    is his own assertion. There was no witness statement from the uncle who
    lives in the United Kingdom  but  the  appellant  claims  had  gone  to
    Afghanistan. Failure by the uncle to make a  statement  does  not  give
    support to the first aspect of the claim concerning why  the  appellant
    came to this country which she claims was  the  threat  of  becoming  a
    suicide bomber from his father. This easily readily available  evidence
    was not provided. Additionally, it is  apparent  that  the  appellant's
    uncle has  accommodation  available  in  Jalalabad  for  his  wife  and
    children and yet has made an application for them to join  him  in  the
    United Kingdom. It is found as a fact that the appellant has family and
    accommodation available to him in Afghanistan on his return.

 6. It is on this basis that the appellant's claim has been  considered  as
    to the risks to him as a young man returning to Afghanistan as a failed
    asylum seeker. The most recent country guidance decision of  the  upper
    Tribunal is AK (article 15 (c) Afghanistan CG [2012]  UKUT  00163  (IAC
    must be considered and not to do so would be an error of law. This case
    is the authority for the proposition that the conditions in Afghanistan
    are not at such a level of indiscriminate violence that  country  taken
    as a whole so as to mean that, within the meaning of Article 15 (c)  of
    the Qualification Directive, a civilian, solely by being present in the
    country, faces a real risk that threatens  his  life  or  person".  The
    Upper Tribunal went on to state further that "whilst when  assessing  a
    claim in the context of article 15 (c) in which the respondent  asserts
    that Kabul city would be a viable internal relocation  alternative,  it
    is necessary to take into  account,  both  in  assessing  "safety"  and
    "reasonableness" not only the level of violence in that city  but  also
    the difficulties experienced by the  city's  poor  and  also  the  many
    internally displaced persons living there,  these  considerations  will
    not in general  make  return  to  Kabul  unsafe  or  unreasonable.  The
    appellant has family to return  to  in  Jalalabad  and  he  is  not  an
    internally displaced person.

 7. In assessing risk, the issue is whether on return to Jalalabad in Nagar
    province or to Kabul. The appellant has lived in Afghanistan  until  he
    was about 14 � years old and predictably continues to speak Pashto.  It
    is accepted that he will  have  been  exposed  to  Western  values  and
    culture and it is likely that he has absorbed much of that  culture  in
    such a prolonged period in the relatively short life. That factor apart
    however, the appellant is no different from any other 20-year-old young
    man living with or with the assistance of family and Afghanistan.

 8. The Judge referred to  the  UNHCR  report  on  assessing  international
    protection needs asylum seekers from  Afghanistan  published  in  April
    2016 where it is stated that  there  are  reports  of  individuals  who
    return from Western countries having been tortured  or  killed  by  the
    anti-government elements is on the grounds they have become  foreigners
    or that there were  spies  for  a  western  country.  In  essence,  the
    appellant is an adult young male who is healthy and with family  living
    in Afghanistan. He has an uncle  currently  in  that  country  visiting
    family and seeking  to  enable  them  to  come  to  this  country.  The
    appellant has his own family to whom he can return. There is nothing in
    the background evidence which suggests that he has a risk profile which
    raises him above that of others. The appellant will be no more than  an
    asylum seeker who has spent some years in the West.

 9. In respect of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  he
    has no partner and no child and lives with his uncle in  this  country.
    The appellant has a family to  return  to  Afghanistan  so  his  appeal
    cannot succeed on the bases of his private life when  taken  inside  or
    outside  the  immigration  rules.  The  appellant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules  because  he
    has not lived in this country for half of his life. He must demonstrate
    that there are very  significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into
    Afghanistan were he to be returned. The Judge dismissed the appellant's
    appeal both to the extent that he relies on the immigration rules,  the
    Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights.

10. In the grounds of appeal, the appellant states the  following  which  I
    summarise.  The  Judge  failed  to  take  into  consideration  material
    evidence relied upon by the appellant to establish his risk  on  return
    and very significant obstacles  to  integration  in  Afghanistan  under
    paragraph 276 ADE (1) (iv) of the immigration  rules.  The  Judge  also
    conducted inappropriate judicial research post  hearing  and  dismissed
    the appellant protection claim on the basis that the Hezbi-i-Islami  is
    now part of the political  establishment  in  Pakistan  with  seats  in
    Parliament. It is wholly unclear where  the  Judge  has  obtained  this
    information as it is not in the lengthy bundles submitted.

11. The Judge also failed  to  have  regard  to  relevant  evidence  and/or
    submissions regarding the material facts of the asylum claim. The Judge
    did not take into account a lengthy and detailed report by the  Refugee
    Support Network ("RSM") entitled "After Return" dated April 2016.

12. In respect of procedural unfairness, the Judge wrongly  concluded  that
    the appellant's reliance upon material facts of his asylum  claim  were
    undermined by his failure to make explicit reference to that  claim  or
    address the issue in his two statements. It is possible that the  Judge
    relied on the wrong skeleton argument as  it  is  not  clear  from  the
    decision which skeleton argument was being referred to in the decision.
    Furthermore, the appellant gave oral evidence in support of his account
    of past persecution which the Judge does not appear  to  have  attached
    appropriate weight. Had the Judge not made these  material  errors  and
    had taken full and proper account of the evidence  and  submissions  in
    the round, it is not inevitable that he would have  come  to  the  same
    conclusion.

13. At the hearing, I heard submissions from both  parties  as  to  whether
    there is an error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Discussion and whether there is a material error of law in the  decision  of
the First-tier Tribunal

14. I have taken into account the decision, the arguments of  the  parties,
    the skeleton argument and I find that the Judge has  made  no  material
    error of law in the decision. The Judge was very clear in his  decision
    that he did not accept as a matter of fact that the  appellant's  claim
    that his father wanted the appellant to  join  the  Hezbi-i-Islami  and
    become a suicide bomber for them. Therefore,  it  is  implicit  in  the
    decision that the appellant came to this country as an economic migrant
    and not because he was fleeing persecution from anyone. The  Judge  was
    entitled to find that the appellant has an uncle with whom he lives  in
    the United Kingdom did not provide  a  statement  even  if  he  was  in
    Afghanistan at the date of the hearing. The Judge was entitled to  find
    that the appellant's failure to provide evidence from his  uncle  about
    his asylum claim was readily and easily available to the appellant  and
    failure to provided it goes to his credibility and to  the  credibility
    of his claim. This evidence clearly demonstrate that the appellant  was
    sent by his father to the United Kingdom to live with his uncle in this
    country as an economic migrant.

15. It is within this context, the Judge found that the  appellant  has  no
    one to fear on his  return  to  Afghanistan.  Similarly,  in  the  same
    context, the Judge found that the appellant has family to return to  in
    Afghanistan and his claim that he has not been in  contact  with  them,
    since he came to the United Kingdom, was not credible. Given  that  the
    appellant's uncle returned to Afghanistan to Jalalabad where  his  wife
    and children live, demonstrated that the appellant  does  have  contact
    with his family and to whom  he  will  return.  These  are  sustainable
    conclusions on the evidence.

16. The Judge considered the country  guidance  case  and  found  that  the
    appellant would not be at risk on return to Afghanistan.  The  evidence
    before him was that the appellant was  an  adult,  has  lived  in  this
    country since he was about 14 or 12 years old, has been educated in the
    State system in this country and obtained several  qualifications.  The
    Judge also found that the appellant has an uncle in this  country  with
    whom he lives.  The  appellant  continues  to  speak  Pushtu  in  which
    language, he gave his evidence. He is not  financially  dependent  upon
    his uncle or anyone else because he works in this country  and  has  no
    health problems. The Judge properly considered the appellant's  profile
    in reaching his conclusion that the appellant can return to Afghanistan
    and continue his life in that country with the support  of  his  family
    and who had been sent to the United Kingdom as an economic migrant.  In
    the circumstances, the Judge was entitled to conclude that there  would
    be no  significant  obstacles  for  the  appellant's  integration  into
    Afghanistan because he had family in that country. These are  perfectly
    reasonable conclusions and there is no perversity in them.

17. In respect of the research that it is claimed that  the  Judge  did  in
    respect of the Hizibi-i-Islami. From the reading of the entirety of the
    decision, it is apparent that the Judge did not believe  the  appellant
    that his father was a member of the Hizibi-i-Islami who wanted  to  use
    the appellant as a suicide bomber. Therefore, even  if  the  Judge  did
    state in his decision that the Hizibi-i-Islami is integrated  into  the
    Afghanistan government, which was not something before him, was  not  a
    material error of law because it had no impact on his  decision.  There
    was no procedural or substantive prejudice to  the  appellant  by  this
    research.

18. It is complained that the Judge did not take into account  the  Refugee
    Support Network entitled "After Return" dated April 2016 and if he  had
    done so he might  have  come  to  a  different  decision.  Reading  the
    decision in its entirety, it is plain to see that the Judge  relied  on
    the background evidence and the country guidance case of AK to come  to
    his reasoned conclusions. The Judge does not have to make reference  to
    every piece of evidence which has been provided to him in his decision.
    The Judge referred to other  background  evidence  such  as  the  UNHCR
    report on assessing international protection needs for  asylum  seekers
    from Afghanistan published in April 2016. The Judge also stated that he
    does not "see anything end the background evidence put before him which
    suggests that he has a risk profile which  raises  him  above  that  of
    others".  I have no difficulty in understanding  the  Judge's  decision
    and I find no good reason has been advanced for why his decision is not
    safe.

19.  The  Judge  found  that  on  his  return,  the  appellant  will   have
    accommodation, family to support him and therefore he will not be  open
    to abuse by anyone because he will have the protection of  his  family.
    He correctly found that the general conditions that Afghanistan do  not
    engage article 15 (c) of the Qualification Directive.

20. The Judge was entitled to find that the appellant's private life is not
    engaged. He stated that the appellant is not meet the  requirements  of
    the immigration rules and  saw  no  justification  in  considering  the
    appellant's private life outside the immigration rules and this finding
    is undisputedly sound.

21. I find there has been no error of law in the decision in respect of the
    findings made by the Judge on the evidence before him. I also find that
    the Judge's conclusion that the appellant  can  return  to  Afghanistan
    because he does not have a profile which would put  him  at  risk.  The
    Judge was also entitled to find that even  though  the  appellant  came
    here  as  a  child,  he  has  studied  in  this  country  and  achieved
    qualifications which he can use at home. The appellant  works  in  this
    country and therefore he can continue working in Afghanistan and  enjoy
    his private life in that country. The appellant has  proved  to  be  of
    considerable resilience, adaptability and fortitude by travelling as  a
    minor to the United Kingdom he could use the  same  resourcefulness  to
    relocate to Afghanistan with the support of his family.

22. I also find that no differently constituted Tribunal would  come  to  a
    different conclusion on the evidence in this appeal. I have  considered
    the report titled "After Return" and I find that the appellant does not
    fit into the profile of a person at risk, given  in  that  report.  The
    difference with this appellant is that he has  family  support  on  his
    return and therefore will not experience  the  consequences  stated  at
    paragraph 28 to 33 of the report. He will also not face obstacles  such
    as envisioned in the report because the appellant has a family  network
    which will protect and support him. The report states at  paragraph  43
    that the UK based educational  qualifications  are  not  recognised  in
    Afghanistan. I find this opinion puts the  credibility  of  the  entire
    report at risk because I do not find it credible that a person who  has
    learned English and acquired skills in the United Kingdom will  not  be
    able to get a job in a country like  Afghanistan  which  is  trying  to
    rebuild as a country.




Notice of Decision

23. I therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and  I
    dismiss this appeal.
