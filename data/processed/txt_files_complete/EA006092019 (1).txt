                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Must an appeal brought under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052 - "the 2016 Regulations") against an EEA
    decision be treated as abandoned following a grant of leave  to  remain
    to the appellant?

 2. The position originally adopted by the Respondent  in  answer  to  this
    question was "yes". However, she now concedes that this is not the case
    and that there is no legislative mechanism for an appeal brought  under
    the 2016 Regulations to be treated as abandoned following  a  grant  of
    leave to remain or the issuance of documentation confirming a right  to
    reside under EU law.

 3. In addition, the Respondent accepts that the First-tier Tribunal  erred
    in law when dismissing the Appellant's appeal, and  that  the  decision
    should be remade and the appeal allowed. Consequently, the substance of
    this appeal can be dealt with  in  fairly  short  order.  However,  the
    jurisdictional  question  of  abandonment  requires   a   little   more
    exploration  to  determine  whether  the  Respondent's  concession   is
    correct.

Relevant background

 4. The Appellant, a Tunisian national, appeals  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cassel ("the judge"), promulgated on 15  July
    2019,  by  which  he  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's refusal to issue him with a permanent residence card under
    the 2016 Regulations.

 5. In 2013 the Appellant married a Spanish national and was issued with  a
    residence  card  under  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations  2006  (SI  2006/1003  -  "the  2006   Regulations").   The
    relationship  subsequently  broke  down,   divorce   proceedings   were
    initiated on an unknown date in November 2016, and  a  decree  absolute
    was issued in April 2017. A further residence card was  issued  to  the
    Appellant, this time based upon his retained right  of  residence.  The
    application for a permanent residence card was made in October 2018 and
    refused by the Respondent on 12 December 2018 on the ground that  there
    was insufficient evidence of  the  ex-spouse's  employment  during  the
    period relied on by the Appellant. The Appellant appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 6. The Appellant then applied for settled status under the  EU  Settlement
    Scheme (as set out in Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules). On 22  May
    2019 he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain ("ILR").

 7. Apparently unaware of the grant of  ILR  and  no  jurisdictional  issue
    having been raised by either party, the judge proceeded to dismiss  the
    appeal on the basis that the Appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that
    he had been "exercising Treaty rights" as  a  "qualified  person",  and
    that there was insufficient evidence of the ex-spouse having worked for
    five years prior to the divorce.

 8. Following the grant of permission, the Respondent provided  a  rule  24
    response, in which it was asserted, for the first time, that the  grant
    of  ILR  meant  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  should  be  treated  as
    abandoned. The Appellant refuted this, but  in  further  correspondence
    the Respondent maintained her original position.

 9. At the hearing on 13 January 2020, Mr Avery accepted that the judge had
    erred in law and that the decision should  be  remade  and  the  appeal
    allowed. However, these concessions would be immaterial if the grant of
    ILR to the Appellant resulted in his appeal being treated as  abandoned
    prior to the  hearing  before  the  judge.  On  this  issue,  Mr  Avery
    requested additional time in which to provide a considered response  on
    behalf of the Respondent. In all the circumstances, we acceded to this.

10. Mr Deller subsequently filed and served  concise  written  submissions,
    for which we are grateful. These set out the concession  summarised  in
    paragraph 2, above. In addition, they  record  that  whilst  there  was
    provision under the 2006 Regulations for appeals  brought  under  those
    Regulations to be treated as abandoned where relevant documentation was
    issued to an appellant, this ceased to be the case from 6 April 2015.

Abandonment: a key distinction

11. In determining whether an appeal is be  treated  as  abandoned,  it  is
    first important to identify the legal basis upon  which  the  appellant
    brought that appeal in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  If  the  appeal  is
    against a decision listed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002" - whether in  its  current
    iteration or prior to the amendments made by the Immigration Act 2014),
    that appeal is brought "under section 82(1)" and  is  governed  by  the
    regime established by NIAA 2002.

12. However, if the appeal is against an  "EEA  decision",  as  defined  by
    Regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations (or its predecessor  under  the
    2006 Regulations), that appeal is brought under  those  Regulations  by
    virtue of Regulation 36(1), which provides:

            "36.- Appeal rights

           (1) The subject of an  EEA  decision  may  appeal  against  that
           decision under these Regulations.

    The same right of appeal was previously afforded under Regulation 26 of
    the 2006 Regulations.

13. An appeal brought under either the 2016 or 2006 Regulations is  subject
    to the regime established by the applicable Regulations.

14. The significance  of  the  distinction  between  the  regimes  for  the
    purposes of abandonment becomes apparent when we examine the  2016  and
    2006 Regulations in a little more detail, beginning with the  first  in
    time.

Abandonment under the 2006 Regulations

15. Section 104(4A) NIAA 2002 provided, in so as is relevant, as follows:

           "104 Pending appeal

           ...

           (4A) An appeal under section 82(1) brought by a person while  he
           is in the United Kingdom shall be treated as  abandoned  if  the
           appellant is granted leave to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom  (subject  to  subsection  (4B))"  [the   reference   to
           subsection 4C  having  been  removed  when  that  provision  was
           repealed by the Immigration Act 2014]

16. As an appeal against  an  EEA  decision  was  brought  under  the  2006
    Regulations and not under section 82(1) NIAA 2002, section 104(4A)  did
    not apply unless it was listed under para 1 of Schedule 1 to  the  2006
    Regulations as one of the "following provisions of, or made under"  the
    NIAA 2002 which applied to an appeal under those Regulations "as if  it
    were"  an  appeal  "under  section  82(1)"   (this   "reading   across"
    legislative device is discussed in Munday  (EEA  decision:  grounds  of
    appeal) [2019] UKUT 00091(IAC) in a context different  from  that  with
    which we are presently concerned). Section 104 of the NIAA 2002 was not
    one of those provisions contained in para 1 of Schedule 1. Therefore, a
    pending appeal brought under the 2006 Regulations could not  have  been
    treated as abandoned by virtue of an appellant being granted  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.

17. We note that Regulation 25(4) precluded  statutory  abandonment  of  an
    appeal solely on the basis that an appellant left the United Kingdom.

18. There was however one provision pursuant to which an appeal  against  a
    relevant EEA decision was to be treated  as  abandoned.  Prior  to  its
    revocation on 6 April 2015 (by virtue of para 16 of Schedule 2  to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area)(Amendment)  Regulations  2015  (SI
    2015/694), para 4(2) of Schedule 2 to  the  2006  Regulations  read  as
    follows:

           "4.- Appeals under the 2002 Act and previous immigration Acts

           ...

           (2)  A  person  who  has  been  issued   with   a   registration
           certificate,  residence  card,  derivative  residence  card,   a
           document certifying permanent residence or a permanent residence
           card  under  these   Regulations   (including   a   registration
           certificate under these Regulations as applied by  regulation  7
           of  the   Accession   of   Croatia   (Immigration   and   Worker
           Authorisation) Regulations 2013) or a  registration  certificate
           under  the  Accession  (Immigration  and  Worker   Registration)
           Regulations  2004,  or  an  accession  worker  card  under   the
           Accession (Immigration  and  Worker  Authorisation)  Regulations
           2006, or a worker authorisation registration  certificate  under
           the Accession of Croatia (Immigration and Worker  Authorisation)
           Regulations 2013, or a person whose passport  has  been  stamped
           with a family member residence stamp, shall  have  no  right  of
           appeal under  section  2  of  the  Special  Immigration  Appeals
           Commission Act 1997 or  section  82(1)  of  the  2002  Act.  Any
           existing appeal under those sections of those Acts or under  the
           Asylum  and  Immigration  Appeals  Act  1993,  the  Asylum   and
           Immigration Act 1996  or  the  1999  Act  shall  be  treated  as
           abandoned." (emphasis added)

19. Thus, the issuance of  relevant  documentation  resulted  in  statutory
    abandonment. This was consistent with  the  fact  that  the  individual
    concerned would have been given all  that  he/she  had  sought  in  the
    appeal, namely a document confirming his/her  right  under  EU  law  to
    reside in the United Kingdom. What this provision did not cover was the
    situation in which an appellant had been granted leave to remain, which
    was an immigration decision taken under domestic law.

20. Paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations was  not  replaced
    with  an  equivalent  provision  prior  to  the  revocation  of   those
    Regulations in their entirety on 1 February 2017.

21. Para 4(2) of Schedule 2  continues  to  be  mentioned  in  legislation,
    notwithstanding its revocation. The relevant requirements of Rule 16 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014 (SI 2014/2604) state:

           "16.- Appeal treated as abandoned or finally determined

           (1) A party must notify the Tribunal if they are aware that-

           ...

           (d) a document listed in paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule  2  to  the
           2006 Regulations has been issued to the appellant.

           (2) Where an appeal is treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
           104(4A) of the 2002 Act or paragraph 4(2)of Schedule 2  to  2006
           Regulations,  the  Tribunal  must  send  the  parties  a  notice
           informing them that the appeal is being treated as abandoned  or
           finally determined, as the case may be."

22. As with the First-tier Tribunal's Procedure Rules, we find a  reference
    to para 4(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations  in  Rule  17A(1)(d)
    and (2) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI
    2008/2698):

           "17A.-(1) A party to an  asylum  case  or  an  immigration  case
           before the Upper Tribunal must notify the  [Upper]  Tribunal  if
           they are aware that-

           ...

           (d) a document listed in paragraph 4(2) of  Schedule  2  to  the
           Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006(c)  has
           been issued to the appellant.

           (2) Where an appeal is treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
           104(4) or (4A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
           2002(d) or paragraph 4(2)  of  Schedule  2  to  the  Immigration
           (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  or  as   finally
           determined  pursuant  to  section  104(5)  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the Upper  Tribunal  must  send
           the parties a notice informing them that  the  appeal  is  being
           treated as abandoned or finally determined."

23. Even though the Procedure Rules continue  to  refer  to  para  4(2)  of
    Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations, it is clear that an  appeal  cannot
    be treated as abandoned where a document confirming a right  to  reside
    under EU law has been issued after the revocation of that provision  on
    6 April 2015. To this extent, the continued reference in the  Procedure
    Rules to para 4(2) of Schedule 2 appears anachronistic. However,  there
    were appeals that were treated as abandoned under para 4(2) of Schedule
    2 and the possibility cannot be excluded that there may still be  long-
    standing pending appeals brought under the 2006 Regulations  where  the
    appellant was issued with relevant documentation prior to 6 April 2015,
    with the consequence that such appeals would  fall  to  be  treated  as
    abandoned under those Regulations and the relevant  provisions  of  the
    Procedure Rules would apply.

Abandonment under the 2016 Regulations

24. As with appeals under the 2006 Regulations, the  statutory  abandonment
    mechanism contained in section 104(4A) of the NIAA 2002 can only  apply
    to appeals brought under the 2016 Regulations if  it  is  to  be  "read
    across" to such appeals. Para 1 of Schedule 2 to the  2016  Regulations
    stipulates that the "following provisions of, or made under"  the  NIAA
    2002 apply to an appeal under those Regulations  "as  if  it  were"  an
    appeal "under section 82(1)". It is apparent that section  104  of  the
    NIAA 2002 is not amongst those provisions.

25. Therefore, as was the position under the 2006  Regulations,  an  appeal
    brought under the 2016 Regulations cannot be treated  as  abandoned  by
    virtue of an appellant being granted leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

26. What is conspicuous by its absence is an equivalent  provision  in  the
    2016 Regulations to para 4(2) of Schedule 2 to  the  2006  Regulations.
    The previous mechanism for an appeal to be treated  as  abandoned  upon
    the issuance of documentation confirming a right to reside under EU law
    has not been replicated.

27. Regulation 35 (the successor to Regulation 25 of the 2006  Regulations)
    confirms that an appeal under the 2016 Regulations is to be treated  as
    pending until the appeal (or a further appeal) is  finally  determined,
    withdrawn or abandoned. Regulation 35(4) specifies that an  appellant's
    departure from  the  United  Kingdom  during  the  life  of  an  appeal
    specifically does not result in statutory abandonment.  The  Regulation
    makes no provision for  abandonment  following  a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain.

28. We have had regard to the Practice Directions of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Chambers of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Whilst Direction 5 refers to pending appeals and abandonment,  it  adds
    nothing to our analysis.

Conclusions on the abandonment issue

29. We conclude that the Respondent's concession on the  abandonment  issue
    is correct. Prior to 6 April 2015, there was provision under para  4(2)
    of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Regulations for appeals brought  under  those
    Regulations to be treated as abandoned where an  appellant  was  issued
    with documentation confirming a right to reside in the  United  Kingdom
    under EU law. As of  6  April  2015,  that  abandonment  provision  was
    revoked and never replaced. There was never  any  provision  under  the
    2006 Regulations for an appeal to be treated as abandoned  following  a
    grant of leave remain in the United Kingdom.

30. There is no mechanism for an appeal against  an  EEA  decision  brought
    under the 2016 Regulations to be treated as abandoned as a  consequence
    of an appellant being granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom  or
    issued with a document confirming a right to reside under EU law.

31. It follows that a grant of leave to  remain  following  an  application
    under the EU Settlement Scheme does not result in an appeal against  an
    EEA decision brought  under  the  2016  Regulations  being  treated  as
    abandoned.

32. Whether the omission of a mechanism for treating appeals under the 2016
    Regulations as abandoned is by design or  otherwise  is  uncertain.  At
    first blush, it might be thought that a grant of ILR  to  an  appellant
    would result in them achieving all that they  could  wish  for,  namely
    settled status in United Kingdom. It should  be  appreciated,  however,
    that ILR involves a grant of  leave  under  domestic  law,  whereas  an
    individual may well wish to assert, and have confirmed, rights under EU
    law; rights which may in certain respects offer  additional  protective
    features. At least  in  respect  of  appeals  brought  under  the  2016
    Regulations, an individual is entitled to pursue this course of action.



33. In light of the foregoing,  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  EEA
    decision, brought under the  2016  Regulations,  did  not  fall  to  be
    treated as abandoned by virtue of the grant of ILR on 22 May  2019.  In
    consequence, the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction  to  decide  that
    appeal. The appeal is  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  we  too  have
    jurisdiction to deal with it.

Postscript to the  abandonment  issue:  The  Immigration  (Citizens'  Rights
Appeals) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020

34. On 31 January 2020, the  Immigration  (Citizens'  Rights  Appeals)  (EU
    Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/61) came into force. EU  citizens  have
    rights of appeal against a variety of decisions made on or  after  exit
    day (that being 31 January 2020) relating to leave to enter,  leave  to
    remain, and deportation. Regulation 13(3) specifically provides for  an
    appeal brought under the Regulations to be treated as abandoned if  the
    appellant is granted leave to enter remain in  the  United  Kingdom  by
    virtue of "residence scheme immigration rules", subject  to  exceptions
    under Regulation 13(4). We note that by virtue of  paras  5  and  6  of
    Schedule 4 to  the  Regulations,  Rule  17A  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    Procedure Rules and Rule 16  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  Procedure
    Rules have been amended so as to  make  reference  to  the  abandonment
    provision in Regulation 13. However, somewhat oddly given what we  have
    set  out  when  analysing  the  current  legal  framework  relating  to
    abandonment, the references to the 2006 Regulations  in  the  Procedure
    Rules for both Tribunal are left untouched.

Error of law and remaking the decision

35. As noted earlier in our decision, the Respondent has conceded that  the
    judge erred in law. In our judgment that concession was correctly made.
    The  judge  wrongly  sought  proof  from  the  Appellant  that  he  was
    "exercising Treaty rights" and that he was a  "qualified  person",  and
    failed to appreciate  that  time  accrued  with  a  retained  right  of
    residence counted towards the five years necessary for the  acquisition
    of a permanent right of residence.

36. We therefore set the judge's decision aside.

37. Based on the evidence  adduced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Respondent  has  also  conceded  that  the  Appellant  has  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence in this country. Again, we agree with this
    concession.

38. Accordingly, we go on to remake the  decision  and  conclude  that  the
    Respondent's decision of 12  December  2018  breaches  the  Appellant's
    rights under EU law.

Anonymity
39. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and, in all
    the circumstances, nor do we.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We remake the decision by allowing the appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
full fee award of �140.00. The Appellant succeeded on the basis  upon  which
he made an application to the Respondent in the first instance.
