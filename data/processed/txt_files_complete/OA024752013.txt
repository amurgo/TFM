Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J. Howard (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Smart (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 28th March 2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 21st March 2014.  In the determination, the judge allowed
    the appeal of Mrs  Traheem  Irshad.   The  Respondent  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, subsequently applied for, and was granted permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Pakistan, who was born on  10th
    May 1982.  She is the spouse of Mr  Saeed  Nazir,  a  British  citizen,
    present and settled in the UK.  She  appeals  against  the  refusal  of
    entry clearance, under Appendix FM (Section EC-P1.1(d),  and  E-ECP3.1)
    and Appendix FM-SE of HC 395.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor, Saeed  Nazir,  that  he
    was paid in cash for jobs  that  he  was  doing,  and  he  deposited  a
    sufficient amount in his bank accounts only so as to be able to pay his
    direct debits, and then kept the rest to pay for his bills and  to  buy
    food.  The judge was satisfied that the  Appellant  met  the  requisite
    threshold  of  earnings  of  �18,600  per  annum  as  required  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law because he
    failed to specify exactly the time when the  Sponsor  was  said  to  be
    earning in excess of �8,600.  Further, the evidence, such  as  it  was,
    was not presented in the specified format.

The Hearing

 5. At the hearing before me, Mr Howard appearing as solicitor on behalf of
    the Appellant submitted that he had an application to make to  withdraw
    the appeal of the Appellant.  He submitted  that  the  Sponsor  was  no
    longer in a relationship with the Appellant and therefore  he  did  not
    now wish to sponsor the Appellant's  entry  into  the  UK.   Mr  Smart,
    appearing on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer, submitted  that  he
    did not in principle oppose this, although the legality of this  course
    of action was something that should be considered, as it was the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's  appeal,  and  not  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant
    herself.

 6. I have concluded that Mr  Smart,  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, is correct in his submissions.   I  must  first  consider  the
    appeal, as presented by the Entry Clearance Officer, and only if I find
    there to be an error of law, and I am then to remake the decision, that
    I should consider the application of Mr Howard to withdraw his appeal.

 7. Having considered the appeal of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  I  am
    satisfied that the judge, in making findings of fact at  paragraphs  19
    and 20, failed to have regard to  the  provisions  of  Appendix  FM-SE,
    which requires specified evidence to be provided for a period  of  time
    before the date of the application.  It has not been stipulated in  the
    determination what the date of the application is,  or  the  period  of
    time which was covered by the letter from  HMRC,  relied  upon  by  the
    Sponsor.  Accordingly, there is clearly an error of law, and I so find.

Decision on the Appellant's Application to Withdraw the Appeal

 8. The application to withdraw in this case, is not that of the Appellant,
    Mrs Traheem Irshad, but of the Sponsor, Mr Saeed Nazir.  As such, it is
    not open to the Sponsor to withdraw the appeal.  Under Rule 17  of  the
    Upper Tribunal Rules, for a party to withdraw its case before the Upper
    Tribunal, the consent of the Tribunal is required.  The Upper  Tribunal
    does not consent to the withdrawal  of  the  appeal  by  the  Appellant
    because the application is not by the Appellant, but by the Sponsor, Mr
    Saeed Nazir.

 9. Accordingly, I proceed to determine the appeal substantively.

Remaking the Decision

10. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions I have heard today.
     Having set aside the decision, I remake the decision now under Section
    12(2) of TCEA 2007.  Given that there is no evidence  before  me  about
    the period of time before the date of the application that the evidence
    of the Sponsor's earnings can be said to  be  put  in  the  form  of  a
    specified  format,  and  given  that  it  is   not   clear   from   the
    determination, or from the evidence before me today, what the  date  of
    the application is, or the period of time that is covered by the letter
    from the HMRC, I dismiss the appeal.

Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

12. No anonymity order is made.
