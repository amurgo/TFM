Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Q S Anisudon, of S Z Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  who  was  refused  entry
    clearance to settle in the UK with his wife, Iran Kanwal (the sponsor).
     The entry clearance application was refused on 5 December 2012, on the
    sole issue of maintenance (paragraph 281(v) of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (HC 395 as amended)).  The appellant's appeal was dismissed by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Powell.  This followed a hearing at Newport  on
    6 December 2013, at which the sponsor gave evidence, and the  appellant
    was represented, as before me, by Mr Anisudon.   The  judge's  decision
    was based on findings that the sponsor had provided documents about her
    financial circumstances that were not reliable or genuine, and that she
    had not provided an accurate account of her employment and income.  The
    particular documents under consideration were two letters from a branch
    of the National Westminster Bank.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted,  on  28  March  2014,  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pirotta.  The grounds seeking permission to  appeal  had
    argued that the judge had  entered  into  his  own  assessment  of  the
    authenticity of the bank letters without sufficient  evidence;  and  he
    had erred in his consideration of Article 8.  The grounds were found to
    be arguable.  A further letter from the bank had  been  provided,  with
    the  application  for  permission  to  appeal.   The   judge   granting
    permission noted that this letter confirming the  authenticity  of  the
    bank letters  could  not  have  been  anticipated  by  the  judge,  but
    suggested that the judge, as a matter of fairness, could have permitted
    the appellant to obtain further evidence to rebut matters brought up at
    the hearing.

Submissions

3.   The submissions by Mr Anisudon, arguing that there had  been  an  error
    of law, can be summarised as follows.  The judge had not raised  as  an
    issue at the hearing his concern that the documents  were  false.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer, in the refusal, had  not  made  an  allegation
    that the bank letters were not genuine, but had only drawn attention to
    spelling errors.  The further letter had shown that the judge's adverse
    findings, based on a comparison of the two letters, was not correct.

4.   In addition, at paragraph 12 the judge  had  erred  in  considering  HC
    194, which introduced Appendix FM, when this application was made  just
    before the changes  were  introduced.   There  was  also  an  error  in
    paragraph 16.  The judge took as an adverse credibility point that  the
    sponsor had not previously mentioned having a period of two and a  half
    months off work.  In fact  this  had  been  mentioned  in  her  witness
    statement, prepared for the appeal, at paragraph 2.

5.   It was accepted, for the appellant,  that  any  errors  in  considering
    Article 8 were not relevant if there were  errors  in  considering  the
    appeal under the Rules.  In view of this agreement I invited Mr Bramble
    to make submissions limited  to  the  position  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  His submissions on these matters can be summarised as  follows.
    It was accepted that there were errors, but it was not clear that these
    were material.  The determination could be read  in  such  a  way  that
    paragraph 15 could be regarded as a freestanding  negative  credibility
    finding about the sponsor.  Although it was accepted that there was  an
    error in paragraph 16, because of the witness  statement,  it  remained
    the case that the conclusion at  paragraph  24  was  sustainable,  even
    without paragraph 16.  The finding at paragraph 24 included  a  finding
    that something was being concealed.  There remained a missing document,
    in the form of the June bank statement that would  have  confirmed  the
    payslip income for that month.

6.   As I indicated at the hearing I decided, having heard submissions  from
    both sides, that the judge had erred in law, and that  this  error  was
    material to the outcome.  Mr Bramble mounted an  ingenious  attempt  to
    salvage the adverse findings, but in my view  paragraph  15  cannot  be
    read as containing adverse findings.  Having read the determination  as
    a whole  it  appears  clear  to  me  that  the  findings  of  fact  and
    conclusions start at paragraph 14, and run through to paragraph 25.  In
    my view paragraph 15 is only the start, and not the end, or  a  partial
    end, of the findings process.  The main findings are at  paragraphs  24
    and 25.  The heart of the adverse findings are at  paragraph  16,  with
    the finding that the sponsor had invented an explanation to  explain  a
    discrepancy; and paragraphs 17 to 23, where there was a conclusion that
    the second bank letter was not genuine.

7.   Mr Bramble correctly conceded that paragraph 16 contained an error,  in
    that it was not the case that the sponsor  had  mentioned  her  absence
    from work at the hearing for the  first  time.   Mr  Bramble  was  also
    unable to provide any reasoned defence of the  approach  taken  to  the
    bank letters.

8.   The case of RP (proof of forgery) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00086  is  well-
    known, and sets  out  the  correct  approach  to  forgery  allegations.
    Paragraph 14 of the determination is as follows:

        In judicial  proceedings  an  allegation  of  forgery  needs  to  be
        established to a high degree of proof,  by  the  person  making  the
        allegation.  This is therefore a  matter  on  which  the  respondent
        bears the burden of  proof.   Immigration  Judges  decide  cases  on
        evidence, and in the absence of any concession by the appellant,  an
        Immigration Judge is not entitled to find or assume that a  document
        is a forgery, or to treat it as a forgery for the  purposes  of  his
        determination, save on the basis of evidence  before  him.   In  the
        present case  the  evidence  was  limited  to  the  Entry  Clearance
        Officer's assertion of his own view and the defect in  the  document
        identified in the notes on the application form - that  is  to  say,
        the mismatch between the run date and the date stamp on one  of  the
        remittance documents.   That  evidence  is  wholly  insufficient  to
        establish that that document is a forgery.  There is  no  reason  to
        suppose that it is not a simple mistake.  As it happens, "petroleum"
        is misspelt in the Notice of Refusal.  Although we would be inclined
        to suppose that Entry Clearance Officers can spell this word, we  do
        not automatically assume that the Notice of Refusal  is  a  forgery:
        there is no reason to suppose that it was not simply a mistake.


     The point was therefore made, in that case,  that  spelling  errors  or
    other discrepancies on the  face  of  a  document  are  not  enough  in
    themselves to justify a finding of falsity.  That is exactly the  point
    here.  This is an object lesson in the danger of reaching  the  serious
    adverse conclusion of a document not being genuine solely on the  basis
    of spelling mistakes,  typographical  errors,  or  other  discrepancies
    between letters.  There were two possible explanations for  these:  one
    was that the documents were false;  the other was that the  authors  of
    the documents, in the  bank,  had  issued  letters  with  spelling  and
    grammatical errors, and on paper with different  headings.   The  judge
    reached the former conclusion, but the further letter provided from the
    bank, which was not disputed, confirms that the latter explanation  was
    the correct one.

9.   My finding that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  his  approach  to  the
    documents is not directly based on that further letter, however.   That
    letter was not before him. The error was that the judge embarked on his
    own consideration of the documents without notifying the parties, which
    raised a fairness issue; and in addition the judge erred in law in  not
    following the approach set out in RP (proof  of  forgery)  which  would
    have cautioned him against the reaching of a  forgery  finding  without
    proper evidence.  What would have been needed would have been some form
    of document verification report, where a check had been conducted  with
    the bank, as a result of which they had stated that the letter was  not
    genuine.  As is now clear, if such a  check  had  been  conducted,  the
    letters would in fact have been confirmed.

10.  Having indicated that I found there to be a material error of law,  and
    that the findings in the determination therefore stood to be set aside,
    I invited submissions as to whether a remaking of the decision required
    further evidence.

11.  Mr Anisudon, for the appellant, was of the view that there was no  need
    for further evidence.  Mr Bramble, for the respondent, was at first  in
    agreement, but then decided that there was a need for further evidence.



12.  Since the points at issue were narrow, and the matter primarily  rested
    on a consideration of the documentary evidence, I took  the  view  that
    there was no need to adjourn for a  remaking  hearing.   There  was  no
    objection to this course from either party.  As a  result  the  sponsor
    gave evidence, adopting her witness statement of 6 December  2013,  and
    explaining that she had obtained the further letter from the bank after
    showing them a copy of the judge's determination.  She was then  cross-
    examined  by  Mr  Bramble.   I  then  heard   submissions   from   both
    representatives, and reserved my decision.

13.  The cross-examination was  concerned  with  why  the  sponsor  had  not
    obtained the missing bank statement for June 2012, whether the  sponsor
    was still in the same employment, and what the nature of her job was.

14.  Mr Bramble's submissions as to  the  remaking  were  as  follows.   The
    concern about whether the sponsor was working was that one of the three
    payslips was not cross-referenced to a bank statement.  There was still
    no proper explanation as to why this bank statement was  missing.   The
    later payslips and bank statements were post-decision evidence.

15.  The submissions by Mr Anisudon, for the  appellant,  were  as  follows.
    The employer's letter to the Entry Clearance Officer had given the  tax
    office reference number.  It was not unusual  for  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer to make checks in cases of this sort.  The sponsor had produced
    original bank statements and a letter.  The payslips were backed up  by
    bank statements for two months, and the  explanation  for  the  missing
    third bank statement should be accepted on  balance  of  probabilities.
    There was sufficient evidence to find that the maintenance requirements
    had been met.

Decision and Reasons

16.  Having set aside the judge's adverse findings I have decided to  remake
    the decision by allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  As  a
    result, as was agreed between the parties at the hearing, there  is  no
    need to consider Article 8.

17.  The point at issue in the refusal was a narrow one.  Every  aspect  was
    accepted, save for the sponsor's employment income.   The  concerns  in
    the refusal notice were based on a  missing  bank  statement;  spelling
    errors in the letter from the bank explaining why it was  missing;  the
    lack of original bank statements; and the fact that the  payslips  were
    of a  type  that  was  easy  to  reproduce  and  therefore  of  limited
    evidential value.

18.  Having heard from the sponsor, on  the  subject  her  position  at  the
    garage, Mr Bramble,  for  the  respondent,  did  not  make  submissions
    challenging her credibility.  I could see nothing in her evidence about
    the nature of her work, which was at a relatively  small  garage,  that
    suggested that she did not in fact work there.  I have  considered  the
    bank letters in some detail.  Without independent verification evidence
    I would not have found that the two letters were not  genuine,  but  in
    any event there is now a third letter from the bank, which has not been
    challenged, confirming their authenticity, and explaining  the  errors.
    This third letter has been provided well  after  the  refusal,  but  it
    directly concerns letters that were provided with the application,  and
    considered at the date  of  decision,  and  is  therefore  an  item  of
    evidence that is  admissible,  because  it  is  relevant  to  what  the
    situation was at the date of decision.

19.  The only other  challenge  to  the  sponsor's  evidence  concerned  her
    explanation  for  not  having  produced  the  missing  June  2012  bank
    statement.  Her evidence at the hearing before me  was  candid,  namely
    that it had not come to her mind that she needed to submit this.   This
    appeared to me to be credible.  In any event there were three payslips,
    and corresponding payments into the sponsor's bank account for  two  of
    them.  An explanation, supported by a bank  letter,  now  shown  to  be
    genuine, was  provided  to  explain  the  absence  of  the  third  bank
    statement.  On that basis it appears to me to be more likely  than  not
    that the three payslips were genuine, and that the amounts shown in all
    three were in fact paid into the sponsor's bank account.  I accept  the
    submission made on the appellant's behalf that it was open to the Entry
    Clearance Officer to make further checks.  The  issue  of  the  missing
    bank statement appears to me to fall well short of the type of evidence
    that would be required to find that it had  not  been  established,  on
    balance, that the sponsor's income  was  as  claimed  at  the  date  of
    decision.  It is now accepted that original bank statements  have  been
    provided, although it remains disputed as to whether they were provided
    with the application.  The payslips may have been of  a  type  easy  to
    reproduce, but they are supported by the letter  and  bank  statements,
    making them easy to verify.

20.  For these reasons I find  that  the  documentary  evidence,  considered
    alongside the sponsor's oral evidence, does establish,  on  balance  of
    probabilities, that sponsor's income was as  claimed  at  the  date  of
    decision.  It does not ever appear to  have  been  disputed  that  this
    income was sufficient to meet the maintenance requirements.

21.   The  decision  refusing  entry  clearance  on  the  sole   ground   of
    maintenance was therefore not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
    Immigration Rules.

22.  It has not been suggested that there is any need for anonymity in  this
    appeal.  Since sufficient evidence was provided with  the  application,
    and it was open to the respondent to make  any  relevant  enquiries,  I
    have decided that there  is  no  reason  to  depart  from  the  general
    practice of making a whole fee award where an appeal has been  allowed.



Decision

23.  The judge erred in law, in a manner material to the  outcome,  for  the
    reasons given above.  His decision dismissing the appeal  is  therefore
    set aside.

24.  I remake the decision by allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

     In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).  I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee
    Awards in Immigration Appeals (December 2011). I make a whole fee award
    in the sum of �140 for the reasons given above.
