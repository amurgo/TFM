questions set out at the end of it.



                             ORDER FOR REFERENCE
                TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who claims to have arrived in the
    United Kingdom in 1999 as a visitor.  On 2 December 1999, he married an
    Irish national.  They have 2 children.  It was at this moment that time
    commences to run  in  relation  to  the  entitlements  upon  which  the
    appellant now seeks to rely.  On 5 September 2000,  he  was  granted  a
    residence permit permitting him to remain in the United Kingdom as  the
    spouse of an  EEA  citizen  exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The residence permit was expressed to expire  on  5  September
    2005.

 2. On 26 June 2000, upon his  conviction  of  having  intercourse  with  a
    mental patient whilst a member of the hospital staff, the appellant was
    sentenced to 9 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years.  He completed
    the period of suspension without imprisonment.

 3. On 30 September 2003, whilst  passing  through  United  Kingdom  border
    controls from France, the appellant  was  arrested  for  assisting  the
    illegal entry of a passenger in the car in which he was travelling.  He
    was bailed to appear at court but absconded.  He was convicted  of  the
    offence on 18 August 2004.  On 16 September 2004, he was sentenced to 2
    years and 6 months imprisonment.  Between the period  2  December  1999
    (his marriage to a Union citizen/EEA national) and 16 September 2004, a
    period of about 4 years 10 months elapsed, a period just short of  five
    years' residence before imprisonment.

 4. The appellant was released on 16 November 2005. On  18  November  2005,
    the Secretary of State made a decision to make a deportation order.  On
    1 November 2006, the appeal against  deportation  was  allowed  on  the
    basis that the appellant was the husband of an EEA national  exercising
    Treaty rights.

 5. On 26 December 2007 when the appellant's motorcar was stopped,  he  was
    found to be unlawfully in possession of false documentation  for  which
    offence he was convicted on 14  April  2008.  On  8  May  2008  he  was
    sentenced to 2  years  3  months  imprisonment.  The  sentencing  judge
    described the offence as undermining the integrity of identity  in  the
    context of undermining the application process for jobs. It  was  noted
    that, by that time, he had already spent 109 days in custody suggesting
    that he had been in detention  since  sometime  in  January  2008.  The
    period  between  his  release  on  16  November  2005  and   his   next
    imprisonment amounted to about 2 years and 2 months.  He  was  released
    on 6 February 2009, about 2 years  and  9  months  before  the  hearing
    before us.

 6. The Secretary of State made the second decision  to  deport  him  on  6
    February 2009.  By a decision made on 29 June 2010, the Upper  Tribunal
    allowed the appellant's appeal, the Judge  finding  that  although  the
    appellant's wife had exercised Treaty rights between April 1998 and May
    2004 and had therefore acquired a permanent  right  of  residence,  the
    appellant had not because his imprisonment in 2004 prevented its  being
    acquired.  Nevertheless, even on the basis of  the  baseline  level  of
    protection afforded to EEA nationals  and  their  family  members,  the
    Judge  found  the  appellant's  circumstances  outweighed  the   public
    interest in removing on  public  policy  grounds,  notwithstanding  the
    offending.  Following the decision, the appellant  sought  a  permanent
    residence card.

 7. On 24 September 2010, the Secretary of State  refused  his  application
    for a permanent residence card under the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006  (2006  No  1003)  which  implemented  Directive
    2004/38/EC.  That decision gave rise to a right  of  appeal  which  the
    appellant exercised.  The appeal was heard on 20 June 2011.  The  Judge
    found the appellant was entitled to a residence card but not a right of
    permanent  residence  based  on  5  years  continuous  residence.   The
    Secretary of State did not, however, appeal the  Judge's  finding  that
    the appellant was entitled to a residence card.

 8. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal asserting that  the  Judge
    had made an error of law in refusing him the permanent  residence  card
    by reason of the breaks in continuity of residence resulting  from  the
    periods he had spent in prison.  He submitted that the decision of  the
    Grand Chamber in Case C-145/07 Tsakouridis stated that imprisonment did
    not break continuity but was merely a factor to be taken into  account.
    Whilst Tsakouridis was  a  case  dealing  with  the  highest  level  of
    protection afforded to those with a 10-year  period  of  residence,  by
    parity of reasoning, the case also determined the correct  approach  to
    those entitled to a permanent right of residence.  The case came before
    us to decide whether the Judge's approach was legally flawed.

 9. The appellant has never spent a continuous period of  5  years  in  the
    United Kingdom since 2 December 1999 if the periods of his imprisonment
    are excluded from the calculation. It goes without saying that if  they
    are included, the period that has  elapsed  since  his  marriage  on  2
    December 1999 is now in excess of 12 years. We should  add  that  there
    has never been a suggestion in this case that either the  appellant  or
    his spouse has been absent from the United Kingdom so as to break their
    continuity of residence.

10. If the periods of imprisonment are excluded from  calculation  but  the
    periods of physical freedom are aggregated (albeit non-continuous), the
    period is in excess of 5 years.

Case law and Discussion

11. In order to understand the significance of the relevant case law, it is
    important to note that the impact of imprisonment upon the  calculation
    of the period of 5 years residence not only affects the entitlement  to
    a permanent right of residence and the documentation that recognises it
    but also affects the  level  of  protection  against  removal  that  is
    afforded to Union citizens/EEA nationals or their family members  under
    Article 28 of Directive 2004/38/EC, as transposed into  United  Kingdom
    law by reg. 21 of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2006 (2006 No 1003). It is in this context that the issue  has  usually
    been considered both in national and European level.   Reg.  21  is  as
    follows:

         Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
         grounds
         21.-(1) In this regulation  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.
         (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.
         (4) A relevant decision may  not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
              (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
              of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or
              (b) is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
              necessary in his best  interests,  as  provided  for  in  the
              Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the  General
              Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.
         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-
              (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
              proportionality;
              (b) the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
              conduct of the person concerned;
              (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
              represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat
              affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;
              (d) matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
              which relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not
              justify the decision;
              (e) a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
              themselves justify the decision.
         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin.

12. The 2006 Regulations set out three levels of protection; (1) the  basic
    level of protection for anyone who is the subject of  an  EEA  decision
    taken on public policy, public security or public health grounds; (2) a
    higher of protection for a person who has acquired a permanent right of
    residence; for such a person 'serious grounds' have to  be  shown;  and
    (3) the highest level  of  protection  for  a  person  with  10  years'
    residence prior to the relevant decision; for such a person 'imperative
    grounds' have to be shown.   In  respect  of  all  three  (but  clearly
    crucial to a person with only the basic protection) any  decision  must
    comply with the principles set out at paragraphs (5) and (6) above.

13. It is to be noted that persons with a permanent right of residence  may
    include family members of a Union citizen as  well  as  Union  citizens
    themselves, see reg. 15(1)(b).  In  contrast,  the  category  of  those
    entitled to the exception of imperative grounds of public  security  is
    not  stated  to  include  family  members  of  EEA   nationals.    This
    distinction also appears in the Directive, Article 16, paragraph 2  and
    Article 28, paragraphs 2 and 3:


         Article 16
         1. Union citizens who have resided legally for a continuous  period
         of five years in the host Member State  shall  have  the  right  of
         permanent residence there.
         2. Paragraph 1 shall apply also  to  family  members  who  are  not
         nationals of a Member State and have legally resided with the Union
         citizen in the host Member State for a continuous  period  of  five
         years.
         3. Continuity of residence  shall  not  be  affected  by  temporary
         absences not exceeding a total of six months a year, or by absences
         of a longer duration for compulsory military  service,  or  by  one
         absence of a maximum of twelve  consecutive  months  for  important
         reasons such as pregnancy and childbirth, serious illness, study or
         vocational training, or a posting in  another  Member  State  or  a
         third country.
         4. Once acquired, the right of permanent residence  shall  be  lost
         only through absence from  the  host  Member  State  for  a  period
         exceeding two consecutive years.


         Article 28
         1. Before taking an expulsion decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security, the host Member State shall take account
         of considerations such as how long  the  individual  concerned  has
         resided on its territory, his/her age, state of health, family  and
         economic situation, social and cultural integration into  the  host
         Member State and the extent of his/her links with  the  country  of
         origin.
         2. The host Member State may not take an expulsion decision against
         Union  citizens  or   their   family   members,   irrespective   of
         nationality, who have the  right  of  permanent  residence  on  its
         territory, except on serious grounds of  public  policy  or  public
         security.
         3. An expulsion decision may not be taken against  Union  citizens,
         except if the decision is based on  imperative  grounds  of  public
         security, as defined by Member States, if they:


            (a) have resided in the host Member State for the previous  ten
         years...


14. In refusing the appellant's application for a permanent residence card,
    the Secretary of State accepted he  was  a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national.  However, on the basis of  decisions  made  in  the  national
    courts that periods spent in prison do not count for  the  purposes  of
    periods of residency, the Secretary of State decided in her  letter  of
    24 September 2010 that the appellant had  not  resided  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a continuous period of 5 years.

15. It is common ground between the parties that the  consistent  authority
    of the Court of Appeal (by whose decisions we are bound in the  absence
    of supervening CJEU authority) and the Tribunal is that  periods  spent
    in custody do not count towards periods of residence for  the  purposes
    of the Directive or the 2006 domestic Regulations made  in  pursuit  of
    it.  In Carvalho and Omar [2010] EWCA Civ 1406, Maurice  Kay  LJ,  with
    whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated:
    1. Nevertheless, in HR (Portugal) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 371, [2010]  1
       WLR 158, it was held that the same requirement of lawfulness governs
       both  the  5  year  and  the  10  year  qualifying   periods.   This
       assimilation is based on the recitals  to  the  Citizens'  Directive
       which emphasise that the protection  applies  to  persons  who  have
       "availed themselves of the rights and freedoms conferred on them  by
       the Treaty" and "have become  genuinely  integrated  into  the  host
       Member  State"  (recital  23);  and  "the  greater  the  degree   of
       integration of Union citizens and their family members in  the  Host
       Member State, the greater the degree of protection against expulsion
       should be" (recital 24). Stanley Burnton LJ said (at paragraph 21):
       "... These recitals show that what was intended was a progression in
       the  restrictions  on  expulsion,  depending  on   the   degree   of
       integration of a person in the country in which  he  is  present  as
       demonstrated by the duration of his residence  in  the  exercise  of
       Treaty rights."
    1. Thus, "legally" means "in the exercise of the  rights  and  freedoms
       conferred by the Treaty".
16. The Upper Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  applied  these
    principles in Ogunyemi (Imprisonment breaks  continuity  of  residence)
    [2010] UKUT 164 (IAC).

17. Whilst the appellant accepts the authority  of  the  decisions  in  the
    Court of Appeal, he submits that these authorities have been undermined
    by the decision of the Court of Justice  in  Tsakouridis  [2010]  EUECJ
    Case C-145/09; [2011] Imm AR 276 given on 23 November  2010.   Carvalho
    and Omar was heard in the Court of  Appeal  on  16  November  2010  but
    judgment  was  not  given  until  14  December  2010,  that  is   after
    Tsakouridis had been published.  However, neither Carvalho and Omar nor
    Ogunyemi in 2011 makes reference to Tsakouridis.

18. In order to consider this point fully, it is necessary to  examine  the
    facts upon which the decision in Tsakouridis was made.   The  case  was
    classified as one involving a Union citizen who had resided in  Germany
    for  the  past  10  years,  thereby  engaging  the  highest  level   of
    protection,  namely  whether  the  decision  could  only  be  made   on
    imperative grounds of public security.  Whilst it may be that different
    considerations might be held to apply  to  10-year  cases,  Tsakouridis
    provides the Court of  Justice's  thinking  so  far  on  the  issue  of
    duration.

19. Mr Tsakouridis was a Greek national, born in Germany on 1  March  1978,
    and was aged 32 when the CJEU made its decision.  In  October  2001  he
    acquired a permanent residence permit in Germany.  From March  to  mid-
    October 2004, a period of about 9 months, he ran a pancake stall on the
    island of Rhodes in Greece. He then returned to Germany. In mid-October
    2005 he travelled to Rhodes and resumed running the pancake  stall.  On
    22 November 2005 the Amtsgericht  Stuttgart  (Local  Court,  Stuttgart)
    issued an international arrest warrant against him. On 19 November 2006
    he was arrested on Rhodes having spent  13  months  voluntarily  absent
    from Germany and was  transferred  to  Germany  on  19  March  2007  in
    custody.  His total absence amounted to some 16 months.

20. Mr Tsakouridis was subsequently convicted by the Landgericht  Stuttgart
    (Regional Court, Stuttgart) on 28 August 2007 on 8  counts  of  illegal
    dealing in substantial quantities of narcotics as part of an  organised
    group.  He was sentenced to 6 � years imprisonment.

21. By decision  of  19  August  2008,  the  Regierungspr�sidium  Stuttgart
    (Regional Administration, Stuttgart), determined  that  Mr  Tsakouridis
    had lost his right of residence in Germany and was liable to  expulsion
    to  Greece  on  'imperative  grounds  of  public  security'.  The  high
    threshold applied by the Regierungspr�sidium reflected the fact that he
    had resided in Germany for in excess of 10 years  and  benefitted  from
    enhanced  protection.  The  Regierungspr�sidium  considered  that   the
    interference with Mr Tsakouridis' private and family life was justified
    in the interests of  the  prevention  of  disorder  and  expulsion  was
    proportionate.

22.  Mr  Tsakouridis  brought  proceedings  before  the  Verwaltungsgericht
    Stuttgart (Administrative Court, Stuttgart) against the decision of the
    Regierungspr�sidium, relying on the fact that most of his  family  were
    living in Germany and the loss of his right of entry to, and  residence
    in, Germany was  disproportionate.  The  Verwaltungsgericht  held  that
    there were no  'imperative  grounds  of  public  security'  to  justify
    expulsion.  However, on appeal,  the  Higher  Administrative  Court  of
    Baden-W�rttemberg referred a  series  of  questions  to  the  Court  of
    Justice for a preliminary ruling.  They included:


         '2.      Under what conditions can the right to enhanced protection
         against expulsion achieved following 10 years of residence  in  the
         host Member State  laid  down  in  Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
         2004/38 subsequently be lost? Is the condition for the loss of  the
         right of permanent residence laid down  in  Article  16(4)  of  the
         directive to be applied mutatis mutandis in that context?
         3.      If Question 2 is answered in the affirmative  and  Article
         16(4) of the directive applies mutatis mutandis:  is  the  enhanced
         protection  against  expulsion  lost  by  lapse  of   time   alone,
         irrespective of the reasons for the absence?
         4.      Also if Question 2 is  answered  in  the  affirmative  and
         Article 16(4) of the directive  applies  mutatis  mutandis:  is  an
         enforced return to the host Member State in the context of criminal
         proceedings  before  expiry  of  the  two-year  period  capable  of
         maintaining the right to  enhanced  protection  against  expulsion,
         even where following that return the fundamental freedoms cannot be
         exercised for a considerable time?'

23. In its judgment, the Court of Justice noted that  Article  28(3)(a)  of
    Directive 2004/38, while making the enjoyment  of  enhanced  protection
    subject to the person's presence in  the  Member  State  for  10  years
    preceding  the  expulsion  measure,  was  largely  silent  as  to   the
    circumstances which are capable of interrupting the period of 10 years'
    residence for the purposes of the acquisition of the right to  enhanced
    protection against expulsion laid down in that  provision.   The  Court
    said:
         "30      Starting  from  the  premise  that,  like  the  right  of
         permanent  residence,  enhanced  protection  is  acquired  after  a
         certain length of residence  in  the  host  Member  State  and  can
         subsequently be lost, the referring court considers that it may  be
         possible to apply by analogy  the  criteria  in  Article  16(4)  of
         Directive 2004/38.
         31      While recitals 23 and 24  in  the  preamble  to  Directive
         2004/38 certainly refer to special protection for persons  who  are
         genuinely integrated into the host Member State, in particular when
         they were born there and have spent all their life there, the  fact
         remains that, in view of the wording of Article  28(3)(a)  of  that
         directive, the decisive criterion is whether the Union citizen  has
         lived in that Member State for the 10 years preceding the expulsion
         decision.
         32      As to the question of the extent to which absences from the
         host Member State during the period referred to in Article 28(3)(a)
         of Directive 2004/38, namely the 10 years preceding the decision to
         expel the person concerned,  prevent  him  from  enjoying  enhanced
         protection, an overall assessment must  be  made  of  the  person's
         situation on each occasion at the precise time when the question of
         expulsion arises.
         33      The national authorities responsible for applying  Article
         28(3) of Directive 2004/38 are required to take all  the  relevant
         factors into consideration in each individual case,  in  particular
         the duration of each period of absence from the host Member  State,
         the cumulative duration and the frequency of  those  absences,  and
         the reasons why the person concerned left the host Member State. It
         must be ascertained whether those absences involve the transfer  to
         another State of the centre of the personal, family or occupational
         interests of the person concerned.
         34      The fact that the person in question has been the  subject
         of a forced return to the host Member State in  order  to  serve  a
         term of imprisonment there  and  the  time  spent  in  prison  may,
         together with the factors listed in  the  preceding  paragraph,  be
         taken into account as part of the overall assessment  required  for
         determining whether the integrating links  previously  forged  with
         the host Member State have been broken.
         35      It is for the national court to assess whether that is the
         case in the main proceedings. If  that  court  were  to  reach  the
         conclusion that Mr Tsakouridis's  absences  from  the  host  Member
         State are not  such  as  to  prevent  him  from  enjoying  enhanced
         protection, it would then have to  examine  whether  the  expulsion
         decision was based on imperative grounds of public security  within
         the meaning of Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38."

24. From the above, it would appear that Tsakouridis was not a  case  about
    acquiring rights by reason of residence in the host  state  but  losing
    rights to the 10-year imperative grounds protection  thus  acquired  by
    absence from it.  It was permissible  in  this  context  to  apply  the
    provisions in  Article  16.3  and  16.4  above  (which  deal  with  the
    acquisition of rights derived from continuous  residence)  as  shedding
    light on the circumstances  where  continuity  of  residence  might  be
    broken by absence.  Importantly, although Mr Tsakouridis was  sentenced
    to 6  �  years  imprisonment,  this  period  did  not  feature  in  the
    consideration provided by the Court of Justice.  This  was  because  it
    had already been found he  had  resided  in  the  host  country  for  a
    substantial period (plainly longer than 10 years)  and  the  Court  was
    considering whether the periods  of  absence  from  Germany  broke  the
    continuity of residence prior to his imprisonment sufficient to  engage
    the highest level of protection.

25. The break in the continuity of presence was predicated on  a  departure
    from the host country, not remaining within it whilst serving a  prison
    sentence.   Thus  Tsakouridis  does  not  deal  with  the   effect   of
    imprisonment in the host country as a means of breaking  continuity  in
    other circumstances.

26. The principal point made in Tsakouridis was that it is for the national
    court to determine what  constitutes  a  break  in  the  continuity  of
    residence, applying the words of the Directive that short periods, such
    as an absence of not more than 6 months a  year  do  not  automatically
    break continuity and that longer breaks up to  maximum of 12 months are
    justifiable where particularly good or important reasons  are  provided
    or even longer where the claimant is required by his  national  law  to
    perform national service.  These examples cover  breaks  in  continuity
    for which the claimant may be excused without  any  misconduct  on  his
    part being raised against him - temporary absence,  health,  vocational
    training, a foreign posting or where he is  required  to  leave  (e.g.,
    national service),  but  they  shed  little  light  on  the  impact  of
    imprisonment.

27. Since the decision in Tsakouridis and the hearing of the appeal  before
    us, the Court of Justice has considered the concept of lawful residence
    in the context of Article 16 of the Directive.  In Ziolkowski  (Freedom
    of movement for persons) [2011] EUECJ Case C-424/10 (21 December 2011),
    the Court concluded in paragraphs 46 and 47 that the concept  of  legal
    residence implied by the terms 'have resided legally' in Article  16(1)
    of Directive 2004/38  should  be  construed  as  meaning  a  period  of
    residence  which  complies  with  the  conditions  laid  down  in   the
    Directive, in particular those set out in Article 7(1).   Consequently,
    a period of residence which complies with the law of a Member State but
    does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 7(1) of  Directive
    2004/38 could not be regarded as a 'legal' period of  residence  within
    the meaning of Article 16(1).

28. This decision is consistent with the decision of the English  Court  of
    Appeal in Okafor & Ors v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 499 (20  April  2011)  in
    which Thomas LJ, with whom the other Lord Justices  agreed,  considered
    the case of a wife and mother, a Union citizen, who before her death in
    2007, had not fulfilled the conditions in  Article  7(1)  and  was  not
    therefore a "qualified person" within the meaning of reg. 6 of  the  UK
    Regulations which transposed the Directive. After the  mother's  death,
    the father and the children remained lawfully in  the  United  Kingdom;
    the period of five years for which  their  residence  permit  had  been
    granted expired, in accordance with its terms, on 26  June  2008.   The
    appellants contended that both the father and the children  could  rely
    upon Article 16 and the fact that they had "resided legally" with Union
    citizens "for a continuous period of five  years  in  the  host  Member
    State" and thereby acquired the right of permanent residence. The Court
    of Appeal rejected that submission, stating that it was not tenable  to
    suggest that if a person managed to stay in a Member State  beyond  the
    period of five years, even though he has no right under  the  Directive
    to permanent residence, Article 16 provided a self-standing right.  The
    lawful residence contemplated  by  Article  16  of  the  Directive  was
    residence which complied with Community law requirements  specified  in
    the Directive and did not cover residence lawful  under  domestic  law.
    Accordingly, the father  and  the  children  had  no  rights  of  legal
    residence under EU law which gave rise to rights under  Article  16  to
    permanent residence.


29. More recently still, the Tribunal in Jarusevicius (EEA Reg 21 -  effect
    of imprisonment) [2012]  UKUT  120  (IAC)  considered  the  case  of  a
    Lithuanian citizen who had been convicted of a highly organised  scheme
    for the disposal of stolen vehicles.  The appellant  had  not  spent  a
    continuous period of 5  years  in  the  United  Kingdom  prior  to  his
    imprisonment and had not acquired a right of permanent residence  under
    the Directive. The Tribunal decided that Tsakouridis  neither  required
    nor entitled  the  Tribunal  to  reach  a  different  conclusion.   The
    Tribunal continued:

        "59.     In our judgment all the cases  cited  draw  a  distinction
             between acquisition of the right to reside permanently and  the
             loss of that right. The learning  from  the  Court  of  Justice
             suggests that:-

          i) once a right of permanent residence has accrued it is not  lost
             by a remand in custody or a short sentence  or  a  sequence  of
             them (Nazli [2000] ECR 1-957, Dogan [2005] ECR 1-6237);
         ii) prison is not to be equated to voluntary unemployment  that may
             lead to loss of worker status and the  loss  of  continuity  of
             lawful residence for the purpose  of  acquiring  the  right  of
             permanent residence  (Orfanopolous  and  Oliveri  [2004]  ECR-1
             5257);
        iii) the continuity of residence  for  the  purpose  of   regulation
             21(4)(a) (ten years residence)  is not broken by  a  period  of
             imprisonment (Tsakouridis).


        60.      This may mean that the conclusions of the decisions of the
             AIT in LG and CC (Italy)  [2009]  UKAIT  00024  and  the  Upper
             Tribunal  of  the  IAC  in  Ogunyemi  (imprisonment  breaks   -
             continuity of residence) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00164 (IAC)  (also
             called SO) that in addition to not counting  towards  the  five
             year period, prison also broke the continuity of residence  for
             that period may have to be re-examined.  It  is  one  thing  to
             conclude that a period spent serving a sentence of imprisonment
             is not lawful residence for the  purpose  of  acquiring  an  EU
             right of residence, it  is  another  to  conclude  that  lawful
             residence prior to such a sentence could not be aggregated with
             lawful residence after service of it. It is  difficult  to  see
             why  if  such  a  period  of  imprisonment   does   not   break
             "continuous" residence for the purpose of regulation 21 (4)(a),
             it should do so for the purpose  of  15(1)(a).  Equally  it  is
             difficult to reconcile the conclusion of the AIT in LG  and  CC
             that service of a sentence of  imprisonment  in  the  10  years
             before the decision to deport prevents the  greater  protection
             of "imperative grounds" arising, with  the  conclusion  of  the
             CJEU in Tsakouridis reached on the basis that it  could.  In  a
             case where this issue is central to  the  outcome,  it  may  be
             necessary to consider whether the UT is able to reach  its  own
             conclusion on the matter, or should make  a  reference  to  the
             CJEU or is bound by a Court  of  Appeal  decision  pending  any
             reference that is made by that court."


30. There are a number of competing arguments in relation to the impact  of
    imprisonment on a period of residence in the host state.   On  the  one
    hand, imprisonment does not result in absence from the host  state  but
    it subverts the underlying purpose  of  the  Directive,  that  is,  the
    acquisition of rights as a result of an increasing integration into the
    host  state  by  developing  positive  social,  domestic  and   working
    relationships within it.  None of these aims is achieved by  serving  a
    term of imprisonment as  a  result  of  misconduct  which  itself  runs
    directly contrary to the development of a positive engagement with  the
    host country.  This is the point made by Maurice Kay LJ in the  extract
    provided in  paragraph  9  of  this  determination  with  reference  to
    recitals 23 and 24 of the Directive.


31. On the other hand, it might be thought that the touchstone of residence
    is being physically present in the United Kingdom and a person  serving
    a sentence in the United Kingdom inevitably remains present  here.   It
    might seem a curious result if a person who has spent, say, 20 years in
    a British prison has never been resident in the United  Kingdom  during
    his period of imprisonment.


32. The facts of this appellant's appeal can be summarised in this way:

        i)             The  period  of  residence  here  exercising  Treaty
           rights from 2 December 1999 (his marriage to a Union citizen/EEA
           national) and 16 September 2004 lasted 4 years and 10 months.
       ii) The period between his release on 16 November 2005 and his  next
           detention in January 2008 (sentenced 14 April 2008) amounted  to
           2 years and 2 months.
      iii) He was next released on 6 February 2009.
       iv) The Secretary of State's decision to make  a  deportation  order
           against him was made on 18 March 2009, after a further month  of
           residence.  His appeal against deportation was allowed on  basic
           protection grounds, that is, on public policy grounds.
        v) If these periods of residence are aggregated, excluding the time
           in prison, they amount to a period in excess of 7  years.   That
           period is more than the 5 years residence required for  a  right
           of permanent residence, (Article 16(2) and 28(2)).
       vi) Even if the periods of residence if aggregated exceed  5  years,
           there is not a continuous period of 5 years.
      vii) If the period of imprisonment is  included  as  a  part  of  the
           appellant's period of residence, the appellant had spent 9 years
           and 3 months by  the  time  the  Secretary  of  State  made  the
           decision under appeal.
     viii) A period of more  than  10  years  has  now  elapsed  since  his
           marriage if the period of imprisonment is included.
       ix) The appellant has spent a total of  3  years  and  3  months  in
           prison.


33. We consider that, as a result of the decision in Tsakouridis it  is  no
    longer clear whether imprisonment breaks continuity  of  residence  for
    the purposes of acquiring the benefit of the higher (or highest)  level
    of protection based upon 5 (or 10) years' residence.  We conclude  that
    a clear understanding of the EU law provisions is necessary for  us  to
    determine this appeal.

34. In deciding whether to make such a reference we have had regard to  the
    Note on references  from  national  courts  for  a  preliminary  ruling
    (2011/C 160/01, 28 May 2011).

35. We conclude:

       (i)     The facts of this present case have been determined  by  the
            First-tier Tribunal.

       (ii) The EU law issue will be determinative of the  approach  to  be
            adopted by the  national  courts  in  relation  to  whether  the
            appellant has acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence  but,
            incidentally, the level of protection to be  provided  to  Union
            citizens or their family members, one of whom has been sentenced
            to a period of imprisonment.

       (iii)   The issue is a familiar one and has been the  subject  of  a
            series of decisions made by the courts and tribunals in  England
            and Wales.

       (iv) Whilst the decisions of the national courts and  tribunals  are
            clear pre-Tsakouridis, the subsequent decision of the  Court  of
            Justice in  Tsakouridis  raises  questions  which  the  Tribunal
            cannot confidently resolve.  In Jarusevicius, the Upper Tribunal
            found it difficult to reconcile the conclusion of the AIT in  LG
            and CC with the  conclusion  of  the  CJEU  in  Tsakouridis  and
            suggested that, where the issue was central to the  outcome,  it
            might be necessary to consider making a reference to the CJEU.

       (v)   We sent out an earlier  version  of  this  determination  and
            invited and received submissions on it and the questions we were
            minded to pose in a reference.  None of the parties has  opposed
            the making of a reference.

36. Accordingly we have decided to make an order for  a  reference  to  the
    CJEU on the issues of Community law on which we need  assistance.   The
    questions are annexed to this reference as a Schedule.

        SCHEDULE OF QUESTIONS TO BE REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE


 i) In what circumstances, if any, will a period of imprisonment constitute
    legal residence for the purposes of  the  acquisition  of  a  permanent
    right of residence under Article 16 of the Citizens Directive 2004/38?

ii) If a period of imprisonment does not qualify as legal residence,  is  a
    person who has served a period of imprisonment permitted  to  aggregate
    periods of residence before and after his imprisonment for the purposes
    of calculating the period of 5  years  needed  to  establish  permanent
    right of residence under the Directive?
