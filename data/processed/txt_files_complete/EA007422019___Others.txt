Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms E Rutherford, instructed by Syeds Law Office,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan who were  born  on  24  January
    1960, 29 January 1993  and  16  March  1989  respectively.   The  first
    appellant ("A1") is the mother of the second and third appellants ("A2"
    and "A3").

 2. On 28 October 2018, the appellants  each  applied  for  an  EEA  family
    permit under reg 12 of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2016  (SI
    2016/1052 as amended) ("the EEA Regulations").

 3. A1 applied on the basis that  she  was  a  "family  member"  of  Judith
    Kovacs, a Hungarian citizen (an EEA national) exercising Treaty  rights
    in the UK (the "sponsor") who is married  to  A1's  son.   As  such  A1
    claimed she was a "dependent" direct relative in the ascending line  of
    an EEA national's spouse (reg 7(1)(c)).   A2  and  A3  applied  on  the
    basis that they were "extended family members"  ("EFMs")  as  dependent
    relatives (sisters-in-law) of the sponsor, an EEA national (reg  8(2)).



 4.  On  19  December  2018,  the  ECO  refused  each  of  the  appellants'
    applications.  Principally, he was not satisfied that the sponsor was a
    "qualified person".  He was not satisfied that she was working or self-
    employed in the UK.  Further,  the  ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor (and, so far as relevant, A1's son) were financially supporting
    the appellants and, therefore, they were dependent upon the sponsor  as
    required by regs 7(1)(c) and 8(2) of the EEA Regulations.

 5. The appellants appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Sharma on 14  October  2019.   In  the  course  of  that
    hearing, the judge considered the documentary  evidence  and  also  the
    evidence of the sponsor who gave oral evidence at the hearing.

 6. The only live issue before the judge was whether the  appellants  could
    establish their dependency upon the sponsor (and A1's son).  Before the
    judge, the Presenting Officer accepted that that  was  the  only  issue
    arising under the EEA Regulations.  Accordingly, it was  accepted  that
    the sponsor was a "qualified  person"  for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

 7. The judge was not satisfied that the appellants were dependent upon the
    sponsor.  Although he accepted that the sponsor (and A1's son) had made
    financial payments to the appellants since 8 November 2017 (although he
    did not accept the evidence  that  payments  had  been  made  earlier),
    nevertheless the judge was not satisfied on  the  evidence  that  these
    payments were to meet the  "essential  needs"  of  the  appellants  and
    consequently he was not satisfied they were dependent upon the  sponsor
    and he dismissed their appeals.

 8. The appellants were granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge R J Pooler) on 10 February 2020.

 9. The error of law hearing was listed before me at Cardiff Civil  Justice
    Centre on  6 August  2020  and,  following  a  remote  hearing,  in  a
    determination sent on 4 September 2020 I concluded that the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision involved the making of an error of law  and  I  set
    that decision aside.

10. The appeal, with the agreement of the  parties,  was  adjourned  to  be
    relisted before me in order to remake the decision on the single  issue
    in dispute, namely whether the payments made  by  the  sponsor  to  the
    appellants were in order to meet their  "basic"  or  "essential"  needs
    following Lim v Entry Clearance Officer, Manila [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1383
    and so established the required dependency under reg 7(1)(c)  (for  A1)
    and reg 8(2) (for A2 and A3) of the EEA Regulations.

11. The resumed hearing was again listed before me  at  the  Cardiff  Civil
    Justice Centre on 22 October 2020.  The appeal was heard remotely  with
    Ms Rutherford, who represented  the  appellants  and  Mr  Howells,  who
    represented the ECO taking part in the hearing remotely  by  Skype  for
    Business.

12. The appellants relied upon new evidence contained  in  a  supplementary
    bundle which Mr Howells accepted should be remitted under  rule  15(2A)
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2689  as
    amended).  That bundle contained a detailed witness statement  from  Mr
    Khurram Shehzad who is A!'s son and the  brother  of  A2  and  A3.   In
    addition, there were affidavits from each of the appellants  dated  and
    signed 16 October 2020.  Also included in the  bundle  were  copies  of
    Halifax bank statements from the sponsor covering the period 1 June  to
    27 July 2020 and a Barclay's bank statement in respect of  the  sponsor
    and Mr Shehzad covering the period 1 August 2019 to 23 September  2020.



13. In addition, Mr Shehzad briefly gave oral evidence in which he  adopted
    his witness statement.  He confirmed that he and his wife sent money to
    the appellants.  Prior to 2016, they had been sent through a person  in
    Birmingham in cash.  Since 2016-2017, the money had been  sent  through
    bank accounts.  Mr Howells took  Mr  Shehzad  to  the  bank  statements
    relating to his wife's account and their joint account and  Mr  Shehzad
    confirmed transactions on those accounts  were  payments  made  to  the
    appellants (into A1's bank account) as a result of transfer  through  a
    third party transfer organisations.  He explained that  the  sums  were
    greater than the ï¿½200 per month.  He said that was  necessary  to  meet
    their  basic  needs  because  the  appellants  were  living  in   their
    grandfather's house and it had  been  agreed  in  the  family  that  Mr
    Shehzad would buy the property from the family so that they could enjoy
    the proceeds.

14. Having  heard  Mr  Shehzad  give  evidence  and  following  his  cross-
    examination, Mr Howells conceded on the basis of  the  new  documentary
    evidence, the appellants' affidavits  and  the  oral  evidence  he  had
    heard, that the money sent by the sponsor and Mr Shehzad  had  been  to
    meet the "basic" or "essential" needs of the appellants and  that  they
    had, therefore, established that they were dependent upon  the  sponsor
    as required by the EEA  Regulations.   Mr  Howells  conceded  that  the
    appellants' appeals should be allowed.

15. I agree with that concession.  The judge accepted that the sponsor  had
    made financial payments to the appellants since 8 November 2017 and, on
    the basis of the more recent evidence, I  accept  that  those  payments
    have continued and that they are in order to meet  the  "essential"  or
    "basic" needs of the appellants who plainly have no  other  sources  of
    income.   They  have,  therefore,   established   on   a   balance   of
    probabilities that they are dependent upon the sponsor as  required  by
    regs 7(1)(c) and 8(2) of the EEA Regulations.

16. Consequently, as that was the only  issue  under  the  EEA  Regulations
    which was in dispute, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that
    A1 is a "family member" of an EEA national's spouse under  reg  7(1)(c)
    and A2 and A3 are EFMs under reg 8(2) of the EEA Regulations.

17. A1 is a "family member".  It is accepted that the remaining requirement
    for the issue of a family permit under reg 12(1) are satisfied.  A1 is,
    accordingly, entitled to be issued  with  a  family  permit  under  reg
    12(1).

18. A2 and A3 are EFMs and they meet the substantive  requirements  of  reg
    12(4).  That provision states that an  ECO  may  issue  an  EEA  family
    permit to individuals such as A2 and A3 where it is appropriate  to  do
    so.  The exercise of that discretion is for the ECO to determine but no
    matters were raised before me, and Mr Howells  did  not  suggest  there
    were any such matters, that would justify the exercise of discretion so
    as to refuse to issue A2 and A3 with EEA family permits  to  come  with
    their mother, A1 to join the sponsor and their brother in the UK.

Decision

19. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  each  of  the
    appellants' appeals involved the making of an  error  of  law  and  the
    decisions were set aside by my decision sent on 4 September 2020.

20. I now remake the decision in each appeal.  The appeals are  allowed  on
    the basis set out in paras 17 and 18 above.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                             26 October 2020


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed each of the appeals, and despite there being new  evidence
relied upon, in all the circumstances I consider it  to  be  appropriate  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee that  has  been  paid  or  which  the
appellants are liable to pay.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
