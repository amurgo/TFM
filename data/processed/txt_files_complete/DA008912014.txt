Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Lingajothy
For the Respondent:    Mr Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer,


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a national of Nigeria, challenges the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Trevaskis sent on 1 September 2015 dismissing
    his appeal against the decision by the respondent on 25 April  2014  to
    make a deportation order by virtue of s.32(5) of  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007.  This decision was made  in  view  of  the  appellant's  criminal
    record.  On 28 October 2011 the appellant was convicted of four  counts
    of robbery and one count of possessing  an  imitation  firearm.   On  2
    December 2011 he was sentenced to a total of seven years' imprisonment.



2.   The appellant arrived in the UK on 13 April 2002  as  an  unaccompanied
    minor aged approximately 13ï¿½.   The  asylum  application  he  made  was
    refused but he was granted  ELR  until  5  November  2006.   Subsequent
    applications by him for ILR were refused.  On 27 October  2011  he  was
    served with notice that he was an overstayer  and  on  28  October  (as
    already noted) he was sentenced to seven  years'  imprisonment.   By  a
    letter dated 30 July 2013  the  appellant  had  been  notified  of  his
    liability to deportation under s.72 of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002.  The decision to make  a  deportation  order  set  out
    reasons why he was subject to a s.72 certificate,  why  his  claim  for
    asylum, humanitarian protection and Article 3 ECHR were  being  refused
    and why he could not succeed under either the Immigration Rules  or  on
    an exceptional circumstances basis.   The  appellant's  appeal  against
    refusal of his claim was dismissed on 12 September 2014  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Miller.

3.   The respondent had previously served the appellant  with  a  notice  of
    liability to deport and a decision to deport on 29 April 2014.  At that
    stage the basis of his asylum claim was that he was a  gay  Muslim  who
    feared that on return to Nigeria he would face forcible recruitment  by
    Boko Haram.  Part of his evidence was that his father was  a  prominent
    Christian pastor who had been killed by Islamic  extremists.   The  FtT
    Judge  heard  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  his  mother.   Judge
    Trevaskis upheld the s.72 certificate and dismissed the appeal  on  the
    basis of his claims for asylum  and/or  humanitarian  protection.   The
    judge also decided to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds.  At paragraphs 101-102 the judge stated:

         "101.    I have considered the medical evidence which the appellant
                has relied upon in support of his  appeal.   The  appellants
                medical conditions do not  reach  the  very  high  threshold
                required to render his removal from  the  United  Kingdom  a
                breach of articles 2 and/or  3  ECHR,  which  would  require
                demonstration that his removal would almost certainly result
                in his  death,  due  to  the  lack  of  appropriate  medical
                treatment  in  Nigeria.   There  is   evidence   which   the
                respondent relies, which shows that treatment is  available,
                which is appropriate to the appellant's claimed needs.


         102. I have also considered the medical issues in conjunction  with
                any other issues  raised  under  articles  2,  3  and/or  8,
                excluding those matters which  fall  to  be  disregarded  by
                virtue of section 72 (2) NI&A Act.  I have  found  that  the
                appellant does not have family life in  the  United  Kingdom
                which engages article 8.  Although  his  private  life  does
                engage article 8, I have  found  that  it  would  not  be  a
                disproportionate interference with that private life for him
                to be removed.  I further find that there are no aspects  of
                his private life, in conjunction with his medical and mental
                health  issues,   which   would   together   amount   to   a
                disproportionate interference.  Neither do I find that those
                factors in conjunction would render his removal a breach  of
                articles 2 and/or 3."

4.   The grounds of appeal contended that the judge  had  failed  to  assess
    the appellant's Articles 3 and 2 ECHR rights in relation to  the  issue
    of whether the appellant would be safe on return to Nigeria.  The judge
    was said to have wrongly focused just on Articles 2 and 3  in  relation
    to the appellant's medical condition.  There had been no assessment  of
    the appellant's  subjective  fears  concerning  Nigeria.   The  grounds
    avowed that the judge ignored the fact that  "those  involved  in  [the
    appellant's] father's assassination have gained strength".   The  judge
    was also said  to  have  disregarded  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    conversion to Islam and his reconversion to Christianity would make him
    a vulnerable person, as in the eyes of his persecutors he would now  be
    regarded as an apostate.

5.   Challenges were also  made  as  to  the  judge's  assessment  that  the
    appellant's past criminal convictions meant that he posed a  threat  to
    the wider society, when his post conviction behaviour  demonstrated  an
    entirely different view.  The appellant should have been regarded as  a
    credible witness because he pleaded guilty during the  criminal  trial.
    The judge's Article 8 assessment was also said to be flawed because  he
    failed to take account  of  all  relevant  facts,  including  that  the
    appellant came to the UK as  a  young  boy  and  his  father  had  been
    assassinated by a Nigeria-based extremist group and  he  had  lost  all
    ties with Nigeria and he had  debilitating  psycho-medical  conditions,
    all of which amounted to "very  compelling  circumstances"  within  the
    meaning of s.117C(6) of the 2002 Act.

6.   Permission to appeal was refused by a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  but
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Blum limited to the ground  challenging
    the judge's failure  to  assess  risks  the  appellant  may  face  from
    extremists.

7.   At the hearing Mr Lingajothy and Mr Norton made submissions  and  I  am
    grateful to both of them for their amplification  of  their  respective
    arguments as set out in the grounds and in  the  respondent's  Rule  24
    notice.

8.   Whilst persuaded that the FtT Judge erred in law, I  am  not  persuaded
    that his error constituted a material error.

9.   Nowhere in the determination does the  judge  address  the  appellant's
    expressed fears about risk on return to Nigeria,  notwithstanding  that
    the appellant gave evidence about his fears and that  his  Counsel  (Mr
    Lingajothy on that occasion as well) made submissions  regarding  these
    fears.   It  may  be  that  because  the  thrust  of  Mr   Lingajothy's
    submissions dwelt on the medical circumstances and the Article 8 issues
    that the judge inferred that the other grounds were not  being  pursued
    with any vigour, but that does not excuse the evident failure  to  make
    any findings on risk on return.

10.  However, it would not be correct to  set  aside  the  judge's  decision
    unless I was satisfied that this error was capable of having a material
    effect on the outcome of the appeal.  I fail to see this was  any  such
    error.  In this regard it is important to have regard to three  matters
    in particular.

11.  First, the appellant's claim regarding risk arising to him due  to  his
    father's killing by  religious  extremists  had  been  addressed  in  a
    relatively recent judicial decision.  In  the  determination  by  Judge
    Miller in September 2014 it was stated at [40]-[41] as follows:

         "40. With regard to his claim for asylum, the evidence for which is
             obviously also relevant to any claim under  Articles  2  or  3
             ECHR or humanitarian protection, the Appellant has  relied  on
             various matters.  His principal concerns, it has to  be  said,
             initially appeared to relate to the fact  that  he  claims  to
             have no family in Nigeria and, as he said  in  his  statement,
             dated the 5th March 2012, (H20): "I would not  know  where  to
             start from".  He also, of course, stated that at that time  he
             was concerned because  his  father  and  stepmother  had  been
             killed and "there is a lot of terrorism in the area where I am
             from".  - However, and this was  accepted  by  the  Appellant,
             Nigeria is a very large country indeed, with  areas  differing
             greatly with regard to religious affiliation, and,  given  his
             age, and the fact that he is a single man, I see no reason why
             he should not be able to relocate if, for instance, he did not
             wish to live in one particular area.  I am unable to find  any
             significance in the fact that his father was allegedly killed.
              I fail to see how this would impact upon him, as it does  not
             appear to arise out of a family feud.


         41.  With regard to the risk  of  terrorism,  again,  there  is  no
             reason why the Appellant should have to live in  a  particular
             area, if (and there  is  no  evidence  to  substantiate  this)
             living in such an  area  might  lead  to  his  being  forcibly
             recruited to a group such as Boko Haram.  It is now, moreover,
             two and a half years since he made the  statement.   Were  his
             concerns serious, I would have expected  there  to  have  been
             some evidence produced to support them."

12.  That determination was before Judge Trevaskis and from  Judge  Miller's
    decision  it  can  be  seen  that  even  on  the  assumption  that  the
    appellant's evidence about  his  father's  assassination  was  accepted
    credible, it was considered he would have a viable internal  relocation
    alternative because Nigeria was a very large country.

13.  Secondly, in the Reasons for Refusal Letter accompanying  the  decision
    under  challenge  in  this  appeal,  the  respondent  had  set  out  in
    considerable detail  relevant  extracts  from  the  Country  of  Origin
    Information Service (COIS) Report for Nigeria dated 17 June  2013.  The
    extracts summarized highlighted, inter alia, that  Christians  make  up
    around 40% of the population of Nigeria  which  comprises  170  million
    inhabitants and that although the majority of Christians  live  in  the
    south, significant Christian communities have resided and  intermarried
    with Muslims in the north for more than 50 years.  The tensions between
    the  Muslim  majority  north  and  its  Christian-majority  south  were
    recorded  as  fuelling  periodic  sectarian  conflicts.   At  [36]  the
    respondent concluded that it was in line with  the  objective  evidence
    for the appellant to  relocate  in  safety  to  another  region  within
    Nigeria.

14.  It is fair to say  that  the  respondent's  assessment  at  this  stage
    focused on the appellant's claim to  be  Muslim  and  it  was  in  that
    context that areas of possible safe relocation included "the  north  of
    the country which  is  predominantly  Muslim",  but  the  body  of  COI
    evidence identified made clear that there would  equally  be  available
    safe areas for Christian returnees.

15.  Thirdly the  documentary  evidence  before  FtT  Judge  Trevaskis,  did
    contain more up-to-date information, which included evidence concerning
    the activities of Boko Haram but  none  of  that  indicated  that  this
    organisation, on its own or together with other Islamic extremists, had
    anything like an effective countrywide network or were ordinarily in  a
    position to pose a significant threat to southern areas where there was
    a strong Christian majority.

16.  Fourth, on the appellant's own account the killing of his  father  (and
    stepmother) had occurred in 2002 and indeed his mother was said to have
    returned to his home area for a week to bury his father's remains.  The
    appellant did not produce any evidence that the killers  had  made  any
    specific threats subsequently to him or other family members

17.  It is true that on the appellant's own account he would not be  in  the
    position of an ordinary Christian in  that  (i)  his  father  had  been
    targeted and killed by Islamic extremists and was a well-known  pastor;
    (ii) he had now "re-converted" to Christianity,  which  would  mean  he
    would be perceived by Islamic militants as  an  apostate.   However  as
    regards (i) there was simply no evidence  to  indicate  that  his  late
    father had had or still had a profile outside his home area or even  if
    he did, that this would still  be  recalled  by  the  Islam  extremists
    groups operating in 2015/2016, some 13-14 years later; and  as  regards
    (ii), there was  no  COI  evidence  demonstrating  that  the  religious
    extremists who attacked the appellant's father or associated groups  of
    extremists, including Boko Haram, have an  organisational  capacity  or
    reach that would lead to them  either  identifying  or  taking  adverse
    action against the appellant.

18.  Put shortly, there was no evidential foundation for  a  tribunal  Judge
    to consider that if the appellant relocated internally  within  Nigeria
    to Christian areas he would face a well-founded fear of persecution  or
    ill-treatment.  Of course, Article 8  of  the  Qualification  Directive
    (paragraph 339O of the Rules) also  contains  a  "reasonableness"  limb
    which requires  a  decision-maker  to  assess  whether  the  particular
    circumstances  of  an  applicant   would   make   internal   relocation
    unreasonable.  But again, it is important, however, to observe what the
    position was when the appellant brought his appeal.

19.   First  of  all,  the  judge  did  consider  the  appellant's   medical
    circumstances and had found that the background evidence adduced by the
    respondent demonstrated that there would be treatment available to  the
    appellant in Nigeria.  Second (albeit in the context of  an  Article  8
    assessment) the judge had found that he would be  able  to  reintegrate
    himself into Nigerian society without significant  obstacles.   It  was
    noted that he had undertaken  courses  whilst  in  the  UK  that  would
    benefit  him  in  re-integrating.   Further,  the  judge   specifically
    rejected the appellant's claim that he would  be  regarded  "as  not  a
    typical Nigerian".

20.  In essence,  therefore,  the  judge  had  decided  and  given  adequate
    reasons bearing on the main matters that  would  apply  when  assessing
    reasonableness of internal relocation.

21.  In light of those findings there  was  no  realistic  prospect  of  the
    appellant succeeding in  his  Article  3  claim  even  when  these  are
    considered holistically to encompass risk on  return  and  his  medical
    conditions.

22.  For the above reasons I conclude that the FtT Judge did not  materially
    err in law.

23.  I would add that if I had found a material error of  law  necessitating
    that I set aside the judge's decision,  I would then have gone on to re-
    make the decision without further ado.   Despite  being  informed  that
    they should identify and produce any further  evidence  on  which  they
    wished to rely, the appellant and his representatives had not  done  so
    prior to the hearing.

24.  On the basis of the evidence that would have then been  before  me  and
    considering  matters  holistically,  I  would  have  decided  that  the
    appellant failed to show that he faces a real risk  of  persecution  or
    ill-treatment on return to Nigeria.  If he is  concerned  at  what  his
    situation would be in his home area (Jos, Plateau  State,  in  northern
    Nigeria), he would be able to relocate safely and reasonably.  Thus the
    decision I would have re-made would have been to dismiss his appeal.

25.  For the above reasons:

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not materially err  in  law  and  his
    decision dismissing the appellant's appeal must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
