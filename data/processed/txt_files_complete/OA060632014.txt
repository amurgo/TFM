For the Appellant:     Miss S Azhar, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born  on  9th  February  1988.
    The Appellant had applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Her application had been refused
    by the Entry Clearance Officer on 13th April 2014.

 2. The Appellant had appealed and the appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Cockrill sitting at Taylor House  on  13th  January
    2015.   In  a  determination  promulgated  on  19th  January  2015  the
    Appellant's appeal had been allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 26th January 2015 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  The background to the case and the appeal was that
    the Appellant had been refused entry clearance to the  UK  because  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied  that  the  income  threshold
    requirement was met.  The judge had found that the Sponsor's income met
    the income requirement threshold of �18,600 in spite of the  fact  that
    the Sponsor's net income amounted to �17,089.  This was due to the fact
    that the Sponsor, on his own admission, kept some of the wages paid  in
    cash and did not pay  it  all  into  his  bank  account.   The  grounds
    contended that it was not open to the judge to count earnings  paid  in
    cash which have not been paid into a bank account and that as a  result
    the judge had erred in law.

 4. On 2nd March  2015  Immigration  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to
    appeal.  No Rule 24 reply is lodged on behalf of the Appellant.

 5. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  This is an appeal by the Secretary of State
    but for the purpose of continuity  throughout  the  legal  process  Mrs
    Akther is referred to herein as the  Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of
    State as the Respondent.  The Appellant is represented by Miss Azhar of
    Counsel.  Miss Azhar is  familiar  with  this  matter  having  appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  The Secretary of State is  represented
    by her Home Office Presenting Officer Ms Everett.

Submissions/Discussions

 6. Ms Everett starts off by submitting that income  was  wrongly  in  fact
    considered by the Entry Clearance Officer and that in  order  to  bring
    the Sponsor's income within the financial limits imposed by  the  Rules
    then that income must be addressed in a particular way and if it is  in
    cash (as is the case here) then the documentary evidence  must  specify
    the net amount of cash that has been paid into the Sponsor's bank to be
    reflected within  the  bank  statements.   She  acknowledges  that  the
    discrepancy that is paid in in this instant case is  of  a  very  small
    amount indeed and that the net weekly payments amount  to  �302.69  and
    that the bank statements disclose regular payments at cash points of  a
    minimum of �302.  She  does  however  acknowledge  that  the  Sponsor's
    evidence was found to be credible by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  but
    still maintains on the Secretary of State's behalf  that  the  decision
    contains a material error of law in virtue of the manner in which  cash
    was included in the assessment.

 7. Miss Azhar opposes the Secretary of State's appeal and submits that the
    Home Office are in fact wrong as the figure that the Appellant and  his
    legal advisors made in their initial calculations was based on the  net
    figures.  She takes me to the statements showing the  Appellant  had  a
    gross income of �18,899 i.e.  a  figure  in  excess  of  the  statutory
    minimum requirement and  she  then  makes  appropriate  deductions  for
    annual income tax of �1,910.  She submits that the error appears in the
    Home Office calculations to be that they have not factored in  national
    insurance and that the annual net figure  once  national  insurance  is
    deducted calculates down to the exact figure of the net weekly  pay  of
    �302.69.  She submits that this paper trail  shows  such  payments  and
    that this evidence was known and available to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and was appropriately applied.  She consequently submits there is
    no material error of law.

The Law

 8.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

 9. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

10. Appendix FM 1(n) states:-

         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips  ...  Otherwise
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted."

11. It is the submission of the Secretary of State that the judge  was  not
    entitled therefore to count earnings paid in cash which  had  not  been
    paid into a bank account.  Whilst the judge may not  have  specifically
    made reference to this Rule it is clear  from  paragraph  49  that  the
    judge has acknowledged that there are some payments made  in  cash  and
    has shown the paper trail is followed and given  full  details  of  the
    Sponsor's income at paragraph 51.  Had the Secretary of State  factored
    in the national insurance contributions then it would have  been  clear
    that the figures balanced.  In such circumstances the cash payments are
    fully explained within the terms of Appendix FM 1(n) and  this  is  set
    out properly within the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision.   The
    decision therefore discloses no material error of law and the appeal of
    the Secretary of State is dismissed and the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is maintained.
