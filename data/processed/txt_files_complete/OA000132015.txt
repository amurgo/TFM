Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ball, instructed by Sentinel Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) we continue the anonymity order made by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs  otherwise,
    no report of these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall
    directly or indirectly identify the original appellant. This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings. We  do
    so in order to avoid a likelihood of  serious  harm  arising  for  DB's
    children.

 2. This is an appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the  decision
    promulgated on 23 June 2016 of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Wyman  which
    allowed DB's appeal against the refusal to revoke a deportation order.

 3. For the purposes of this decision we refer to DB as the  appellant  and
    to the Secretary of State as the respondent, reflecting their positions
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. As the appellant has  a  conviction  of  2  �  years  and  has  British
    children, an assessment has to be made in line with paragraph 399(a) of
    the Immigration Rules and section 117C(5) as to  whether  it  would  be
    "unduly harsh" for his children. The First-tier Tribunal judge  allowed
    the appeal as it was found that it would  be  "unduly  harsh"  for  the
    applicant's children; see [106].

 5. The Secretary of State's challenge was narrow and  was  to  the  effect
    that the judge had failed to follow case law setting down  the  correct
    approach in the "unduly harsh" assessment.

 6. At [77] and [79] Judge Wyman set out extracts from  the  cases  of  KMO
    (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543  (IAC)  and  MAB
    (para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435 (IAC). The judge makes
    no further reference to those cases, however,  stating  only  at  [101]
    that "I refer to paragraph 76-82 above and do not intend to  repeat  in
    this section what case law has recently held to be 'unduly harsh'."

 7. That is problematic as KMO and MAB reach opposing conclusions as to how
    the "unduly harsh"  assessment  should  be  conducted.  This  is  shown
    clearly in the extracts quoted in the decision here. The  case  of  MAB
    was decided first and the first paragraph of the head note, set out  at
    [79] of the First-tier Tribunal determination, states:


         "The phrase "unduly harsh" in para 399 of the Rules (and s.117C(5)
         of the 2002 Act) does not import a balancing exercise requiring the
         public interest to be weighed against the circumstances of the
         individual (whether child or partner of the deportee).  The focus
         is solely upon an evaluation of the consequences and impact upon
         the individual concerned."

 8. The head note of KMO, set  out  at  [77]  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision, states:



         "The  Immigration  Rules,  when  applied  in  the  context  of  the
         deportation of a foreign criminal, are a complete  code.  Where  an
         assessment is required to be made as to whether a person meets  the
         requirements  of  para  399  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  as  that
         comprises an assessment of that person's claim under article  8  of
         the  ECHR,  it  is  necessary  to  have  regard,  in  making   that
         assessment, to the matters to which the Tribunal must  have  regard
         as a consequence of the provisions of s117C. In  particular,  those
         include that the more serious the offence committed, the greater is
         the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  a   foreign   criminal.
         Therefore, the word "unduly" in the phrase "unduly harsh"  requires
         consideration of whether, in the light of the  seriousness  of  the
         offences committed by the foreign criminal and the public  interest
         considerations that come  into  play,  the  impact  on  the  child,
         children or partner of  the  foreign  criminal  being  deported  is
         inordinately or excessively harsh."





 9. Put simply, MAB states that the  "unduly  harsh"  assessment  does  not
    require a balancing exercise  including,  amongst  other  matters,  the
    public interest in deportation of a foreign national criminal  but  KMO
    finds that it does. This conflict is not resolved by any legal analysis
    by the First-tier Tribunal here, nor does the substance of the  "unduly
    harsh" assessment indicate that the judge was mindful of  the  conflict
    or took a position one way or the other. Having  quoted  the  headnotes
    setting out the differing approaches, the decision  is  silent  on  the
    point.

10. That error is compounded by the Court of Appeal decision of MM (Uganda)
    v SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ  450,  which  approves  the  KMO  approach.  MM
    (Uganda) was issued on 20 April 2016 and should have  been  applied  by
    the First-tier Tribunal in the decision promulgated  on  23  June  2016
    after a hearing on 8 June 2016. MM (Uganda) specifically considers both
    MAB and KMO, finding at [23]-[24]:


         "23.     The context in these cases invites emphasis on two
             factors, (1) the public interest in the removal of foreign
             criminals and (2) the need for a proportionate assessment of
             any interference with Article 8 rights. In my judgment, with
             respect, the approach of the Upper Tribunal in MAB ignores
             this combination of factors. The first of them, the public
             interest in the removal of foreign criminals, is expressly
             vouched by Parliament in section 117C(1). Section 117C(2) then
             provides (I repeat the provision for convenience):


              "The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
              criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation
              of the criminal."

         24.   This  steers  the  tribunals  and   the   court   towards   a
              proportionate assessment of the criminal's deportation in any
              given case. Accordingly the more pressing the public interest
              in his removal, the harder it will be to show that the effect
              on his child or partner  will  be  unduly  harsh.  Any  other
              approach  in  my  judgment  dislocates  the  "unduly   harsh"
              provisions  from  their  context.  It  would  mean  that  the
              question of undue hardship would be  decided  wholly  without
              regard to the force of the public interest in deportation  in
              the particular case. But in that case the  term  "unduly"  is
              mistaken for "excessive" which imports a different idea. What
              is due or undue depends on all the circumstances, not  merely
              the impact on the child or partner in the given case. In  the
              present context relevant circumstances certainly include  the
              criminal's immigration and criminal history."

11. As above, nothing in the substance of the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge shows that she followed the correct approach set out  in
    MM (Uganda) and KMO in the "unduly harsh" assessment. The determination
    does not indicate that there was any consideration of the two important
    factors identified in MM (Uganda), the public interest in  the  removal
    of foreign criminals and the need  to  weigh  the  seriousness  of  the
    offence.  On  the  contrary,  at  [109],  rather  than   weighing   the
    seriousness of the 2 � years sentence against the appellant, the  judge
    appears to weigh in his favour that it was not a more serious sentence,
    commenting that:

         "I take into account the appellant was not sentenced to a period of
         imprisonment of over four years."

12. Mr Ball sought to argue that a  combination  of  [50]  which  sets  out
    paragraph 399(a) and section 117C, so  including  a  reference  to  the
    importance of the public interest and weighing of  the  seriousness  of
    the offence and [106] showed that the judge  did  consider  the  public
    interest in the deportation of the appellant and the seriousness of his
    offence. However, the decision at [106] states only:

         "Having taken into account all the  evidence  and  weighed  up  the
         circumstances, I am satisfied that it would be unduly harsh for  DJ
         and DE to live in  Jamaica  and  it  would  unduly  harsh  for  the
         children to remain in the United Kingdom without their father."

13. We did not find that the unspecific reference  at  [106]  to  "all  the
    evidence and ... the circumstances" even when read with [50]  began  to
    show that the judge took  a  proper  approach  to  the  "unduly  harsh"
    assessment here.

14. For these reasons we found an error on a point of  law  such  that  the
    decision had to be set aside to be re-made de novo. We found  that  the
    case fell to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  line  with
    paragraph 7 of Part 3 of  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement
    dated 25 September 2012.

Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the appellant's asylum claim
    discloses an error on a point of law and is set aside.

16. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made.
