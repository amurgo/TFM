                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Tallacchi, Counsel, instructed by Farani
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst the respondent is the appellant in these proceedings before me,
    I hereafter refer to the parties using terminology used in the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant in the First-tier Tribunal will hereafter
    be referred to as "the appellant" in these proceedings, and the
    respondent will be referred to as "the respondent".


 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on May 19, 2007 with entry
    clearance as a student. His leave was extended until July 31, 2010. On
    February 15, 2010 the appellant was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1
    Highly Skilled (Post-Study Worker) migrant and this leave was extended
    until June 17, 2006. He made an application for indefinite leave to
    remain based on his period of time spent here as a Tier 1 Migrant, but
    this was refused on December 2, 2016. The decision was administratively
    reviewed but the decision was maintained on January 12, 2017.

 3. On January 23, 2017 the appellant applied to remain on the basis of
    family/private life and this was some later varied to an application
    for long residence under paragraph 276B HC 395 on June 22, 2017. The
    respondent refused this application on April 30, 2018.


 4. The appellant appealed this decision on May 14, 2018 under section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and his
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hodgkinson on
    November 20, 2018. In a decision promulgated on November 28, 2018 the
    Judge concluded that the respondent had not discharged the burden of
    proof placed on him in establishing that the appellant had practised
    dishonesty or deceit with reference to his earlier tax returns and in
    particular with reference to the figures for employment and self-
    employment that were set out in his 2011 and 2013 Tier 1 applications.
    The Judge found as a fact that the respondent had neither established
    that the appellant had intentionally deflated or intentionally inflated
    his income nor had it been established that any anomalies in the
    appellant's figures were with the intention to evade tax or dishonestly
    secure further leave to remain.

 5. The respondent sought permission to appeal on  December  13,  2018  and
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Holmes found  it  arguable  there  had
    been an error in law and that the  grounds  of  appeal  had  merit.  In
    giving permission he found  that  the  Judge  had  arguably  failed  to
    understand or failed to apply current jurisprudence (Khan  [2018]  UKUT
    384) and in particular it was arguable  the  Judge  had  erred  in  the
    weight attached to the fact that HMRC had neither prosecuted nor issued
    a financial penalty against the appellant.

    SUBMISSIONS

 6. Mr Avery submitted the Judge's approach  was  flawed.  The  grounds  of
    appeal set out in some  detail  today's  challenge.  The  Judge  placed
    weight on the fact no action had been taken by HMRC over the  incorrect
    reporting of income but Mr Avery submitted that following the decisions
    in R (on the application of Samant) v SSHD [2017] UKAITUR  JR/6546/2016
    and Abbasi JR/13807/2016 the Judge erred as the Tribunal  had  made  it
    clear that there are a multitude of  reasons  why  the  HMRC  does  not
    prosecute  or  apply  a  penalty  and  as  such  this  should  not   be
    determinative of whether the appellant used deception. It  was  obvious
    to anyone that there was a major difference between an income of �4,485
    and �64,816. Whilst the Judge considered the evidence from para 28, the
    Judge wrongly concluded the figures did not  matter  when  the  figures
    were at the heart of the issue.

 7. Mr Tallacchi urged the Tribunal to reject this appeal.  The  Judge  had
    made specific findings on credibility and had made numerous findings of
    fact which were set out throughout his decision and, in particular,  at
    paragraphs 38, 44 and 45  of  his  decision.  The  Judge  accepted  his
    explanation for  not  including  the  income  on  his  tax  return  and
    concluded the respondent had not rebutted the appellant's  explanation.
    Put simply the Judge accepted the appellant's explanation that  he  did
    not believe his Nigerian earnings had to be  declared  because  he  had
    already paid tax on that element of his income in Nigeria.

 8. I reserved my decision.

    FINDINGS

 9. In refusing the appellant's application the respondent placed weight on
    discrepancies between income figures disclosed on  his  Tier  1  Highly
    Skilled (General) Migrant applications 2011 and 2013  compared  to  the
    income disclosed to HMRC. In particular the tax year ended  April  2011
    the only income disclosed to HMRC was his PAYE employment  of  �4485.61
    whereas he had previously informed the respondent  that  he  had  self-
    employed income totalling �64,816.06. It is in this area that Mr  Avery
    argues the Judge has erred in law in the way that  he  approached  this
    evidence at the original hearing.

10. In response to this submission Mr Tallacchi refers to  the  examination
    carried out by the Judge and the  fact  that  the  Judge  had  rejected
    respondent's claim that he had satisfied the burden  of  proof  and  he
    referred to the evidence provided by the appellant that he  argued  was
    accepted as being an innocent explanation for the error.

11. The Tribunal in Khan provided guidance on how courts should  deal  with
    cases such as these and whilst that case is a  Judicial  Review  appeal
    nevertheless the guidance issued is of assistance. The Tribunal  should
    consider the following:

      a) Where there has been a significant difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary of State  to  draw
         that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.


      b) However, where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented with a fact-
         finding task: she must decide whether the explanation and  evidence
         is sufficient, in her view, to displace the prima  facie  inference
         of deceit/dishonesty.


      c) In approaching that  fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is  the
         "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.


      d) However, for an applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
         an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be the
         end of the matter: far from it.  Thus, the Secretary  of  State  is
         entitled to take into account that, even where  an  accountant  has
         made an error, the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
         payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to  have  signed
         the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of
         his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If,
         realising this (or wilfully shutting his eyes  to  the  situation),
         the Applicant has not taken  steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to
         remedy the situation, the Secretary of State  may  be  entitled  to
         conclude either that the error was not  simply  the  fault  of  the
         accountant or, alternatively, the Applicant's failure to remedy the
         situation itself justifies a conclusion that he has been  has  been
         deceitful or dishonest and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR
         within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.


      e) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a  tax
         return has been dishonest or  merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the  reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


      f) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary  of  State  to
         consider in reaching her decision in these  cases,  including  (but
         these are by no means exclusive):


          i) Whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;


         ii) Whether the documentation which can be assumed to  exist  (for
             example,  correspondence  between  the   Applicant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;


        iii) Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been  made
             because his liability to pay tax was less than he should  have
             expected;


         iv) Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to remedy
             the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and  the
             explanation for any significant delay.


      g) In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary of State  is
         likely to want to see evidence which goes  beyond  mere  assertion:
         for example, in a case such as the present where the explanation is
         that the Applicant was distracted by  his  concern  for  his  son's
         health, there should be documentary evidence about the matter.   If
         there is, then the Secretary  of  State  would  need  to  weigh  up
         whether such concern genuinely excuses or explains the  failure  to
         account for tax, or at  least  displaces  the  inference  that  the
         Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest.  The  Secretary  of  State,
         before making her decision, should call for the evidence which  she
         considers ought to exist, and may draw  an  unfavourable  inference
         from any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.


      h) In her decision, the  Secretary  of  State  should  articulate  her
         reasoning, setting out the matters which she has taken into account
         in reaching her decision and stating the reasons for  the  decision
         she has reached.

12. As Mr Avery points out there is a substantial  difference  between  the
    figure provided to the HMRC and the figure provided to the  respondent.
    In the absence of an innocent explanation the guidance provided by  the
    Court is that the Secretary of State is entitled to draw  an  inference
    that the appellant has been deceitful or  dishonest  and  therefore  he
    should be refused indefinite leave to remain within paragraph 322(5) of
    the Immigration Rules.

13. In this appeal, the appellant provided an explanation and the Judge was
    provided  with  various  documents  including   a   document   entitled
    UK/Nigeria Double Taxation Agreement. The Judge recorded the respondent
    had satisfied initial evidential burden considered  in  Khan  but  went
    onto accept the  appellant's  contention  that  he  had  not  practised
    deception.

14. Mr Avery criticises the Judge for not setting out adequate  reasons  as
    to why he reached the conclusions he did, but it is not  necessary  for
    the Judge to set out everything that is contained within the statement.
    It is clear from  this  decision  that  the  Judge  was  aware  of  the
    evidence. He had set out in considerable detail the decision letter and
    had then gone on to summarise the appellant's case at paragraph  31  of
    his decision. The Judge accepted that the explanation contained  within
    both his statement and oral evidence were plausible and  therefore  the
    respondent had to demonstrate, on the balance  of  probabilities,  that
    his explanation should be rejected.  Importantly,  the  Judge  reminded
    himself that respondent had  to  demonstrate  that  the  appellant  had
    practised deceit, deception or dishonesty.

15. The grounds of appeal pointed to paragraph 34 of the  Judge's  decision
    and the fact that the Judge placed weight on the fact that the HMRC had
    not taken action  against  the  appellant.  However,  contrary  to  the
    grounds of appeal the  Judge  did  not  find  the  respondent  had  not
    satisfied the relevant burden of proof because HMRC took no action  but
    in considering the case the Judge stated it was a factor he  had  taken
    into account in considering whether deception or  dishonesty  had  been
    practised by the appellant.

16. At paragraph 38 of the decision the Judge recorded the appellant's oral
    evidence to be that he had not declared self-employed Nigerian earnings
    in his UK tax returns because those earnings had been taxed  at  source
    in Nigeria and were  not  consequently  liable  to  UK  tax.  Mr  Avery
    submitted that this was not a finding but reading  paragraph  38  as  a
    whole it is clear that  the  Judge  accepted  the  submission  advanced
    namely that what the appellant stated was consistent with  the  content
    of the UK/Nigeria Double Taxation Agreement. Again, the Judge  did  not
    reject the respondent's submission on this point alone  but  stated  it
    would be a factor to take into account when assessing  the  appellant's
    credibility.

17. The Judge considered  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  income  from
    Nigeria  and  accepted  that  documents  had  been  submitted  to   the
    respondent and at paragraph 42 the Judge concluded there was a  "wealth
    of documentation" which supported his claimed activities.

18. Mr Avery argued that the Judge should undertaking a  detailed  analysis
    of the figures and that his finding at paragraph 44 was flawed. If this
    appeal had simply been over  the  nondisclosure  in  tax  documents  of
    �60,000 then many of the points advanced by Mr Avery would  have  merit
    but this was an appeal in which the appellant claimed that tax had been
    paid already and that he did  not  believe  he  had  to  disclose  this
    information on his UK tax return. In other words,  he  was  not  acting
    dishonestly. The tax on �60,000 would have been considerably more  than
    the �3000 that was due and owing to the tax authorities.

19. The Judge therefore had an explanation and as he  correctly  stated  in
    his decision the  respondent  had  to  demonstrate  the  appellant  had
    practised dishonesty or  deceit  with  reference  to  his  earlier  tax
    returns and with reference to his Tier  1  applications  the  2011  and
    2013.

20. The Judge had correctly identified the  issue  in  this  case  and  the
    relevant evidence in respect of that matter. He had at some length  set
    out the burden and standard of proof where such assertions of deception
    were made by the respondent and the shift in such burden of proof.

21. He  had  found  the  evidence  disclosed  in  his  judgment,  that  the
    respondent had discharged the  evidential  burden.  He  had  thereafter
    examined the evidence and explanations put forward by the appellant and
    concluded that the appellant has provided an innocent explanation  that
    satisfies the minimum level of plausibility.

22. Thereafter he had examined whether the Respondent had shown  that  that
    innocent explanation should  be  rejected  and  whether  therefore  the
    Respondent discharged the legal burden. He had looked at  the  relevant
    evidence in not insignificant detail.

23. The Judge was mindful of the legal tests applicable. He  was  aware  of
    the salient evidence in this case and whilst not required to deal  with
    each and every matter had adequately considered all relevant facts  and
    provided reasons for his findings. He had approached that evidence with
    care and in a fair manner. Whilst it could not be said that all  Judges
    would necessarily have reached  the  same  conclusion  it  was  not  an
    irrational conclusion that was  reached  by  the  Judge  and  does  not
    disclose a material error of law.
