Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Akindele, solicitor, A & A Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state  and  to  the
      respondent as the claimant.


   2. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria,  born  on  7  August  1976.  She
      applied on 22 October 2014 for a residence card under  the  provisions
      of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the
      2006 Regulations") on the basis that she was the primary carer  of  an
      EEA national child exercising free movement rights in the UK as a self
      sufficient person.


   3. In a decision promulgated on 9  June  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge allowed the claimant's claim under  the  2006  Regulations.  The
      Judge found that the child was an Irish citizen and is accordingly  an
      EEA national living in the UK. He is self sufficient as his mother has
      access to sufficient resources  not  to  become  a  burden  on  social
      assistance  in  the  UK  during  the  period  of  residence,  and  has
      comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the UK [13].


   4. The secretary of state appeals with permission against that decision.


   5. In granting permission, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  noted  the
      grounds alleging an error of law. There has been  a  failure  to  make
      findings on material matters such as "sufficient  resources",  and  in
      particular by failing  to  compare  claimed  income  by  the  claimant
      against income support rates, housing costs and council tax payments.


   6. Judge Molloy found it difficult to see where  'the  physical  evidence
      is' of  the  funds  recorded  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in
      paragraph 10(iii) of the decision. The First-tier  Judge  at  [10(vii]
      expressed satisfaction that the claimant had access to the income that
      she avers she enjoys.  She claimed to have the equivalent  of  �45,000
      in a fixed deposit with Meetneeds Investment Services Ltd, 'but  there
      was not in the claimant's bundle any document from  that  organisation
      supporting the claim'.


   7. Judge Molloy stated that as the  respondent  pleaded  in  the  grounds
      there was insufficient evidence to show that the claimant or  her  EEA
      sponsor could gain access to monies, specifically �45,000.


   8. On behalf of the secretary of state Mr Mills submitted that the appeal
      related  to  Regulation  15A(2)  of  the  2006  Regulations,  and   in
      particular the requirement that the relevant EEA national is  residing
      in the UK as a self sufficient person.


   9. Regulation  4(1)(c)  sets  out  the  definition  of  "self  sufficient
      person". Such a person must have sufficient resources not to become  a
      burden on the social assistance system of the UK during his period  of
      residence and comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the UK.


  10. Regulation 4(2) states that for the purpose of paragraph  1(c),  where
      family members of the person concerned reside in  the  UK,  and  their
      right to reside is dependent upon there being family members  of  that
      person -


     a) the requirement for that person to have sufficient resources not to
        become a burden on the social assistance system of  the  UK  during
        his period of residence shall only be satisfied  if  his  resources
        and those of the family members are sufficient to avoid him and the
        family members becoming such a burden;


     b) the requirement for that  person  to  have  comprehensive  sickness
        insurance cover in the UK shall only be satisfied  if  he  and  his
        family members have such cover.


  11. Paragraph 4(4) of the Regulations states  that  for  the  purposes  of
      paragraph 1(c) and 2, the resources of the person concerned and, where
      applicable, any family members, are to be regarded as sufficient if


     a) they exceed the maximum level of resources which a British  citizen
        and his family members may possess if he is to become eligible  for
        social assistance under the UK benefit system; or


     b) paragraph (a) does not apply but, taking into account the  personal
        situation of the person concerned and, where applicable, any family
        members, it appears to the decision maker that the resources of the
        person or persons concerned should be regarded as sufficient.


  12. Family members include a primary carer as defined in Regulation 15A(7)
      - paragraph 4(5).


  13. Mr Mills submitted that these resources  cannot  include  income  from
      illegal work undertaken in the UK.


  14. He submitted that the Judge gave no consideration to the fact that the
      claimant is part of a family unit in the UK comprising a  sole  parent
      and three children. The Judge has failed at [13] to make an assessment
      required by Regulation 4(2)(a) as to whether or not the funds  claimed
      by the claimant are sufficient for the family  as  a  whole  to  avoid
      becoming a burden on the social assistance system for the duration  of
      the sponsor's period of residence.


  15. He submitted that the Judge had to consider not only whether they  had
      resources, but whether they would be available over a period of  time,
      i.e. for the duration of the sponsor's period of residence required by
      Regulation 4(2)(a). It is accordingly "forward looking".


  16. He referred to the fact that the claimant entered the UK on 19  August
      2014. Prior to that, she had been raised and had lived in Nigeria. She
      is  married  to  Mr  Kehinde  Akingbola,  described  as  a  practising
      barrister in Nigeria. He is also said to be an investor - [10].


  17. They have three children, namely a son, an Irish  citizen  born  on  6
      September 2004; and two children, both American nationals, born on  27
      March 2009 and 13 January 2012.


  18. The claimant arrived in the UK with her children. She and her  husband
      decided to relocate here on the basis that they would be entitled to a
      derivative right of residence as she is the  carer  and  custodian  of
      Akindele, an Irish citizen, who  is  accordingly  an  EEA  national  -
      [10(ii].


  19. Mr Mills submitted that in those circumstances  it  was  necessary  to
      have regard to the relevant income support  levels  as  applied  to  a
      parent and three children in the UK. This amounted to �291.25 a  week,
      as well as housing costs and council tax. That accordingly equates  to
      more than �291 a week. No assessment however has been  made  regarding
      any of the claimant's housing costs or council tax payments.


  20. No assessment has  been  carried  out  as  to  how  long  the  claimed
      resources would be available. Further income will  be  available  once
      the father comes. This is evidenced from the witness statement of  the
      claimant set out at [10(2)].


  21. They intend to reside in the UK as a family. When  that  happens,  his
      income from abroad will not continue. This has not  been  acknowledged
      by the Judge.


  22. Moreover, the claimant listed funds and investment that  she  and  her
      husband have in Nigeria in the amount of �46,200 in the bank of  which
      �45,000 is held as a fixed deposit with Meetneeds Investment  Services
      Ltd. The remaining balance is held between the Guaranteed Trust  Bank,
      First Bank of Nigeria and Barclays Bank. It is also contended that she
      has a house with her husband in Lagos valued at �210,000.


  23. Accordingly, it appeared that all  but  �1,200  is  held  in  a  fixed
      deposit. Based on the income support calculations, that  amount  would
      last for a little over four weeks. There was accordingly  insufficient
      evidence showing that the claimant or her sponsor could gain access to
      the remaining �45,000 said to be shared by her and her husband.


  24. He referred to the contention in  the  grounds  that  the  'period  of
      residence' of their son, the EEA national, the duration of which these
      resources must cover, was always  intended  to  be  permanent  and  is
      therefore open ended.


  25. Mr Mills referred to the letter from Meetneeds Investment at P of  the
      secretary of state's bundle. This  is  dated  23  September  2014.  It
      confirms investments made with the company. Returns on investments are
      paid at  agreed  rates  and  due  dates,  until  the  investments  are
      liquidated or terminated. The termination of this placement  shall  be
      by written notice received 14 days prior to the  intended  termination
      date. Confirmation shall remain  valid  until  returned  to  Meetneeds
      Investment Services Ltd for the terms thereof are fully discharged.


  26. On that basis, it was not clear how the Judge was satisfied  that  the
      resources would cover an open ended period.


  27. Mr Mills noted that  the  appeal  was  considered  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal on the papers, without the benefit of any  representation  or
      submissions  by  either  party  to   address   these   problems.   The
      "application of the law to the facts" at [13] is brief. The Judge  has
      not considered how long the resources would last, which depends  on  a
      proper assessment of the relevant facts, including taking into account
      housing  costs  and  council  tax  payments.  There  has  to  be  some
      consideration given as to how long the resources would last  them  and
      how it would be applied. In this case it has to  be  assessed  over  a
      lengthy period.


  28. The �45,000 is a large amount but regard must be had to the fact  that
      theirs is a large family. It may last for two years. If  however  they
      intend to remain for five years, the husband would  only  be  able  to
      earn an income if he were here lawfully. There is no date as  to  when
      he would  come.  There  is  no  evidence  as  to  how  he  would  find
      employment. No findings have been made in this regard, and none of the
      problems has been addressed.


  29. On behalf of the claimant, it was submitted that the decision was open
      to the First-tier Judge. The evidence of  bank  statements  and  fixed
      deposits showed that there are sufficient  resources.  In  EEA  cases,
      there should not be a  strict  approach  to  the  evidence.  There  is
      nothing in the Home Office guidance  that  refers  to  income  support
      levels. It is simply provided that  the  self-sufficiency  requirement
      should be met.


  30. Here there is some �45,000 available. This can be  liquidated  in  two
      weeks. He referred to the bank statements at C1-29 of  the  claimant's
      bundle. That showed that there was income which goes into the  account
      arising from property income. These were seen by the Judge.


  31. It is not for the Judge to  look  forward.  At  the  date  of  appeal,
      �45,000 was in a fixed deposit. The interest was adequate to live  on.
      When you add all this together, there are  sufficient  resources.  The
      �45,000 was part of the resources which would be available.   Even  if
      the husband decided to relocate, the status of  the  family  would  be
      considered at that time. It is too much to look forward over a  period
      of several years. The Judge had to look at  the  circumstances  before
      him.


  32. Mr Alikndele subnmitetd that if an error of law is  found  the  matter
      should be remitted to the first-tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh  decision
      where the evidence and submissions can be properly considered.


      Assessment


  33. It is  accepted  that  Regulation  4(2)(a)  of  the  2006  Regulations
      requires that a self-sufficient  person  must  be  a  person  who  has
      sufficient resources not to become a burden on the  social  assistance
      system of the UK during his period of residence.


  34. Where family members of the person concerned reside in the UK and  the
      right to reside is dependent upon their being family members  of  that
      person, the requirement for that person to have  sufficient  resources
      not to become a burden on the social services system of the UK  during
      his period of residence shall only be satisfied if his  resources  and
      those of his family members are sufficient to avoid him and his family
      members becoming such a burden.


  35. It is not possible for a claimant to rely on wages earned in the UK to
      assert self-sufficiency - MA and others EU national; self sufficiency;
      lawful employment) Bangladesh [2006] UKAIT 00090 at [45].  A  person's
      resources include the individual's  accommodation  -  SG  v  Thameside
      Metropolitan Borough Council  (HB)  [2010]  UKUT  243  at  [46].   The
      claimant must show sufficient resources for  the  intended  period  of
      residence - VP v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2014]  UKUT
      32.  The resources  available  must  exist  independently  of  an  any
      economic activity in the host Member state  -  Macdonld's  Immigration
      Law and Practice , 9th ed, 14.47.


  36. The Judge was required to assess the relevant period of  residence  in
      the circumstances. In that respect, I accept the submission  that  the
      Regulation must to that extent be construed as "forward looking."


  37. This was  an appeal decided on the papers. The  First-tier  Judge  had
      regard to the evidence produced and found that the  claimant  and  her
      husband have three children.  She arrived with them  in  the  UK.  The
      claimant is not currently working in the UK but has  relied  on  money
      from abroad. The income relied on is derived from her  husband's  work
      as a barrister and from other investments.  She  accesses  this  money
      from the UK using bank cards.


  38. The Judge had regard  to  the  claimant's  assertion  in  her  witness
      statement that she and her husband decided to relocate to  the  UK  on
      the basis of a derivative right of residence as the  carer  for  their
      child, an EEA national [10(iii)]. Moreover, she and her  husband  plan
      to move all their funds here once she has been granted status  in  the
      UK. Her husband plans to re-qualify as an English lawyer [10(v)].


  39. Although the amount of �45,000 in a fixed deposit can  be  liquidated,
      the amount is finite.  As at the date of  decision,  the  evidence  of
      funds produced showed that all but �1,200 was held in a fixed deposit.
      Based on income support rates at the date of  hearing,  an  amount  in
      excess of �300 per week for the claimant as a lone parent and her  two
      children plus the family premium  would  be  required.  There  was  no
      reference to any of their housing costs or council tax  payments  that
      was taken into account.


  40. In those circumstances, I accept the submission  that  the  period  of
      residence the resources must cover was intended to be permanent and is
      accordingly open ended. The income of the claimant's husband,  derived
      from his employment in Nigeria was, on the evidence, shortly to cease.
      I have taken into account the minimum income support  levels  required
      as well as housing and Council Tax costs.


  41. The claimant did not show that  the  finite  funds  available  to  the
      family was sufficient to support them for an  unspecified  open  ended
      period of time. The evidence before the Judge was that  they  intended
      to reside for a long period in  the  UK.  The  Judge  was  accordingly
      required to consider whether in the circumstances the funds relied  on
      by the claimant were sufficient for the family as  a  whole  to  avoid
      becoming a burden on the social assistance system for the duration  of
      the anticipated period of residence. That was not however considered.


  42. I accordingly find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      involved  the  making  of  an  error  on  a  point  of  law.   In  the
      circumstances I set aside the decision which will have to be remade.


  43. I accept Mr Akindele's submission that this is an appropriate case  to
      remit to the first-tier Tribunal.  There has been no submission to the
      contrary that Mr Mills has made.


  44. I have  had  regard  to  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement
      regarding the issue of remitting an appeal to the First Tier  Tribunal
      for a fresh decision.  I am satisfied that the extent of judicial fact
      finding which is necessary in order for the decision to be re-made, is
      extensive.  This will  be  a  complete  re-hearing  with  no  findings
      preserved. I have also had regard  to  the  overriding  objective  and
      conclude that it would be just and fair to remit the case.


  45. The  appeal  is  accordingly  remitted  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
      (Birmingham) for a fresh decision to be made.
