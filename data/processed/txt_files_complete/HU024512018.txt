For the Appellant:     Mr A Jafar (counsel for Lawfare Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Riabiaz [K], a citizen of Iran born  2  January
       1990, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 27  February
       2019 dismissing his appeal against the refusal of  his  human  rights
       claim (of 9 January 2018) made in response to deportation proceedings
       brought against him.

    2. Taking the history from  the  appealed  decision,  the  Appellant  is
       recorded as having arrived in the UK on 16  November  2005,  claiming
       asylum a few days later, that claim being refused on 17 January 2006;
       though as he was a minor he was granted discretionary leave to remain
       until 1 January 2008. He applied for further  leave  on  private  and
       family life grounds but that was refused, on 12 March  2008;  however
       he was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain on 10 February
       2011 under the legacy programme. He applied for naturalisation  as  a
       British citizen during 2015 but that application was refused due to a
       conviction from June 2015.

    3. The Appellant was convicted of actual bodily harm following  a  "road
       rage" incident for which he was sentenced (in November 2017) to eight
       months' imprisonment & required to pay a victim  surcharge  of  �140;
       the  June  2015  conviction  was  for  criminal  damage,  for   which
       compensation and costs orders each of �150 were imposed.

    4. Once deportation proceedings were intimated, the Appellant's claim to
       remain in the UK was based  on  his  relationship  with  his  British
       citizen  partner  [JR]  and  their  son  [MK],  born  12  July  2017.
       Deportation  was  nevertheless  considered  appropriate  because  the
       Respondent did not accept that the Appellant's relationship, whilst a
       genuine one formed at a time when the Appellant's immigration  status
       was not precarious, was with a British  citizen,  and  there  was  no
       evidence that his son was dependent on him, which was  in  any  event
       unlikely given that he had only been born  three  months  before  the
       Appellant's incarceration. His son was presumed to be at an age  when
       he could readily adapt to life without the Appellant.  The  Appellant
       had not lived in the UK for most of his life and so the private  life
       route was foreclosed to him. He was not considered to be a persistent
       offender though had caused serious  harm  as  shown  by  his  assault
       conviction. This, taken with his other conviction,  demonstrated  his
       continued presence in the UK was not conducive to the public good.

    5.  A  previous  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing   the
       Appellant's appeal of 18 June 2018 was found to contain legal  errors
       such that the appeal was remitted for re-hearing,  albeit  with  some
       preserved findings: that the Appellant was a "foreign criminal", that
       the appeal could not succeed with reference to Rule 399  in  relation
       to family life, that he had a genuine and subsisting relationship and
       that it would be unduly harsh for his partner and child  to  relocate
       to Iran.  Judge  Monson  in  allowing  that  appeal  found  that  the
       Appellant's actions were out of character, he had shown  remorse  and
       there was a low risk of re-offending. The child's best interests were
       for his father to remain in the UK with him, given he was  his  joint
       carer and financial provider, and if raised by his mother alone would
       suffer from the disadvantage in his  formative  years  of  having  no
       daily contact with his father. The Upper  Tribunal  found  that  this
       decision was in error of  law  as  no  additional  feature  save  for
       separation affecting the  nature  and  quality  of  the  relationship
       between the Appellant and his partner and child had been identified.

    6. The Appellant's evidence was that he had met [J] in August  2009  and
       their relationship begun in March 2011. He had supported her and  [M]
       via both self-employed and part-time employed  work.  He  had  become
       fully accustomed to the UK's culture having entered the country as  a
       minor and was no longer a  practising  Muslim;  he  feared  that  his
       normal way of behaving would now  cause  him  difficulties  with  the
       authorities in Iran.  His  father  had  fought  against  the  Iranian
       government for the Kurdistan Democratic Party and  been  executed  in
       1992.

    7. [J] was a Sikh and would face persecution and be unable  to  practice
       her religion in Iran.

    8. There was reference to a further potential prosecution for intent  to
       supply Class B drugs but as this had  not  proceeded  to  court,  the
       Tribunal below left the matter out of account.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal noted that this was  not  a  case  where  the
       automatic  deportation  regime  applied  given  the  length  of   the
       Appellant's sentence was less than 12 months.  By  the  time  of  the
       hearing the Secretary of State accepted that the Appellant's  partner
       and son could not reasonably be expected to follow him to  Iran  were
       he to be removed. The question was whether  there  were  "compelling"
       and therefore exceptional reasons why it would be  inappropriate  for
       the Appellant to be removed,  acknowledging  that  this  in  practice
       would  sever  a  subsisting  and  genuine  relationship  between  the
       Appellant and both his partner and son. The Strasbourg Court had made
       it clear that the relevant question was the  proportionality  of  the
       interference with private and  family  life,  having  regard  to  the
       nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence  committed  and  the  best
       interests of any children, and the fact that a child should  be  held
       responsible for the failings of parents, including criminality.

   10. One notable feature of the evidence was that [J]  had  clearly  faced
       particular challenges in discharging her responsibilities  with  [M];
       she needed support, either from the Appellant or from her sister, the
       latter having stepped in during the Appellant's spell of imprisonment
       though it had to be recognised that the Appellant's permanent absence
       would represent a very different challenge. [J] had given up her full-
       time employment at London Heathrow Airport.

   11. The Appellant's offence was serious notwithstanding that it  did  not
       reach the automatic deportation threshold.  His  victims  would  have
       been in significant fear given the sentencing  remarks  which  stated
       this to have been an offence of "high culpability", and  the  act  in
       question was a violent, sustained and unjustified  incident  of  road
       rage which was an affront to decent society.

   12. Deportation naturally gave rise to the loss of a  significant  figure
       within a family unit, but the evidence did not here establish that it
       would be unduly harsh for [J] and [M] to live in the UK  without  the
       Appellant. Nor were there any unjustifiably harsh  consequences  when
       the case was considered outside the Rules.

   13. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had  materially
       erred in law because

           (a) It had set too high a standard for assessing undue harshness
           and had in effect introduced a "compelling reasons" test
           contrary to KO (Nigeria);


           (b) It had failed to consider [M]'s best interests as a primary
           consideration: inevitably a prolonged separation of a two-year
           old son from his father would cause serious detriment to his
           welfare.


   14. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 2 April 2019,
       highlighting the "best interests" points, but without any restriction
       on what might be argued thereafter.

   15. Mr Jafar submitted that this was an appeal where the members  of  the
       small family unit  were  clearly  very  close  to  one  another.  The
       authorities such as De Souza Riberio v France  emphasised  the  self-
       evident importance of a father to their child's development.

   16. Ms Everett submitted  that  whilst  one  should  not  trivialise  the
       effects of separation between father and child, here  the  Judge  had
       correctly identified the  need  for  a  case  to  exhibit  additional
       features to render deportation disproportionate, beyond the issue  of
       separation from partner and child, relating to the quality and nature
       of the relationship.  No such factors  had  been  identified  by  the
       Tribunal which had thus been entitled to dismiss the appeal.

Decision and reasons

   17. I accept that there were material  errors  of  law  in  the  decision
       appealed. Firstly, the First-tier Tribunal did indeed add a gloss  on
       the Rules that in truth is not  found  within  them.  They  pose  the
       question as to whether an  individual's  expulsion  would  be  unduly
       harsh for his partner and/or children; there is no further  elevation
       of the relevant test  to  a  requirement  that  the  consequences  be
       "compelling". See Lord Carnwath in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 �42:

           "Mr Drabble for IT submits that the court's reasoning is open to
           the same criticisms as the decision in MM (Uganda) on  which  it
           relied. In any event he criticises the court's introduction of a
           "compelling reasons" test which is not found in the relevant sub-
           section. I agree that for that reason  at  least  the  Court  of
           Appeal's reasoning cannot stand."


       This is a threshold error which inevitably impacts on the  assessment
       of all the conclusions made subject to it, whether or not  there  are
       otherwise overt flaws in that reasoning.

   18. Secondly, there  is  no  distinct  evaluation  of  the  child's  best
       interests found in the decision below. Reverting to KO (Nigeria) �11,
       15, such an evaluation is vital:

           "The most recent version of the IDI (22 February 2018), no doubt
           taking account of Court of Appeal decisions  to  which  I  shall
           refer  below,  includes  an  additional  paragraph,  which  more
           closely reflects the Secretary of  State's  submissions  in  the
           present case:


                 "The consideration of the child's best interests  must  not
                 be affected by the conduct or immigration  history  of  the
                 parent(s) or primary carer, but these will be  relevant  to
                 the  assessment  of  the  public  interest,  including   in
                 maintaining effective  immigration  control;  whether  this
                 outweighs the child's best interests; and whether,  in  the
                 round, it is reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
                 UK." (Family Migration: Appendix FM  Section  1.0b.  Family
                 Life (as a Partner or Parent) and  Private  Life:  Ten-Year
                 Routes, p 76)


           I start with the expectation that the purpose is  to  produce  a
           straightforward set of rules, and in particular to narrow rather
           than widen the residual area of discretionary judgment  for  the
           court to take account of public interest or  other  factors  not
           directly reflected in the wording of the statute. I  also  start
           from the presumption, in the absence of clear  language  to  the
           contrary, that the provisions are intended to be consistent with
           the general principles  relating  to  the  "best  interests"  of
           children, including the principle that  "a  child  must  not  be
           blamed for matters for which he or she is not responsible,  such
           as the conduct of a parent" (see Zoumbas v  Secretary  of  State
           for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74, [2013] 1 WLR 3690,  para
           10 per Lord Hodge)."


   19. The parties  agreed  that  in  the  event  that  the  Upper  Tribunal
       identified an error of law in the  decision  appealed,  it  would  be
       appropriate to retain the matter  for  final  decision.  Furthermore,
       given the  evidence  was  available  on  file  and  that  both  sides
       considered they had had ample opportunity to make submissions on  the
       legal framework and salient evidence, it was unnecessary  to  proceed
       to a further continuation hearing: a  final  decision  based  on  the
       papers would suffice.

   20. It is now appropriate to review the available evidence in more detail
       than hitherto, particularly given that a significant element of Judge
       Monson's findings have  been  previously  treated  as  preserved,  an
       approach from which it has not been suggested I  should  depart.  The
       Appellant's asylum claim, as summarised by Judge Monson in the First-
       tier Tribunal previously, was that his father had  been  executed  in
       1993 as a KDPI member. His mother and sister went  to  a  refugee  in
       camp in Iraq where the Appellant lived  with  them  from  1996  until
       2002. In 2003, his mother remarried and returned  to  Iran  with  her
       husband. The Appellant's stepfather did not accept him, and so he was
       left behind in the camp with his sister and  brother-in-law.  It  was
       against their custom for his sister to support him, so his brother-in-
       law gave him money to pay an agent to  bring  him  to  the  West.  He
       eventually reached the UK having travelled across Europe from Turkey.
       He could not return to Iraq as his sister  and  brother-in-law  could
       not be relied on to support him and he only had limited contact  with
       his relatives in Iran.

   21. His application for further DLR was refused in March 2008 because the
       Secretary of State considered that the Appellant had  now  gained  an
       education and the relevant skills such that he could be  expected  to
       work on his own behalf in Iran, and so would not need to rely on  his
       relatives for financial support. His grant  of  indefinite  leave  to
       remain under the legacy programme was predicated on his  strength  of
       UK connections, length of residence and compassionate circumstances.

   22. The sentencing remarks record the context  of  the  Appellant's  road
       rage conviction, which had been  recorded  on  camera,  showing  that
       following a dispute as to priority at a road junction a woman  sought
       to remonstrate with the Appellant, who, together with his  passenger,
       responded by assaulting her with objects that appeared to  be  blunt,
       using stabbing motions, until other motorists got out of  their  cars
       and intervened. The Appellant had originally claimed to have been the
       victim in the incident until confronted with this footage,  at  which
       point he pleaded guilty. The sentencing judge noted  the  Appellant's
       advocate's (doubtless inevitable) concession that  this  was  a  high
       culpability case where it was self-evident that there was  an  intent
       to  commit  more  serious  harm  than  happened  to  eventuate,  with
       aggravating features such as the offence taking place on a busy road.
       Due mitigation was afforded the guilty plea, albeit one that  was  at
       the  courtroom  door,  such  that  eight  months'  imprisonment   was
       appropriate.

   23. Judge Monson concluded that notwithstanding the  absence  of  medical
       evidence showing serious  harm  to  the  Appellant's  victim  it  was
       appropriate to accept that he had intended serious  harm,  given  the
       evidence recounted in the sentencing remarks: thus the  Secretary  of
       State just made out his case as to the Appellant falling under  Rules
       399/399A. That finding has not been challenged in the  appeal  before
       me.

   24. The Appellant had provided evidence of  gainful  employment  for  the
       period leading up to his conviction and sentence, having worked on  a
       self-employed basis and at a car wash,  from  June  2016  until  July
       2017, and thereafter with SNDE Shawarma, earning  �487.50  net,  with
       earnings recorded by his P60 of �2,382.70 for  the  tax  year  ending
       April 2016. Nevertheless  his  partner's  bank  account  was  heavily
       overdrawn  notwithstanding  the  receipt  of  substantial   universal
       credit. Supporting evidence included testimonials such as one  family
       friend, but there was little by way of integrative  evidence  in  the
       UK. Doubtless as an ethnic Kurd he  would  suffer  discrimination  in
       Iran, but this was not demonstrated to be a very significant obstacle
       to integration.

   25. The Appellant's witness statement records  that  he  shared  parental
       responsibilities with [J] before his incarceration, accompanying  her
       to doctors' appointments during  her  pregnancy,  and  his  life  now
       involved around [M].  His partner and son visited him in  prison.  He
       loved them and could not comprehend  life  without  them.  He  feared
       capital punishment if he fell foul of the  strict  Iranian  religious
       laws and did not feel well connected to Iranian  culture.  He  feared
       for [J]'s life if she sought to practice her religion in Iran. He had
       had a lump in his lower back which required an operation in May 2018.
       He was carrying out  ad  hoc  work  to  support  his  family.  Recent
       payslips recorded his employment at a car wash on a similar income to
       that already referenced.

   26. [J]'s witness statement set out that she could not establish  a  life
       for herself in Iran. The Appellant had been a good  companion  and  a
       great partner, and met all his fatherly duties; the love and trust in
       their house is an ideal atmosphere for [M]  to  grow  up  in  a  safe
       environment. She felt that she could not have got  through  pregnancy
       without him.

   27. A family friend, [SQ], produced a statement stating that he felt that
       the Appellant had learned a lesson from his prison sentence. [J]  and
       [M] relied on the Appellant emotionally and financially: he  provided
       for them well. Their separation would have a negative impact  on  his
       relationship with [J] and would  hinder  [M]'s  development.  Similar
       statements were provided by [HR], [PR], and [SD] (their landlord).

  Legal framework and conclusions

   28. The Immigration Rules state:

           "398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human
           Rights Convention, and


           ...


           the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
           public good and in the public interest because, in the view of
           the Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm
           or they are a persistent offender who shows a particular
           disregard for the law, the Secretary of State in assessing that
           claim will consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,
           if it does not, the public interest in deportation will only be
           outweighed by other factors where there are very compelling
           circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs 399
           and 399A.


           ...


           399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)
           applies if -


                 (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                 relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is
                 in the UK, and


                       (i) the child is a British Citizen; or


                       (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for
                       at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date
                       of the immigration decision; and in either case


                            (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to
                            live in the country to which the person is to
                            be deported; and


                            (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to
                            remain in the UK without the person who is to
                            be deported; or


                 (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship
                 with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or
                 settled in the UK, and


                       (i) the relationship was formed at a time when the
                       person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their
                       immigration status was not precarious; and


                       (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to
                       live in the country to which the person is to be
                       deported, because of compelling circumstances over
                       and above those described in paragraph EX.2. of
                       Appendix FM; and


                       (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to
                       remain in the UK without the person who is to be
                       deported.


           399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)
           applies if -


                 (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for
                 most of his life; and


                 (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and




                 (c) there would be very significant obstacles to his
                 integration into the country to which it is proposed he is
                 deported."


29. Leaving aside the private life route which  on  preserved  findings  has
   already been ruled on adversely to the Appellant, the Immigration  Rules
   lay down two routes by which deportation might be resisted for a  person
   sentenced  to  between  one  and  four  years'  imprisonment,  or  whose
   criminality is assessed as involving  "serious  harm".  There  are  then
   specific  thresholds  to  be  met  depending  on  whether  there  is   a
   relationship with a relevant child,  family  life  with  a  partner,  or
   private life.

30. There is the partner route by which family life  is  established  via  a
   genuine and subsisting relationship with a British  citizen  or  settled
   partner (r399(b)):

     - where the relationship was formed at a time when the deportee was in
       the UK lawfully and their immigration status was not precarious


     - where it would be unduly harsh for their partner to  live  with  the
       deportee abroad or without them in the  UK,  because  of  compelling
       circumstances over and above the Appendix FM level as  expressed  in
       EX.2, i.e. exceeding  "very  significant  difficulties/very  serious
       hardship."


31. There is then the child route, which (so far as  relevant  here)  for  a
   British citizen child poses the question  as  to  whether  it  would  be
   unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK  without  the  Appellant.
   Approving the approach taken by the  Upper  Tribunal,  in  KO  (Nigeria)
   [2018] UKSC 53 the Supreme Court  held  that  the  consequences  for  an
   individual will be 'harsh' if they are 'severe' or 'bleak' and they will
   be 'unduly' so if they are 'inordinately' or 'excessively' harsh  taking
   into account all of the circumstances of the individual': all  of  which
   represents a higher threshold than identifying whether the  consequences
   were merely "undesirable."

32. Outside the Rules, regard must be had to section 117C of the NIAA  2002:



      "117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving  foreign
      criminals


      (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.


      (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the
      greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.


      (3)  In the case  of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
      sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  four  years  or  more,  the
      public  interest  requires  C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
      Exception 2 applies.


      (4)  Exception 1 applies where-


           (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
           of C's life,


           (b)  C is socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
           Kingdom, and


           (c)   there  would  be  very  significant   obstacles   to   C's
           integration into the country  to  which  C  is  proposed  to  be
           deported.


      (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect  of  C's
      deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


      (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced  to  a
      period of imprisonment of at least four  years,  the  public  interest
      requires deportation unless there are very  compelling  circumstances,
      over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.


      (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken into
      account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to  deport
      a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision
      was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the  criminal  has   been
      convicted."


33. Those who do not qualify for  these  routes  under  the  Rules  for  one
   reason or another face a very high residual test if they  are  to  avoid
   deportation. This is the same whether the question is  posed  within  or
   outwith the Rules. Rule 398 states  that  "the  Secretary  of  State  in
   assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies
   and, if it does not, the public interest in  deportation  will  only  be
   outweighed  by  other  factors   where   there   are   very   compelling
   circumstances over and above  those  described  in  paragraphs  399  and
   399A."

34. Outside the Rules, the public interest in deportation  is  expressed  by
   the considerations identified in sections 117C-117D of  the  NIAA  2002,
   and will only be outweighed  by  other  factors  where  there  are  very
   compelling circumstances over and above the  three  private  and  family
   life routes just described. As stated in NA (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA  Civ
   662, vis-�-vis medium offenders (i.e. those convicted of between one and
   four years' imprisonment) �27:

"... [F]all back protection of the kind stated in section 117C(6) avails
both (a) serious offenders and (b) medium offenders who fall outside
Exceptions 1 and 2. On a proper construction of section 117C(3), it
provides that for medium offenders 'the public interest requires C's
deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies or unless there are
very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions
1 and 2.'"


35. The Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) went on to explain �29 that

"A foreign offender who has to demonstrate very compelling circumstances
over and above those described in the exceptions is not disentitled from
seeking to rely on (factual) matters which fall within the scope of
exceptions 1 and 2. A person in that position is entitled to rely both on
circumstances that fall within and outside the exceptions in order to
establish that his article 8 claim is sufficiently strong."


36. The Supreme Court in Hesham Ali makes a series of  important  points  as
   to how an appeal is to be considered outside the Rules including these:

   a)       The overall question is whether a fair balance has been  struck
      between the private and family life  in  existence,  and  the  public
      interest;


   b)       A national government is permitted to  weight  the  balance  in
      favour of the public interest if it considers that is necessary - the
      United Kingdom has done this very thing  via  the  Immigration  Rules
      cited above, alongside section 117C-D of the Nationality  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002;


   c)       That weighting of the balance is achieved by  the  requirements
      expressed in various government policy statements and in  the  Rules:
      in general the focus now is on the existence of a  compelling  rather
      than an exceptional case (in Hesham Ali the Rules then in force  made
      exceptionality  the  reference  point).  Given  the  expertise   that
      government had in assessing the public interest, courts and tribunals
      should  attach  considerable  weight  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
      assessment;


   d) It would be necessary to show "a very strong case indeed"  where  the
      Rules and statute required  "very  compelling  circumstances"  to  be
      demonstrated;


   e)        Nevertheless,  whatever   the   public   interest   to   which
      considerable weight had to be given, it was necessary  to  feed  into
      the analysis the facts of the particular case.


37. The authorities at Court of Appeal level post-Hesham Ali make clear  the
   height of the hurdle that confronts putative deportees. In NA (Pakistan)
   [2016] EWCA Civ 662 Jackson LJ stated that "The commonplace incidents of
   family life, such as ageing parents in poor health or the  natural  love
   between parents and children, will not be  sufficient."  In  WZ  (China)
   [2017] EWCA  Civ  795  Sir  Stanley  Burnton  opined  that  it  was  not
   sufficiently out of the ordinary for a man living with his wife and  two
   British citizen children to establish a low risk of reoffending where he
   had been sentenced to two years'  imprisonment  for  drugs  offences.  A
   similar point is made, on facts even closer to those here, by  Sales  LJ
   in Mwesezi  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1104.  He  emphasises  at  �22  that  the
   circumstances in Maslov, where the Strasbourg Court indicated that "very
   serious reasons" were required to justify the deportation of a  youthful
   criminal who had  only  offended  during  their  minority,  were  to  be
   distinguished from  the  situation  where  very  serious  offences  were
   committed well into adulthood. Also at  �22  Sales  LJ  notes  that  the
   ordinary love and affection between  family  members  falls  well  below
   anything amounting to compelling circumstances.

38. As adroitly noted by Mr Jafar,  Judges  of  the  Grand  Chamber  of  the
   European Court of Human Rights have noted the value of  a  parent  to  a
   child, see the concurring opinion of Judge Pinto de  Albuquerque  joined
   by Judge Vu?ini? in De Souza Ribeiro v. France (no. 22689/07), footnotes
   41-42, referencing Article 1 of the United  Nations  Convention  on  the
   Rights of the Child and Articles 9 and 10 specifically for the right not
   to  be  separated  from  one's  family  except  where  a  court  decides
   otherwise, and noting:

      "Moreover, scientific literature  has  already  established  that  the
      abrupt separation of a young person from his or her family  can  cause
      irreversible, long-lasting, painful psychological  damage,  especially
      when that physical separation implies the severance of all  ties  with
      the core family (mother, father and brothers and sisters).  Separating
      a young son  or  daughter  from  their  parents  can  have  profoundly
      negative effects, such as  low  self-esteem,  a  general  distrust  of
      others, mood disorders, including depression and anxiety,  socio-moral
      immaturity and inadequate social skills (see, for instance, Caye,  J.,
      McMahon, J., Norris, T., and Rahija, L. (1996), "Effects of separation
      and  loss  on  attachment",  Chapel  Hill:  School  of  Social   Work,
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)."


39. These then are my conclusions  on  the  appeal,  in  the  light  of  the
   evidence and legal framework set out above.

40. Firstly, I address the question posed by the  Immigration  Rules:  would
   the Appellant's expulsion from the UK be "unduly harsh" for  the  family
   he leaves behind? The Appellant has lived in the United  Kingdom  for  a
   significant period, having been born in January 2009, arriving in the UK
   in November 2005 aged 15�, and now being aged 29. His  ability  to  meet
   the private life route under  the  Rules  has  already  been  determined
   adversely to him; outside the Rules,  of  course,  this  aspect  of  his
   Article 8 rights retain relevance.  This is  not  a  case  like  Maslov,
   however, where there is offending  during  the  Appellant's  youth;  his
   single act of significant offending has taken place well into adulthood.
   He has not lived in Iran for many years. He has  limited  family  there,
   but he may well have extended family members who would offer him support
   if he was truly in need. Besides, a young man who  can  earn  money  for
   themselves can make their way in the world without family; doubtless  he
   will face a harsher existence than would otherwise be the case,  and  he
   would suffer some discrimination as a Kurd, but the  preserved  findings
   already hold that this would not be unduly harsh.

41. The fundamental difficulty facing the Appellant,  as  is  doubtless  the
   case for any comparatively new father facing deportation where there  is
   no  evidence  raising  issues  of  special  dependency  via  a  lack  of
   alternative support within the family or  a  child's  particular  health
   needs, is that it is very difficult to identify any additional  feature,
   save for the  separation  which  is  inevitable  following  deportation,
   affecting the  nature  and  quality  of  the  relationship  between  the
   Appellant and his partner and child. I cannot detect any  such  evidence
   here. The witness statements emphasise the Appellant's important role in
   his child's development. But he has already been absent for her life for
   a significant period during  his  imprisonment.  [J]  clearly  has  some
   supportive family around her.

42. That no doubt is why Mr Jafar is compelled to cite generalised  evidence
   (via opinions expressed in Strasbourg)  of  the  potential  difficulties
   posed by deportation given the inevitable  separation  that  will  ensue
   between parent and child. However, that  represents  the  very  starting
   point for the deportation process, one which Parliament  has  considered
   palatable bearing in mind the relative interests in play. As  Sedley  LJ
   stated in Lee [2011] EWCA Civ 348 �27: "The tragic consequence  is  that
   this family, short-lived as it has been, will  be  broken  up  for  ever
   because of the appellant's  bad  behaviour.  That  is  what  deportation
   does."

43. I have noted the reference to [J] needing her  sister's  support  during
   the Appellant's imprisonment, from  the  decision  below.  However,  the
   witness statements do not specify any particular enduring problems  that
   were identified during  the  Appellant's  incarceration.  I  infer  that
   family support is indeed available. She will not be left alone  to  fend
   for herself. Of course, the need for permanent support is different to a
   short-term need. Life will indubitably be harder for  mother  and  child
   than would otherwise be the case. However, there are a great many single
   parents who make a decent life for their children.

44. In the light of  these  considerations,  I  do  not  consider  that  the
   Appellant has established that his family will face  consequences  which
   are "unduly harsh" if they remain in the UK without him (the other  side
   of the enquiry, that life for them abroad would be  "unduly  harsh"  has
   been understandably conceded by the Home Office,  a  conclusion  that  I
   would myself endorse; but they have to establish that both possibilities
   meet the test under  the  Rules).  I  am  willing  to  accept  that  the
   consequences will be foreseeably "harsh" ("severe"  or  "bleak"),  given
   that [J]'s future ability to care for their son will be less than  would
   be the case were the family to remain intact.  However I  cannot  accept
   that  those  consequences  are  "unduly"  harsh,  such  that  they   are
   "inordinately" or  "excessively"  harsh  taking  into  account  all  the
   circumstances.  I consider that the circumstances here fall short of the
   threshold for undue harshness identified in KO (Nigeria).

45. Nor do I consider that the "very  compelling"  threshold  (the  relevant
   one for a medium level  offender  who  cannot  meet  the  Rule  399/399A
   requirements) is met outside the Rules.

46. It is difficult to identify any significant feature  of  the  case  that
   has not already been catered for in my consideration above. I appreciate
   that all those factors potentially fall for reconsideration outside  the
   Rules, but  absent  some  distinct  additional  factors  to  bring  into
   account, one's conclusions are inevitably the same outside as within the
   Rules.  A  person  whose  circumstances  fall  exclusively  within   the
   exceptions may of course still be able to  demonstrate  very  compelling
   circumstances if the facts they assert go well beyond a bare case  under
   the exceptions, where the matters relied upon are especially compelling:
   OP (Jamaica) [2018] EWCA Civ 316.

47. In carrying out this exercise I have regard to the fact that  the  rules
   found within section 117C do not  provide  for  "any  further  room  for
   balancing of  the  relative  seriousness  of  the  offence,  beyond  the
   difference between the two categories ... other than is inherent in  the
   distinction drawn by the  section  itself  by  reference  to  length  of
   sentence" (ie the two categories of cases that have to reach  the  "very
   compelling" threshold and those that do not": see Lord  Carnwath  in  KO
   (Nigeria) �20, 23). So I have been careful not to hold  the  Appellant's
   offending against his son - at least more than is inevitable in applying
   the general requirement that the scheme of statute and Rules shifts  the
   benchmark to the "very compelling" threshold.

48. The starting point is  that  the  Appellant  has  been  convicted  of  a
   serious offence, as set out above. It is of course not  at  the  highest
   level (four years plus) under the statutory framework: but  it  must  be
   recognised as a medium level offence (albeit at  the  low  end  of  that
   scale), given the finding that it involved serious harm. So there  is  a
   significant public interest in his expulsion,  notwithstanding  that  he
   has not reoffended. Rehabilitation is, as the  authorities  remark,  the
   least one can expect of an offender.

49. I have no doubt that the Appellant's son's best interests  would  be  to
   be raised in a loving environment with both parents  present,  and  with
   the advantage of his father being present as a male role model. I accept
   that the general considerations identified in the concurring opinion  in
   De Souza Ribeiro strongly indicate potential dangers to any child's well-
   being where they are abruptly separated from one parent.  But I  do  not
   consider that can be said to be a "very  compelling"  factor.  It  is  a
   routine factor present in many deportation cases involving family  life.
   Parliament has chosen to set the bar higher than that.

50. Reconsidering the factors above in the context of section  117C  to  ask
   whether the family's separation is  disproportionate  because  of  "very
   compelling" features being present, I do not accept any such factors are
   present. I appreciate that the Appellant will face  diminished  personal
   circumstances if he has to return to Iran,  where  he  lacks  social  or
   other connections given he has lived in the UK in recent years and given
   that some family members have left the country (though  others  such  as
   his mother have returned there), but he  nevertheless  has  some  family
   there. He has not raised any cogent challenge to the conclusion  of  the
   Secretary of State that he could be expected to find work in  Iran,  and
   he was granted residence in the UK on the basis of factors such  as  his
   length of residence and connections here, at  a  time  when  he  had  no
   criminal record. As a relatively young man who has  work  experience  in
   the UK I believe he will be able to reintegrate in  Iran;  he  may  well
   find life there something of a "culture shock" but  as  the  authorities
   show,  that  does  not  amount  to  a  very  significant   obstacle   to
   integration, and nor to my mind would any culture shock, taken with  the
   relatively routine consequences of his separation from his family, reach
   the threshold of "very compelling".

51. It is very sad that [J], who like their child is an innocent  victim  of
   the consequences of the Appellant's offence, now  faces  a  real  chance
   that her relationship with him will not survive due to the long (if  not
   indefinite) physical separation they now face. But she has other  family
   members to whom to turn. I do not find that the factors  of  family  and
   private  life,  including  the  son's  best  interests,   outweigh   the
   significant public interest in the Appellant's deportation identified by
   section 117C where an offence involves "serious  harm."  So  the  appeal
   falls to be dismissed.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
