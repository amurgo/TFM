Representation:

For the Appellant      Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent     Ms Bhachu, Counsel, instructed by Marsh & Partners

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall,  in
       the  interests  of  convenience  and  consistency,   replicate   the
       nomenclature of the decision at first instance.

    2. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Albania.  She  came  to  the  United
       Kingdom on February 4, 2014 and applied for asylum  on  February  6,
       2014. On September 1, 2014  the  respondent  refused  to  grant  her
       asylum under paragraph 336 HC 395 and she also made  a  decision  to
       remove her as an illegal entrant from the United Kingdom by  way  of
       directions under paragraphs 8-10 of schedule 2  to  the  Immigration
       Act 1971.

    3. The appellant appealed this decision on September  18,  2014,  under
       section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

    4. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal De Haney  on
       January 21, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on February  9,  2015
       he allowed her appeal on asylum and article 3 ECHR grounds.

    5. The respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  February  12,  2015
       submitting the Judge had erred by taking as  his  starting  point  a
       "concession" that the respondent accepted she  had  been  trafficked
       and had been forced into prostitution. The grounds  of  appeal  made
       clear that this was  an  erroneous  starting  point.  Permission  to
       appeal was given by Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Murray on February 24, 2015.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal did make an anonymity direction and pursuant
       to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  I
       extend that Order.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both representatives.

    8. Ms Johnstone relied on the grounds of appeal and the content of  the
       refusal letter. She submitted that although the Judge had  made  his
       own findings these followed on from an erroneous assumption that the
       respondent did not dispute the core of the  appellant's  claim  that
       she had been trafficked. Paragraph [21] of the refusal  letter  made
       it clear that her account was not accepted.

    9. Ms Bhachu adopted her skeleton argument and  submitted  that  whilst
       the Judge's decision wrongly stated the respondent's  position  this
       did not materially affect the Judge's decision because  he  had  set
       out in detail why he accepted the claim. He had set out exactly  why
       he felt the appellant had been trafficked and why she  would  be  at
       risk on return. Although he had not  referred  specifically  to  the
       country guidance decision of AM and BM (Trafficked Women) Albania CG
       [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC)  the  Judge  had  clearly  had  regard  to  the
       guidance therein.

   10. Having considered the submissions I was satisfied there was an error
       in law for the simple reason that the Judge had started the position
       that the respondent had accepted the appellant had  been  trafficked
       and that she had been forced into working as a prostitute for over a
       year. This was not the respondent's position and taking into account
       the Judge went onto find her account of escape lacked credibility  I
       was satisfied the decision was materially flawed.

   11. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

      Remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute the normal
      approach to determining appeals where an error of law is  found,  even
      if some further fact finding is necessary."

   12. Ms Johnstone invited me to remit the matter back to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and in light of the Practice Direction I agreed the  matter
       should be remitted.

   13. Ordinarily I would expect this appeal to be listed before me but  in
       the event this case cannot be listed before me by the end  of  March
       2016 then I am content for the matter to be listed before any  Judge
       of the First-tier Tribunal.

   14. It goes without saying that  once  that  date  has  been  fixed  the
       appellant should serve on both the Tribunal and the  respondent  any
       updated bundle of evidence that is to be relied on.

DECISION

   15. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set  aside  the
       decision.

   16. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh
       appeal hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
       Enforcement Act 2007.
