                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals against  a  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Raymond  promulgated  on  28th  August
    2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male citizen of Ghana born 16th September 1983 who in
    June 2013 applied for entry clearance to join his spouse Natasha Brown-
    Acquaye (the Sponsor) who is a British citizen.

 4. The  application  was  refused  on  16th  August  2013  initially  with
    reference to paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules, the ECO taking
    the view that because the Claimant had previously  overstayed,  he  had
    contrived in a significant way  to  frustrate  the  intentions  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. In addition it was not accepted that the  parties  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting  relationship  nor  that  they  intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the United Kingdom, and the application was also refused
    on financial grounds.  The reason for refusal on financial grounds  was
    that specified documents had not been submitted with the application to
    prove that the Sponsor had an income of at least �18,600 per annum,  as
    the Sponsor's payslips and bank statements covering  a  period  of  six
    months prior to  the  date  of  application  had  not  been  submitted.
    Finally the application was refused as there was no evidence  that  the
    Claimant satisfied the English language requirements.

 6. The Claimant lodged an appeal, and the application was reviewed  by  an
    Entry Clearance Manager who conceded that the  Claimant  satisfied  the
    English language requirements, as the appropriate test certificate  had
    been submitted.  It was also conceded that  the  Claimants  actions  in
    previously overstaying did  not  constitute  aggravating  factors,  and
    therefore the ECO no longer relied upon paragraph 320(11).

 7. The appeal was heard by Judge Raymond (the judge) on 12th August  2014,
    with the  issues  to  be  decided  being  whether  the  parties  had  a
    subsisting relationship and intended  to  live  permanently  with  each
    other, and whether the  financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  were
    satisfied.

 8. The judge heard evidence from the Sponsor and found in  favour  of  the
    Claimant under the Immigration Rules, and therefore allowed the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  The judge did  not  therefore  go  on  to
    consider Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the
    1950 Convention) although this had been raised as a ground of appeal.

 9. The ECO was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   There
    was no challenge to the findings that the parties  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and intended  to  live  permanently  with  each
    other, but the findings made by the judge in relation to  finance  were
    challenged as it  was  contended  that  in  the  absence  of  specified
    evidence,  the  judge  had  erred  in  finding   that   the   financial
    requirements of Appendix FM were satisfied.

10. Permission to appeal was granted and there was a hearing before  me  on
    28th November 2014.  I found that the judge erred in law and set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal.   In  brief  summary  it  was
    apparent that incomplete financial documentation had been submitted  to
    the ECO.  Although further documents had been submitted to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, the documentation was still incomplete when the  hearing
    took place on 12th August 2014,  and  the  judge  gave  the  Claimant's
    solicitors a period of six days following the hearing,  to  submit  the
    missing documentation.

11. Further documents were then submitted, which included  bank  statements
    covering a period of six months prior to the application being made and
    further payslips.  However the  payslip  for  May  2013  had  not  been
    submitted, and therefore payslips covering the six month  period  prior
    to the date of application had not been submitted.  For this  reason  I
    found that the judge erred in allowing the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules.

12. Full details of the application for permission to appeal, and the grant
    of permission, and my full reasons for finding an error of law are  set
    out in my decision dated 1st December 2014.

13. I was asked not to proceed and remake the decision but  to  adjourn  to
    allow the Sponsor an opportunity to obtain  a  copy  of  her  May  2013
    payslip, and submit this in order  to  prove  that  all  the  specified
    documentation required had been produced, and  therefore  the  decision
    could be remade and allowed.

14. There was no objection to the proposed  adjournment,  and  I  therefore
    agreed to adjourn the  hearing  until  9th  January  2015,  and  issued
    directions that the missing payslip should be submitted  at  least  ten
    clear days before the next hearing date.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing 9th January 2015

15. Mr Kandola confirmed that the Claimant's representatives had  submitted
    the May 2013 payslip together with a letter from the Sponsor's employer
    confirming its authenticity, and it was  therefore  conceded  that  the
    required specified evidence  had  been  submitted  and  the  Claimant's
    appeal should be allowed  as  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  were
    satisfied.

16. I announced that the appeal was  allowed  and  that  I  would  issue  a
    written decision.

My Conclusion and Reasons

17. Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal at the hearing
    on 28th November 2014, the only issue before the Upper Tribunal related
    to the financial provisions of Appendix FM.

18. The burden of proof was on the Claimant, and the standard a balance  of
    probability.

19. I am satisfied that the Sponsor was at the relevant time, and still is,
    in employment.  I am satisfied  that  her  annual  income  exceeds  the
    required  minimum  of  �18,600.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  required
    specified documentation has now been submitted.

20. Because the Sponsor is in salaried employment in  the  United  Kingdom,
    the documentation that must be submitted to prove her salary is set out
    in paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE.

21. Paragraph 2(a)(i) states that payslips must  be  submitted  covering  a
    period of six months prior to the date of application  if  the  Sponsor
    has been employed by the current employer for at least six months.   In
    this case the Sponsor has been employed by her current employer for  at
    least six months, and has submitted payslips covering  the  six  months
    prior to the date of application which was made in June 2013.  The only
    payslip that was missing before the First-tier Tribunal, related to May
    2013, and that has now been  provided,  together  with  an  appropriate
    covering letter from the Sponsor's employer.

22. Paragraph 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE requires a letter  from  the  employer
    who issued payslips confirming the employment and gross annual  salary,
    the length of employment, the period over which the individual has been
    paid the level of salary relied upon in the application, and  the  type
    of employment.   A  letter  from  the  Sponsor's  employment  has  been
    submitted covering these points.

23. Paragraph 2(c) requires that personal bank statements must be submitted
    covering the same period as covered by the payslips,  and  the  Sponsor
    submitted those  bank  statements,  showing  that  the  salary  in  her
    payslips was paid into her account.

24. In addition the Sponsor submitted her P60 tax form, for  the  tax  year
    ending April 2013, which confirmed that her salary was �24,145.25.

25. The Claimant's appeal was therefore allowed because, as conceded at the
    hearing before me by Mr Kandola, it had been proved  that  the  Sponsor
    had a salary in excess of �18,600, and the specified evidence  set  out
    in Appendix FM-SE had, eventually, been provided.

26. Because the Claimant's appeal was allowed under the Immigration  Rules,
    I was not asked to go on and consider Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

Notice of Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier  Tribunal  and  there  has
been no request to the Upper Tribunal for anonymity.  I  make  no  anonymity
order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the Claimant's appeal has been allowed I have considered  whether  it  is
appropriate to make a fee award.  I find that it is  not.   The  application
was correctly refused because the  specified  financial  documents  had  not
been submitted with the application.  The defects in the documentation  were
not remedied when the appeal was submitted nor at  the  hearing  before  the
First-tier Tribunal.  There is therefore no fee award.
