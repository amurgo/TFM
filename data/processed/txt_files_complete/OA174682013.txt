                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  6th  June  1970.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent  dated  7th  August  2013
    refusing him leave to enter the United Kingdom under paragraph EC-P.1.1
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant wished to  join
    his wife, Mrs Raina Khanam a United Kingdom citizen ("the Sponsor").

2.   The Appellant's appeal was allowed at first instance by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Majid sitting at Taylor House on 24th October 2014.
     The Respondent appeals with leave against that decision and the matter
    therefore comes before me in the  first  place  as  an  appeal  by  the
    Respondent.  For the reasons which I set out in  some  detail  below  I
    have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on  the  grounds
    of a material error of law and have proceeded to rehear the appeal.   I
    therefore continue to refer to the parties as they were known at  first
    instance for the sake of convenience.

Immigration Law and Rules relevant to the Appellant

3.   Section EC-P sets out the requirements to be met  for  entry  clearance
    as a partner.  Sub-paragraph (c) states that  the  applicant  must  not
    fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-EC suitability -
    entry clearance.  Section S-EC.2.2 states that  an  applicant  will  be
    refused entry clearance on grounds of suitability where there has  been
    a failure to disclose material facts in  relation  to  the  application
    whether or not that was to the Appellant's  knowledge.   Section  E-ECP
    sets out the relationship requirements and includes at E-ECP  2.6  that
    the relationship between  the  applicant  and  their  partner  must  be
    genuine and subsisting and at 2.10 that the applicant and partner  must
    intend to live together permanently in the United Kingdom.

4.   The applicant must satisfy the financial requirements  under  paragraph
    E-ECP3.1.  The applicant  must  provide  specified  evidence  from  the
    sources listed in paragraph E-ECP3.2 of a specified gross annual income
    for the Sponsor of at least  �18,600.   Appendix  FM-SE  sets  out  the
    specified evidence which must be produced by an applicant in  order  to
    be able to demonstrate that they meet that financial requirement. Where
    an applicant relies on the Sponsor's paid employment  this  includes  a
    letter from the employer who issued the wage  slips.  The  letter  must
    confirm the  person's  employment  and  gross  salary,  the  length  of
    employment, the period over which they have been  paid,  the  level  of
    salary relied upon in the application and the type of employment.

5.    Where  an  applicant  relies  on  the  Sponsor's  self-employment  the
    applicant must supply remuneration evidence of ongoing  self-employment
    through  evidence  of   payment   of   class   2   national   insurance
    contributions.  If the business  is  not  required  to  produce  annual
    audited accounts the latest  unaudited  accounts  and  an  accountant's
    certification of confirmation from an accountant who is a member  of  a
    UK recognised supervisory body should be given.  There should  also  be
    provided personal bank statements for the same twelve month  period  as
    the tax return showing that the income from  self-employment  has  been
    paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name  of  the
    person and their partner jointly.

6.   Finally an applicant must show that  they  meet  the  English  language
    requirement.  An applicant must provide specified  evidence  that  they
    have passed an English language test in speaking  and  listening  at  a
    minimum of level A1 of the Common European Framework of  Reference  for
    Languages with a  provider  approved  by  the  Respondent  or  have  an
    appropriate academic  qualification  or  be  exempt  from  the  English
    language requirement (where the applicant is aged 65 years or  over  or
    there are exceptional circumstances which prevent  the  applicant  from
    being able to meet  the  requirement  prior  to  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom).

7.   The burden of establishing that the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules are met rests upon the Appellant and the standard of proof is the
    usual civil standard of the balance of probabilities.  In  addition  in
    this case the Appellant argues that the refusal of his application  for
    entry clearance breaches this country's  obligations  under  Article  8
    (right to  respect  for  private  and  family  life)  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.   The  burden  and  standard  of  proof  of
    establishing this equates with the burden and standard of  proof  under
    the Immigration Rules.

Explanation for Refusal

8.   The Respondent refused the application for the following reasons:

    (i)  Material non disclosure.

         The Appellant had previously made an application for a family visit
         visa and had submitted a passport which gave his date of  birth  as
         16th December 1972.  In the current application under consideration
         the Appellant had provided a new passport with a different date  of
         birth 6th June 1970.  It was not clear why the Appellant's date  of
         birth had changed between the two passports. The Respondent refused
         the application on the grounds of a failure  to  disclose  material
         facts in relation  to  the  application.   The  Appellant  appealed
         against that part of the  decision  arguing  that  the  discrepancy
         about the dates  of  birth  in  the  two  passports  arose  because
         Bangladesh upgraded the passports issued to a  new  digital  style.
         On review by the Entry Clearance Manager this point was conceded.

    (ii) Genuine and subsisting and relationship.

         The Respondent was not satisfied that the relationship was  genuine
         and subsisting.  The marriage had taken place on 13th July 2012 and
         the Appellant and Sponsor were said to have  lived  together  until
         the Sponsor left Bangladesh on 26th July 2012.  The photographs  of
         the wedding and some  photographs  of  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor
         together with some telephone cards did not demonstrate  what  calls
         the cards were used for or whether they were used for calls between
         the Appellant and  Sponsor.   There  was  no  further  evidence  of
         contact between the Appellant and Sponsor since the marriage.   The
         lack of intervening devotion for the entire  twelve  months  period
         since the marriage and the application led the Respondent to  doubt
         that the marriage subsisted.  The Sponsor had not chosen  to  visit
         the Appellant since the marriage in July 2012 and  they  had  spent
         less than two months together since that time.  The Respondent  was
         not satisfied that the Appellant's relationship  with  the  Sponsor
         was genuine or that they intended to live together  permanently  in
         the United Kingdom.

    (iii)    Financial requirements

         The Appellant stated that the Sponsor was employed as a cleaner for
         Copperfield House with a gross annual income of �8,678.78.  It  was
         also said that the Sponsor was self-employed  and  that  her  gross
         annual income was �10,264.  However the Appellant had not  provided
         all  the  documents  to  prove  the  earnings  from  the  Sponsor's
         employment or self-employment.  There was no employment letter with
         the specified details from Copperfield House.  The letter  provided
         only confirmed leave arrangements.  As to the self-employment there
         was a letter from Royal Associates  but  that  did  not  constitute
         unaudited accounts and did  not  adequately  demonstrate  that  the
         Sponsor's income from self-employment was as claimed.  Whilst there
         were regular cash deposits into  the  Sponsor's  bank  account  the
         Respondent was not satisfied that the Sponsor had demonstrated that
         this was the Sponsor's self-employment income.  The Respondent  did
         not accept that the self-employment in fact existed and the  income
         from paid employment from Copperfield  House  was  insufficient  to
         meet the financial requirements.

    (iv) English Language.

         The Appellant had submitted an ESOL entry level certificate in both
         speaking and listening from City and Guilds dated 13th October 2012
         and 10th October 2012 from test centre 821470 as  evidence  of  the
         English  language  proficiency.   However  the  documents  did  not
         indicate that the Appellant has passed an English language test  in
         speaking and listening at a minimum level of A1.  The documents did
         not reliably demonstrate that the Appellant had passed  the  stated
         qualification.

9.   The Appellant's grounds of appeal argued that the relationship  between
    the Appellant and Sponsor was genuine and  subsisting.   The  Appellant
    and  Sponsor  utilised  calling  cards  as  a  cost  effective  way  of
    maintaining regular contact.  Although the parties had had an  arranged
    marriage it had evolved into something deeper.  The Sponsor  maintained
    regular contact with the Appellant when possible.  She  had  sought  to
    ensure that her two adult  children  from  her  previous  marriage  and
    integrated and bonded well with the Appellant.   On  review  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager stated that  the  doubts  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  had  regarding  the  genuine  and  subsisting  nature  of  the
    relationship had not  been  adequately  addressed  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

10.  The grounds of appeal further argued  that  the  Sponsor  had  provided
    wage slips and a P60 as  evidence  of  her  employment  at  Copperfield
    House.  The grounds went on to  argue  (wrongly)  that  the  P60  is  a
    government issued document.  It is not it is issued by the employer  at
    the end of the tax year.  The grounds further argued that  the  Sponsor
    had provided a letter from her employer.  As  to  her  self-employment,
    she had provided a letter from Royal Associates detailing her job.  The
    Sponsor had provided a tax return which indicated her yearly  earnings.
    Again  the  grounds  wrongly  asserted  that  the  tax  return  was   a
    "government certified document".  Further the Sponsor  at  present  was
    now self-employed full-time earning above �18,600.  The Entry Clearance
    Manager's review stated that the Immigration  Rules  were  clear  about
    what documents were required to be produced to evidence income and  the
    Appellant had failed to provide all of  the  required  documents  under
    categories (a) and (f).

11.  The grounds of appeal further argued that the  Appellant  had  provided
    the ESOL entry level certificate and had therefore passed the tests set
    down. The City and Guilds of London Institute was regulated by the High
    Commission.  In  response  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  stated  that
    investigations  conducted  by  City  and  Guilds  and  UK   Visas   and
    Immigration Dhaka revealed inconsistencies in  testing  in  Bangladesh.
    As a result of those investigations the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    satisfied that the documents which the Appellant had provided could not
    be relied upon.  The inconsistencies in testing had  subsequently  been
    addressed by City and Guilds in Bangladesh who  agreed  to  offer  free
    testing to all affected visa applicants.  The Appellant had been issued
    with a letter explaining this on the same day that  he  was  given  his
    refusal notice.  He was offered a free retest.  It was  not  clear  why
    the Appellant had failed to take advantage of this free test given that
    he had ample opportunity to do so.  The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  was
    satisfied that the Entry Clearance Officer was  correct  to  doubt  the
    Appellant's English language ability.

12.  Finally the grounds of appeal argued  that  the  Respondent's  decision
    breached Article 8.  The Sponsor  had  two  children  from  a  previous
    marriage which were described in the grounds of appeal as  "very  young
    and would benefit from having a constant father figure in their lives".
     In fact, contrary to that assertion, the Sponsor's two  children  from
    her previous marriage were born in 1993 and  1996  respectively  making
    them 21 and 18 at the time.  It was not entirely clear why  the  author
    of the grounds of appeal should consider that a 21 year old and  an  18
    year old were "very young".

13.  In response to the argument that the decision breached  Article  8  the
    Entry Clearance Manager stated that there was no evidence  that  either
    the Appellant  or  Sponsor  would  be  unable  to  live  in  Bangladesh
    especially given that the Sponsor did not require a visa to live there.
     The Appellant had chosen to  enter  into  an  arranged  marriage  with
    someone living in another country and was aware that marriage in itself
    would not guarantee that he  would  be  assured  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Appellant and Sponsor could maintain contact using modern
    means of communication and the Sponsor was  free  to  visit  Bangladesh
    whenever she was able to  do  so.   The  decision  did  not  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellant or  his  family  and
    was proportionate under Article 8.

The Hearing at First Instance

14.  In considering the evidence the Judge found (at  paragraph  10  of  his
    determination) that the  Appellant  was  able  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements to show �18,600 accepting the Sponsor's  evidence  to  him
    that she could evidence  the  total  of  �18,942  per  annum  from  her
    employment.  The Respondent had ignored the evidence of the Appellant's
    ability to speak English. The two children of the Sponsor  even  though
    over 18 were both born in the United Kingdom.   The  Judge  quoted  the
    Sponsor's statement in which the Sponsor had said she had  been  unable
    to visit the Appellant in Bangladesh as regularly  as  she  would  have
    liked due to work commitments and  her  children's  school  timetables.
    (The statement does not appear to have dealt with what school timetable
    in particular her 21 year old daughter had).  She said  she  could  not
    leave her 21 year old and 18 year old daughters to travel to Bangladesh
    herself and it was difficult to find a mutually  convenient  period  of
    time.  The  statement  did  not  indicate  that  she  had  visited  the
    Appellant in Bangladesh since the marriage in July 2012 save  that  the
    three had visited the Appellant in the summer of 2014.  She called  the
    Appellant through her line rental from Sky which listed the Appellant's
    Bangladesh mobile numbers.

15.  She had not provided further evidence of her employment at  Copperfield
    House as she had been informed by her employer that the P60  which  she
    also described as "a government issued letter" and  payslips  would  be
    sufficient evidence of employment.  She was now working full-time on  a
    self-employed basis.  At paragraph 19 of his  determination  the  Judge
    stated that the factors outlined in paragraph 10 of  his  determination
    (the Appellant being able to meet the financial requirements etc.) were
    powerful factors which persuaded him that depriving  the  Appellant  of
    protection of Article 8  would  be  disproportionate.   The  Judge  was
    persuaded  that  the  Appellant  could  benefit   from   the   relevant
    Immigration Rules and he allowed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

16.  The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing  that  the  Judge
    had failed to give any or any adequate reasons.  There was no authority
    to support the proposition that the Judge did not have to detail  which
    Rules were applicable, which aspects were in issue and  why  they  were
    all met.  The Judge had failed to indicate which aspects of Appendix FM-
    SE were applicable and when they had been  evidenced.   The  Judge  had
    failed to identify the credibility issues which had emerged  in  cross-
    examination and had failed to account for what was said  on  behalf  of
    the Respondent at the hearing including a failure to  engage  with  the
    live issue of whether the relationship was genuine.

17.  The Judge's handling of Article 8 was not founded on the  statement  of
    the authorities as they are at present.  Sections of the  determination
    were utterly irrelevant and  factually  in  accurate.   The  Judge  had
    relied on authority which was no longer good law and had misapplied the
    case of  Nagre.   The  Judge  had  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    provisions of Section 117A to D of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act  2002.   At  paragraph  15  the  Judge  had  said  that  the
    Appellant's case deserved "an illuminated use of exercise of discretion
    in his favour".  This was more  properly  the  preserve  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and was a clear and material error in law relying  on
    the case of Ukus [2012] UKUT 00307.

18.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge on 7th  January  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal she wrote that there  was  merit  in  the  grounds
    asserting that the Judge has failed to identify  and  engage  with  the
    Immigration Rules applicable to out of country spousal applications and
    Article 8 ECHR. He had failed to conduct any assessment of the evidence
    both in terms  of  its  credibility  and/or  sufficiency  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules or set out the factual matrix from  which  he
    had drawn his Article 8 conclusions.

19.  Following the grant of permission the  Tribunal  issued  directions  to
    the parties that they should prepare for the forthcoming hearing on the
    basis that if the Upper Tribunal decides to set aside the determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal any further evidence including supplementary
    oral evidence that the Upper Tribunal might  need  to  consider  if  it
    decided to remake the decision can be so considered at that hearing.

The Error of Law Stage

20.  In the first place I had to decide whether there was an  error  of  law
    in the determination such that it fell  to  be  set  aside.   In  brief
    submissions the Presenting Officer relied on the grounds of appeal  and
    the grant of permission to appeal.  The various issues in the case  had
    been insufficiently analysed by the Judge and  there  were  very  large
    credibility issues in the case.  For the Appellant his solicitor relied
    on the documents supplied in the  Appellant's  bundle.   The  principal
    issues were whether the Sponsor could meet the  financial  requirements
    and whether the Appellant could meet  the  language  requirement.   All
    necessary documents were contained  in  the  bundle.   There  had  been
    evidence before the Judge to show that the marriage was subsisting.

21.  I held that there was a material error  of  law  in  the  determination
    such that it fell to be set aside and the  appeal  to  be  reheard.   I
    indicated that I would give fuller reasons in my determination which  I
    now do.  This was a case where a  number  of  issues  were  in  dispute
    between the parties.  Whilst it is correct that the Judge does not need
    to set out each and every piece of evidence put before him a basis  for
    the decision has to be given such that a losing party can reasonably be
    expected to understand why he has lost.  In this case the Judge  failed
    to give adequate reasons for his finding  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    were met particularly how the Sponsor was said  to  have  provided  the
    necessary supporting evidence to demonstrate her earnings.   The  Judge
    failed to indicate why he was satisfied that the Appellant  could  meet
    the English language requirement given the Respondent's objections.  In
    allowing the appeal under Article 8 the Judge had failed to  deal  with
    the provisions of Section 117 A to D and had failed to  deal  with  the
    issue of whether it was reasonable to expect the Sponsor to  travel  to
    Bangladesh to be with the Appellant if he was refused entry  clearance.



The Substantive Hearing Before Me

22.  Having found an error of law the issue  then  arose  as  to  whether  I
    should remit the appeal back to the First-tier to  be  heard  again  or
    whether I should proceed to rehear the appeal  myself.   Neither  party
    indicated to me that they wished the matter to be remitted back  and  I
    did not consider  that  the  requirements  of  the  Senior  President's
    Direction regarding remittals back to the First-tier were met  in  this
    case.  I indicated that the matter would proceed and  enquired  of  the
    Appellant's solicitor whether the Sponsor wished to  give  any  further
    oral evidence.  The solicitor indicated that the Appellant's case could
    be deduced from the Appellant's bundle submitted at first instance  and
    there was no further oral testimony which he wished to call  on  behalf
    of the Appellant.  I  therefore  heard  closing  submissions  from  the
    representatives before reserving my decision.

23.  For the Respondent it  was  argued  that  the  present  appeal  had  no
    reasonable prospects of success and that what the Appellant ought to do
    if he could show that he met the requirements was  to  submit  a  fresh
    application to the Entry Clearance Officer.  It was not in dispute that
    insufficient documentation had been submitted to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer. The  employer's  letter  in  particular  lacked  the  required
    information. The Appellant  could  not  rely  now  in  this  appeal  on
    documents that had come into existence since the date of decision.

24.  For the Appellant reliance was placed on the  skeleton  argument  which
    pointed out that there had been no interview in this case and thus  the
    Appellant had no opportunity to clarify the concerns of the Respondent.
     Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2A(i) stated  that  in  respect  of  salaried
    employment in the United Kingdom  the  applicant  may  in  addition  to
    payslips and personal bank statements submit a  P60  for  the  relevant
    period of employment. Even if that was not done  the  Respondent  could
    still  grant  the  application  if   otherwise   satisfied   that   the
    requirements of the Appendix relating  to  that  employment  were  met.
    There would have been no difficulties to find out what work the Sponsor
    was doing.  There were stamps in the  Sponsor's  passport  showing  how
    long she had been in Bangladesh and when she had returned to the United
    Kingdom.

Findings

25.  The first issue I have to decide is whether the Appellant can meet  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is only if he cannot that I need  to  go  on  to
    consider whether his exclusion from the United  Kingdom  breaches  this
    country's obligations under Article  8.   The  first  issue  which  the
    Appellant had to deal with was whether the marriage between him and the
    Sponsor was genuine and subsisting.  Although the determination is  not
    entirely clear I deduce from the decision at first instance that  Judge
    Majid was satisfied that the relationship  between  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor was genuine and subsisting.  Since he had the benefit of seeing
    the Sponsor give evidence and I have not I  do  not  depart  from  that
    finding.  I appreciate the  Respondent's  argument  that  a  number  of
    matters emerged during cross-examination which in fact  undermined  the
    argument that the marriage was genuine and subsisting.  I was not given
    any details of what those matters might have consisted of but  even  if
    Judge Majid's decision might be  construed  as  a  generous  one  which
    another Judge might not have reached on  the  same  evidence,  that  of
    itself would not have demonstrated an error of law  or  importantly  at
    this stage a finding which I could go behind.  The  issues  in  dispute
    are whether the Sponsor could show that she was earning  in  excess  of
    �18,600 and whether the Appellant could show that  he  had  a  suitable
    English language qualification.

26.  On the issue of finances the Appellant makes two  points.   Firstly  he
    says he has provided sufficient documentation and secondly he  says  if
    the Sponsor has not then the Respondent could have  still  granted  the
    application  anyway.   Dealing  with  the  first  point  as  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager explains the documentation requirements  in  Appendix
    FM-SE are fixed.  The letter from the employer  Copperfield  House  did
    not meet the requirements of the Appendix.  Given the ease  with  which
    false wage slips etc. can be produced  it  is  understandable  why  the
    Immigration Rules require a letter  from  an  employer  confirming  the
    necessary details so that that can be verified by the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer before a decision to grant or refuse entry clearance is  taken.



27.  In this case the details from the employer were  quite  inadequate  (it
    is not suggested that they were adequate).  Some of the confusion which
    has arisen on the Appellant's side may be due to the  false  impression
    that the Appellant and his representatives have that a P60 is  in  some
    way a government issued document.  It is not any more than a wage  slip
    is.  A P60 is a statement by the employer  of  what  the  employee  has
    earned and what tax and other deductions have been  made.   In  a  case
    such as this where the Respondent had a number of objections it is  not
    surprising  that  the  Respondent  was  not  prepared  to   grant   the
    application on the basis of insufficient documentation.

28.  The Appellant has not sought to produce an up-to-date letter  from  the
    Sponsor's employer. The letter might not have been  admissible  but  it
    might have shed some light on the  documentation  which  the  Appellant
    produced at the time of the application. In those circumstances I  find
    that the  Appellant  has  not  submitted  sufficient  documentation  to
    demonstrate the Sponsor's earnings.  Whether or not the Sponsor is  now
    earning more than �18,600 from self-employed income is not  a  relevant
    matter for me since that is postdecision evidence and  could  not  have
    been in the contemplation of the parties at the date of  refusal.   The
    Appellant's remedy in that respect is to  submit  a  fresh  application
    with up-to-date evidence which meets the requirements of the  Rules.  I
    find therefore that the Appellant fails on the issues of maintenance as
    the Sponsor cannot demonstrate through  sufficient  documentation  that
    she earned more than �18,600 at the date of the Respondent's  decision.



29.  Turning to the issue  of  the  English  language  test  the  Respondent
    explained why the  City  and  Guilds  certificate  was  not  considered
    sufficient as City and Guilds  themselves  were  no  longer  supporting
    their own certificates as they realised that the certificates had  been
    open to abuse.  In those circumstances the Respondent acted  reasonably
    by offering the Appellant an  opportunity  to  undertake  a  free  test
    before a final decision on the  application  for  entry  clearance  was
    made.  This the Appellant declined to take up.   What  he  subsequently
    did was to take a test with TOEIC obtaining relatively low scores of 90
    out of 200 for speaking and only 100 out of  495  for  listening.   The
    Appellant took this test thirteen  days  after  he  was  refused  entry
    clearance on the grounds of  sufficient  evidence  to  show  linguistic
    ability.   Although  a  letter  produced  over  a  year   later   dated
    27th September 2014 from UK Education states that the Appellant passed
    his TOEIC exams on 28th August 2013 successfully  the  Appellant's  low
    scores  reinforced  the  view  that  the  Appellant  clearly  had   not
    demonstrated his ability in English at the date of decision.   Even  if
    the TOEIC results show the Appellant has passed  the  English  language
    (which I have  some  reservations  about)  that  is  evidence  obtained
    postdecision and cannot be taken into account in  this  case.   I  find
    therefore that the Appellant  cannot  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    relation to his English language ability either.

30.  The issue  therefore  is  whether  the  Appellant  should  nevertheless
    succeed outside of the Immigration  Rules  under  Article  8.   As  the
    Respondent pointed out the Appellant was  aware  when  he  married  the
    Sponsor in an arranged marriage that would not confer upon him a  right
    to enter the United Kingdom.  The disruption to the family life between
    the Appellant and the Sponsor was caused by the decision of the Sponsor
    to return to the United Kingdom and remain there apart from a visit  in
    the summer of 2014 to the Appellant.   The  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance merely confirms the existing status quo.  There appears to be
    no reason why the Sponsor  could  not  go  to  join  the  Appellant  in
    Bangladesh if she so chose as she evidently maintains  links  with  her
    country of  origin  and  family  life  could  be  continued  elsewhere.
    Alternatively if the Sponsor does not wish to return to  Bangladesh  to
    live with the Appellant, there is no reason why the relationship cannot
    be continued with visits and through modern means of  communication  as
    it has been up until now.

31.  The interference such as  it  is  with  the  family  life  between  the
    Appellant and  the  Sponsor  is  pursuant  to  the  legitimate  aim  of
    immigration control since the Appellant  cannot  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules and the Sponsor could not demonstrate at  the  date  of  decision
    that she had the necessary funds to be able to maintain the  Appellant.
    The legitimate aim is thus the economic wellbeing of  the  country.   I
    also note the provisions of Section  117B  that  an  ability  to  speak
    English is considered to be in the public interest.  It is particularly
    in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United  Kingdom  that
    persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able  to
    speak English because persons who can  speak  English  are  less  of  a
    burden on taxpayers and are  better  able  to  integrate  into  society
    (Section 117B(2).  Furthermore it is in  the  public  interest  and  in
    particular in the interests of the economic  wellbeing  of  the  United
    Kingdom that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom
    are financially independent because such persons are not  a  burden  on
    taxpayers and are better able  to  integrate  into  society  (117B(3)).
    Since the Appellant cannot satisfy either the financial requirements or
    the linguistic requirements of Appendix FM it is  clearly  not  in  the
    public interest that he should nevertheless be admitted into the United
    Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules.

32.  I find therefore that  the  interference  caused  to  the  relationship
    between  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  is  proportionate  to   the
    legitimate aim being pursued because of the statutorily defined  public
    interest and because family life could be continued elsewhere  for  the
    reasons I have given.  I find therefore that the Appellant is not  able
    to show that the refusal of entry  clearance  breaches  this  country's
    obligations under Article 8 and I dismiss his  appeal  under  both  the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the
Respondent's decision to refuse to grant entry clearance.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have overturned the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  because  it
involved the making of an error of law, I also set aside the fee award  made
in that determination such that no fee is payable by the Respondent  to  the
Appellant in this case.
