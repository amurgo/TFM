                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                       (anonymity direction NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. This was an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Clarke, promulgated on 27 February  2017,
    in which she  allowed  Mr  Rahman's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision to refuse the appellant leave to remain under the  family  and
    private life provisions.

 2. However the Tribunal received a letter dated 6 November 2017  from  Taj
    Solicitors,  the  respondent's  representatives,  indicating  that  the
    Secretary of State had made a further decision on 9 June 2017, pursuant
    to the decision of Judge S J Clarke promulgated on  27  February  2017,
    who remitted the case to the respondent.  Mr  Rahman's  representatives
    appealed that decision on 22 June 2017 and are currently  awaiting  the
    fresh hearing on 30  May  2018  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (and
    provided documentary evidence of this chain of events).

 3. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the Secretary  of  State's  conduct,
    was consistent with what was said in the  case  of  Greenwood  (No.  2)
    (para 398 considered) [2015] UKUT 00629 (IAC).  Such is academic as  Ms
    Willocks-Briscoe quite properly submitted that, given  the  actions  of
    the Secretary of State in proceeding to make a  further  decision,  she
    sought to withdraw the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 4. Under Rule 17(1)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case orally at a
    hearing.  Under Rule 17(2) notice of withdrawal will only  take  effect
    if  the  Upper  Tribunal  consents  to  the  withdrawal.   Given,   the
    circumstances, including that Taj Solicitors confirmed in writing on  6
    November 2017 that they were not attending and could not see any  merit
    in the Secretary of State proceeding with the appeal before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, I consent to the withdrawal of the appeal  pursuant  to  Rule
    17(2).

    Notice

The appeal is withdrawn.  The decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  S  J
Clarke stands.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
