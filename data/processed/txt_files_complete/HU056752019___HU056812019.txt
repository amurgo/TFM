Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms G Capel, instructed by Wilsons Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of Sierra Leone born on 15  December  2000
      and 10 October 2002 respectively. They are first cousins. They applied
      on 5 December 2018 for entry clearance to the UK under the category of
      Family Reunion dependant relative of someone with  Refugee  Status  in
      the UK, to join the sponsor, Fatmata Kabia, the biological  sister  of
      the first appellant and the cousin of the second appellant.

   2. In their application it was explained that the sponsor had arrived  in
      the UK on 4 April 2011 and had been kept in slavery for  the  purposes
      of sexual exploitation. She was subsequently recognised as a victim of
      human trafficking and granted asylum. She and  her  brother  had  lost
      both parents, her father having passed away in December 2000  and  her
      mother in January 2011. They lived together until  the  day  she  fled
      Sierra Leone, at which time she left her brother with  their  paternal
      uncle Santigie Kabia and his daughter, the second appellant. When  she
      arrived in the UK the  sponsor  lost  contact  with  her  brother  but
      subsequently managed to  locate  both  appellants  through  a  friend,
      Abibatu Sesay, in September 2016. Their uncle had passed away in  July
      2016 and the two children were on their own and were destitute, living
      in the streets until they were taken in by  a  local  woman,  Aminata,
      whose family did not want them staying at the house. The  sponsor  was
      sending money to them through her friend and wanted them to  join  her
      in the UK. It was submitted that the appellants met  the  requirements
      of paragraph 319X of the immigration rules. The  application  included
      reports of The Child Welfare Society,  a  charity  which  operated  in
      various African countries including Sierra Leone,  which  stated  that
      the children were living in  precarious  conditions.  It  was  claimed
      further that the sponsor was able to maintain the appellants from  the
      public funds she received and that she was to be re-housed  to  larger
      accommodation so that there was sufficient room for them all to reside
      together. It was submitted that the refusal of the applications  would
      be disproportionate and in breach of Article 8.

   3. In  the  decision  refusing  the  appellants'  claim,  the  respondent
      considered that they  were  not  qualifying  family  members  for  the
      purposes of paragraph 352A-352FI of the  immigration  rules  and  that
      Article 8 was not engaged as they had not demonstrated that they had a
      family life with the sponsor.

   4. The appellants appealed against that decision. In  response  to  their
      grounds of appeal, the respondent accepted that paragraph 319X of  the
      immigration rules should have been taken into account, but  considered
      that the requirements of that rule were not met in any event as it had
      not been shown that the sponsor  would  be  able  to  accommodate  and
      maintain the appellants without additional recourse to  public  funds.
      The respondent was also not satisfied that suitable  arrangements  had
      been made for the appellants' care in the UK.  The respondent did  not
      accept that the appellants'  relationship  to  the  sponsor  had  been
      proven, as the birth certificates and identity documents  referred  to
      in the grounds of appeal had not  been  provided.  It  was  still  not
      accepted that Article 8 was engaged on the basis of family life and it
      was considered that refusal of entry clearance  was  proportionate  in
      any event and that there were no exceptional circumstances outside the
      rules.

   5. The appellants' appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Cassel on
      12 December 2019. The sponsor and her partner both gave oral  evidence
      before the judge. The sponsor gave evidence of the children's  current
      circumstances, as they had since been thrown out of Aminata's house  -
      her husband had thrown them out when she was  away  travelling  -  and
      were being temporarily looked after by Abibatu in her small,  one-room
      house, where they had to sleep on the floor. The sponsor continued  to
      be very worried about the children's health and the risks to  them  of
      kidnapping and exploitation.

   6. Judge Cassel did not accept that the appellants and the  sponsor  were
      related as claimed and  found  that  even  if  they  were,  there  was
      conflicting evidence from  the  sponsor  and  her  partner  about  the
      contact between them and no evidence of telephone contact or financial
      remittances. There was no evidence of the sponsor's accommodation  and
      no evidence to support the claim that the council had agreed  to  move
      her to a larger flat so that the children could be  accommodated  with
      her. The judge did not accept the evidence of the sponsor's  partner's
      earnings. The judge found that the requirements of paragraph 319X  had
      not been met and he did not accept that there was family life for  the
      purposes of Article 8. He did not consider that there was a duty under
      section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 as the
      appellants were not in the UK and he  concluded  that  the  appellants
      could not succeed either within or outside the immigration rules.  The
      judge accordingly dismissed the appeals.

   7. The appellant sought, and was granted, permission  to  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal against Judge Cassel's decision. Following the grant of
      permission by the First-tier Tribunal, the matter  came  before  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Pickup on 14 October 2020. UTJ  Pickup  found  material
      errors of law in the judge's decision and set aside the decision  with
      no findings preserved. He directed that the decision be re-made in the
      Upper Tribunal. His reasons for so doing are as follows:

         "2. I have carefully considered  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         tribunal in the light of the submissions made to me and the grounds
         of application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

         3. The grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal:



               a. In finding that the appellants  are  not  related  to  the
                  sponsor  as  claimed,  failed  to  make  findings  on  the
                  reliability of the submitted birth certificates;

               b. Failed to have regard to relevant  evidence  and  to  give
                  reasons;

               c. Made a material misdirection in law as to the  application
                  of 'best interests';

               d. Reached an irrational conclusion that article 8  ECHR  was
                  not engaged;

               e. Erred in finding the decision proportionate;

               f. Failed to take into account or give reasons for  rejecting
                  the sponsor's explanation for the absence of  evidence  of
                  phone calls.

       4.   Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds by  the  First-
          tier  Tribunal  on  31.3.20,  considering   it   arguable   that,
          notwithstanding concerns about the credibility of the sponsor and
          her partner, as well as the lack of evidence provided in a number
          of respects, the judge failed to have sufficient  regard  to,  or
          properly engage with, all the relevant evidence provided, such as
          the Child Welfare Society evidence  or  those  who  had  provided
          witness statements in support. "It is,  therefore,  difficult  to
          understand what view the judge took of such evidence, the reasons
          for that, and the reasons  for  why  it  was  or  may  have  been
          rejected." It was also considered arguably  unclear  whether  the
          judge considered the welfare of  the  children  (both  appellants
          being minors at the date of their  applications),  or  whether  a
          proper analysis of the case outside the Rules was carried out.

       5. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Tan indicated that  he  did  not
          resist the appeal, accepting that various parts of  the  evidence
          had not been properly considered by the judge.

         Relationship of the appellants to the sponsor


       6. At [16] of the decision, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  not
          satisfied that the sponsor and the two appellants were related as
          claimed but did not provide  any  reasons  for  that  conclusion.
          However, in the alternative scenario that they  were  related  as
          claimed, the judge gave some  reasons  for  concluding  that  the
          appellants  had  failed  to  demonstrate  that  they   would   be
          adequately  maintained  and  accommodated  in  the   UK   without
          additional  recourse  to  public  funds.  Reference  is  made  to
          inadequate evidence of accommodation  and  finances.  It  follows
          that the appellants could not meet the requirements of  paragraph
          319X. Mr Tan maintained that this aspect of the decision did  not
          disclose an error of law.

       7. In  relation  to  consideration  outside  the  Rules,  the  judge
          acknowledged the best interests duty from [19]  of  the  decision
          but failed to state  what  conclusion  was  reached  as  to  best
          interests.  On the evidence, the judge  found  there  was  little
          contact between the appellants and the sponsor  and  insufficient
          evidence of family life between them to engage  article  8  ECHR.
          However, it is not  clear  on  what  basis  this  conclusion  was
          reached.

       8. Considered overall, I find that the decision is without  adequate
          or cogent reasoning. There are blunt findings at various parts of
          the decision but no adequate explanation as to what was  accepted
          or rejected, or why. Neither was there sufficient evidence of any
          adequate  consideration  of  the  evidence  relied  on   by   the
          appellants.

       9. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, I find an
          error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  so  that
          it must be set aside to be remade.

      10. After canvassing the matter with the two representatives, I  have
          concluded that the remaking of the decision can be  made  in  the
          Upper Tribunal but should be at  a  face-to-face  hearing,  Field
          House being the most convenient location for the two witnesses to
          be called.

          Decision
          The appeal of the appellants to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
          The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside to be remade
          in the Upper Tribunal.
          I make no order for costs.
          I make no anonymity direction. "

Hearing and submissions

   8. The matter then came before me for a hearing in order for the decision
      to be re-made.  The  appellants  had  provided  further  evidence,  in
      accordance with the directions given by UTJ Pickup, in the form  of  a
      supplementary bundle containing a further statement from the  sponsor,
      evidence of money transfers and telephone calls from  the  sponsor  to
      the appellants,  the  sponsor's  tenancy  agreement  and  council  tax
      statement, evidence of the sponsor's partner's self-employment and tax
      returns and the sponsor's partner's bank statements.

   9. The sponsor, Ms Fatmata Kabia, gave evidence before me. She  explained
      that she had been saving her telephone cards once  she  realised  that
      she needed them. Her telephone  calls  to  the  appellants  varied  in
      length because the connection was so bad and she would  have  to  keep
      calling them back whenever the call was cut off.  The  money  transfer
      forms now submitted showed transfers made  to  Anwar  directly  rather
      than to Abibatu, as Anwar was now an adult and was able to collect the
      money himself.  Ms Kabia said that her partner, Mr Sesay, had moved in
      with her in August 2019 after she received permission from  the  local
      authority in July 2019. The local authority had been provided with his
      details but did not need to add his name to the tenancy agreement. The
      council tax payments were made by Mr Sesay and the  statement  was  in
      his name. The local authority had also confirmed their previous advice
      that they would re-house her if the appellants  came  to  the  UK.  Ms
      Kabia said that she had been applying for jobs but had not  found  one
      yet.

  10. When cross-examined by Ms Cunha, Ms Kabia confirmed that she  had  not
      been working until now because she had had a baby and needed  to  take
      care of him. Her partner's income was the only  income  they  had.  He
      paid the rent of �500 a month. It had  previously  been  paid  through
      housing benefit. The money she sent to the appellants  came  from  her
      partner's salary and the money she received from  the  government.  If
      they moved to a bigger  house,  this  would  be  through  the  housing
      association and the increased rent would be paid by  her  partner  and
      also from her income when she found a job. The  rent  would  still  be
      discounted as it would be a local authority property. Ms Kabia  agreed
      with Ms Cunha that a bigger property would be  needed  to  accommodate
      the appellants. The appellants were still living with Abibatu and  had
      been there since 2018, in the same living conditions.  They  were  not
      destitute or homeless currently. Ms Kabia said  that  her  mother  had
      been part of the Bondu society and that she had  been  initiated  into
      the society herself, but she did not continue to follow it. Aisha  had
      been initiated and had gone through  the  first  stage  of  the  Bondu
      ceremony. Ms Kabia confirmed that the children attended lessons at ISU
      where they were taught English and Maths, but were not  at  an  actual
      school. They were looking for jobs in Sierra Leone but  there  was  no
      work available because of their lack of education.

  11. Mr Sesay then gave his evidence. He confirmed that  he  had  moved  in
      with the sponsor on 15 August 2019 and  that  he  paid  the  rent  and
      council tax. He had signed a contract with BST Electrical Ltd  in  May
      2021. Prior to that he was working for MGL, again as a contractor, but
      in that job he was paid per task. The  work  was  for  Waltham  Forest
      Council. He had been working five days a week, but Covid had had a big
      impact on the hours of work and he had had a big drop  in  his  income
      from April 2020 to April 2021. Since May 2021 the work  had  increased
      hugely as there was a backlog and he was being paid �18  an  hour  and
      working up to six or seven days  a  week.  Mr  Sesay  agreed  with  Ms
      Capel's calculation that his income  from  the  past  month  had  been
      around �3456. His income would go up as he would shortly get  his  ECS
      Gold Card as a fully qualified electrician and could then earn �21  an
      hour. When cross-examined by Ms Cunha, Mr Sesay  agreed  that  if  his
      income went  up,  his  partner  would  receive  less  money  from  the
      government. Their rent would remain the same, but in any event he  was
      hoping to get a mortgage by the end of the year. He also  intended  to
      buy and sell property. Prior to living with the sponsor he  had  lived
      with his fianc�e and their child in a council property. He contributed
      to the upbringing of his child from that  relationship.  He  had  left
      that property in early August  2019  and  lived  with  friends  before
      moving in with the sponsor. They were married on 19 December 2019 in a
      civil marriage. He had a child with the sponsor. Mr Sesay said that he
      did not know about the father of the sponsor's eldest child and he did
      not know why the sponsor had left Sierra Leone.  He  was  from  Sierra
      Leone himself and had last visited there in  2018.  He  had  a  sister
      there and a nephew, but his sister would not be able to look after the
      appellants as they lived a long way away from her.

  12. Both representatives made submissions before me.

  13. Ms Cunha submitted that there was insufficient evidence to  show  that
      the appellants were destitute  or  in  danger  of  becoming  destitute
      imminently. In any event, leaving two adults destitute in Sierra Leone
      would  not  infringe  the  UK's  obligations  under  the   ECHR.   The
      appellants' relationship to  the  sponsor  did  not  fall  within  the
      immigration rules and did not constitute family life outside the rules
      under the principles in Kugathas v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and Rai v Entry Clearance Officer,  New
      Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320. In the  alternative,  the  public  interest
      outweighed the appellants' interests and the UK had to protect its own
      resources here. Ms Cunha submitted that it was not accepted  that  the
      appellants were 'relatives' for the purposes of paragraph 319X as they
      had not been part of the same household as the sponsor before she came
      to the UK, but in any event  there  were  no  serious  and  compelling
      family or other considerations as they  were  being  looked  after  in
      Sierra Leone. Their best interests were served by  being  in  a  place
      where they were being looked after. No weight should be given  to  the
      Child Welfare Society reports as they were speculative in stating that
      the appellants would become destitute if they did not come to the  UK.
      The appellants had formed an independent life in Sierra Leone and  did
      not, therefore, fall within the immigration rules at the time  of  the
      refusal decision. The previous and  current  situation  was  that  the
      appellants would not be accommodated and maintained adequately without
      recourse to public funds. They would be a burden on the taxpayer  and,
      furthermore, they were now adults. The refusal of entry clearance  was
      proportionate.

  14. Ms Capel  submitted  that  the  appellants  met  the  requirements  of
      paragraph 319X as children of a relative who was a refugee in the  UK.
      They met the requirements in terms of relationship to the sponsor.  As
      for the accommodation and maintenance requirements of  the  rules,  Ms
      Capel invited the Tribunal to consider the  unusual  circumstances  of
      Covid 19 in assessing whether the sponsor could meet the threshold. Ms
      Capel relied on the HMRC self-assessment at pages  33  to  34  of  the
      supplementary bundle which  showed  an  income  for  2020/21  for  the
      sponsor's partner, after tax, of �18,167.67,  and  an  average  weekly
      income during  the  pandemic  of  �348.44,  by  her  calculation.  She
      submitted that the situation for May 2021,  after  the  pandemic,  was
      very different, and relying upon the documents at pages 39 to  43  she
      calculated an average weekly income of �864. That  compared  with  the
      Government's income support threshold for a couple over 18  with  four
      children of �391.20. That was sufficient to demonstrate adequate funds
      for the appellants. As for the accommodation,  the  current  residence
      would not be statutorily over-crowded, but  in  any  event  there  was
      enough leeway in the sponsor's partner's income to enable them to move
      to a larger property. The  appellants  had  a  family  life  with  the
      sponsor, for the purposes of Article 8,  given  that  the  immigration
      rule itself allowed  for  that.  The  appellants  had  not  formed  an
      independent life and their best interests were  not  being  met  where
      they were, as their lives were in danger. Ms  Capel  relied  upon  the
      Child  Welfare  Society  reports  as  independent  evidence   of   the
      appellants' circumstances. There were compelling reasons  outside  the
      immigration  rules  and  the  proportionality  balance  was   in   the
      appellants' favour.

Consideration and findings

  15. I start by setting out the  provisions  of  the  relevant  immigration
      rules, in paragraph 319X:

      "Requirements for leave to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  as
      the child of a relative with limited leave to enter or remain  in  the
      United Kingdom as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection.
      319X. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter or
      remain in the United Kingdom as the child of a relative with limited
      leave to remain as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection
      in the United Kingdom are that:
         (i) the applicant is seeking leave to enter or  remain  to  join  a
         relative with limited leave to enter or  remain  as  a  refugee  or
         person with humanitarian protection; and:
         (ii) the relative has limited leave in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
         refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian  protection  and  there  are
         serious and compelling family or other  considerations  which  make
         exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable  arrangements  have
         been made for the child's care; and
         (iii) the relative is not the parent of the child  who  is  seeking
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom; and
         (iv) the applicant is under the age of 18; and
         (v) the applicant is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried
         and is not a civil partner,  and  has  not  formed  an  independent
         family unit; and
         (vi) the applicant can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the
         relative the child is seeking to join without  recourse  to  public
         funds in accommodation which the relative  in  the  United  Kingdom
         owns or occupies exclusively; and
         (vii) the applicant can, and will, be maintained adequately by  the
         relative in the United Kingdom without recourse  to  public  funds;
         and
         (viii) if seeking leave to  enter,  the  applicant  holds  a  valid
         United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this  capacity  or,  if
         seeking leave to remain, holds valid leave to  remain  in  this  or
         another capacity."





  16.  As this is a human rights  appeal,  the  starting  point  is  whether
      family life has been demonstrated for the purposes  of  Article  8(1).
      There was no challenge by Ms Cunha to  the  relationship  between  the
      appellants and sponsor. Her challenge was to the existence  of  family
      life for the purposes of Article 8(1), but she  did  not  dispute  the
      claim that they were related as siblings/cousins. The  relevant  birth
      and  death  certificates  have  been  produced   which   confirm   the
      relationships as claimed and I note also that the author of the  Child
      Welfare  Society  had  no  doubt  as  to  the   relationship,   having
      interviewed the appellants twice (see [43] of the later report).

  17. There was some discussion about the anomaly arising  from  a  possible
      scenario where it was considered that the appellants' relationship  to
      the sponsor did not amount to family life for the purposes of  Article
      8(1) but the appellants otherwise being able to meet the  requirements
      of paragraph 319X on the basis  of  simply  being  'relatives',  there
      being nothing within the rules to suggest that 'relative' was  defined
      by 'family life'.  That was resolved by both parties agreeing that the
      immigration  rules  were  human-rights  compliant  and,  as  this  was
      effectively a family reunion  rule,  it  must  be  the  case  that  it
      envisaged that an ability  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules
      necessarily accepted that family life was established.

  18. In any event, I accept that there is a subsisting family life  between
      the appellants and the sponsor on the basis of the available evidence.
      Although the appellants and the sponsor have not  lived  together  for
      several years and had had no contact for a period of about five years,
      the circumstances which arise in cases of refugee family  reunion  are
      such that periods of separation are inevitable. It is clear  from  the
      evidence, which I accept, that the sponsor  has  been  supporting  the
      appellants financially  for  some  time  and  that  there  is  regular
      telephone contact between them. Such  contact  and  support,  and  the
      strength of the family ties, is confirmed in the Child Welfare Society
      reports. In the light of that evidence,  I  accept  that  family  life
      exists, and that it exists despite the fact that  the  appellants  are
      now over the age of 18, on Kugathas principles.

  19.  With  regard  to  proportionality,  the   starting   point   is   the
      consideration of the appellants' ability to meet the  requirements  of
      the immigration rules, both at the date of the  respondent's  decision
      to refuse entry clearance and at the current date. Having  found  that
      the relationship requirement is met, I  turn  to  the  requirement  in
      paragraph 319X(ii) for there to be serious and  compelling  family  or
      other considerations making exclusion of the child undesirable. I find
      that that has been established, both at the time of  the  respondent's
      decision and at the current time.

  20. I accept the evidence before me as demonstrating that, since the death
      of the second appellant's  father  and  the  first  appellant's  uncle
      Santigi, in July 2016, the children's situation  has  been  precarious
      and any care received, from Aminata and Abibatu, has been temporary. I
      do not agree with Ms Cunha that there  has  developed  an  independent
      family unit formed in Sierra Leone,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  the
      appellants continue to rely on the sponsor for their financial support
      and for arrangements for their care pending the  resolution  of  their
      application to join her in the UK. There is a detailed and  persuasive
      independent report of the children's circumstances  in  Sierra  Leone,
      from the Child Welfare  Society,  which  provides  a  picture  of  the
      compelling circumstances in which the appellants find  themselves  and
      attests to their vulnerability. There are two reports, the first dated
      14 November 2018 and the second dated 4 December  2019.  Focussing  on
      the second report, I note the confirmation, at the bottom of page  A25
      of  the  appeal  bundle,  of  the  assessment   of   the   appellants'
      circumstances as being totally independent and it is clear that  their
      circumstances are consistent with those related by the sponsor in  her
      evidence before me. The report, at [30], refers to  the  deterioration
      in the appellants' emotional situation and, at [32] and [33],  to  the
      risks they were facing - for the second appellant, of being forced  to
      join the Bondo Society and of rape and being forced into  prostitution
      and  for  the  second  appellant,  of  being  symbolically  killed  or
      mutilated. At [36] the report refers to their current living situation
      as "devastating" and of the children being "extremely vulnerable". The
      report concludes at [56] that it is clearly in  the  appellants'  best
      interests to join the sponsor in the UK. I do not agree with Ms  Cunha
      that that is a purely speculative opinion.  On  the  contrary,  it  is
      clearly based upon a careful and detailed analysis of their situation.

  21. However, that is not the end of the matter. The ability of the sponsor
      to  accommodate  and  maintain  the  appellants  without  recourse  to
      additional public funds remains a contentious issue.  The  respondent,
      in refusing entry clearance, considered that the requirements  of  the
      immigration rules were not met in that  respect  and,  in  the  appeal
      before the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Cassel also considered that  the
      limited evidence before him did not show that  the  requirements  were
      met. Although Judge Cassel's decision was ultimately set aside with no
      findings preserved, it is of note that the grounds seeking  permission
      to appeal his decision did not challenge his findings in  that  regard
      and that was not a ground upon which permission was granted  or  which
      was found to be in legal error. There is no further  evidence  of  the
      sponsor's partner's income  at  that  time  or  at  the  time  of  the
      respondent's decision refusing entry clearance and  the  evidence  was
      that the sponsor was herself dependent upon public funds at that time.
      Accordingly, for those reasons, I find that the  appellants  were  not
      able to meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  319X,  with  particular
      reference  to  paragraph  319X(vii),  at  the  date  of  the  relevant
      decision. That is of course a factor weighing against  the  appellants
      in the Article 8 proportionality balancing exercise.

  22. Turning to the current situation, Ms  Cunha  maintained  the  position
      that the requirements of paragraph 319X could not be met  in  relation
      to accommodation and maintenance, although with no particular analysis
      of the evidence provided. Ms Capel,  however,  presented  calculations
      based upon the evidence of the sponsor's partner's income  during  the
      pandemic and in the  weeks  following  the  lifting  of  the  lockdown
      restrictions in submitting that  the  requirements  were  met  at  the
      current time. Those calculations showed that the income  available  to
      the sponsor and her husband was, on the basis of Mr  Sesay's  contract
      with BST Electrical Limited, well above the income  support  threshold
      for a family of six. Even taking account  of  the  rent  paid  by  the
      sponsor's partner and the council tax payments, that appears to be the
      case. I take on board Ms Capel's submissions in relation to the impact
      of Covid 19 on the sponsor's partner's income and, given the nature of
      his work, am prepared to accept that his income is likely to increase,
      as suggested by the four payslips from BST Electrical Ltd, although  I
      would assume that the sponsor's access to Universal Credit would  then
      decrease.  The  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  partner's   income   is,
      admittedly, somewhat limited, consisting of only four payslips without
      bank statements for the relevant period showing corresponding entries.
      However, the bank statements for  the  previous  period  show  regular
      weekly remittances and I have the oral evidence of Mr  Sesay  which  I
      accept. Indeed, Ms Cunha did not challenge  that  evidence  and  I  am
      prepared to accept, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  there  is
      sufficient to demonstrate that the  appellants'  presence  in  the  UK
      would not lead to further recourse to public benefits. Likewise,  with
      the accommodation available to the family, Ms Capel submitted that the
      sponsor's house, consisting of two bedrooms and a living  room,  would
      not  be  statutorily  overcrowded  with  the  presence  of   the   two
      appellants, and again that was not challenged by  Ms  Cunha.  In  such
      circumstances the proposed move to a larger council property would not
      be a material consideration.

  23. In conclusion, and drawing the above considerations together,  I  make
      the following findings. I accept that Article 8(1) is engaged  on  the
      basis of family life between the appellants and the  sponsor,  despite
      the appellants no longer being minors, but considering their level  of
      financial and emotional dependence upon the sponsor, albeit from afar.
      As for proportionality - aside from the appellants' age at the current
      time being 18 and above, the requirements of paragraph 319X  would  be
      met in terms of the family connection and the  compelling  family  and
      other considerations, as well as  the  accommodation  and  maintenance
      requirements  as  discussed  above.  Whilst  that  cannot  assist  the
      appellants in actually meeting the  requirements  of  the  immigration
      rules  per  se,  it  is  a  matter  of  significant  weight   in   the
      proportionality balancing exercise, particularly when considering that
      they were both minors at the time the application  was  made  and  are
      currently only 18 and 20 years old. As caselaw has established,  there
      is no "bright line" to be drawn once a child turns  18.  It  is  clear
      that the appellants are still very much dependent upon the help of the
      sponsor and any care provided to them  in  Sierra  Leone  through  the
      sponsor and that their best interests undoubtedly lie in joining their
      only living family member in the UK. For all of these reasons, and  in
      light of the very compelling reports from the Child Welfare Society, I
      accept that there are particularly compelling circumstances justifying
      a grant of entry clearance outside  the  rules  and  that  the  public
      interest is outweighed as a result of those particular  circumstances.
      I would according allow the appellants' appeals on Article 8 grounds.

DECISION

  24. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
      error on a point of law and has been set aside. I re-make the decision
      by allowing the appeals.
