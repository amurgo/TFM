                            DECISION AND REASONS
                            (extempore judgement)

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order because the appellant is a minor.

 2. This is an appeal by a national of Pakistan who was born in June  2001.
    She appeals the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on 6 February  2018
    dismissing her appeal against the decision  of  the  respondent  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer on 23 December 2016  to  refuse  her  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom as an adopted child. The appellant  relies  on
    an EEA right. The appeal is brought  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations  2006.  Her  uncle  and  purported  adoptive
    father is an EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom and it is the appellant's case that she is to be treated as his
    descendant because she is adopted.  She is not adopted by  a  mechanism
    recognised in English law but by a mechanism that is a feature  of  the
    law of Pakistan.  It is a matter of interest and legal  debate  whether
    this is satisfactory for the purposes of the EEA Regulations.

 3. That there is uncertainty is clear because the Supreme Court has itself
    expressed uncertainty and has referred the matter to the European Court
    of Justice.  However until the outcome of that decision  is  known  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal is clearly binding on  me  and  it  was
    decided in  SM  (Algeria)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1109  that  the  kind  of
    arrangement here is not  an  adoption  for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

 4. I regard that point as entirely  unarguable  before  me  because  I  am
    plainly bound by precedent.  I make it clear  that  Mr  Allan  did  not
    abandon the point and if the law is decided differently in the Court of
    Justice of the European Union  then  it  will  be  apparent  to  anyone
    reading this Decision that it was very much the appellant's  case  that
    she was entitled to rely on Regulation 7.

 5. There is an alternative route.  Unlike the child in SM, this  appellant
    is a "relative". She is the niece of the EEA national and may  be  able
    to satisfy the requirements of Regulation 8.  The appellant has  failed
    to do that so far because the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and,  in  due
    course, the Tribunal, were  not  persuaded  that  dependency  had  been
    established.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge here  took  as  a  starting
    point the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle  and  came  to  a
    like conclusion.  I accept Mr Allan's submission that Judge  Astle  did
    not find the sponsor's evidence to be dishonest but merely  inadequate.
    This is an important difference. It means that  the  appellant's  uncle
    does not start his evidence with the disadvantage of having been  found
    to be dishonest.

 6. I have gone through the evidence with some care with the assistance  of
    the representatives, particularly  Mr  Allan.  There  is  clearly  some
    evidence of regular payment. It does not necessarily  follow  that  the
    payments are in fact payments on  which  the  appellant  is  dependent.
    However I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law because it was
    clearly the appellant's case in the oral evidence of both the  adoptive
    parents that the money was paid for the purposes of the maintenance and
    upkeep of the appellant and that point has not been dealt with  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision.  It is capable as a matter  of  law  of
    being decisive and a decision should  have  been  made  on  the  claim.
    Failing to decide the point was clearly a material error.  I  therefore
    set aside the decision in part.

 7. There is a lurking suggestion that the  appellant  may  be  a  relative
    living in the household of the EEA national.  I  find  that  completely
    unarguable  on  the  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  to  support  a
    conclusion that  the  home  where  she  lives  is  the  EEA  national's
    "household". I anticipate that the living arrangements can be described
    as a compound. It may be somewhere where the EEA national has links  to
    his family but it cannot be  said  on  the  evidence  that  it  is  his
    household.

 8. As indicated above, I am satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred
    by not making findings on the oral evidence that money sent was for the
    maintenance of the appellant and it was money on which she depended and
    to that extent only I rule the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

 9. The appeal has to be reconsidered. If she is to succeed  the  appellant
    must show  that  she  is  in  fact  dependent  on  her  United  Kingdom
    relatives.

10. Having heard proposals from the parties on how to deal with that  error
    I heard evidence intended to persuade me to allow the appeal.

11. I have  the  documents  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  have
    additional documents produced at the hearing.   Regrettably  they  were
    not produced until the hearing but they are of a kind very  similar  to
    those that have been produced before and Mr Mills realistically took no
    objection to their late production.  These are records of sums paid  by
    the appellant's uncle in the United Kingdom to an uncle in Pakistan.

12. The evidence is not  entirely  satisfactory.   The  appellant  has  not
    produced a spreadsheet showing all the sources of income that  go  into
    the family and how this is dissipated.  If the  appellant  has  a  good
    case it would have been better if she had but I have to deal with  what
    I have got and as Mr Allan has properly reminded me I  have  to  decide
    what is probable.

13. I heard oral evidence from the sponsor and his  wife.   I  am  entirely
    satisfied that they send money frequently and that the sums  they  send
    are significant.  The most recent payslips  indicate  payments  in  the
    order of �3,500 over the twelve months. This is a significant amount of
    money from a man whose take home income is around only �1,000  a  month
    and it is something I have to think about carefully.  This suggests  to
    me strongly that the family in Pakistan are not living wealthily.   The
    sums that are sent from the United Kingdom are clearly sacrificial  and
    they are sent to people who need it. They are not  sent  as  tokens  of
    responsibility.

14. I find that Mr Allan made a good point when he said that  are  adoption
    documents here. The fact that they are not recognised in English law is
    of little relevance to the point that he made which is  that  there  is
    evidence that in Pakistani law the applicant is adopted.  It  could  be
    assumed that there will be financial responsibilities as a  consequence
    of that adoption and  the  evidence  is  wholly  consistent  with  that
    assumption of such responsibilities, namely that money  is  sent.   The
    family  in  Pakistan  live  together.  The  appellant  lives  with  her
    grandmother and an uncle but  there  are  other  family  members  close
    nearby and the impression I get, although the evidence was not entirely
    clear about this, is that there is a general pooling of  resources.   I
    cannot say with certainty that the money that is sent by  the  sponsors
    in the United Kingdom is used for the appellant's benefit so  that  she
    is dependent on it.  I do accept the evidence that it is sent  for  the
    benefit of the appellant and her grandmother, that is the mother of the
    sponsor.  I am not allowed the luxury  of  indecision  and  I  find  it
    probable that she needs this money to get by and that  without  it  she
    may stay alive but her life would be much less satisfactorily lived.

15. This is a view I reach having considered all of the evidence  including
    the affidavits in the bundle which tends to confirm the oral  evidence.
    I agree  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  the  documentary
    evidence can only be given limited value because it  is  impossible  to
    cross-examine the people who have given the evidence and they  are  not
    subject to the discipline of the courts if they have told untruths  but
    the evidence entirely fits with a picture of money being sent regularly
    from the United Kingdom for the  benefit  of  the  family  in  Pakistan
    including the appellant who needs that money to get by.

16. My decision is the best that I could do on the evidence I have got  and
    that means that I find in favour of the appellant and I substitute  the
    decision allowing the appeal.

17. I must say immediately this is not a decision  that  the  appellant  is
    allowed to come to the United Kingdom.  It is simply a decision that  I
    am satisfied that she is dependent on her sponsor  and  that  the  case
    must now go back to the Entry Clearance Officer who will  consider  his
    discretion about whether or not it is right to allow the  appellant  to
    come.  I deliberately make no comment whatsoever on that  which  should
    not be interpreted as any kind of indication one way or the other it is
    simply a matter for the Entry Clearance Officer to do his job.

    Notice of Decision

    The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set aside its  decision  and  I
    substitute a decision allowing the  appeal.  The  Respondent  must  now
    exercise his discretion in the light of my findings.
