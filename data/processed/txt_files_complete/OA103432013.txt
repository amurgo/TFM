        REFUSAL TO ADMIT APPLICATION TO APPEAL TO THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                     and

                  UPPER TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appeal

 1.  This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   against   a
    determination promulgated on 7 March 2014 of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    N J Osborne which allowed the Article 8 appeal of the respondent.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I refer to Hui Zoe  Fu  as  the
    claimant  and  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  as  the  respondent,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



Background

 3. The claimant is a Chinese national born on 22 January 1976 who  applied
    for entry clearance to join her British husband, Dr Brian Wilshire, the
    sponsor.

 4. The application was refused on 10 April 2013. The  respondent  did  not
    accept that the marriage was genuine or that the financial requirements
    were met.

 5. It was common ground before me that the first reason  for  refusal  was
    not correct, Judge Osborne having found the  marriage  to  be  entirely
    genuine and subsisting and  that  finding  not  being  subject  to  any
    challenge.

 6. As indicated in the refusal notice, the financial  evidence  originally
    submitted comprised a copy  of  a  letter  to  the  sponsor  from  HMRC
    regarding his tax return and overpayment of tax and  a  tax  assessment
    prepared by the sponsor stating his income to be �27,150.

    The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  accepted  that  there
    were shortcomings in the financial evidence of  the  sponsor's  income.
    Those grounds, which appear  to  have  been  drafted  by  the  sponsor,
    addressed the shortcomings in the financial documentation, thus:

        "We believe that this refusal was the result of  a  combination  of
        mistakes on our part and also on the part of the  ECO.  We  address
        this issue in bundles at #11 and 12, where we outline the  mistakes
        in completing the form in detail.

        However, the advice my wife received  regarding  the  proof  of  my
        income was at odds with the advice that I received  from  the  Home
        office by phone. I was assured that the proof of  the  PAYE  income
        shown on an original Tax Calculation form from HMRC was  sufficient
        proof IN ITSELF for visa purposes.

        Since the exact figure was plainly stated on  the  Tax  Calculation
        form, my wife apparently believed that  an  estimate  on  the  form
        would suffice, which we now recognise was also a mistake.  However,
        the official dealing with her must have been aware that  there  was
        incontrovertible proof in front of their eyes of  my  PAYE  income,
        and they could surely have rendered my wife the  proper  assistance
        in completing the form rather than in  effect  setting  her  up  to
        fail."

 8. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  were  accompanied  by
    additional evidence which was  considered  in  a  review  by  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager  on  25  September  2013.  The  bank  statements  and
    payslips that were submitted with the appeal covered the  period  April
    to  June  2011,  however,  so  still  did  not  meet  the   documentary
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 9. The materials submitted  with  the  appeal  also  included  a  document
    entitled "Additional Financial Information", also apparently drafted by
    the sponsor. This accepts that "a few details" in the financial section
    of the application "may have escaped  my  attention".  It  goes  on  to
    concede  that some responsibility lay with the  claimant  and  sponsor,
    thus:

         "Due to an accidental misunderstanding between us this  section  of
         the application form was completed incorrectly. We acknowledge, and
         apologise for, this mistake. We now request  that  my  PAYE  income
         detailed below and this income alone, is considered as a  means  to
         prove that our income exceeds the threshold.  We  do  not  wish  my
         small profit from self employment (�1,192)  to  be  considered.  We
         also do not wish for Zoe's savings to be considered as this is  not
         necessary according to the criteria as we understand them."

    The case put to the First-tier Tribunal

10. Further financial evidence showing  the  sponsor's  varied  sources  of
    income was submitted  in  support  of  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. It was considered at [10] of the determination. Judge Osborne
    accepted at [10(xi)] that the documentation before him showed an income
    in 2011/12 of �25,958.

11. He did not find that the Immigration Rules were met, however.  Firstly,
    the additional bank statements provided for the appeal covered only the
    5 month period prior to the application  not  the  6  month  period  as
    required. The wage slips provided also did not  cover  the  required  6
    month period. There was no letter from the  employers  who  issued  the
    payslips relied upon. The tax assessment form was based on  information
    from the sponsor not from HMRC. These matters are set out at [10(xii) -
    (xvi)] of the First-tier Tribunal determination.

12. Judge Osborne then found no insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  sponsor
    exercising family life with the claimant outside the UK at [10(xv)] and
    at [11] refused the appeal under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.
    As above, however, he went on to allow the appeal  after  conducting  a
    second stage Article 8 assessment and it  is  that  decision  that  the
    Entry Clearance Office challenges now.

Application for Permission to Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

13. At the hearing, I  was  informed  that  the  claimant  also  wished  to
    challenge the decision of Judge Osborne.

14. Mr Turner explained that on either 15 or 16 May 2014 he  had  faxed  an
    application to the First-tier Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of Judge Osborne to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  challenge  was
    against the decision under Appendix FM.

15. The Tribunal database confirmed that application  as  logged  onto  the
    system on 19 May 2014 and I accepted  that  there  was  an  outstanding
    application before the First-tier Tribunal  for  permission  to  cross-
    appeal the decision of Judge Osborne to the Upper Tribunal.

16. Mr Turner submitted that I should make a decision on that  application,
    sitting as First-tier Tribunal judge. I agreed to do so.

17. The first aspect of the application that I had to consider was  whether
    to admit it as it was made over a month out of time.  The  decision  of
    Judge Osborne was issued on 7 March 2014. The decision  was  served  on
    the UK sponsor was named on  the  appeal  forms  as  a  representative.
    Allowing 2 days for deemed service, good service was took  place  on  9
    March 2014.  A period of 28 days is allowed for lodging an appeal  when
    the claimant is not in the UK. The deadline for appealing was therefore
    6 April 2014.

18. I should perhaps indicate that I had some hesitation as to whether  the
    sponsor was formally eligible to be a representative in this matter but
    Mr Turner took no issue on that  point  and  accepted  at  [7]  of  his
    grounds that the application was lodged late.

19. Rule 24(4) of the First-tier Tribunal Procedure Rules  allows  for  the
    Tribunal to extend time for appealing if satisfied that  by  reason  of
    special circumstances it would be unjust not to do so.

20. The reasons given at [7] of the grounds to explain the lateness of  the
    application are somewhat difficult to follow as they  state  both  that
    the sponsor "contacted Counsel for advice ... on  28  April  2014"  but
    also that "an appointment was made for a conference on 2 April 2014".

21. Be that as it may, the  grounds  go  on  to  indicate  that  it  became
    apparent during the conference, that:

         "... the sponsor had as at  the  date  of  the  decision  all  the
         relevant specified documentation required by the Immigration Rules.
         The sponsor provided all the relevant documentation on 15 May  2014
         and these grounds were prepared on 15 May 2014."

22. The grounds on timeliness go on at [8]:

         "It is submitted that this is a  case  where  there  is  a  genuine
         relationship and a very strong  case.  It  is  submitted  that  the
         Secretary of State's appeal is  tainted  by  the  telephone  advice
         given by the Home Office to the sponsor where he was told that  his
         tax assessment would suffice in respect of the required documentary
         evidence. In all the circumstances of this  case  it  is  submitted
         that time should be extended."

23. I did not find the grounds  and  materials  before  me  showed  special
    circumstances such that I should extend time and admit the  application
    for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

24. Firstly, as above, the sponsor was served  with  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 9 March 2014. There is  no  explanation  of  the
    delay until either 2 April 2014 or  28  April  2014  in  seeking  legal
    advice or doing anything else about appealing the decision.

25. Secondly, there is no explanation as to why, if  the  sponsor  received
    advice on either 2 April 2014 or 28 April 2014 that he had, after  all,
    had in his possession all of the documents needed  to  show  compliance
    with the Immigration  Rules  as  of  the  date  of  the  decision,  the
    application for permission to appeal was not  submitted  until  15  May
    2014.

26. Thirdly, the grounds seek to rely on the submission  that  the  sponsor
    was materially misled by the Home Office who told him he only needed to
    provide his HMRC tax assessment.

27. If it was the sponsor's case that the decision as to which documents to
    provide with the  entry  clearance  was  made  solely  in  reliance  on
    incorrect information provided by the Home Office,  this  was  a  point
    that he could be expected to  have  made  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge.

28. That was not the case put to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  extracts
    above from the grounds and Additional Financial  Information  statement
    before the First-tier Tribunal statements show that  the  claimant  and
    sponsor did not argue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  they  had
    acted in sole reliance on information from the Home Office.

29. The grounds of appeal stated that the  shortcomings  in  the  financial
    documents arose "as a result of a combination of mistakes on  our  part
    and also on the part of the ECO", that the claimant had received  other
    "advice" that was "at odds with the advice I  received  from  the  Home
    Office by phone", that the couple recognised  that  they  had  made  "a
    mistake" in making assumptions about the probative  value  of  the  tax
    calculation form.

30. The Additional Financial Information statement indicated  that  "a  few
    details" in the financial section of the application "may have  escaped
    my attention" and that:

         "Due to an accidental misunderstanding between us this  section  of
         the application form was completed incorrectly. We acknowledge, and
         apologise for, this mistake."

31. Fourthly, the grounds seek to suggest that the sponsor would be able to
    show that he had, finally, acquired  all  of  the  financial  documents
    required by Appendix FM to show the necessary income. He has  not  done
    so. As set out by Judge Osborne at [10(vi)] of his decision, the letter
    from the employer had to show gross annual salary, the  length  of  the
    employment, the period over which they  had  been  paid  at  the  level
    relied upon in the application and  the  type  of  employment  (whether
    permanent, fixed term contract or agency). The letter dated 15 May 2014
    from Worcestershire County Council at page 26 of the  bundle  submitted
    in support of the cross-appeal  does not meet  these  requirements.  It
    merely confirms the genuine nature of the wage slips from  August  2012
    to February 2013. There is also the matter of  the  requirement  for  a
    signed contact of  employment  which  has  also,  even  now,  not  been
    provided. The appeal as it stood before me, taking in  account  all  of
    the evidence from the sponsor whenever  submitted,  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules, therefore.

32.  Mr Turner's "strong" case for admitting the application in time relies
    on the argument that the claimant and sponsor were materially misled by
    the Home Office  about  the  documents  to  be  submitted  and  on  the
    submission that all of the correct documents for the  case  to  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules are now  available.  Neither  argument  has
    merit.  It did  not  appear  to  me  that  a  case  for  admitting  the
    application which had been made over a month  out  of  time  without  a
    reasonable  explanation for that being so, was made out, therefore.

33. Mr Turner also referred me to the overriding objective in Rule 4 of The
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  which  states
    that proceedings before the Tribunal should be "handled as  fairly"  as
    possible. It did not appear to me that, given the  issues  above,  that
    fairness required me to admit the application for permission to  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal as in time. I declined to do so.

34. For all of these reasons I found  the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be out of  time  and  it  was  not
    admitted.

Error of Law

35. I then resumed sitting as an Upper Tribunal judge  and  considered  the
    respondent's error of law application for which permission was  granted
    by the First-tier Tribunal on 16 April 2014. I heard argument from both
    parties.

36. As is clear from the  discussion  above,  a  number  of  the  specified
    documents for evidencing the sponsor's  income  were  not  provided  to
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne and the appeal under the  substantive
    Immigration Rules contained in Appendix FM was therefore refused. Those
    findings stand.

37. Judge Osborne carried out a second stage Article 8 assessment  at  [12]
    to [20].

38. The respondent accepts that the First-tier  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
    proceed to that assessment following Gulshan (Article 8 - new  rules  -
    correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640, R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin). The Entry Clearance Officer's position is that  Judge  Osborne
    did not  apply  the  correct  test,  that  the  claimant  had  to  show
    "compelling" circumstances in order to succeed under Article 8 and that
    there were no such circumstances in this appeal.

39. The First-tier Tribunal's reasoning  on  the  second  stage  Article  8
    assessment is at [17] to [20]. Judge Osborne found at  [17]  that  even
    though the specified evidence had not been provided,  the  sponsor  did
    earn over �18,600, the required income threshold.  Judge  Osborne  also
    referred to MM and Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) at [17] but I
    did not see the relevance of that case to the situation here where  the
    issue was not the lawfulness of the required income threshold  but  the
    failure to provide specified documents.

40. At [18] weight is placed on the couple wishing to start a  family,  the
    claimant being 37 years old. At [19] the judge referred to the  sponsor
    visiting the claimant prior to the hearing.

41. Those points are summarised at [20] and the Article 8 appeal allowed.

42. There is no reference at any point in the  decision  to  the  need  for
    there to be compelling circumstances.  The  nearest  the  determination
    comes is at [12] where Judge Osborne refers  to  MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 but the reference to that case is to  the  general
    proposition that a second stage assessment can take place  rather  than
    the test to be used in that assessment.

43. I considered whether Judge Osborne  had,  nevertheless,  identified  in
    substance matters that were compelling, such that his decision to allow
    the Article 8 appeal was justified. It appeared to  me  that  the  only
    matter at all capable of being characterised was the wish of the couple
    to start a family at [18].  Judge Osborne does not describe this  issue
    in terms that might suggest that he considered it to be  compelling  or
    exceptional,  however.  It  did  not  appear  to  me  that   it   could
    legitimately be considered to be a compelling factor  where  the  entry
    clearance application  here  was  decided  in  only  3  months,  a  new
    application being expected to take the same, relatively short amount of
    time.

44. There is the further issue of the proper role played by the Immigration
    Rules and failure to meet them in the proportionality  assessment;  see
    Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ  558.  Here  that  failure  is  not
    weighed in the Article 8 second stage assessment at all.

45. It was my judgement that for these reasons  the  Article  8  assessment
    could not be read as  having  been  properly  conducted  and  therefore
    contained an error on a point of law such that it had to be re-made.

Re-Making

46. Having announced my decision on error  of  law,  Mr  Turner  sought  to
    persuade me to admit the evidence provided  with  the  application  for
    permission  to  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and  a  written
    submission of the sponsor when re-making the application.

47. I considered his submission under the provisions of Rule 15 (2A) of the
    Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules. That Rule states that if a party wishes
    to the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence  that  was  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, notice should be given to  the  Tribunal  and  any
    other party indicating the nature of the evidence and explaining why it
    was not submitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  when  considering
    whether to admit the evidence the Upper Tribunal must  have  regard  to
    whether there has been unreasonable delay in producing that evidence.

48. No notice was given of the materials on which Mr Turner sought to rely.
     There was no explanation of why those materials were  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal other than that the claimant and  sponsor  had  not
    been legally represented at that time.

49. Mr Turner also argued that  the  claimant  and  sponsor  could  not  be
    expected to  submit further evidence unless and until an error  of  law
    was found. On the contrary, the  direction  issued  on  17  April  2014
    specifically indicated to the  parties  that  they  should  submit   in
    advance any evidence on which they wished to rely in the event  of  any
    re-making.

50. Mr Turner sought support from the overriding objective set out in  Rule
    2 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules for a case  to  be  dealt  with
    fairly  and  justly,  relying  in  particular  on  the  principles   of
    flexibility, ensuring so far as practicable that parties  are  able  to
    participate fully. It was not my view that  where  the  materials  were
    submitted only at the hearing itself without any notice to the Tribunal
    or respondent and could have been before the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    were not, even applying the principles of the overriding  objective  to
    Rule 15 (2A), it was not appropriate to admit the new materials.

51. Mr Turner also sought to persuade me that I should hear  oral  evidence
    from the sponsor. Again, no notice of this intention was given prior to
    the hearing. No  statement  of  evidence  was  provided  prior  to  the
    hearing. It was also the case that the sponsor had not chosen  to  give
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, that decision  being  made  on
    the papers. It was not clarified how any oral  evidence  added  to  the
    other evidence already before me. Also, the relevant date for assessing
    evidence in this entry clearance appeal is the date of  decision  which
    was April 2013 so it  was  not  that  any  update  was  appropriate.  I
    declined to hear oral evidence from the sponsor.

52. I proceeded to hear submissions from Mr Tuner and Mr Nath  on  the  re-
    making of the Article 8 appeal.

53. There was no dispute as to the first four of the questions laid down in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 being answered in  the  claimant's  favour.  This
    couple are in a genuine and subsisting marriage and have a family  life
    together.

54. In the proportionality assessment,  however,  as  in  Haleemudeen,  the
    failure to meet  the  Immigration  Rules  regarding  the  documentation
    required to show the sponsor's income is  the  starting  point  in  the
    assessment  of  whether  the  decision  can   be   considered   to   be
    disproportionate.

55. In order to outweigh that failure to meet the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    claimant must show that there are compelling circumstances.

56. I accept that as of the date of the decision, the sponsor  was  earning
    around �25,000 so in excess of  the  minimum  income  requirement,  and
    that, notwithstanding the failure to meet the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    public finances would not have been prejudiced had the claimant come to
    join her husband.   I accept that this shifts the balance back  towards
    the claimant's side of the balance to some degree but did not  consider
    that it could approach  the  threshold  of  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances.

57. I accept that the claimant and sponsor wish to start a family  together
    and are anxious about this where the claimant  is  37  years  old.  The
    respondent decided the application for entry clearance within 3 months,
    however. It was open to the claimant to  reapply  for  entry  clearance
    with the correct financial evidence and it did not appear to me that  a
    period of 3 months could be considered to be  a  period  of  time  that
    significantly impacted  on  the  couple's  wish  and  ability  to  have
    children.

58. I have indicated above why I find no force in the  arguments concerning
    information given to the sponsor by the Home Office about his HMRC  tax
    documents and  do  not  find  that  they  can  attract  weight  to  the
    claimant's side of the balance now.

59. Without more than the matters set out above, it was not  my  view  that
    where the Immigration Rules were not met, this appeal showed compelling
    circumstances or a result that could be characterised as  unduly  harsh
    or disproportionate such that the second  stage  Article  8  assessment
    could succeed.

60. I dismissed the appeal under Article 8.

Decision sitting as a First-tier Tribunal Judge

16. I do not admit the application made by the claimant for  permission  to
    appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.

18. I re-make the appeal, refusing it under Article 8 of the ECHR.
