Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B. Malik, Counsel (direct access)
For the Respondent:    Mr D. Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of the respondent dated 9 May 2018
    to deport the  applicant,  Gunaratnam  Sriskantharajah,  a  citizen  of
    Germany born  on  7  April  1966,  to  Germany  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the 2016 Regulations").  In
    a decision and reasons dated 25 September 2019, a panel  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Stephen
    Smith) allowed the appellant's appeal against a decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hollingworth promulgated on 2 May  2019  dismissing  her
    appeal against the respondent's decision to make  a  deportation  order
    against her.   The error of law decision may be found in the  Annex  to
    this decision.

 2. The error of law decision preserved Judge Hollingworth's findings  that
    the appellant represented a genuine, present, and sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society,  and
    directed that the matter be re-heard in this tribunal in order for  the
    proportionality  of  the  appellant's  deportation  to  Germany  to  be
    assessed.  In those circumstances the matter came  before  me,  sitting
    alone.

Factual background

 3. The appellant is of Tamil ethnicity, and her main  language  is  Tamil.
    She claims to speak no German and have only limited English.  She moved
    with her husband to Germany from Sri Lanka in 1986.   They  have  three
    daughters.  The family moved to the United  Kingdom  in  2003.   On  10
    November 2014, the appellant, along with her husband  and  two  others,
    were convicted of a number of counts of money laundering, arising  from
    their use of the family Bureau de Change shops in central London  as  a
    front for laundering approximately  �145,000,000  of  the  proceeds  of
    crime.  The  offence  involved  the  appellant  and  the  co-defendants
    placing large  and  frequent  orders  for  wholesale  foreign  currency
    (mainly Euros), which was paid  for  using  cash.   The  sums  involved
    greatly exceeded those which could genuinely have been generated  by  a
    genuine business of a similar size.

 4.  The  appellant  was  sentenced  to  seven  years'   imprisonment   and
    disqualified from acting as a company director for  eight  years.   Her
    husband,  who  is  also  German,  was  sentenced   to   twelve   years'
    imprisonment and remains in prison.  The appellant's  husband  was  the
    lead defendant in the criminal trial.  The appellant had a  subsidiary,
    although significant, role.

 5. Judge Hollingworth found that the appellant continued  to  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society. In the error  of  law  decision,  the
    panel summarised the judge's findings in these terms:

         24. As to the personal conduct of the appellant, the  judge  noted
             that the offending under consideration  had  continued  for  a
             period of five years, from 2006 to 2011.  At [14],  the  judge
             highlighted the appellant's readiness over that time to engage
             in these serious criminal activities which  were  "effectively
             encouraging criminal activity on the part of organised gangs".
              As to the risk she posed, he found that her conduct was  "the
             antithesis of a low risk of reoffending".  The judge  ascribed
             significance to the fact that the appellant had  been  willing
             to engage  in  this  extensive  criminal  activity  against  a
             background of  having  no  previous  convictions.   The  judge
             observed that the "sheer scale and enormity of the criminality
             upon which she embarked and remained so embarked  for  such  a
             period of time" was such that provided a strong foundation  to
             conclude  that  the  personal   conduct   of   the   appellant
             represented a substantial risk of reoffending.

         25. At [15] the judge specifically considered the principle  which
             Mr Malik contends he failed properly to apply, namely that the
             previous convictions of an  appellant  do  not  in  themselves
             justify a decision.  We  consider  that  the  judge  correctly
             directed  himself  concerning   the   requirement   that   the
             individual conduct of the appellant must represent a  genuine,
             present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
             fundamental interests of  society.   The  judge  analysed  the
             appellant's conduct carefully.  He noted  the  seriousness  of
             the offence.

         26. Judge Hollingworth outlined the Crown Court judge's sentencing
             remarks that criminals cannot operate in this country  without
             the presence of those prepared  to  launder  the  proceeds  of
             their crime.  The appellant was engaged  in  organised  crime,
             found the sentencing judge.  Judge Hollingworth observed  that
             in order to satisfy a confiscation order which had  been  made
             against her, the appellant had been required to sell her  home
             and other assets in order to have any hope of  satisfying  the
             requirements  made  against  her.   The   appellant   had   no
             meaningful qualifications and the only time she had worked  in
             this country was in the Bureau de Change  which  had  provided
             the front for the money laundering operations.

         27. Against that background, at  [17],  Judge  Hollingworth  found
             that the appellant had demonstrated no  remorse  and  had  not
             taken any steps towards  achieving  rehabilitation.   He  also
             found that there had been no evidence that the  appellant  had
             undertaken any rehabilitative work while in  custody,  and  he
             also observed that the primary offending had  taken  place  by
             the appellant alongside  her  husband;  that  was  a  relevant
             factor because the  presence  of  those  associated  with  the
             commission of criminal offences goes to  the  willingness  and
             the risk of an individual committing further offences.

         28. We consider that these findings  demonstrate  that  the  judge
             correctly applied the principle that previous  convictions  do
             not in  themselves  justify  decisions  under  regulation  27.
             Rather, the judge focused on the  underlying  conduct  of  the
             appellant and her wider circumstances, before concluding  that
             her presence represented the necessary, genuine,  present  and
             sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the  fundamental
             interests of society.

         29. We consider these were findings that were open to the judge to
             reach on the evidence before him.  This appellant had  engaged
             in a serious, sustained and organised  pattern  of  offending.
             We accept that in the context of the wider conspiracy of which
             she was a part, she played a lesser  role  than  that  of  her
             husband, who was the main culprit.   He  was  sentenced  to  a
             period of twelve years'  imprisonment.   The  mere  fact  that
             there were co-conspirators or  other  offenders  who  were  of
             greater culpability than the appellant cannot have the  effect
             of diminishing her involvement in this offence.

 6. The appellant's case is that it would be disproportionate to deport her
    to Germany.  She relies on what  she  considers  to  be  the  preserved
    findings of fact from the First-tier Tribunal which are in her  favour.
    She points to the fact that she has resided here  for  over  16  years,
    having arrived in 2003. She was only educated to a basic level  in  Sri
    Lanka. Her age and health conditions make manual labour  difficult  for
    her, reducing the prospect of her being  able  to  gain  employment  in
    Germany. She has no social or familial links with Germany, whereas  her
    three adult daughters all live in this country. She lives with them and
    enjoys a close and supportive relationship with  them.  She  speaks  no
    German. She would face very austere conditions in Germany or  could  be
    forced to rely on the  remitted  financial  support  from  two  of  her
    daughters. Her  daughters  would  struggle  to  provide  her  with  the
    necessary financial support, meaning that,  realistically,  they  would
    have to move to Germany with her, thereby terminating  the  social  and
    cultural links that each of them has established in this country, since
    having arrived here as minors. The appellant's husband is in prison  in
    this country with a possible release on licence in 2020.

 7. Against that background, the appellant highlights an OASys report dated
    17 December 2019 which concludes that she  represents  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending. Her probation officer has no concerns about her propensity
    to commit further offences. In the  circumstances,  submits  Mr  Malik,
    deportation  is  a  measure  which  has  drastic  effects,   and   goes
    significantly further than would be required to attain  the  objectives
    which the Secretary of State is constrained to achieve under the EU law
    framework which underpins her decision to deport the appellant.

Legal framework

 8. The legal framework is set out at [5]  to  [8]  of  the  Error  of  Law
    decision.

 9. Mr Malik relied on R (on the application of Lumdson and others) v Legal
    Services  Board   [2015]   UKSC   41   concerning   the   doctrine   of
    proportionality under EU law.  He highlighted the following key  themes
    from the joint judgment of Lord Reed and Lord Toulson.

10. First, the  principle  of  proportionality  under  EU  law  is  neither
    expressed  nor  applied  in  the  same  way   as   the   principle   of
    proportionality under European Convention  on  human  rights.  Although
    there is some common ground, the four-stage analysis of proportionality
    explained in Bank Mellatt v Her Majesty's Treasury (No 2)  [2013]  UKSC
    39; [2014] AC 700 at  [20]  and  [72]  -  [76]  is  not  applicable  to
    proportionality under EU law (see [26]).

11. Secondly, he highlighted the following at [33]:

         "Proportionality as a  general  principle  of  EU  law  involves  a
         consideration of two  questions:  first,  whether  the  measure  in
         question is  suitable  or  appropriate  to  achieve  the  objective
         pursued; and secondly, whether the measure is necessary to  achieve
         that objective, or whether it could be attained by a  less  onerous
         method."

The hearing

12. The appellant provided a bundle featuring her statement and that of her
    daughter, Surega, both dated 18 December 2019, a letter  from  a  Ms  B
    Kelly, probation officer, and accompanying OASys assessment, both dated
    17 December 2019.  The materials also  featured  the  product  of  some
    internet research,  in  English,  concerning  benefits  eligibility  in
    Germany,  and  some  bank  statements  concerning  Surega's   financial
    position.

13. The appellant and Surega gave evidence, adopted their statements  dated
    18 December 2019,  and  were  cross-examined.  A  full  note  of  their
    evidence is on the  tribunal's  file,  and  the  proceedings  were,  of
    course, recorded. I will outline the salient aspects of their  evidence
    to the extent necessary to give reasons for my findings.

Discussion

14. At the outset, it is necessary  to  recall  the  context  in  which  my
    analysis  of  the  issue  of   proportionality   takes   place.   Judge
    Hollingworth found that the appellant represents a genuine, present and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society. That was a finding which was disputed by the  appellant  at
    the hearing before the judge  below,  and  which  Mr  Malik  sought  to
    challenge when this appeal was initially heard for  the  error  of  law
    determination in September. In the error of law decision quoted  above,
    the panel found that the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were
    within the range of findings that the judge was entitled  to  reach  on
    the basis of the evidence before him.

15. The extent and nature of the risk posed by the appellant  are  relevant
    to the question of proportionality.  Judge Hollingworth's findings were
    based on the conduct that led to the appellant's conviction. Her bundle
    from the original hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  includes  the
    Crown's opening note from the trial at Crown  Court  at  Southwark.  It
    describes how the appellant and her husband were  responsible  for  the
    administration of two  relatively  small  bureaux  in  central  London.
    There was a third outlet, also in central London, run by another of the
    co-defendants. The  leaseholder  for  that  shop  was  the  appellant's
    husband, and documents relating  to  the  outlet,  including  Companies
    House records, were found at  the  appellant's  home  during  a  police
    search. From February 2006 to September 2011, the three outlets  placed
    wholesale currency orders totalling over �145 million for euros, mainly
    for E500 and E200 denomination notes.  Transactions of  this  magnitude
    greatly surpassed  the  level  of  business  which  the  small  outlets
    ostensibly run by the appellant and her  husband  would  ever  normally
    encounter and were for denominations  which  are  rarely  used  by  the
    tourist trade at which the bureaux were ostensibly targeted. By way  of
    comparison, the bureaux de change operating out of 11,500 Post  Offices
    between September 2009 and March 2010 dealt with  E500  notes  in  only
    0.12% of transactions, and E200 notes in 0.06% of transactions,  across
    �2.9billion of transactions in total.  Large  denomination  Euro  notes
    are favoured by organised crime.  The appellant dealt in  the  currency
    of money-laundering, over a sustained period, to a significant  extent.



16. I outline these factors here to provide some context to  the  preserved
    findings of Judge Hollingworth  concerning  the  threat  posed  by  the
    appellant.  In common with the position she adopted before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, before me the appellant did not display any remorse  for
    her offences.  She has never accepted responsibility  for  the  serious
    harm that the  facilitation  of  such  a  large  quantity  of  criminal
    proceeds is likely  to  have  caused.   As  the  Crown's  opening  note
    records, the appellant's  bureaux  de  change  were  revealed  to  have
    connections to a well known drug dealer in Croydon.  The wider criminal
    context in which the operation sat was never revealed by the appellant.
     The orders placed by the appellant's bureaux  de  change  for  foreign
    currency were often paid for by large numbers  of  Scottish  banknotes;
    although legal tender in England, their use and frequency are much less
    common south of the border, as they are routinely returned to  Scotland
    as soon as  they  enter  the  banking  system.   In  England,  Scottish
    banknotes are prevalent in the drugs trade, the Crown  said.  The  jury
    must have accepted those assertions by its  guilty  verdict  passed  in
    relation to the appellant.

17. Before me, the appellant contends that her risk is  minimal,  and  that
    the proportionality assessment should be calibrated to reflect her risk
    profile. She relies on a letter dated 17 December 2019 from  Ms  Kelly,
    her probation officer, which states:

         "From a probation perspective, [the appellant] has been assessed as
         low risk to the public. Since release she has complied with all her
         licence  conditions  and  there  haven't  been  any  concerns  with
         compliance."

18. Mr Malik accepts that he cannot go behind  the  preserved  findings  of
    Judge Hollingworth but submits that  the  judge's  findings  should  be
    viewed in light of new material such  as  Ms  Kelly's  letter  and  the
    accompanying OASys report.

19. I accept that, in principle, it is  necessary  for  me  to  conduct  an
    assessment of the risk posed by  the  appellant  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing. The earlier findings of Judge Hollingworth are  a  significant
    and foundational factor in that assessment. To the extent that there is
    new material which may cast the  risk  posed  by  the  appellant  in  a
    different light, I must take such materials into account.

20. Ms Kelly did not provide any qualitative analysis of the nature of  the
    conduct of the appellant  that  led  to  her  convictions.   Similarly,
    although the appellant has  provided  what  purports  to  be  an  OASys
    assessment  dated  17  December  2019,  it  features  no  analysis   or
    commentary as to why the appellant is regarded as  a  "low"  risk.  The
    document itself appears to be targeted at assessing  violent  risk,  as
    confirmed by the subheading on many of the pages which states, "Risk of
    Serious Harm Screening". There follows on each page what appears to  be
    a tick box list of potential offence  types,  for  the  author  of  the
    report to select as appropriate. On each page, the  author  has  ticked
    the "none of the above" box. That is hardly surprising, as  the  nature
    of the offences covered by the "risk of serious  harm"  assessment  are
    all offences of violence. For example under R1.2, the offences  include
    murder, attempted murder, wounding, rape or  serious  sexual  offences,
    any other offence against a child, aggravated burglary, arson, criminal
    damage with intent to endanger life, kidnapping or false  imprisonment,
    possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or resist  arrest,
    racially  motivated/racially  aggravated  offences,  robbery,  offences
    involving the possession and/or use of weapons, any other offence which
    is "as serious" including  blackmail,  harassment,  stalking,  indecent
    images of children, child neglect, and abduction "etc".

21. The OASys document does not consider the risk of harm  that  may  arise
    from large scale money-laundering. It does not look at  the  calculated
    steps which the appellant must have been found  by  the  jury  to  have
    taken in order  to  facilitate  her  offending  from  January  2006  to
    September 2011, the dates covered by the indictment.

22. I find that the lack of analysis and the absence of references  to  the
    underlying circumstances of the appellant's offences  in  the  December
    2019  OASys  report  mean  that  it  attracts  little  weight  in   the
    proportionality assessment that I am to perform.  Therefore  while,  in
    principle, I accept Mr Malik's submission that such  materials  may  be
    relevant to an updated risk assessment, the materials  adduced  by  the
    appellant do not, in fact, cast  Judge  Hollingworth's  findings  in  a
    different light. The appellant,  of  course,  continues  to  refuse  to
    engage in an acceptance of the underlying seriousness of  her  offence.
    Mr Malik submitted  that  the  appellant  had  been  let  down  by  the
    probation service; the OASys report originally  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was incomplete, and the revised report for  these  proceedings
    is light on  detail.  The  difficulty  with  that  submission  is  that
    expressions  of  remorse,  understanding  and  insight  concerning  the
    offence committed by the appellant are, and have always been,  entirely
    within the gift of the appellant. It was  her  choice  not  to  express
    remorse before the First-tier Tribunal.  It  has  been  her  choice  to
    continue in that attitude before me. She has not  taken  any  steps  to
    reveal to the authorities the wider criminal community with  which  she
    was involved in order to commit the offences; the appellant  must  have
    been  provided  with  the  �145,000,000  from  external  sources.   The
    appellant has not worked with the authorities to bring those persons to
    justice.  These are not failings of the probation service; they are the
    natural consequences of an attitude which reflects the appellant's lack
    of understanding of the seriousness of her offence, and the absence  of
    rehabilitation.

23. The lack of remorse the appellant displays, combined with the preserved
    findings of Judge Hollingworth and  the  absence  of  any  contemporary
    material to demonstrate that her risk profile has changed, lead  me  to
    the conclusion that the risk assessment by Judge Hollingworth that  she
    represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
    one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society  is  a  finding  which
    continues to apply in the proceedings before me.

24. Regulation 27(6) of the 2016  Regulations  requires  me  to  take  into
    account considerations such as the age of the appellant, her  state  of
    health, her family and economic situation, the length of her residence,
    and cultural integration issues.  These are the factors which Mr  Malik
    focused upon in his  submissions,  and  which  the  appellant  and  her
    daughter gave evidence.

25. I accept that the enforced return of the appellant to Germany  will  be
    disruptive to a considerable extent. She has lived in this country  for
    16 years and during that time has brought up her young children  to  be
    successful young adults. There is absolutely no suggestion that any  of
    her children had any involvement in the offending  for  which  she  was
    convicted. They are individuals of standing, who contribute to  society
    and pay taxes. Removing the appellant from the family  she  knows  here
    will be a wrench for them as well as for the  appellant.  The  children
    have already had to endure  the  shame  of  their  parents  each  being
    convicted  to  lengthy  periods  of  imprisonment,   and   I   do   not
    underestimate the hardship which the family as a whole had  to  endure,
    and no doubt continues to endure. The children are all German citizens,
    exercising their rights under the EU treaties to reside and work  here.
    The quality of their enjoyment of their Union citizenship  rights  will
    materially be affected by the removal of the appellant.

26. There are some weaknesses, however, in the appellant's account  of  the
    extent to which the relationships she has with  her  daughters  form  a
    significant part of the fabric of her life in this country. At  [5]  of
    her statement, the appellant wrote that she had been  helping  to  look
    after her daughter Surega following some surgery she received.  In  the
    appellant's statement, she did not provide a date for  when  this  took
    place. Under  cross-examination,  she  could  not  recall  whether  the
    operation that Surega had undertaken had been prior to her release from
    prison, or subsequent to it. In my view, this is a key omission.  There
    is also a  degree  of  inconsistency  in  the  evidence  given  by  the
    appellant and that of her daughter. The appellant's evidence  was  that
    she suffers a mobility impairment from having a slipped disc.  Yet  she
    also said that she was the one who cared for and  looked  after  Surega
    when  she  had  been  ill.  Surega's  evidence  provided  a  degree  of
    illumination as to what actually took place: the  operation  had  taken
    place after the appellant's release from prison, and her mother  helped
    her at her own pace. At times, Surega said, she (Surega) was  bedbound.
    Her mother was of particular assistance at those times.

27. I find that the assistance provided by the appellant to Surega was time-
    limited, and a natural  by-product  of  the  two  living  in  the  same
    accommodation. The fact that the appellant could not remember when  the
    crucial operation had taken place undermines her evidence of the  depth
    and quality of the assistance she provided.  She  was  there,  and  she
    provided help. In itself, that would have  been  a  significant  change
    from the previous few years, as the appellant had been in  prison.  The
    appellant still does practical tasks around  the  house,  helping  with
    cooking and laundry. Her daughters provide her with financial help  and
    assistance, paying for acupuncture and counselling sessions.  I  accept
    that there is a strength in depth of relationship between the appellant
    and her daughters, but it does not stray into territory  of  particular
    significance. It is difficult to put matters much higher than that.

28. The appellant said in her evidence that she would be unable to work  in
    Germany, unable to support herself financially,  unable  to  speak  the
    language, and unable to  find  housing.  I  do  not  underestimate  the
    difficulties that she would encounter upon seeking to return.  However,
    there is no evidence before me as to why the appellant would be  unable
    to work in any form of employment  whatsoever.  She  has  not  given  a
    reason why she would not be able to learn German, the language  of  her
    nationality. This appellant would have the advantage of being a citizen
    of Germany. I accept that an initial process of having to learn  German
    would be difficult and may mean that the appellant's integration  takes
    longer than would otherwise be the case.

29. In any event, there is no reason why the appellant's  daughters  cannot
    accompany her to Germany, at least initially. It would not be necessary
    for them permanently to relocate.  They  could  accompany  her  on  the
    journey there and use their own (in the case of Surega, fluent) ability
    in the German language to assist her in the early days. They  would  be
    able to assist with the drafting,  and  understanding,  of  emails  and
    other official documents, even remotely from this country.  They  would
    be able to make telephone calls on  her  behalf.  All  the  while,  the
    appellant would be able  to  take  steps  to  learn  the  language  for
    herself.

30. I accept that the appellant  has  some  mobility  impairments.  Certain
    forms of manual labour would be  difficult.  At  least  initially,  the
    language barrier would make obtaining work difficult. She  is  educated
    only to GCSE level in Sri Lanka and would return to Germany without the
    benefit of any  education  there.  These  are  factors  which  mitigate
    against removal, to which I will return.

31. A significant amount of time during the evidence of the  appellant  and
    Surega, as well as the submissions of Mr  Malik,  was  devoted  to  the
    claimed inaccessibility of social welfare benefits to a person  in  the
    appellant's  position  in  Germany.  The  appellant  and   Surega   had
    approached the  German  embassy  in  London  to  ascertain  the  likely
    entitlement of the  appellant  to  housing  and  other  benefits.  They
    explained that, although an embassy official was initially  willing  to
    provide advice  as  to  the  appellant's  likely  eligibility,  he  was
    prevented from doing so in a form suitable to be relied  upon  in  this
    tribunal,  upon  taking  instructions  from  his   superior   officers.
    According to the appellant and Surega, the embassy official had advised
    that Germany has a contributory benefits system. As the  appellant  has
    not "paid in" in the form of social security contributions,  she  would
    be unable to draw benefits "out" from the system.  There is a long wait
    for social housing, and the appellant would initially be  placed  in  a
    homeless shelter.  Surega said in her evidence that her  parents  still
    own a flat in Germany, but that it is tenanted. In order to  satisfy  a
    confiscation order that was made in respect of her father following the
    convictions, the flat must be sold. From the perspective of the  German
    government, however, that is an asset which counts against  her  mother
    for the purposes of benefit eligibility. They cannot sell the  flat  at
    the moment because her father must sign the sale papers in the presence
    of a German notary, which is difficult as he is in prison.  The tenants
    are refusing to pay their rent and are being  generally  uncooperative,
    as they are aware of the appellant's convictions here, and are  seeking
    to exploit her perceived vulnerability for their own gain, she said.

32. The difficulty with the evidence concerning the availability of  social
    benefits is that it relates to the operation of a foreign legal system,
    and is, therefore, a matter which ordinarily falls to be established by
    means of expert evidence. I readily accept that  a  diplomatic  officer
    posted to the German embassy in London would be subject to  constraints
    as to the extent to which he could participate in legal proceedings  in
    this jurisdiction. That  is  hardly  surprising,  and  I  hold  nothing
    against the appellant in this regard. Even had the embassy officer been
    able to participate, there is no evidence to suggest that he would have
    the necessary expertise in  order  to  establish  with  any  degree  of
    precision the workings of the German social benefit system, as a matter
    of foreign law. Surega said, in response to a question by me, that  the
    official  had  not  touched  upon  the   issue   of   social   security
    coordination. That is a complex area of  law  whereby  social  security
    contributions in one Member State are able to count as contributions in
    another Member State. The EU regime underpinning such  coordination  is
    intended to prevent those moving from one member state  to  another  to
    lose out on account of  having  exercise  their  rights  under  the  EU
    treaties.  It would be necessary to  explore  the  non-availability  of
    social security coordination before  concluding  that  social  benefits
    would not be available to the appellant on the basis that she  had  not
    "pain in" in Germany.

33. From the materials that were provided on behalf of the appellant, it is
    clear that there is a social security system in Germany. I accept  that
    there will be administrative and bureaucratic hurdles to clear in order
    for the appellant to enjoy benefits under it.  Social housing may  take
    some time to finalise.  I do not accept that the appellant  will  never
    enjoy social benefits in Germany.

34. However, the issue of benefits is a potential distraction.  Surega  and
    her sister Sinduya have a joint income of in the region  of  �69,000  -
    �70,000.  Their younger  sister,  the  appellant's  youngest  daughter,
    Gowsaleya, will start graduate work soon, Surega  said.   Between  them
    they have no dependents.  Surega's evidence was that the sisters  would
    not be able to afford to support their mother.

35. There was, as Mr Clarke highlighted, a paucity of  evidence  concerning
    the outgoings the sisters have to meet. The income of the  two  sisters
    who are currently working is far higher than the average wage  in  this
    country, and, as Mr Malik accepted at the hearing, the fact  that  that
    income is earned by two persons means  that  the  total  take-home  pay
    received by the pair will be higher than  if  a  single  person  earned
    �69,000. That is because each taxpayer receives a  tax-free  allowance,
    and the operation of the income tax thresholds is such that the overall
    tax paid by two people is less than if a single person earns  the  same
    amount. So much  is  uncontroversial.  The  impact,  however,  of  that
    reality is that the appellant's  daughters  are  relatively  well  off.
    They have not provided any financial details as to the  commitments  or
    otherwise that they are subject to. There is no reason why  they  would
    not be able to provide financial  support  to  their  mother  upon  her
    return to Germany. It would not  necessitate  their  relocation  (which
    Judge Hollingworth appeared to conclude would be disproportionate:  see
    [19] of his decision). As Surega accepted in in cross examination,  she
    would support her mother financially; she would, she said "have to".

36. I find that the appellant would not be destitute in Germany, nor  would
    she be dependent upon a potentially  lengthy  and  difficult  wait  for
    social  housing,  as  her  daughters  would  be  able  to  support  her
    financially. I reject the assertion that they could not  afford  to  do
    so, given their outgoings were not evidenced. Mr  Malik  provided  some
    contemporary bank statements at the outset of the  hearing.  They  were
    not exhibited to the appellant's or  Surega's  witness  statements  and
    were not accompanied by any analysis of the  expenditure  they  reveal.
    They show income and expenditure in the region of �3000 over the course
    of a month. The start and end statement balances were  both  overdrawn,
    however the money in and money out was considerable. Before the  First-
    tier Tribunal, Sinduya's bank statement displayed  a  balance  of  over
    �5700 at 26 March 2019, with much larger sums  regularly  featuring  in
    the months leading up to that point. For example, on 24 September 2018,
    the balance was �35,018.56. It was consistently over �30,000  until  30
    November 2018, when it dropped to �28,000. It had  gradually  decreased
    in the run-up to the final  date  on  the  statement,  26  March  2019.
    Sinduya maintained a healthy balance at all times.  Her  statement  for
    the First-tier  Tribunal  said  that  her  income  was  around  �45,000
    annually. The appellant's daughters  are  relatively  wealthy,  and  no
    evidence has been provided to demonstrate that they would not  be  able
    to manifest the clear love and support that they currently provide  for
    their mother in the form of financial help upon her return to Germany.

37. I have been  provided  with  no  documentary  evidence  concerning  the
    alleged dispute between the appellant's tenants  in  Germany,  nor  the
    claimed requirement for a German notary to witness a formal transfer of
    property.  In any event,  these  points  are  neutral  as  regards  the
    appellant; her flat in Germany is required to  satisfy  a  confiscation
    order made here.  My analysis will be based on  the  premise  that  the
    appellant has no assets in Germany.

38. In relation to the appellant's health, she claims  to  have  slipped  a
    disc. She currently receives counselling  from  a  psychotherapist  for
    depression and anxiety; her counsellor writes that the counselling,  in
    Tamil, is to help the appellant cope with the  return  to  family  life
    following her release from prison. The appellant  has  provided  no  GP
    records or other medical evidence going to  her  claimed  inability  to
    relocate to Germany. She  explained  that  her  GP  has  requested  her
    medical records from the prison where she served her sentence, and that
    it has been difficult to obtain them. I accept that  explanation  to  a
    point, but it does not satisfy  the  wider  criticism  that  Mr  Clarke
    highlights that there is a paucity of medical evidence. I  accept  that
    the appellant would not be able to undertake manual  work  in  Germany.
    Other than that, there is an absence of evidence  going  to  the  wider
    medical impairments the appellant claims to experience.

39. The appellant made two  mutually  exclusive  claims  about  the  likely
    social impact of being returned to Germany. On the one hand,  she  said
    that she had lost all links with the  Tamil  community.   Everyone  she
    knew had moved on.  Their children had grown up and their circumstances
    had changed, she said.  On the other hand, she said that  she  was  now
    well known within the Tamil community in  Germany  on  account  of  her
    convictions.  Everyone knows about her  offences,  as  they  were  well
    documented in the Tamil press. I consider this aspect of  the  evidence
    to be contradictory. It cannot be the case that the Tamil community  in
    Germany knows about the appellant's offending if she is an  unknown  to
    them. If, as  she  claims,  she  has  no  connections  with  the  Tamil
    community in Germany, and is a complete stranger to that community,  it
    cannot be the case that her offending has any profile to  speak  of  in
    Germany.  If she has no  connections  in  the  community,  it  must  be
    speculation that the community has ostracised her.  Although  both  the
    appellant and Surega claimed that there had been news coverage  of  the
    appellant's  trial  and  convictions,  they  provided  no   documentary
    evidence, not even a screenshot of a web-based news article, to support
    that. Such assertions would be relatively easy  to  document,  yet  the
    appellant has provided no supporting evidence.

40. I attach very little weight to the suggestion that  the  appellant  has
    been ostracised by the Tamil community. I accept that, in the 16  years
    that have passed since she left, the family may have a lost  the  links
    they previously enjoyed in Germany. In my view, that provides no  basis
    to conclude that such links could not be re-established in the  future.
    Surega said that she has added Facebook friends from the  community  to
    her Facebook account, although added that they are dormant and that she
    has no real  interaction  with  them.  There  was  no  suggestion,  for
    example, that either the appellant or her daughters had sought to reach
    out to the acquaintances, or former acquaintances,  they  have  in  the
    Tamil community in Germany. The suggestions that  they  have  lost  all
    links, and that any former links  are  beyond  restoration,  cannot  be
    established on the evidence.

Proportionality

41. Drawing the  above  analysis  together,  therefore,  I  return  to  the
    question of whether it would be proportionate for the appellant  to  be
    removed.

42. Mr Malik relied upon Lumsdon, which concerned the proportionality of  a
    criminal advocacy quality assurance scheme, and the proportionality  of
    the regime as a whole.  It is of course of valuable assistance but,  as
    the Supreme Court noted at [23]:

         "It has also to be  said  that  any  attempt  to  identify  general
         principles  [concerning  proportionality  under   EU   law]   risks
         conveying the impression that the court's approach is less  nuanced
         and fact-sensitive than is actually the case. As  in  the  case  of
         other principles of public law, the way in which the  principle  of
         proportionality is applied in  EU  law  depends  to  a  significant
         extent upon the context."

43. The examples of proportionality under EU law outlined  by  the  Supreme
    Court related to the proportionality of the measures  and  acts  of  EU
    institutions,  and  decisions  taken  by  a  Member  State   concerning
    derogations from EU law relied upon in (or in  order  to  establish)  a
    regulatory regime, rather than case-specific decisions.    For example,
    the Supreme Court considered the regulation of gambling [37], Community
    legislation concerning the harmonisation of tobacco products  marketing
    [40], regulation of hormones in livestock  farming  so  as  to  address
    barriers  to  trade  and  distortions  in  competition   arising   from
    differences  in  legislation   across   the   internal   market   [41],
    authorisation procedures for the use of  certain  regulated  substances
    [47],  the  right  to  establishment  of  posted  workers   [55],   the
    application of Luxembourg's employment law  in  the  case  of  services
    provided  by  employees  based  in  other  Member  States   [56],   the
    prohibition of  foodstuffs  fortified  with  additives  [57],  currency
    controls [61], restrictions on the ownership of pharmacies [64], and so
    on.

44. The context-specific approach (c.f. Lumsdon at [23]) taken by Directive
    2004/38/EC and the 2016 Regulations to the question of  proportionality
    is,  within  the  wider  framework  of  the  approach  of  EU  law   to
    proportionality, to set out a  series  of  free  movement  of  persons-
    specific  considerations  relevant  to  the  question  of  removal   on
    proportionality grounds.  Those are the factors  contained  in  Article
    27(2) of the Directive and regulation 27(6), taken with the derogations
    on  the  right  to  private  and  family  life  under  the  Charter  of
    Fundamental Rights, Article 7.

45. As an EU citizen, the appellant's right to reside in  this  country  is
    conferred by the EU Treaties.  The free movement of persons is  one  of
    the fundamental freedoms upon which the EU is based.   Her  fundamental
    status is that of being a citizen of the Union (Grzelczyk Case C-184/99
    at [31]).  Derogations from EU law should be construed narrowly.

46. In Robinson v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 85 at [58], the Court of Appeal accepted that,  in  principle,  the
    aims of public policy and public security provide legitimate aims which
    can justify the interference such fundamental rights.  It said:

         "In  principle,  the  concepts  of  'public  policy'  and   'public
         security' provide legitimate aims which can justify an interference
         with those fundamental rights."

47. The Court of Appeal outlined at [60] to [62] the  factors  relevant  to
    proportionality in this context:

         "60. [The finding that an individual represents a genuine,  present
         and sufficiently serious threat etc] cannot be drawn  automatically
         on the basis solely of the criminal record of the person concerned.
         It can only result, where appropriate, from a  specific  assessment
         by the national court of all the current and relevant circumstances
         of the case, in the light of the principle of  proportionality,  of
         the child's best interests and  of  the  fundamental  rights  whose
         observance the courts ensure.

     61. That assessment must therefore take account in particular of:

             (1)  the personal conduct of the individual concerned;

             (2)  the length and legality of his residence on the territory
             of the member state concerned;

             (3)  the nature and gravity of the offence committed;

             (4)  the extent to which the person concerned is  currently  a
             danger to society;

             (5)  the age of the child at issue and his state of health;

             (6)  his economic and family situation.

         62.  In carrying  out  the  balancing  exercise  required  by  that
         assessment, the court must take account of the  fundamental  rights
         at stake, in particular the right to respect for private and family
         life,  and  ensure  that  the  principle  of   proportionality   is
         observed."

    Put  another  way,  the  relevant  criteria  are  those  contained   in
    regulation 27(5) and (6) of the 2016 Regulations.

48. The  preserved  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are  that  the
    appellant represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society.   Inherent  to
    that preserved finding is the fact that the appellant's removal is,  in
    principle, justified on grounds of public policy and  public  security.
    The appellant committed a very serious  criminal  offence,  meriting  a
    period of imprisonment  of  seven  years.   The  circumstances  of  her
    offending, including its persistence, calculation and gravity are  such
    that (i) she bears  a  high  level  of  culpability  for  very  serious
    offences which  will  have  facilitated  and  encouraged  much  broader
    criminal offending and (ii) she  poses  a  risk  of  reoffending.   The
    appellant has consistently eschewed the opportunity to express  remorse
    for her offence and demonstrate insight into the underlying  causes  of
    her offending behaviour.

49. As noted by paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations:

         "The removal from the United Kingdom of  an  EEA  national  or  the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for  example,  through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an  EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate."

         The contrary is true in the case of this  appellant,  who  has  not
         demonstrated any reformation or rehabilitation.

50. I accept that the appellant has resided here for 16 years.  Although Mr
    Malik accepted in the error of law hearing that  the  appellant  enjoys
    only the lowest level of protection, there is no suggestion that at all
    points she has been without a right to reside.  I accept that  she  has
    been lawfully present for at least some  of  the  time.   She  has,  of
    course, spent a  considerable  period  of  time  in  prison  since  her
    conviction  in  2014,  and  such  imprisonment  breaks  continuity   of
    residence and, in principle, evidences a loss of any integrating  links
    previously forged.

49. The appellant's cultural and social  integration  in  this  country  is
    limited.  She does not speak English.  Her evidence was that she has no
    friends, and that her focus is primarily on  life  with  her  daughter.
    Schedule  1(2)  to  the  2016  Regulations  provides  that  such   life
    circumstances are minimal evidence of integration:

         "An EEA national or the family member of  an  EEA  national  having
         extensive familial and societal links  with  persons  of  the  same
         nationality or language does  not  amount  to  integration  in  the
         United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
         integration must be present before a  person  may  be  regarded  as
         integrated in the United Kingdom."

    The appellant's offending took place over a significant period of time,
    meaning that what integrating  links  there  are  were  formed  over  a
    largely overlapping period and attract  little  weight.   See  Schedule
    1(4)(a).

50. Despite her limited integration, the appellant's  deportation  will  be
    disruptive, as outlined at [25], above.  It  will  have  a  significant
    impact upon her adult daughters.  The impact will not  go  beyond  that
    which would normally be expected in a deportation situation; the claims
    that  the  appellant  provided  invaluable  assistance  after  Surega's
    operation are tempered  by  the  fact  that  the  appellant  could  not
    remember when the operation was.  Germany is a short flight  away  from
    the United Kingdom.  Her daughters, who are German  citizens,  will  be
    able to return to visit her, even if they do  not  choose  to  relocate
    with her  (I  make  no  finding  that  permanent  relocation  would  be
    reasonable or necessary; the findings in  this  decision  are  premised
    upon the appellant returning alone).

51. As a woman  of  53  with  limited  German  and  limited  mobility,  the
    appellant is likely to take some time to find work, if she is  able  to
    at all.  The appellant will not be destitute, as I have found that  her
    daughters will provide her with funds and wider support  until  she  is
    able either to support herself or receive help from the  German  state.
    I have been presented with no reasons as to why she will not be able to
    learn German.

52. The appellant will return to Germany having lost links with  the  Tamil
    community there, but there are no reasons why she cannot begin to reach
    out to the community and establish relationships again.  It was  common
    ground that there is a Tamil community in Germany.  I do not accept the
    evidence of ostracization for the reasons given above,  and  find  that
    the  appellant  will  be  able  to  integrate  within  a  community  of
    likeminded individuals.  I have been presented with  no  evidence  that
    she will not be able to attend the temple in Sri Lanka.

53. I accept that the appellant has never lived alone; she married when she
    was relatively young, and has always lived with her husband and family,
    and more recently  her  daughters.   I  consider  that  subjecting  the
    appellant to this state of affairs is a proportionate response  to  the
    threat she poses, given the gravity of the underlying conduct which led
    to her convictions.

54. The appellant is in need of healthcare.  There is  no  suggestion  that
    adequate healthcare will not be available in Germany.   To  the  extent
    that her daughters are willing and able to pay for private  healthcare,
    there are no reasons they will not be able to pay for it to take  place
    in Germany.

Conclusion on proportionality

55. I find that the appellant's deportation is  necessary  to  protect  the
    United Kingdom's public security from the risk of repetition of serious
    crime.  It is a proportionate response to risk posed by the appellant's
    presence.  The impact on the  appellant  and  her  wider  family  is  a
    proportionate response.   Her  deportation  goes  no  further  than  is
    necessary to achieve the United  Kingdom's  public  policy  and  public
    security objectives, in  the  face  of  an  individual  whose  presence
    represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society.

Article 8

56. Mr Malik did not pursue any submissions based on Article 8 of the ECHR.
     The regime established by the 2016 Regulations is more generous to the
    appellant than that contained in the Immigration Rules and  in  section
    117C  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The
    appellant could only defeat deportation under the rules or section 117C
    if she were able to point to "very compelling circumstances"  over  and
    above  the  statutory  exceptions  to  deportation.   Neither  of   the
    exceptions are engaged in the present case: the appellant has not lived
    here for  most  of  her  life,  she  is  not  socially  and  culturally
    integrated,  and  there  are  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
    integration in Germany.  She  does  not  have  a  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child.  To the extent that she retains a  relationship  with
    her husband, no reasons have been presented to me as to why it would be
    unduly harsh on him for the appellant  to  be  removed.   See  sections
    117C(4) and (5) respectively.  There is nothing exceptional  about  the
    appellant's case as analysed elsewhere in this decision which could  be
    capable of reaching the elevated threshold that  there  need  be  "very
    compelling circumstances".  The appellant cannot succeed on  Article  8
    grounds.

57. This appeal is dismissed.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B. Malik, Counsel (Direct Access)
For the Respondent:    Ms J. Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Gunaratnam Sriskantharajah, is a citizen of Germany born
    on 7 April 1966.  She appeals against a decision of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Hollingworth promulgated on 2  May  2019  dismissing  her  appeal
    against a decision of the respondent to deport her to Germany under the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

Factual Background and Permission to Appeal

 2. On 10 November 2014,  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  a  number  of
    accounts of converting criminal property contrary to section 327 of the
    Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (money laundering) following a trial  before
    a jury in the Crown Court at Southwark.  She was sentenced on a  number
    of counts to seven years' imprisonment, to run concurrently.   We  will
    turn to her offences in more detail shortly.  Put simply, she worked in
    a Bureau de Change in Central London which she,  with  at  least  three
    others including  her  husband,  had  used  as  a  front  for  a  money
    laundering operation through which  �145,000,000  of  the  proceeds  of
    crime in sterling and euros and were laundered.

 3. The judge found that the personal conduct of the appellant  represented
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society, and that it  would  be  proportionate
    for her to be deported.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey on  the
    basis, first that it was arguable that the judge relied "unduly" on the
    November 2014 conviction in the absence of any analysis as  to  whether
    the  appellant  continued  to  represent   a   genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat.  Judge Storey noted that there appeared to
    be an absence of references to the lapse of time since the offence  had
    been committed.  Secondly, Judge Storey considered that it was arguable
    that the judge erred by his application of the  established  principles
    derived from Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights,  in
    particular the concept of "unduly harsh" and whether  there  were  more
    than the normal emotional ties between  the  appellant  and  her  adult
    daughters in this country, and it was arguable that that  had  infected
    the assessment of proportionality.

The Law

 5. This appeal is governed by the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations  2016   ("the  2016  Regulations"),  which  implement   the
    requirements of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and  of
    the Council.  Regulation 27 reflects Article 27 of the  Directive.   It
    governs removal decisions taken on grounds  of  public  policy,  public
    security and public health.

 6. The 2016 Regulations provide a graduated scheme  of  residence  rights,
    with corresponding tiered levels of protection from removal.  The  most
    basic right of residence is conferred on those  with  fewer  than  five
    years' continuous residence in accordance with the Regulations.   Those
    resident in the United Kingdom on this basis may be removed "on grounds
    of public policy, public security or public  health"  (Article  27(1)),
    provided certain additional criteria are met.

 7. Those resident under the Regulations for a period of five years or more
    acquire the right of permanent residence.  Where an  individual  enjoys
    the right of permanent residence, the level of protection from  removal
    is upgraded to serious grounds of public policy,  public  security  and
    public health.

 8. Where a decision is taken on  any  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
    security or public health,  it  must  comply  with  the  principles  of
    proportionality.  Regulation 27(5) of the  Regulations  implements  the
    requirements contained in Articles 27 and 28 of  Directive  2004/38/EC.
    Regulation 27(5) provides, where relevant:

         "(5) The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
                  in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided
                  the grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy and public security in relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom ('P'), the decision maker  must
             take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
             health, family and economic situation  of  P,  P's  length  of
             residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and  cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom  and  the  extent  of  P's
             links with P's country of origin.

         [...]

         (8)  A court or Tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
             this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society). "

    Schedule 1 sets out a range of considerations relevant to that issue.

Discussion

Ground 1

 9. It is common ground in the present matter that the appellant  does  not
    enjoy the right of permanent residence, and therefore benefits from the
    basic level of protection (see the analysis of this issue  at  [10]  to
    [12] of the judge's decision).  Before us, Mr Malik  did  not  seek  to
    detract from this position.

10. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Isherwood submits that  the  judge  did
    not fall into error in relation to whether the appellant  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.  She  points  to  the
    factors  that  were  considered  and  endorsed  in  linked  cases  K  v
    Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie and H. F. v Belgische Staat
    (Cases C-331/16 and C-366/16) ECLI:EU:C:2018:296  [2018]  INLR  693  at
    [44] to [46], such as maintaining social cohesion and public confidence
    in immigration systems.  Those are some  of  the  factors  outlined  in
    Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations.

11. The respondent also highlights the  nature  of  the  conduct  involved.
    This was an offence committed over a period of  five  years,  involving
    the laundering of a substantial amount of money.   It  was  an  offence
    that has a cross-border dimension as  it  involved  euros  as  well  as
    sterling.  It facilitated and encouraged other criminal activity, on  a
    very significant scale.

12. Ms Isherwood highlights the judge's findings that the appellant did not
    recognise herself to be an offender.  It was clear from the description
    of the evidence that  the  judge  heard  that  the  appellant  had  not
    recognised the seriousness of the  offences  for  which  she  had  been
    convicted and sentenced.

13. Mr Malik highlights the minimal risk of reoffending identified  by  the
    OASys report.   He  accepts  that,  in  principle,  it  is  not  always
    necessary for judges to follow OASys Reports prepared by the  Probation
    Service.  We agree; judges can depart from the  analysis  contained  in
    such reports, provided there are sufficient grounds for doing so.

14. In the present matter that principle applies with  greater  force.  The
    report said in terms that it was to be disregarded.  On page 7  of  the
    report dated 19 September 2017 the following words feature  in  capital
    letters:

         "NO FORMAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN PERFORMED SO PLEASE DISREGARD  THESE
         SCORES AS THEY ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE OFFENDER".

15. Accordingly,  although  it  is  right  to  observe  that  judges  where
    appropriate can depart from the  terms  of  an  OASys  assessment,  the
    present assessment provided no basis upon  which  it  could  rationally
    have been followed by the judge in any event.  Although the report does
    feature some cursory analysis by way of unexplained  quantities  placed
    in boxes describing the likelihood of reoffending (for example on  page
    6 it states there is a 4% possibility of reoffending within a year  and
    a 7% possibility of reoffending in two years), it  is  clear  from  the
    caveat quoted above that it is not possible to ascribe  any  degree  of
    significance to the contents of the report.  The report  itself  stated
    that the "scores" it contained were to be disregarded.

16. Turning to Mr Malik's submission that previous convictions  in  and  of
    themselves are an  insufficient  basis  upon  which  a  decision  under
    regulation 27 of the Regulations may  be  taken,  that  submission,  in
    principle, correctly reflects the legal framework.  So  much  is  clear
    from the extract of the case of K referred to by  both  representatives
    in their skeleton  arguments.   The  principle  features  not  only  in
    regulation 27(5)(e) of the 2016 Regulations, but may also be  found  in
    Article 27(2) of the Directive.

17. K concerned a decision that had previously been taken by the  competent
    authorities of the  Netherlands  concerning  exclusion  of  a  Croatian
    citizen from the Refugee Convention pursuant to Article 1F(a), prior to
    the accession of Croatia to  the  EU.   Upon  accession,  the  Croatian
    citizen sought to reverse  the  decision  taken  under  Article  1F  by
    reference  to  his  newly-acquired  residence  rights  under  Directive
    2004/38/EC.  The issue was to what  extent  was  the  prior  Convention
    exclusion decision relevant  for  the  purposes  of  Article  27(1)  of
    Directive 2004/38/EC?

18. The operative part of the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Justice  in  K
    provided the following answer to the question  referred  by  the  Dutch
    referring court.  It states that past  offending  or  a  finding  under
    Article 1F of the Refugee Convention:

         "...does not enable the competent authorities of that member  state
         to consider automatically that the mere presence of that person  in
         its territory constitutes, whether or not  there  is  any  risk  of
         reoffending, a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
         affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society."  (Emphasis
         added)

    See also [51] in the body of the judgment:

         "It follows that the fact that the person concerned  has  been  the
         subject, in the past, of a  decision  excluding  him  from  refugee
         status pursuant to one of  those  provisions  cannot  automatically
         permit the finding that the mere presence of  that  person  in  the
         territory of the host Member State constitutes a  genuine,  present
         and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the  fundamental
         interests of society, within the meaning of the first  sentence  of
         the second subparagraph of Article  27(2)  of  Directive  2004/38."
         (Emphasis added)

19. We consider that the same principle is capable of applying  by  analogy
    in relation to previous convictions, consistent with Article 27(2)  and
    regulation 27(5)(e).  In  the  present  context,  we  consider  that  a
    central feature of the operative part of the judgment in K is the  word
    "automatically".  Plainly, were it the case that the judge  had  relied
    solely on the mere fact of the  conviction,  without  any  accompanying
    analysis of  the  underlying  circumstances  of  the  offence  or,  for
    example, the attitude of the appellant to  her  conviction,  then  that
    would not be an approach that could be sustainable.  In K, the Court of
    Justice found that previous findings of  reprehensible  conduct  cannot
    "automatically" form the basis of a decision under Article 27(2).

20. However, it is clear from an analysis of the decision of the judge that
    he did consider the underlying conduct of the appellant,  the  attitude
    of the appellant to her conviction, and considered  the  indicators  of
    likely future risk arising from her attitude to her offending  and  her
    understanding of what she had done.

21. We consider that it is possible to categorise the analysis of the judge
    in  relation  to  this  issue  under  two  broad  headings:  first  the
    seriousness of the offence; and secondly, the personal conduct  of  the
    appellant.

22. As to the seriousness of the offence, the judge noted at  [13]  of  his
    decision that  the  decision  letter  had  quoted  the  remarks  of  an
    Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement at HMRC.  The HMRC  official
    is quoted at [25] of the  decision  letter  as  having  said  that  the
    appellant and her co-defendants used their business,  "as  a  front  to
    launder profits made by many of the UK's  most  serious  and  dangerous
    criminal gangs".  The judge  observed  at  [13]  that  the  appellant's
    conduct had enabled numerous  criminal  enterprises  to  exist  and  to
    thrive.

23. The seriousness of the offence is undoubtedly relevant; it goes to  the
    presence of the necessary grounds of public policy and public security.
     It places the role of the appellant in the context and, in  principle,
    provided it  is  sufficiently  linked  to  her  personal  conduct,  the
    seriousness of the offence can reveal the  nature  and  extent  of  the
    likely risk that the appellant may present in the future.

24. As to the personal conduct of the appellant, the judge noted  that  the
    offending under consideration had continued for a period of five years,
    from 2006 to 2011.  At [14],  the  judge  highlighted  the  appellant's
    readiness over that time to engage in these serious criminal activities
    which were "effectively encouraging criminal activity on  the  part  of
    organised gangs".  As to the risk she posed, he found that her  conduct
    was "the antithesis of a low risk of reoffending".  The judge  ascribed
    significance to the fact that the appellant had been willing to  engage
    in this extensive criminal activity against a background of  having  no
    previous convictions.  The judge observed that  the  "sheer  scale  and
    enormity of the criminality upon which she  embarked  and  remained  so
    embarked for such a period of time" was such  that  provided  a  strong
    foundation to conclude that  the  personal  conduct  of  the  appellant
    represented a substantial risk of reoffending.

25. At [15] the judge specifically considered the principle which Mr  Malik
    contends  he  failed  properly  to  apply,  namely  that  the  previous
    convictions of an appellant do not in themselves  justify  a  decision.
    We consider that the judge correctly directed  himself  concerning  the
    requirement that the individual conduct of the appellant must represent
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society.  The judge analysed  the  appellant's
    conduct carefully.  He noted the seriousness of the offence.

26. Judge Hollingworth outlined the Crown Court judge's sentencing  remarks
    that criminals cannot operate in this country without the  presence  of
    those prepared to launder the proceeds of their crime.   The  appellant
    was engaged in organised crime,  found  the  sentencing  judge.   Judge
    Hollingworth observed that in order to  satisfy  a  confiscation  order
    which had been made against her, the appellant  had  been  required  to
    sell her home and other assets in order to have any hope of  satisfying
    the requirements made against her.  The  appellant  had  no  meaningful
    qualifications and the only time she had worked in this country was  in
    the Bureau de Change  which  had  provided  the  front  for  the  money
    laundering operations.

27. Against that background, at [17], Judge  Hollingworth  found  that  the
    appellant had demonstrated no remorse  and  had  not  taken  any  steps
    towards achieving rehabilitation.  He also found that there had been no
    evidence that the appellant  had  undertaken  any  rehabilitative  work
    while in custody, and he also observed that the primary  offending  had
    taken place by the appellant alongside her husband; that was a relevant
    factor because the presence of those associated with the commission  of
    criminal offences goes to the willingness and the risk of an individual
    committing further offences.

28. We consider that these findings demonstrate that  the  judge  correctly
    applied the principle that previous convictions do  not  in  themselves
    justify decisions under regulation 27.  Rather, the  judge  focused  on
    the underlying conduct of the appellant and  her  wider  circumstances,
    before concluding that her presence represented the necessary, genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society.

29. We consider these were findings that were open to the judge to reach on
    the evidence before him.  This appellant  had  engaged  in  a  serious,
    sustained and organised pattern of offending.  We accept  that  in  the
    context of the wider conspiracy of which she was a part, she  played  a
    lesser role than that of her husband, who was the main culprit.  He was
    sentenced to a period of twelve years'  imprisonment.   The  mere  fact
    that there were co-conspirators or other offenders who were of  greater
    culpability than the appellant cannot have the  effect  of  diminishing
    her involvement in this offence.

30. Although we note the observations of the permission  judge  that  there
    had been minimal references to the passage of time since the offence in
    question, we do not consider that to have been an error  of  law.   The
    judge carefully considered the risk profile the appellant was likely to
    present by reference to her personal  circumstances  and  her  previous
    willingness to engage in such serious and sustained  offending  against
    the background of having no previous convictions.  The  judge  appeared
    to  have  highlighted  the  well-established  pattern  taken  by   many
    criminals whereby offending of greater seriousness  is  preceded  by  a
    build-up, or crescendo, of less serious offending.  By  contrast,  this
    appellant had launched straight into offending of such seriousness  and
    of  such  a  magnitude  that  a  custodial  sentence  of  seven  years'
    imprisonment was merited.  The judge was entitled to observe  that  the
    appellant had no apparent means of supporting herself and displayed  no
    insight or remorse into her offending.

31. We reject the submissions of Mr Malik that  it  is  necessary  for  the
    previous conduct of the appellant to evoke "a deep public revulsion" in
    order for it to be sufficient to merit a decision under Article  27  of
    the Directive.  Mr Malik relies on the case of Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department v Robinson [2018] EWCA Civ 85 in order to establish
    this point.  Mr Malik highlights the judgment of Lord Justice Singh  at
    [71] in which the issue of public policy was addressed.  In our view it
    is important to read that entire paragraph in context.

32. Lord Justice  Singh  had  introduced  the  discussion  of  the  "public
    revulsion" issue at [68] in these terms:

         "There was an interesting debate between the parties in this appeal
         about  whether  past  conduct  alone,  and  "public  revulsion"  in
         particular, may be sufficient to justify deportation of an offender
         in this sort of case. In that context there was  debate  about  the
         extent to which the decision  of  the  European  Court  of  Justice
         ("ECJ") in R v Bouchereau remains good  law.  That  case  concerned
         Directive 64/221."

    The context of the discussion in R v Bouchereau [1978] ECR 732  was  in
    response to submissions by the United  Kingdom  that  certain  conduct,
    even where there was no  demonstrable  present  threat,  could  justify
    removal  under  one  of  the  predecessor  instruments   to   Directive
    2004/38/EC.  The Advocate General in Bouchereau (at page 742)  recorded
    the submissions made by the United Kingdom as follows:

         "The United Kingdom Government ... points out that cases do  arise,
         exceptionally, where the personal conduct of an alien has been such
         that, whilst not necessarily evincing any clear propensity  on  his
         part, it has caused such deep public revulsion that  public  policy
         requires his departure." (Emphasis added)

33. Against that background, Lord Justice Singh's judgment at [71] needs to
    be quoted in full.  His Lordship quoted  extracts  from  the  Court  of
    Justice's judgment in Bouchereau from [27] to [30] and then said:

         "It is important to recognise that what the ECJ was  there  talking
         about was not a threat  to  "the  public"  but  a  threat  to  "the
         requirements of public policy". The latter is a broader concept. At
         para. 28 the ECJ said that past conduct  can  only  be  taken  into
         account in so far as  it  provides  evidence  of  personal  conduct
         constituting a  "present  threat  to  the  requirements  of  public
         policy." As the ECJ said at para. 29, "in general" that will  imply
         that the person concerned has a "propensity to act in the same  way
         in the future" but that need  not  be  so  in  every  case.  It  is
         possible that the past conduct "alone" may constitute a  threat  to
         the requirements of public policy. In order to understand  in  what
         circumstances that might be so, I consider that it is  helpful  and
         appropriate to have regard to the opinion of the  Advocate  General
         in Bouchereau, when he referred to "deep public revulsion". That is
         the kind of extreme case in which past conduct alone may suffice as
         constituting  a  present  threat  to  the  requirements  of  public
         policy."

34. Lord Justice Singh was considering the first limb of public policy  and
    public security formulation contained in the Directive.  It was in  the
    context of addressing public policy,  specifically  and  in  isolation,
    rather than addressing the public security limb of the test, which  the
    Court of Appeal said that requires evidence  of  offending  of  such  a
    magnitude as to trigger "deep public revulsion", in order  to  merit  a
    decision under Article 27 of the Directive.  As the  quote  highlighted
    by Mr Malik in his  skeleton  argument  makes  clear,  it  will  be  an
    "extreme case" in which past conduct alone may suffice as  constituting
    a present threat to the requirements of public policy.

35. In the present matter we are in different territory.  We do not need to
    address whether a conviction for  laundering  �145,000,000  meriting  a
    seven year  sentence  of  imprisonment  crosses  that  threshold.   The
    respondent does not rely wholly  on  the  public  policy  limb  of  the
    Directive, but rather the public  security  limb.   We  note  that  the
    opening paragraph of the decision letter does address the situation  in
    terms of this  being  a  public  policy  removal.   However,  when  the
    operative analysis contained in the decision letter is examined  it  is
    clear that the position of the Secretary of State relates to the public
    security limb, for example from [21] to [35]. It  is  in  that  context
    that the remarks that the Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations
    at HMRC is outlined and the risk to the United Kingdom of serious  harm
    is highlighted specifically at, for example, [28].

36. We also note the submissions of Ms Isherwood in her  skeleton  argument
    concerning the cross-border dimension of the present case.  In our view
    this is not a case where it is necessary to highlight the  deep  public
    revulsion necessary to sustain a deportation decision taken  solely  on
    the grounds of public policy.

37. For these reasons we find that there is no  merit  to  ground  1.   The
    judge analysed the evidence by reference to the  applicable  principles
    of both the Directive and the Regulations.  In doing so  he  reached  a
    decision that was rational on the material before him.

Ground 2 - unduly harsh

38. Turning to Ground 2, Mr Malik highlights the  repeated  use  throughout
    the judge's proportionality assessment  of  the  term  "unduly  harsh".
    Elsewhere, the judge made references to whether there  were  more  than
    "normal emotional ties" between the appellant and her  adult  children.
    Mr Malik highlights the origins  of  these  terms  in  the  established
    Article 8 jurisprudence, for example as articulated in section 117C  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   Establishing  the
    presence of more than "normal emotional ties" is the  established  test
    for determining whether Article 8 is engaged on  a  family  life  basis
    between adult relatives: see Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at, for example, [25].

39. There is considerable force to  these  submissions.   We  consider  the
    judge's importation of the established Article 8 jurisprudence to  have
    been an error of law.  Given the sensitivity  of  the  assessment  that
    would be required ahead of returning this appellant to  Germany  it  is
    not possible to accept the submissions of Ms Isherwood that  any  error
    of law on the judge's part  in  this  respect  is  not  such  that  the
    decision needs to be set aside.

40. This is a case where the appellant claimed not to have  any  social  or
    other support network upon her return to Germany.  She claimed  not  to
    speak German, having lived entirely within  the  confines  of  a  Tamil
    speaking German community prior to her arrival in the  United  Kingdom.
    A careful and finely balanced assessment of all relevant factors  would
    be required in order to form this  assessment:  Article  28(1)  of  the
    Directive, and  regulation  27(6)  of  the  2016  Regulations  required
    consideration of the appellant's family situation.  In assessing  those
    matters, at [19], the judge appeared to find that  Article  8  was  not
    engaged.  As [19] is a single paragraph that spans three pages,  it  is
    difficult in this decision for us to pinpoint the  judge's  problematic
    analysis without quoting extensively.  Halfway down page 9,  the  judge
    said:

         "I do not find that it  has  been  shown  that  the  appellant  was
         dependent on her two elder daughters or any member  of  her  family
         prior to  her  imprisonment.  I  do  not  find  that  family  life,
         therefore, exists between the appellant  and  the  members  of  her
         family at this juncture.  I do not find that it has been  shown  at
         this juncture that the  ties  go  beyond  normal  emotional  ties."
         (Emphasis added)

    The text  emphasised  above  is  clearly  drawn  from  the  established
    jurisprudence relating to Article 8.

41. While we have sympathy for the judge's use of  Article  8  terminology,
    given this was the approach adopted by the respondent in  the  decision
    letter, we consider the  entirety  of  the  proportionality  assessment
    conducted by the judge to be tainted by the references  to  established
    Article 8 concepts.

42. For example, the "due" amount of harshness that may be expected  in  an
    Article 8 deportation situation is calibrated by reference  the  public
    interest in the deportation of foreign criminals, which is a  statutory
    factor under section 117C(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002: see the discussion in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 at [23].  In  the  context  of  free
    movement rights conferred by the EU Treaties, the concept of a  certain
    amount of harshness being "due" does not necessarily sit well with  the
    established  tests  contained  in  Article  27  of  the  Directive  and
    regulation 27 of the 2016 Regulations.

43. The threshold under Article 8 and the corresponding public interest  in
    deportation is much easier for the Secretary of State to  satisfy  than
    it is for the Secretary of State to satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    2016 Regulations for deportation.  As such, the  application  of  these
    Article 8 concepts subjected the appellant to  a  higher  threshold  to
    demonstrate that her deportation would not be proportionate than  would
    necessarily have  been  the  case  had  the  Regulations  been  applied
    properly.  We note  Ms  Isherwood's  submissions  that  the  Article  8
    terminology was  peppered  throughout  an  assessment  which  otherwise
    appeared  to  apply  the  correct  tests  pursuant   to   the   correct
    terminology.  However, in our view, the analysis was tainted and  needs
    to be set aside.

44. As such this appeal succeeds in relation to ground 2.

45. The judge's findings that the appellant's conduct represents a genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society  are  preserved.   His  assessment  of
    proportionality is set aside.  The matter  will  be  retained  in  this
    Tribunal for a rehearing on that issue.

46. The appropriate course of action is for the matter  to  be  reheard  in
    this Tribunal in order for  the  proportionality  requirements  of  the
    Regulations to be applied.

47. No anonymity direction is made.

Notice of Decision

Judge Hollingworth's decision involved the making of an error on a point  of
law.  It is set aside, with his findings that  the  appellant  represents  a
genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
fundamental interests  of  society  preserved.   The  proportionality  -  or
otherwise - of the  appellant's  removal  will  be  determined  following  a
rehearing in the Upper Tribunal.



DIRECTIONS

The re-making hearing is to be before Judge  Stephen  Smith  sitting  alone,
time estimate 3 hours.

It is to be listed on the first  available  date,  taking  into  account  Mr
Bilal Malik's availability.


Signed   Date 25 September 2019
