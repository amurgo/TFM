    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr Nath (Home Office Presenting Officer)
    For the Respondent:     Miss Shaw, Counsel, instructed by Lee Valley
    Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party,  we  shall,  in
    the  interests  of   convenience   and   consistency,   replicate   the
    nomenclature of the decision at first instance.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. On July 17, 2013 he  was  given
    leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  migrant.  The
    appellant travelled to Pakistan and on his return to the United Kingdom
    on November 29, 2013 he was stopped by immigration officers.  That  day
    the respondent served a notice refusing him leave to enter and  at  the
    same time gave directions for his removal.

 3. On December 6, 2013 the Appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under Section  82(1)  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (hereinafter called the 2002 Act), as amended. The matter  came  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Majid (hereinafter called "the  FtTJ")
    on November 3, 2014 and  he  allowed  his  appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on November 12, 2014.

 4.  The  respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  November  17,  2014.
    Permission to appeal was  granted  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    McDade on December 22, 2014.

 5. The matter came before us on the date set out above. The appellant  was
    in attendance and represented by his counsel.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. Mr Nath identified two arguable issues. Firstly, the FtTJ had failed to
    apply the correct standard of proof and secondly, he had made  findings
    in paragraphs [19] and [20] that were unsupported by evidence.

 7. Miss Shaw accepted that there was merit in both of the grounds advanced
    and did not oppose Mr Nath's application.

 8. We agreed that the determination contained errors in  law  in  that  it
    contained  inadequate  reasoning  and  the  FtTJ's  findings   had   no
    evidential basis.  Having considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of  the
    Practice Statement we agreed to remit the appeal back to the First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

 9. We directed that the respondent  do  serve  on  the  Tribunal  and  the
    appellant's representatives copies of the appellant's application  form
    and transcripts of any interviews  conducted.  These  transcripts  were
    essential for the future conduct of the appeal.

10. The parties should ensure compliance  with  any  directions  issued  in
    light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply to  this  appeal
    from hereon.

DECISION

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. We have set aside the decision.

12. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

13. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier Tribunal and we saw no reason  for  an
    order to be made today.
