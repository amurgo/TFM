Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Lane, instructed by Fursdon Knapper Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect the anonymity of the appellant who has  claimed  asylum.   This
    order prohibits the disclosure directly or indirectly (including by the
    parties) of the identity of the appellant.  Any disclosure  and  breach
    of this order may amount to a contempt  of  court.   This  order  shall
    remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal or court.



Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Morocco who was born on 16 December 1996.
     He claimed asylum on 19 May 2011  having  arrived  in  the  UK  as  an
    illegal entrant on 12 May 2011.  He was then 14 years of age.

 3. On 2 July 2013, the Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's  claim
    for asylum but granted him limited leave to remain until  16  May  2014
    when he would be 17� years  of  age  under  her  policy  applicable  to
    unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

 4. On 15 May 2014, the appellant made a further application for  leave  to
    remain based upon his human rights.

 5. On 2 December 2014, the Secretary of State refused to grant him further
    leave on international protection grounds and on 10 December 2014  made
    a decision to refuse to vary his leave and to  remove  him  by  way  of
    directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006 to Morocco.

The Appeal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 11 May 2015, Judge C Sweeney dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal on all grounds.  He found that the appellant's return to Morocco
    would not breach Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

 7. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission having initially been refused by the First-tier Tribunal, on
    26 August 2015 the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Goldstein) granted the appellant
    permission to appeal.

 8. On 10 September 2015, the Secretary of State filed  a  Rule  24  notice
    opposing the appellant's appeal.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Appellant's Challenge

10. The appellant challenges the decision of Judge Sweeney on five  grounds
    set out in the grounds of appeal and the  skeleton  argument  and  oral
    submissions of Mr Lane who appeared on behalf of the appellant.

          1. The  judge  failed  properly  to  consider  all  the  evidence
             relating to  the  appellant's  circumstances  if  returned  to
             Morocco and, in particular, in reaching his finding  that  the
             appellant is a "capable adaptable and resourceful"  individual
             in paras 59 and 77 of his determination.

          2. The judge erred in applying s.8 of the Asylum and  Immigration
             (Treatment  of  Claimants,  etc.)  Act  2004  in  taking  into
             account, as  damaging  of  the  appellant's  credibility,  his
             failure to claim asylum prior to coming  to  the  UK  when  he
             lived in Spain between the ages of  9  and  14  after  leaving
             Morocco.

          3. The judge erred in law in concluding that para 276ADE did  not
             apply to the appellant and, in  particular,  in  finding  that
             there were not "very significant obstacles" to his integration
             into Morocco given the  evidence  concerning  the  appellant's
             circumstances on return.

          4. The  judge  had  wrongly  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
             appellant had given his evidence through an interpreter  which
             was not the case.  That both infected the judge's  application
             of s.117B(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
             2002 (the "NIA Act 2002") that the appellant could  not  speak
             English but more generally demonstrated that he had failed  to
             apply anxious scrutiny to the appellant's claim.

          5. The judge erred in law in dismissing the appeal under  Art  8.
             Again, it is said, he failed to look at all the  circumstances
             of the appellant in Morocco but also the exceptional closeness
             of the appellant to his foster carers in the UK.  The  judge's
             assessment of proportionality was flawed.

Discussion

11. I will take each of the grounds in turn.  There is, however,  a  degree
    of overlap between the grounds.  In  particular,  the  points  made  in
    relation to ground 1, as Mr Lane acknowledged, spill over into ground 3
    and ground 5.

    Ground 1

12. Mr Lane focused his criticism on the judge's finding that the appellant
    was a "capable, adaptable and resourceful" individual.  The  judge  set
    out his reasons for that finding at paras 59-61 of his determination as
    follows:

         "59. The appellant is capable, adaptable and resourceful.   He  was
             described by Mr [C] as intelligent.  He has shown himself able
             to travel unaccompanied to foreign countries at  a  young  age
             and has been able to take the necessary steps  to  ensure  his
             basic needs are met.  He has acquired  skills,  education  and
             employment in the UK which would be available  to  assist  him
             were he to return to Morocco.

         60.  I agree with Ms Quan that the appellant will be  in  no  worse
             situation than any  other  person  in  Morocco  and  thus  the
             suggestion that he will starve, given the skills and resources
             that he has developed, is not one  that  I  accept.   He  will
             certainly be as able as other residents of Morocco, and, in my
             judgement, most likely more  able,  to  utilise  such  skills,
             education, intelligence, resourcefulness and  adaptability  as
             he has to secure work so as to meet  his  essential  needs  of
             daily life including food, shelter and clothing.

         61.  No evidence has been put before me on behalf of the  appellant
             which causes me to conclude that a  person  with  his  skills,
             capabilities and resources is likely to starve in Morocco."

13. The judge repeated that finding in relation to para 276ADE at  para  77
    of his determination and in relation to Art 8 at  paras  90-92  of  his
    determination.

14. Mr Lane submitted that the judge had failed to take into  account  that
    the appellant had left Morocco aged 9 and had lived in Spain  until  he
    was 14.  He had lived there  for  five  years  but  in  very  difficult
    conditions and was in care (see paras 4-6 of  the  appellant's  witness
    statement dated 30 April 2015 at page  39  of  the  bundle).   Mr  Lane
    submitted that the judge had failed to consider this evidence  and  his
    finding, which Mr Lane accepted was central  to  the  judge's  ultimate
    conclusion,  that   the   appellant   was   "capable,   adaptable   and
    resourceful", was flawed.

15. I do not accept this submission.  The judge was clearly  aware  of  the
    appellant's case on this issue which is specifically set  out  at  para
    14(q) of his determination.  The evidence before the judge was that the
    appellant had survived in Spain (albeit in care) for five years and had
    learnt the Spanish language.  He had been able to  travel  to  the  UK,
    aged 14 and, although again in care supported by foster parents, he had
    learnt English and acquired skills, education and employment in the UK.
     The evidence of his foster carers was that he was likely  to  have  to
    move on from them in the near future.  There was no suggestion  in  the
    evidence that the appellant would not be able to live independently  in
    the UK, now aged 19, in the foreseeable future.

16. Mr Lane also criticised the judge's failure properly  to  consider  the
    appellant's circumstances in Morocco.  In particular, he submitted that
    it was not sufficient to take into account that he spoke  Arabic  given
    that he  had  not  lived  in  the  country  for  ten  years  but,  more
    significantly, there was no evidence  that  he  would  have  family  or
    others to support him on return.  He had left Morocco when he was  aged
    9.

17. The judge dealt with the appellant's circumstances,  in  particular  in
    relation  to  any  family  in  Morocco,  at  various  points   in   his
    determination.  At para 94, the judge said this:

         "94. It is not possible to determine what family the appellant  has
             in Morocco as the appellant has given inconsistent accounts as
             to the location of, and his relationship with members of,  his
             family  and,  in  particular,  his  father,  though  there  is
             certainly a significant possibility that he does  have  family
             in Morocco who can provide him with assistance if required."

18. The basis of that conclusion was twofold.   First,  the  appellant  had
    given an address in Spain as part of the  family  tracing  process  but
    when the Spanish police had attended at the address, as the judge noted
    in para 53: "They had  failed  to  find  anyone  meeting  the  name  or
    description he gave." As a consequence, the location of the appellant's
    parents was unknown.

19. Secondly, the appellant's  evidence  was  wholly  unsatisfactory  on  a
    number of issues.  At paras 31-46, the judge  identified  a  number  of
    inconsistencies in the appellant's account which led him not to  accept
    the appellant's credibility.  But, even further, as the judge noted  at
    para 43 the appellant acknowledged that he had lied during  the  course
    of his  interviews.   At  para  45,  the  judge  said  this  about  the
    appellant's evidence concerning the whereabouts of his family:

         "45. Whilst some of the appellant's answers can be explained by his
             anxiety and his fear of being returned to  Spain  or  Morocco,
             such anxiety and fear do  not,  in  my  judgement,  provide  a
             complete explanation for his inconsistency.  For  example,  he
             gave an untruthful account of the number of siblings  he  has.
             His providing an untruthful account on this issue is  not,  in
             my judgement, explained by a fear of return.  Whether  he  has
             two brothers and two sisters,  or  three  brothers  and  three
             sisters, would seem to be of little effect as  to  whether  or
             not he is likely to be returned to Morocco."

20. Mr Lane submitted that the judge should have proceeded,  therefore,  on
    the basis that the appellant  had  no  family  in  Morocco  to  provide
    support.

21. In my judgment, given the nature of the appellant's evidence, the judge
    was entitled to find in para 94 that he could not  determine  precisely
    what family the appellant had in Morocco but nevertheless to take  into
    account that there was a "significant possibility"  that  he  did  have
    family there.

22. In any event, the judge was entitled to find at para 95 that given  the
    appellant's circumstances he would be able to adapt to life in Morocco.
     The judge said this:

         "95. However, I accept Mrs Quan's submission that the appellant  is
             now an adult and given the capabilities he  has  demonstrated,
             in having adapted to life in Spain and the UK,  that  he  will
             similarly be able to  adapt  to  life  in  Morocco.   He  will
             certainly be in no worse position,  and  in  my  judgement  is
             likely to be in a significantly better  position,  than  other
             residents of Morocco given the training and education  he  has
             received in the UK which he can utilise in Morocco  to  secure
             his future there."

23. In my judgment, Mr Lane's submissions under ground  1  cannot  succeed.
    The judge made findings on the basis of all the evidence before him and
    I am unable to say that his findings were not properly open to  him  on
    the basis  that  they  were  inadequately  reasoned  or  irrational  or
    perverse.  The judge was entitled to find as he did,  for  example,  in
    para 59 and apply that finding in reaching his decisions in respect  of
    Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR and also para 276ADE of the Rules.

24. For these reasons, I reject ground 1.

    Ground 2

25. Mr Lane criticised the judge's approach to s.8  of  the  2004  Act,  at
    paras 47-50 of his determination.  There, the judge says this:

         "47. I also bear in mind Section 8 (2) and (4) of  The  Asylum  and
             Immigration (Treatment of Claimants Etc)  Act  2004.   I  take
             into account the guidance given by the Court of Appeal  in  JT
             Cameroon v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  2008
             EWCA Civ 878 where it was said that conduct within  section  8
             was potentially damaging to an appellant's credibility.

         48.  I accept the respondent's submission that  the  appellant  had
             ample opportunity to apply for asylum in  Spain,  which  is  a
             safe country.  His failure to do so thus engages section 8 (4)
             of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants Etc) Act
             2004,  and  is  thus  damaging   to   his   credibility.    No
             satisfactory explanation  has  been  provided  to  me  by  the
             appellant as to why he did not apply for asylum in Spain if he
             has, as he contends, a valid Article 3 claim.

         49.  Similarly,  as  above,  I  have  found  that  the  appellant's
             inconsistent  accounts  are  damaging   to   his   credibility
             independently of the provisions of Section 8 (2) of  The  2004
             Act,  though  the  provisions  of  that   act   reinforce   my
             conclusions in this regard.

         50.  I have borne in mind that that is one factor to be taken  into
             account when assessing the appellant's  credibility.   I  have
             also taken into account that that person lies in  relation  to
             one  issue  does  not  mean  that  their  whole   account   is
             untruthful."

26. Mr Lane submitted that the judge had failed to take  into  account  the
    appellant's explanation, set out for example in his witness  statement,
    that he was only 9 years old when he went  to  Spain  and  lived  there
    until he was 14 and he had particular difficulties when he lived there.
      The  judge  was  wrong  to  say  that  there  was  no   "satisfactory
    explanation" for the appellant's failure to claim asylum.

27. In my judgment, there are two answers to this point.  First, the  judge
    was clearly aware of the appellant's circumstances in  Spain.   He  set
    out  the  appellant's  case  on  this  point  at  para  14(b)  of   the
    determination namely that the appellant was afraid  that  he  would  be
    sent back to Morocco and beaten up again, as he claimed had  previously
    been the case (see also para 63 of the  determination).   However,  the
    judge did not accept this aspect of the  appellant's  claim  which  had
    only been raised at the hearing and  was  not  mentioned  in  his  SEF,
    asylum interview or witness  statement.   At  paras  63-71,  the  judge
    rejected the appellant's account as, in effect,  a  recent  fabrication
    that he had been beaten by the authorities  in  Morocco  which  he  had
    consistently not mentioned until the hearing itself.  Consequently, the
    appellant's own explanation as to why he did not claim asylum in  Spain
    was rejected by the judge.  It was not the appellant's case that he did
    not know how to claim asylum and, indeed, arriving in the UK aged 14 he
    immediately did claim asylum.  I see nothing in  Mr  Lane's  contention
    that the judge was not entitled to count as damaging of the appellant's
    credibility that he had not previously claimed asylum  before  arriving
    in the UK.

28. Secondly, as Mr Richards submitted it  is  also  clear  that  s.8  only
    provided a basis for doubting the appellant's  account.   At  para  50,
    which I have set above, the judge says it was "one factor" in assessing
    the appellant's credibility and at para 49 that it  "reinforce[d]"  the
    judge's conclusion based on other reasons that the  appellant  was  not
    credible.

29. For these reasons, the judge was entitled to take into account, to  the
    extent that he did, the appellant's  failure  to  claim  asylum  and  I
    reject ground 2.

    Ground 3

30. Mr Lane sought to challenge the judge's decision under para 276ADE,  in
    particular subpara (vi) that it had not been established that:

         "... there would be very significant obstacles to  the  applicant's
         integration into the country to  which  he  would  have  to  go  if
         required to leave the UK".

31. The judge's reasoning is at paras 76-77 as follows:

         "76. As regards paragraph 276 ADE, the appellant does  not  satisfy
             subparagraphs (iii) - (v) thereof.   As  regards  subparagraph
             (vi), the appellant entered the UK on 19 May 2011 and has thus
             been present here for  some  four  years.   He  has  lived  in
             Morocco for the first nine  years  of  his  life.   He  speaks
             Arabic.   As  referred  to  below,  there  is  a   significant
             possibility that he has family living in Morocco,  though  due
             to the  appellant's  own  inconsistency  on  this  issue,  the
             precise  position  in  this  regard   cannot   be   accurately
             ascertained.

         77.  Given the initiative, skills, capabilities,  adaptability  and
             resourcefulness  shown  by   the   appellant   in   travelling
             independently to and creating a life for himself in Spain  and
             subsequently the UK, taken together with  the  skills  he  has
             developed as a result of the foster care he has received,  and
             the education and employment he has undertaken in the UK,  all
             of which can be transferred to Morocco, I  am  satisfied  that
             the appellant could integrate  back  into  Morocco  relatively
             quickly and without encountering significant  difficulty  were
             he required to return there.  In the circumstances, I  do  not
             accept that there would be very significant obstacles  to  his
             reintegration into Morocco."

32. To the extent that this challenge mirrors the challenge in ground 1, it
    cannot be sustained.  In addition, Mr Lane submitted that the judge had
    failed in para 76 to take into account that the appellant had been  out
    of Morocco for ten years.  Instead, he had simply focused on  the  fact
    that the appellant had lived there for the first nine years of his life
    and had lived in the UK for the last four years.  In my  judgment,  the
    judge's words are not capable of the forensic dissection which Mr  Lane
    invites me to make.  The determination has to be read as  a  whole  and
    there is no doubt that the judge was well aware of the  fact  that  the
    appellant, having left Morocco aged 9, had not been there for ten years
    given that he was now aged 19 having subsequently spent five  years  in
    Spain and four years in the UK.  The appellant's immigration and travel
    history is referred to on a number of occasions  in  the  determination
    (see for example para 14(d)-(f)).

33. Given the judge's findings, which  were  themselves  findings  properly
    open to him, his finding that it had not been  established  that  there
    were "very significant obstacles" to the appellant's  integration  into
    Morocco was also one  properly  open  to  him  and  not  irrational  or
    perverse.

34. Consequently, I reject ground 3.

    Ground 4

35. Mr Lane submitted that the judge had wrongly stated that the  appellant
    had given his evidence through an interpreter.  It was  wholly  unclear
    why he had said this as that was not the case.  That error affected the
    judge's finding in para 98 applying s.117B(2) of the NIA Act  2002  and
    showed a  failure  to  consider  the  appellant's  claim  with  anxious
    scrutiny and  cast  doubts  upon  the  sustainability  of  the  judge's
    decision as a whole.

36. Having consulted the Tribunal's file, there is nothing to suggest  that
    an interpreter was present at the hearing.  None appears to  have  been
    requested by the Tribunal.  Mr Richards raised the  possibility,  based
    upon an informal  recollection  of  the  Presenting  Officer,  that  an
    interpreter may have been present.  Given  the  content  of  the  court
    file, I am not satisfied that was the case.

37. It is, consequently, most unfortunate that the judge  in  para  13  and
    again in para 98 stated that an interpreter was  present  and  assisted
    the appellant to give his evidence.  There is no explanation  for  this
    mistake.  However, in my judgment, that error does  not  undermine  the
    sustainability of the judge's determination.

38. First, in relation to s.117B(2) at para 98 the judge said this:

         "98. As to section 117B (2), the appellant is able to speak English
             to an extent.  In the  course  of  the  oral  hearing  of  his
             appeal, he gave his evidence in part in English and part of it
             through an interpreter.  Accordingly, I bear in mind  that  he
             is not fluent in English, but has some capability of  speaking
             English."

39. It is far from clear that the judge took into account adversely to  the
    appellant that he could not speak English applying s.117B(2).  In fact,
    he noted that the appellant had "some capability of speaking  English".
    I was told that the appellant is in fact fluent  in  English.   Reading
    para 98 as a whole, it looks very much like the appellant was given the
    benefit of s.117B(2) on the basis that he was able to speak English  to
    an extent or had some capability in it.  In any event, even if contrary
    to what I consider the judge actually did in para 98, he  did  take  it
    into account adversely, it was not in my judgment of such  significance
    that it undermines the judge's  overall  reasoning  and  conclusion  in
    respect of proportionality.

40. Secondly, I do  not  accept  Mr  Lane's  submission  that  the  judge's
    inexplicable mistake that  an  interpreter  was  used  at  the  hearing
    demonstrates  a  lack  of  "anxious  scrutiny"  by  the  judge  to  the
    appellant's evidence or to the case as a whole.  As  I  understand  the
    substance of this submission, it is both that it  calls  into  question
    the judge's focus upon the material and also  demonstrates  a  lack  of
    fairness.  However, Mr Lane did not point out or rely upon any mistakes
    in the judge's determination which could be said to stem from a lack of
    focus or careless consideration of the evidence.  The determination  is
    a careful and detailed one running to 109 paras over  seventeen  pages.
    It  faithfully  sets  out  the  evidence,  the  appellant's  case   and
    submissions and reaches findings based upon the evidence as a whole  as
    I have already concluded under Ground 1.  I see no basis to uphold  the
    submission that the judge failed to  give  "anxious  scrutiny"  to  the
    appellant's case or that there was any manifest unfairness in  reaching
    his decision to dismiss the appeal.

41. For these reasons, I reject ground 4.

    Ground 5

42. Mr Lane submitted that  the  judge  had  failed  to  look  at  all  the
    appellant's circumstances under Art 8.  He relied upon  the  points  he
    had made in relation to grounds 1 and 3.  I  need  say  no  more  about
    those points as, for the reason I have already  given,  the  judge  did
    fully take into account the appellant's circumstances both  in  Morocco
    and in the UK.

43. As an additional point, Mr Lane submitted that the judge had failed  to
    give proper weight to the strength of the appellant's relationships  in
    the UK, in particular the exceptionally  close  relationship  with  his
    foster parents.  He relied upon a number  of  documents  including  the
    appellant's witness statement, letters of support  and  the  Child  and
    Care documentation (at pages 40-41, 62-65 and 76-92 respectively in the
    bundle).  Mr Lane  submitted  that  none  of  this  evidence  had  been
    considered by the judge.  Mr Lane submitted that the  judge  was  wrong
    simply to address the issue that the  appellant's  private  life  could
    continue using 'modern means of communication'.

44. The  judge's  consideration  of  Art  8  is  at  paras  79-108  of  his
    determination.  Having correctly identified the five stage approach set
    out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 at para 80 of his determination, the judge
    went on to find that the appellant's relationship although "close" with
    his foster carers did not amount to family life.  That finding  is  not
    challenged.  Nevertheless, at paras 85  onwards,  the  judge  concluded
    that the appellant's relationship with his foster carers was a  feature
    of his "private life" together with his  "social  and  religious  links
    with a mosque in Torquay, and that he has been  attending  college  and
    has secured part-time employment" (at para 85).  At  paras  86-87,  the
    judge found that the appellant's removal to Morocco  would,  given  the
    effect upon his private life, engage Art 8.1.

45. Then at paras 88-108 the judge considered the issue of  proportionality
    as follows:

         "88. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the appellant's  relationship
             with Mr and Mrs [C] (and indeed with friends he  has  made  in
             the UK) can be maintained, albeit in a different form,  should
             he return to Morocco by use of modern means  of  communication
             such as telephone, Skype and similar methods of communication.
              It will also, of course, be open to Mr and Mrs [C]  to  visit
             the appellant in Morocco should they wish to do so.

         89.  The appellant is able to speak Arabic and thus will be able to
             utilise that ability in Morocco.  He will similarly be able to
             practice his religion in Morocco should he wish to do  so  and
             will have the opportunity  to  build  new  relationships  with
             friends there.

         90.    The   appellant   has   demonstrated    his    intelligence,
             resourcefulness, capability and adaptability having at a young
             age,  independently  travelled  from  Morocco  to  Spain   and
             subsequently from Spain to UK.  He remained in Spain for  some
             five years and demonstrated resourcefulness and ability whilst
             living there in taking the necessary steps to ensure that  his
             essential needs were met.

         91.  He subsequently showed the initiative and  resourcefulness  to
             be able to travel independently to the UK  and,  having  lived
             here for some 4 years, has demonstrated his ability  to  adapt
             to a different culture and  environment.   He  has  undertaken
             education in the UK, has obtained part-time employment and has
             made friendships.

         92.  He will be able to apply the benefit of the education  he  has
             had in the UK and the skills he has learned from  his  job  to
             his  life  in  Morocco  and,  in  my  judgement,   given   the
             intelligence, resourcefulness, capability and adaptability  he
             has demonstrated, there is no reason why he  cannot  transfer,
             utilise  and  enhance  those  skills  in  Morocco  to   secure
             employment there and, should he  wish,  to  fund  his  further
             education that.

         93.  The appellant confirmed that he has not made any enquiries  to
             determine what assistance is  available  to  him  in  Morocco,
             though Mr [C] confirmed that were the appellant to be  removed
             to Morocco, Mr [C] would assist him in looking into that.

         94.  It is not possible to determine what family the appellant  has
             in Morocco as the appellant has given inconsistent accounts as
             to the location of, and his relationship with members of,  his
             family  and,  in  particular,  his  father,  though  there  is
             certainly a significant possibility that he does  have  family
             in Morocco who can prove him with assistance if required.

         95.  However, I accept Mrs Quan's submission that the appellant  is
             now an adult and given the capabilities he  has  demonstrated,
             in having adapted to life in Spain and the UK,  that  he  will
             similarly be able to  adapt  to  life  in  Morocco.   He  will
             certainly be in no worse position,  and  in  my  judgement  is
             likely to be in a significantly better  position,  than  other
             residents of Morocco given the training and education  he  has
             received in the UK which he can utilise in Morocco  to  secure
             his future there.

         96.  I also take into account section 117 A - D of the 2002 Act.

         97.  S 117C has no application in the circumstances of this case as
             the appellant was not sentenced to a period of imprisonment of
             four years or more.

         98.  As to section 117B (2), the appellant is able to speak English
             to an extent.  In the  course  of  the  oral  hearing  of  his
             appeal, he gave his evidence in part in English and part of it
             through an interpreter.  Accordingly, I bear in mind  that  he
             is not fluent in English, but has some capability of  speaking
             English.

         99.  The appellant is not currently financially independent, though
             he is working 24 hours per week.   Accordingly,  I  take  into
             account, given the provisions of section 117B (3), that he has
             some financial resources, but is not financially independent.

         100. The private life established by the appellant has not,  in  my
             judgement, been  established  when  he  has  been  in  the  UK
             unlawfully as it has  been  established  whilst  he  has  been
             granted discretionary leave to  remain.   Accordingly,  in  my
             judgement,  section  117B  (4)   does   not   apply   in   the
             circumstances of this case.

         101. However, in my judgement, the  appellant's  private  life  has
             been  established  when  his  immigration  status   has   been
             precarious.  He had entered the UK  unlawfully  in  May  2011.
             His application for asylum was refused on 2 July 2013.  He was
             granted limited leave to remain in the UK only  until  16  May
             2014 when he reached 17 � years of age.

         102. Accordingly, the appellant had no expectation of remaining  in
             the UK after  reaching  that  age  and  his  status  was  thus
             necessarily precarious.  I bear this in mind when  considering
             whether, per section 117A, removal of the  appellant  breaches
             his rights under article 8 ECHR.

         103. Section 117B (6) has no application in  the  circumstances  of
             this case.

         104. Taking  all  of  these  matters  into  account,  whilst  I  am
             satisfied that removal of the appellant  would  amount  to  an
             interference with his private life  Article  8  rights,  I  am
             satisfied that the respondent has justified such interference.

         105. Such interference is in accordance with the  law,  namely  the
             immigration  rules  and,  I  am   satisfied,   necessary   and
             proportionate in the interests of the economic  well-being  of
             the country through  the  maintenance  of  a  fair  system  of
             immigration control.

         106.  As  above,  the  appellant  has  the  skills,   capabilities,
             resources and adaptability to secure an independent  life  for
             himself in Morocco.  He would be able to continue to  maintain
             regular  telephone,  Skype  and  should  they  wish,  visiting
             contact with Mr and Mrs [C].  He can pursue his education  and
             his religious beliefs in Morocco should he wish to do so.   He
             can use the transferable skills he  has  developed  to  secure
             employment in Morocco.  Accordingly,  the  appellant  will  be
             capable of maintaining his private  life  if  he  returned  to
             Morocco.

         107. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the respondent has  justified
             any interference that refusal of the  appellant's  application
             would cause to his private life and that  such  refusal  is  a
             proportionate response to the legitimate  aim  of  maintaining
             immigration controls.

         108. In the circumstances, I  am  satisfied  that  refusal  of  the
             appellant's appeal  on  the  grounds  of  the  maintenance  of
             immigration control does  not  amount  to  a  disproportionate
             interference with the private or family life of the  appellant
             under Article 8."

46. There is no doubt, in my judgment, that the judge fully recognised  the
    nature of the appellant's private life in the UK both with  his  foster
    parents  and  more  widely  in  society  including  his  education  and
    employment.  The judge took into account s.117B of  the  NIA  Act  2002
    including that the appellant's private life had been established whilst
    his immigration status was precarious as required by s.117B(5)  of  the
    NIA Act 2002.  I have already concluded that the judge was entitled  to
    find that the appellant was  a  "capable,  adaptable  and  resourceful"
    individual.  The judge took  into  account  that  contact  between  the
    appellant and his foster carer could be maintained by such  methods  as
    Skype.  That is a mechanism which has, in recent years,  revolutionised
    the ability of individuals to maintain  face-to-face  contact  via  the
    internet over large distances.  As the judge had previously  noted,  Mr
    C's own evidence was that the appellant would shortly move on from them
    (see para 82).

47. In  my  judgment,  the  judge  fully  considered  all  the  appellant's
    circumstances  and,  given  that  he  could  not  succeed   under   the
    Immigration Rules, it was properly open to the judge to  conclude  that
    the public interest did outweigh  the  appellant's  circumstances  such
    that the decision to remove him  was  proportionate.   The  appellant's
    circumstances were not "compelling" such  as  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest and justify the grant of leave outside the Rules under Art 8.

48. Consequently, I also reject ground 5.

Decision

49. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal  under  Arts  3  and  8  of  the  ECHR  and  the
    Immigration Rules did not involve the making of an error of law.   That
    decision stands.

50. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


                                                                      Signed

                                                                     A Grubb
