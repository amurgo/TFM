Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R. Ahmed, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
appellants
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:

      1. The appellants appeals with permission against the decision of the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer (hereinafter referred to as the
         "FtTJ") who dismissed their appeals against the decisions made to
         refuse their applications for a family permit as dependent extended
         family members of an EEA national in a decision promulgated on 18
         February 2021.

      2. The background is set out in the decision of the FtTJ and the
         evidence in the bundle. The appellants are nationals of Pakistan.
         The 1st and 2nd appellants are married and are the parents of the
         other listed appellants. They applied on 14 November 2019 for
         residence cards as the extended family members of the 2nd
         appellants brother, a Spanish national, resident in the United
         Kingdom.

      3. The applications were refused in a decision taken on 10 January
         2020 where it was stated that the money transfer vouchers from 2
         April 2018 to 1 October 2019 did not establish financial
         dependency. It was considered that there was no evidence of the
         family circumstances to show that without the sponsor's financial
         support their essential living needs could not be met.

      4. The appellants appealed and the appeal came before the FtT on the
         15 February 2021. In a decision promulgated on 18 February 2021 the
         FtTJ dismissed their appeals, having found that the appellants had
         not demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that they were
         dependent on the sponsor.

      5. Permission to appeal was issued and on 11 December 2019 permission
         was granted by FtTJ Keane.

      6. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic the Upper Tribunal issued
         directions, inter alia, indicating that it was provisionally of the
         view that the error of law issue could be determined without a face-
         to-face hearing.

      7. Subsequently, the appeal was listed for a remote hearing via
         Microsoft teams. The Tribunal listed the hearing to enable oral
         submissions to be given by each of the parties.

      8. The hearing took place on 13 August 2021, by means of Skype for
         Business. which has been consented to and not objected to by the
         parties. A face-to-face hearing was not held because it was not
         practicable, and both parties agreed that all issues could be
         determined in a remote hearing. I was present at Court. The
         advocates attended remotely via video. There were no issues
         regarding sound, and no substantial technical problems were
         encountered during the hearing, and I am satisfied both advocates
         were able to make their respective cases by the chosen means.

      9. Mr Ahmed relied upon the grounds which he amplified in his oral
         submissions.  He submitted that the FtTJ had accepted that the
         appellant and the sponsor were related as claimed and that the FtTJ
         also accepted that the transfers of money had been regular (at
         paragraph [17]). However the FtTJ failed to give adequate reasons
         for making the adverse credibility findings he made set out at
         paragraph [17] and that this was an error of law.

     10. Mr Ahmed, in his oral submissions, invited the tribunal to consider
         the terms of the grant of permission which he adopted. He submitted
         that there had been an arguable procedural irregularity which had
         affected the outcome by the judge requiring the appellants to be
         present for cross examination before accepting that there could be
         evidence of dependency. Mr Ahmed submitted that this was an
         irrational line of reasoning and amounted to an error of law. The
         test was a balance of probabilities which was not applied by the
         FtTJ.

     11. Furthermore, he referred to paragraph 9 of the grounds where it was
         argued that the judge had found that �250 per month was not
         adequate because no evidence of comparative living standards have
         been provided. In the grounds it was submitted that the judge
         referred to comparative living standards but did not substantiate
         how that may have been achieved and that it was thus an
         unreasonable finding. Mr Ahmed also relied upon paragraph 10 that
         �250 was wholly inadequate in the UK but such a comparison of
         living costs between Pakistan and the UK would be wholly
         unreasonable. He therefore invited the tribunal to find that the
         decision of the FtTJ should be set aside.

     12. Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the respondent relied upon the written
         submissions that had been sent to the tribunal on 14 May 2021. In
         those written submissions, it was submitted that the judge had
         directed himself appropriately in law and that the assessment of
         the evidence was one that was open to him.

     13. Mr Ahmed further submitted that the strongest point was that there
         was a procedural irregularity and that consequently the FtTJ's
         assessment at [17] was irrational.

Decision on error of law:

     14. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 have
         now been revoked by The Immigration and Social Security Co-
         ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 Schedule 1(1) paragraph
         2(2) (December 31, 2020. Revocation, however, has effect subject to
         savings specified in The Citizens' Rights (Restrictions of Rights
         of Entry and Residence) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, Regulation 2
         and Schedule 1 and The Immigration and Social Security Co-
         ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 (Consequential, Saving,
         Transitional and Transitory Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations
         2020 Regulations ("The Transitional Provisions").

     15. Schedule 3 paragraph 5 of the Transitional Provisions deals with
         existing appeal rights and appeals and as this appeal was extant
         prior to commencement day, and it is not argued by either party
         that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider the
         appeal.

     16.  Prior to revocation Regulation 8 of the 2016 Regulations (so far
         as relevant) read as follows:

             Extended family member"

             8. - "(1)     In these Regulations "extended family member"
                  means a person who is not a family member of an EEA
                  national under regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who
                  satisfies a condition in paragraph  (1A),(2), (3), (4) or
                  (5).

                  (1A) ...

                  (2)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person is-
                  "

                      (a)  a relative of an EEA national; and

                      (b)  residing in a country other than the United
                      Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is
                      a member of the EEA national's household; and either-
                      "

                           (i)  is accompanying the EEA national to the
                           United Kingdom or wants to join the EEA national
                           in the United Kingdom; or

                           (ii) has joined the EEA national in the United
                           Kingdom and continues to be dependent upon the
                           EEA national, or to be a member of the EEA
                           national's household.

     17. Notwithstanding the persuasive submissions made by Mr Ahmed, I am
         not satisfied that the FtTJ's decision involved the making of an
         error on a point of law. I shall set out my reasons for reaching
         that conclusion.

     18. There is no dispute that in the light of the lack of challenge to
         the nature of the relationship between the sponsor and the
         appellants, the place of residence of the appellants and their
         desire to join the sponsor in the UK that the only issue that
         remained was that of dependency. That was properly identified by
         the FtTJ in his decision at paragraphs [4 - 5].

     19. The FtTJ thereafter conducted an assessment of the evidence before
         the tribunal in support of the claimed dependency and summarised
         the evidence between paragraphs [5 - 15] of his decision.

     20. The grounds identify that the FtTJ accepted the evidence that there
         were regular financial transfers from the EEA sponsor to the
         appellants as set out at paragraph [17]. This is correct as the
         judge found from the documentary evidence summarised at paragraph
         [13] that there had been money transfer vouchers produced from 2
         April 2018 until 4 January 2021 totalling �8715.

     21. The grounds however seek to challenge the assessment of the
         evidence and the conclusions reached upon the issue of dependency
         thereafter.

     22. It is firstly argued that the judge failed to apply the correct
         test as to dependency within the EEA Regulations and that he
         applied a "higher standard of proof" and secondly, that at
         paragraph [17] the judge suggested that cross-examination would
         have been critical for him to have accepted the evidence of
         dependency. In this context Mr Ahmed submits that the FtTJ erred in
         law in the way identified in the grant of permission and that this
         was a procedural irregularity affecting the outcome of the appeal
         by requiring the appellants and the sponsor to be cross-examined
         before accepting their evidence. The grant of permission states:
         "such was arguably an irrational proposition, it hardly being the
         responsibility of the appellant and the sponsor that they were not
         cross-examined, and the judge arguably impose an unreasonable
         condition which the judge prayed in aid before resolving the issue
         whether the money transfers comprise the sole income against the
         appellants."

     23. In my judgement it is important to consider the factual findings of
         the FtTJ as he expressed them in his decision and as set out at
         paragraph [17]. The FtTJ stated as follows: -

             "17. I accept that money transfers identified  in  [13]  above
             are regular, and that the money is sent from  Mr  Chughtai  to
             Mrs Imran as that is what the documents say. I do  not  accept
             that is their  only  income  for  the  following  interrelated
             reasons. I do not have to accept what Mrs Imran and Mr  Arshad
             say just because they say it, especially where they  have  not
             been subject to cross-examination, which is now  by  no  means
             unusual in the  new  remote  ways  of  working.  There  is  no
             documentary evidence of remittances prior to April 2018 in the
             absence of which I do not accept it has been established  that
             there were any,  and  accordingly  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             appellants were able to provide for their living needs out  of
             their own resources. It has not been established that �250 per
             month is adequate to provide for a family of 5 in Pakistan  is
             no evidence has been provided of comparative living standards,
             is plainly being wholly  inadequate  in  the  United  Kingdom.
             There is no evidence from Mr Arshad's brother  explaining  why
             it is said he doesn't contribute to the household expenses  in
             Pakistan or regarding his circumstances despite that  evidence
             been readily available. The documentary  evidence  of  grocery
             purchases not current. I do not accept Mr Arshad does not work
             since 2014 as, apart from Covid,  no  cogent  explanation  has
             been given as to why  he  has  not  worked.  The  school  fees
             receipts do not show Mr Chugtai pays them and indeed Mrs Imran
             said that she pays them out of the money received. I therefore
             place no weight  on  Mr  Ratyal's  letter  as  it  is  clearly
             factually incorrect. There is insufficient cogent evidence  of
             the family's circumstances to show that without  Mr  Chugtai's
             financial support their essential living needs  could  not  be
             met as Mr Chughtai was unable to say  whether  they  have  any
             savings, and just because they say they have no  other  income
             or savings, that does not mean that they don't."

     24. Whilst it is correct as Mr Ahmed points out that the judge
         identified that there had been money transfers made (by reference
         to paragraphs 13 and 17 taken together) the judge did not accept
         that the evidence before him demonstrated that this was their only
         income for the reasons that he went on to give at paragraph [17].
         In this context the judge plainly meant that he was not satisfied
         on the balance of probabilities that the income they received was
         necessary for their "essential living needs". The reasons he gave
         were set out at paragraph 17. He found that there was no
         documentary evidence of remittances prior to 2018 and in the
         absence of the evidence he did not accept that it had been
         established that there had been any earlier remittances and
         therefore the appellants were not able to demonstrate that their
         living needs were not met out of their own resources. The judge
         also found that it had not been established that �250 per month was
         adequate to provide for a family of 5 as no evidence had been
         provided of their comparative living standards. Similarly there was
         no evidence from Mr Arshad's brother explaining why he did not
         contribute to the household expenses in Pakistan or evidence
         regarding his circumstances despite that evidence being readily
         available. The judge found the documentary evidence of grocery
         purchases was not current and he did not accept that Mr Arshad had
         not worked since 2014 as no cogent explanation had been given as to
         why he had not worked. The judge made reference to the school fees
         evidence which was not consistent with the factual evidence and
         concluded that there was "insufficient cogent evidence of the
         family circumstances to show that without the financial support
         their essential living needs could not be met." That was an
         assessment of the evidence which was reasonably opened to the FtTJ
         to make.

     25. Insofar as the grounds argue that the FtTJ's assessment of �250 was
         not adequate as no evidence of comparative living standards had
         been provided, the onus was on the appellants to demonstrate the
         financial dependency was necessary for their essential living needs
         and in this context the judge did not accept that they had
         demonstrated this by reference to their own social and financial
         circumstances in Pakistan.

     26. I also consider that the grounds misread the FtTJ's assessment of
         the evidence at paragraph [17] where it is stated that the judge
         was referring to a comparison of the living costs between Pakistan
         and the UK and as such this was unreasonable. In fact, the judge
         was not stating that but was simply making the point that on the
         evidence as to their circumstances in Pakistan and by reference to
         their essential living needs, that evidence was lacking. Alongside
         that, the FtTJ identified other aspects of the evidence which was
         absent and which in his judgement undermined the claim of
         dependency.

     27. At paragraph [17]  the judge also identified the lack of earlier
         remittances prior to April 2018 and that there had been no evidence
         from Mr Arshad's brother explaining why he did not contribute to
         the household expenses or evidence his circumstances despite that
         being readily available and that no cogent explanation been
         provided as to why Mr Arshad was not working. The judge also
         identified in the documents that the expenses which were said to
         have been paid for had not been properly or reliably evidenced. In
         summary the judge was not satisfied that the evidence before him
         was of sufficient cogency to demonstrate that their essential
         living needs were met by the sponsor. The reasons given by the FtTJ
         were one's that were reasonably open to him and were sustainable in
         the light of the evidence before the tribunal.

     28.  I deal now with the point articulated in the grant of permission
         and which has been relied upon and adopted by Mr Ahmed in his oral
         submissions before the tribunal. The grant and those submissions
         highlight the part of the FtTJ's assessment where he stated; "I
         accept that the money transfers identified in [13] above are
         regular, and that the money is sent from Mr Chughtai to Mrs Imran
         as that is what the documents say. I do not accept that it is their
         only income for the following interrelated reasons. I do not have
         to accept what Mrs Imran and Mr Arshad say just because they say
         it, especially where they have not been subject to cross-
         examination, which is now by no means unusual in the new remote
         ways of working ...".

     29. Thus it is asserted that the judge perpetrated a procedural
         irregularity by requiring the appellants and the sponsor to be
         cross-examined before accepting the appellant's evidence as
         truthful. It is stated in the grounds and in the submissions that
         this was irrational and that it was not the responsibility of the
         appellants and the sponsor to be cross-examined and that the judge
         arguably imposed an unreasonable condition before resolving the
         issue. Whilst the grant of permission refers to the appellants and
         the sponsor not giving evidence, it is clear from the decision and
         the record of proceedings that the sponsor did give evidence and
         was cross examined by the presenting officer.

     30. I have carefully considered the submission made in this regard and
         have done so in the light of paragraph 17 when read as a whole. In
         my judgement the grounds and the grant of permission misread what
         the FtTJ was stating at that part of paragraph 17. What the judge
         had stated was that an account provided in the witness statements
         did not have to be accepted simply because it was in a witness
         statement. The judge was in essence re-stating that the weight to
         be given to the evidence was to be determined by him in accordance
         with the evidence as a whole. The judge was not requiring them to
         be cross-examined before he accepted their evidence and in any
         event it was a matter for the appellants as to what evidence they
         sought to put before the tribunal.

     31. From my reading of paragraph 17, I do not accept that the judge was
         suggesting that cross-examination was crucial before he could
         accept the evidence of dependency but that the judge was simply
         making the point the matter of the weight of the evidence was one
         for him and was to be determined in the light of that evidence. The
         judge then went on in his analysis to give reasons as to why he was
         not satisfied the evidence of dependency was made out and as the
         respondent submits the judge was entitled to consider the
         appellant's home/financial arrangements and the lack of evidence
         and explanation regarding the circumstances and alleged lack of
         contributions by others who resided at the address. I am satisfied
         as the respondent submits that the judge was entitled to have
         regard to those factors in terms of assessing the veracity of the
         evidence and the issue of dependency.

     32. As set out in the relevant jurisprudence and recently in the
         decision of Latayan v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 191, dependency is a
         question of fact. In that decision, at paragraph 23 the court cited
         the decision of SM (India) v ECO (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426 as
         follows:

             "23. Dependency entails a  situation  of  real  dependence  in
             which the family member, having regard to their financial  and
             social conditions, is not in a position to support  themselves
             and needs the material support of the  Community  national  or
             his or her spouse or registered partner in order to meet their
             essential needs: Jia v Migrationsverket Case C-1/05; [2007] QB
             545 at [37 and 42-43] and Reyes  v  Migrationsverket  Case  C-
             423/12; [2014] QB 1140 at [20-24]. As the Upper Tribunal noted
             in the unrelated case of Reyes v SSHD (EEA  Regs:  dependency)
             [2013] UKUT 00314 (IAC), dependency is a question of fact. The
             Tribunal continued (in reliance on Jia and on the decision  of
             this court in SM (India) v Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Mumbai)
             [2009] EWCA (Civ) 1426):

                  "19. ... questions of dependency must not be reduced to  a
                  bare calculation of financial  dependency  but  should  be
                  construed broadly to involve a holistic examination  of  a
                  number  of  factors,  including  financial,  physical  and
                  social conditions, so as to  establish  whether  there  is
                  dependence that is genuine. The essential focus has to  be
                  on the nature of the relationship concerned and on whether
                  it is one characterised by a situation of dependence based
                  on  an  examination  of  all  the  factual  circumstances,
                  bearing in mind the underlying  objective  of  maintaining
                  the unity of the family."

         Further, at [22]

             "... Whilst it is for an appellant to discharge the burden  of
             proof resting  on  him  to  show  dependency,  and  this  will
             normally require production of relevant documentary  evidence,
             oral evidence can suffice if not found wanting. ..."

         24. As to the approach to evidence,  guidance  was  given  by  the
             Upper Tribunal in Moneke  and  others  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria
             [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC):

                  "41. Nevertheless dependency  is  not  the  same  as  mere
                  receipt of some financial assistance from the sponsor.  As
                  the Court of Appeal  made  plain  in  SM  (India)  (above)
                  dependency means dependency in the sense used by the Court
                  of Justice in the case  of  Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811.  For
                  present  purposes  we  accept  that  the   definition   of
                  dependency is accurately captured by the current UKBA ECIs
                  which read as follows at ch.5.12:

                      "In determining if a family member or extended family
                      member is dependent (i.e. financially dependent) on
                      the relevant EEA national for the purposes of the EEA
                      Regulations:

                      Financial dependency should be interpreted as meaning
                      that the person needs financial support from the EEA
                      national or his/ her spouse/civil partner in order to
                      meet his/her essential needs - not in order to have a
                      certain level of income.

                      Provided a person would not be able to meet his/her
                      essential living needs without the financial support
                      of the EEA national, s/he should be considered
                      dependent on that national. In those circumstances,
                      it does not matter that the applicant may in addition
                      receive financial support / income from other
                      sources.

                      There is no need to determine the reasons for
                      recourse to the financial support provided by the EEA
                      national or to consider whether the applicant is able
                      to support him/herself by taking up paid employment.

                      The person does not need to be living or have lived
                      in an EEA state which the EEA national sponsor also
                      lives or has lived."

     33. In Lim, the Court of Appeal stated at [25]:

             "In my judgment, this makes it unambiguously clear that it  is
             not enough simply to show that financial support  is  in  fact
             provided by the EU citizen to the  family  member.  There  are
             numerous  references  in  these  paragraphs  which  are   only
             consistent with a notion that the family member must need this
             support from his or her relatives in order to meet his or  her
             basic needs. "

         and at [32]:

             "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the claimant
             is in fact in a position to support himself or not, and  Reyes
             now makes that clear beyond doubt,  in  my  view.  That  is  a
             simple matter of fact. If he can support himself, there is  no
             dependency, even if he is given financial material support  by
             the EU citizen. Those additional resources are  not  necessary
             to enable him to meet his basic needs. If, on the other  hand,
             he cannot support himself from his own  resources,  the  court
             will not ask why that is the case, save perhaps where there is
             an abuse of rights. The fact that he chooses not to get a  job
             and become self-supporting is irrelevant. It follows  that  on
             the facts of this case, there was no dependency. The appellant
             had  the  funds  to  support  herself.  She  was   financially
             independent and did not need the additional resources for  the
             purpose of meeting her basic needs."

     34. The question of dependency as set out above entails a situation of
         real dependence in which the family members, in this case the
         appellants, having regard to their financial and social conditions
         are not in a position to support themselves thus needing the
         material support of the sponsor in order to meet their essential
         needs. It is also plain that questions of dependency must not be
         reduced to a bare calculation of financial dependency but to be
         construed broadly to involve holistic examination of a number of
         factors and so as to establish whether there is a dependence that
         is genuine. The judge correctly identified that proof of dependency
         required the appellants to establish, on the balance of
         probabilities, that financial support from the sponsor was required
         in order to meet the appellants' essential needs. It is plain from
         the FtTJ's assessment of the evidence that there were gaps in that
         evidence which had not been either adequately explained or
         evidenced and thus the FtTJ did not accept that the appellants were
         wholly reliant upon money received from the sponsor. In other words
         and set out above if the appellants can support themselves, there
         is no dependency even if they are given financial material support
         by the EU citizen as those additional resources are not necessary
         to enable them to meet their essential basic needs. I do not
         consider that the FtTJ applied the wrong test or that he applied
         too high a standard and was entitled to critically assess the
         evidence. Thus in summary, the judge did not reject the account of
         the appellants and the sponsor on the basis that they did not give
         evidence or were not cross-examined but that on the evidence before
         him properly analysed did not satisfy him that the appellants were
         properly dependent on the sponsor notwithstanding the evidence of
         the financial remittances.

     35. For those reasons, I am not satisfied that it has been demonstrated
         that the decision of the FtTJ did involve the making of an error on
         a point of law. I therefore dismiss the appeals. The decision of
         the FtTJ shall stand.
