                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Agnew ('the Judge') promulgated on 30 March 2017 in which the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on both protection and human
        rights grounds.





Background


     2. The appellant is a national of Somalia  originally  from  Mogadishu
        who claims to be a  member  of  the  Reer  Hamar,  Ashraf  clan,  a
        minority clan in Somalia. The appellant claims he had six  brothers
        and sisters and that the family left Somalia when he  was  a  child
        and that he was brought up in Yemen where he received an education.
        The appellant claimed  the  family  was  supported  by  his  father
        working in  shops  and  that  his  mother  worked  from  home.  The
        appellant claimed that in 2014 when people were trying to oust  the
        President he was hit on the top of his head when a  bomb  exploded.
        In 2015 the Houthis started trying to force young men to  work  for
        them. The appellant's cousin refused and was killed. The  appellant
        claims that he and the males in his family dressed up as  women  in
        public to avoid being harassed and  were  afraid  to  go  out.  The
        appellant claims he was shot in the arm when  Houthis  entered  the
        mosque he was  attending  and  started  shooting.  The  appellant's
        father decided that as their neighbours were leaving and  going  to
        the border of Yemen to try and get into Saudi  Arabia  they  should
        accompany them and so they all went by lorry  to  the  border.  The
        appellant claims, however, to have lost his father and brother  and
        to have been left with his mother, younger brother, and sister, and
        to have remained at the border for about 4  �  to  5  months  after
        which the appellant claimed his mother told him to cross the border
        and that she would remain with the children and try and find  their
        father. The appellant claims his mother sold her gold necklace  and
        earrings and found an agent who took the appellant to Saudi  Arabia
        where he stayed for a month and from where he travelled to  Turkey,
        Greece, France and  eventually  to  the  United  Kingdom  where  he
        claimed asylum.
     3. Having considered the evidence with the required degree of  anxious
        scrutiny the Judge sets out findings  of  fact  from  [10]  of  the
        decision under challenge which can be summarised in  the  following
        terms:


                i. Setting aside the implausibility that the  appellant,  as
                   the oldest male of the family, would leave his mother and
                   younger siblings unprotected at the border when they  had
                   not found his father and brother in four and a half to  5
                   months, the Judge did not find plausible  the  appellants
                   claim as to how he was able to pay an agent to get him to
                   the UK [14].
               ii. The appellant claims an agent was paid to  get  him  from
                   the border at Yemen to Saudi Arabia and then from  Jeddah
                   to Turkey by aeroplane  and  then  a  further  flight  to
                   Greece as well  as  a  flight  to  the  UK  using  forged
                   documents [15].
              iii. The Judge did not believe that the family would not  have
                   needed any funds they could raise  after  they  left  the
                   home area to survive for up to 5 months.  The  Judge  did
                   not believe that the appellants  mother's  gold  earrings
                   and necklace which she  was  wearing  brought  sufficient
                   funds to pay for an agent to procure false documents  and
                   pay for the flights the appellant claimed to have  taken.
                   That  claim  was  found  to  be  wholly  implausible  and
                   seriously damaging to the credibility  of  the  appellant
                   that his family were poor and/or that he lost touch  with
                   them so that he now claims  that  he  is  unable  to  get
                   further support [16].
               iv. The Judge found inconsistencies in the appellant's  claim
                   about where he was, with whom, and when,  after  he  left
                   his home area. The Judge notes in the screening interview
                   the appellant claimed to have left Yemen about one  month
                   previously with an agent and not to know which  countries
                   he had flown from to get to the United  Kingdom  although
                   subsequently recalled he had been to Turkey  and  Greece.
                   In a substantive interview, the appellant claimed he left
                   Yemen after he was injured and that this was at  the  end
                   of 2015 and that he spent 4 � to 5 months at  the  border
                   between Yemen and Saudi Arabia before crossing  over  the
                   border  without  his  family  to  Saudi  Arabia.  In  re-
                   examination, the appellant stated it was one  months  ago
                   he had left Saudi Arabia but he had left  his  home  area
                   stayed at the border 4 to 5 months. The Judge  noted  the
                   appellant clearly stated in his  screening  interview  he
                   left Yemen one month ago which the Judge did  not  accept
                   was open to misinterpretation [17].
                v. The appellant has failed to establish that his family all
                   fled from Yemen and went to the border  of  Saudi  Arabia
                   where he lost contact with his father and other siblings,
                   that he remained with them for almost 5 months at a  time
                   his mother sold the jewellery she was wearing to  pay  an
                   agent  or  agents  so  the  appellant   was   accompanied
                   throughout his trip firstly across the  border  to  Saudi
                   Arabia, then to Jeddah airport where he was given  forged
                   documents enabling him to fly to Greece with an agent and
                   then, having been put on another plane alone, on  to  the
                   UK. The  appellant  had  not  established  to  the  lower
                   standard of proof which rests with him that he  does  not
                   have family in Mogadishu and/or elsewhere  with  whom  he
                   has retained contact and who can offer  support.  He  has
                   not established he would have no family or  clan  support
                   on return to Mogadishu. He has not  established  that  he
                   has never worked or could not obtain employment [18].
               vi. Although the appellant had lived for a time in a  shelter
                   in the United Kingdom, the Judge was not  satisfied  that
                   staying in a shelter for a short period established  that
                   the appellant is without support from  abroad  or  indeed
                   Mogadishu  should  he  require  it  long-term  whilst  he
                   readjusts to life and establishes himself in his  country
                   of nationality. The Judge found the appellant appeared to
                   be fairly knowledgeable about what he needs  to  show  in
                   terms of lack of any support from  family  abroad,  hence
                   his claim he cannot return to Mogadishu.  The  Judge  did
                   not find as credible the appellants  claim  that  despite
                   having been represented by two firms  of  solicitors  and
                   having used  the  services  of  a  charity  he  had  only
                   discovered on the day of  the  hearing  some  ten  months
                   after he claimed he lost touch  with  them  in  allegedly
                   highly insecure  and  difficult  circumstances,  that  he
                   could ask the Red Cross to help him discover  their  fate
                   [19].
              vii. Given  the  lack  of  credibility  the  Judge  found  the
                   appellant had not established that he  had  lost  contact
                   with his family or that they went to the border of  Yemen
                   and Saudi Arabia rather than return  to  Mogadishu  where
                   they and other clan members can support him [23].
             viii.  In  relation  to  language  issues,  the  appellant  was
                   provided with a Somali-Reer Hamar interpreter rather than
                   the Arabic one which was originally planned. He also  had
                   a  Somali-Reer  Hamar  interpreter   at   the   screening
                   interview.  The  Judge  found  the  appellant   has   not
                   established he will have problems in speaking to those in
                   Mogadishu necessary for him to establish a life there and
                   to work [23].
               ix. It was found the  appellant  had  relied  on  significant
                   resources to get him to the UK and that it has  not  been
                   established he cannot rely on them again whether this  be
                   from family in Mogadishu or abroad or both  in  order  to
                   have sufficient support not to be in the  very  difficult
                   circumstances those from extremely poor  backgrounds  and
                   other areas may have when returned to Somalia [26].
                x. The Judge  sets  out  the  conclusions  in  [27]  in  the
                   following terms:


                      27.  The appellant has not discharged the  burden  of
                           proof based on the low standard which rests  with
                           him to show that he has a  well-founded  fear  of
                           persecution for a Refugee Convention or  that  he
                           faces serious harm under  Article  15(C)  of  the
                           Qualification Directive if  returned  to  Somalia
                           now.  He  does  not  meet  the  requirements   of
                           Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE.  The  appellant
                           is not relying  on  Article  8  of  the  European
                           Convention on Human Rights.


     4. The appellant sought permission  to  appeal  which  is  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier Tribunal on the basis it  was  said
        to be arguable that the Judge may have materially erred in relation
        to his ability to reintegrate into a country where he did not speak
        the primary language,  had  not  lived  in  since  an  infant,  and
        apparently had no family support.
     5. The application is opposed by the Secretary of State in her Rule 24
        reply dated 14 August 2017.




Error of law


     6. On behalf of the appellant Mr Worthington challenged  the  decision
        on the basis that the Judge had found the appellant had  no  family
        to return to in Somalia. This is arguably not a correct reading  of
        the decision under challenge for in [18] the Judge finds  that  the
        appellant had not established he  would  have  no  family  or  clan
        support on return to Mogadishu, i.e. he had not proved this will be
        the case. This is therefore not an appeal  in  which  it  has  been
        found the appellant will be returned without the  type  of  support
        referred to in the country guidance case of MOJ [2014] UKUT 00442.
     7. It was submitted that if the appellant does not  have  support  the
        Judge had not undertaken the required careful assessment of all the
        appellant circumstances but, as stated above, it was not  made  out
        before the Judge that the appellant did not have support  available
        to him in Mogadishu.
     8. Mr Worthington submitted on the appellant's behalf  that  the  fact
        the appellant had an address in Huddersfield did  not  indicate  he
        was a person of independent means. Such a  submission  is  accepted
        but the main finding by the Judge is that it  did  not  established
        that the appellant will be without support either from abroad or in
        Mogadishu. This is finding reasonably open  to  the  Judge  on  the
        evidence.
     9. It was argued on the appellant's behalf that a  number  of  aspects
        were not put to the appellant such as the amount received from  the
        sale of the mother's jewellery or the finding was implausible  that
        the appellant as the oldest male of  the  family  would  leave  his
        mother  and  younger  siblings  unprotected.  It  is  important  to
        remember the reality of life in  areas  such  as  Somalia  and  the
        lawless parts of Yemen and the risk faced by women without  a  male
        protector of serious sexual and gender-based violence. The claim by
        the appellant is that his mother and siblings had lost  his  father
        and brother and now he himself, as the  one  who  would  ordinarily
        guarantee and provide protection, was to be lost or he abandon  the
        female and minor members of this  family.  The  conclusion  by  the
        Judge that this is implausible, with no evidence of any other means
        of support or protection, is within the range  of  conclusions  the
        Judge was entitled to make on the evidence.
    10. The appellant's evidence is that his mother sold her gold  necklace
        and earrings. The appellant also claimed the  family  were  from  a
        minority clan who escaped the civil war. The  evidence  in  earlier
        country guidance cases considering these aspects clearly shows that
        minority clans fled Somalia as  the  militia  of  the  major  clans
        targeted them for persecution and subjected them to  attacks  where
        most if not all  they  had  of  value  was  taken  from  them.  The
        appellant's claim that his mother appeared to  have  retained  gold
        jewellery, unless that was purchased whilst the family  settled  in
        Yemen indicating they had access  to  funds  not  only  to  support
        themselves but also to buy such items, has to be considered against
        the background evidence.
    11. If the appellant's mother had the jewellery referred  to,  and  the
        Judge does not find she did not, the issue relating to plausibility
        arises when comparing the appellants evidence in relation  to  what
        was sold by his mother to the costs of employing an  agent,  paying
        for the procurement of  forged  documents,  and  the  cost  of  the
        appellant's journey to the United Kingdom which  includes  possibly
        three flights with the associated costs. This is a  finding  within
        the range of  those  reasonably  available  to  the  Judge  on  the
        evidence.
    12.  An  additional  point,  not  originally  pleaded  but  allowed  in
        following Mr McVeety confirming he was not prejudiced, related to a
        challenge to the finding by the Judge that the appellant had  given
        inconsistent evidence regarding where he was and whom he  was  with
        after he left his home area. Mr Worthington  referred  to  a  reply
        given in the asylum interview  at  question  136  which  he  stated
        answered  the  question  raised  by  the  Judge.  Even  giving  the
        appellant the benefit of the doubt in relation to this point it has
        not been shown to be a determinative issue  but  rather  one  of  a
        number of points taken by the Judge.
    13. In relation to language, it was argued the Judge failed  to  factor
        into  the  consideration  of   all   relevant   circumstances   the
        difficulties  the  appellant  would  have   in   communicating   in
        Mogadishu. This  is  clearly  an  assertion  that  the  appellant's
        language skills would prevent  him  from  being  able  to  properly
        integrate or find assistance. I do not find this is a  matter  that
        the Judge failed to factor in as the Judge clearly  considered  the
        language issue and  makes  specific  reference  of  to  it  in  the
        decision under challenge. The appellant speaks Somali with  a  Reer
        Hamar dialect, commonly referred to as Coastal Somali, and  Arabic.
        Although there were problems with a  Somali  interpreter  appointed
        for the substantive hearing who claimed he could not understand the
        appellants dialect, the appellant fails to establish that a  person
        only speaking this dialect will be unable to survive  in  Mogadishu
        or to re-establish himself.
    14. The Reer Hamar form part of the Benadiri  clan,  a  minor  clan  in
        Somalia, but not one whom in relation to the  country  guidance  in
        MOJ states should be treated in any specific way. Whether a  person
        from this ethnic group can survive in Mogadishu or other  parts  of
        Somalia is a fact sensitive issue.
    15. It is also important to recall that the  appellant  speaks  Arabic.
        Over  two  million  people  in  Somalia  speak  Arabic  and  indeed
        Mogadishu is a city founded by Arab settlers. The  appellant  fails
        to make out that he will not be able to adequately communicate with
        those he would need to in Somalia by either of  his  two  languages
        such as to prevent  him  properly  and  adequately  re-establishing
        himself. The finding to this effect at [23] of the  decision  under
        challenge is arguably within the range of findings  the  Judge  was
        able to make on the evidence, especially  as  the  finding  by  the
        Judge the appellant had not established he did not have  family  or
        clan members he could turn to would mean those he  would  primarily
        communicate with will be those who spoke his languages.
    16. I find the Judge clearly examined the evidence  with  the  required
        degree of anxious scrutiny  and  has  given  adequate  reasons  for
        findings made. As such the weight to be given to the evidence was a
        matter for the Judge.
    17. The core finding is that the appellant is  a  person  who  had  not
        proved that he had lost contact  with  family  or  would  not  have
        family or other clan members to support him on return. It was found
        the appellant has language abilities to enable him to  establish  a
        life and to obtain work. These are all findings reasonably open  to
        the Judge on the evidence. The Judge noted the  considerable  costs
        that have been incurred in getting  the  appellant  to  the  United
        Kingdom and did not find it made out that the appellant  could  not
        rely upon family either at home or abroad.
    18. The appellant fails to make out  the  Judge  did  not  properly  or
        adequately consider the matters as required by the country guidance
        case law or country information. The appellant fails  to  make  out
        that the conclusions arrived  at  resulting  in  the  appeal  being
        dismissed were not reasonably open to the Judge on the evidence  or
        are findings infected by arguable legal error.
    19. My finding is that the appellant has failed to discharge the burden
        of proof upon  him  to  the  required  standard  to  establish  any
        arguable legal error in the decision of the Judge material  to  the
        decision to dismiss the appeal.


Decision

    20. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    21. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
