Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Makol
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's refusal of his application made on 4  December
    2017 for leave to remain on the basis of his family life with his  wife
    and partner, Asha Lad.

2.   The respondent refused the appellant's application on 6 April  2018  on
    the basis that the appellant did not qualify for leave to remain  under
    the partner route, due to findings with respect  to  suitability  under
    Section S-LTR of the Immigration Rules.

3.   The respondent stated that ETS, the educational testing  service,  were
    able to detect when a single person, a proxy, was undertaking a  number
    of tests for different candidates.  ETS maintained that that applied to
    the circumstances of the appellant and therefore the scores  which  the
    appellant  appeared  to  have  achieved  as  a  consequence  of   tests
    undertaken at Universal Training Centre on 17 July 2013 were cancelled.
      The  respondent  was  satisfied  that  the  relevant  language   test
    certificate had been  fraudulently  obtained.  As  a  consequence,  the
    respondent further decided that the presence of the appellant  in  this
    country was not conducive to the public good.

4.   The appellant was also refused on suitability grounds  because  he  had
    failed to pay litigation costs which had been awarded  against  him  in
    favour of the Home Office.  It was also not found  that  the  appellant
    satisfied the immigration status or financial requirements.

5.   In relation to private life, the application fell to  be  refused  with
    reference to suitability for the same reasons.  The respondent  was  of
    the view that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) was not satisfied as there  would
    not be very significant  obstacles  facing  the  appellant  as  to  his
    integration on return to India.

6.   At the hearing before the judge the appellant gave evidence as did  his
    wife Asha Lad.  They were not legally represented at the hearing before
    the judge. The appellant confirmed his reliance upon all  documentation
    submitted by him or on his behalf.  The documents included a  statement
    by him.

7.   In his statement he set out details of his experience  in  the  English
    language and said he would have no reason to have engaged a proxy.  The
    judge recorded that in cross-examination the appellant could not recall
    the details of where he had taken his TOEIC test, but had said  it  had
    been in London and had been in 2013.  He had then been living in  Abbey
    Wood. He had chosen the particular college, Universal Training  Centre,
    because his own college had recommended it.  Other venues had also been
    fully booked. It had taken him an hour in London traffic to  reach  the
    centre.  There had been many students  present.   He  had  reported  to
    reception and had been  required  to  give  his  personal  details  and
    present his passport.

8.   He said that he had taken the  tests  over  two  days;  the  first  had
    related to speaking and writing.  After a gap of  few  days  there  was
    then the listening and reading tests.  The speaking test  lasted  about
    twenty minutes and ten to twelve people had been present.  He had  been
    notified of the results through his college.   He  realised  there  had
    been issues arising from the results when a letter had been sent by the
    Home Office to his college.

9.   The appellant said he met his wife in  2017  and  they  married  on  21
    October 2017.  When the relationship  had  deepened  he  had  told  her
    everything concerning his immigration status.  Due to her affection for
    him, his immigration situation had made no difference.

10.  The appellant confirmed  that  he  has  a  family  in  India  who  have
    supported him and his wife.  He has two sisters and a mother in  India.
    He has no brothers and his father is deceased.  His wife has no  family
    in India, as they are all in the UK.

11.  He confirmed that his wife is employed and earns approximately  �21,000
    a year.

12.  He said that he could not return to make an  application  in  India  to
    return to the UK as he had been in the UK for a long time and his  wife
    would not be able to accompany  him  because  of  her  family  in  this
    country.

13.  His wife gave evidence that it had been a difficult  time  because  her
    sister, had committed suicide on 4 March 2016.  She confirmed that  she
    and the appellant were married on 21 October 2017.  Due to the death of
    her sister and the needs of her family members  she  was  not  employed
    between March and August 2017.   She subsequently  recommenced  regular
    employment.   She would not find it possible to live in  India  if  the
    appellant had to return.  She is  concerned  at  country  circumstances
    there and stated that in particular her mother was dependent  upon  her
    on a daily basis.   She and the appellant  have  lived  together  since
    their  marriage  in  October  2017.  Her   annual   based   income   is
    approximately �20,000.

14.  The judge's findings and reasons are set out at paragraphs 51 to 71.

15.  Permission was granted to the appellant to appeal the judge's  decision
    by DUTJ Pickup.  He held that in the main the grounds as  drafted  were
    little more than a disagreement with the decision and an attempt to re-
    argue the appeal.  However, he  granted  permission  on  the  following
    basis:

         "It is arguable that the judge misapplied the burden  and  standard
         of proof in an ETS case following the  decision  of  the  Court  of
         Appeal in Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167.  Whilst  at  [55]  the  judge
         correctly placed the burden on the Secretary of State, the  way  in
         which the shift of the evidential burden  to  the  appellant  takes
         place on establishment of a prima facie case so as to  require  the
         appellant to provide an innocent explanation is  not  set  out  and
         does not make clear that the  judge  understood  the  legal  burden
         remains throughout on the Secretary of State.  The way in which the
         conclusion is expressed at [64] is also  suspect,  suggesting  that
         the appellant had not discharged the burden to show that he had not
         been involved in cheating.  It may be that on  the  facts  of  this
         case the outcome would have been  the  same  but  it  is  at  least
         arguable that if the judge misapplied the burden  and  standard  of
         proof that error was material".


16.  I find that  it  was  paragraph  52  (not  54)  where  the  judge  made
    reference to the burden  of  proof.   The  judge  held  as  follows  at
    paragraph 52:

         "In this appeal the  burden  of  proof  generally  rests  with  the
         Appellant and the standard of proof to be applied is  that  of  the
         balance of probabilities.  However, in allegations, as here,  where
         the Respondent asserts that  dishonest  behaviour  applies  by  the
         allowing  or  instructing  of  a  proxy  to  sit  English  language
         examinations,  the  burden  rests  with  the  Respondent  in   that
         allegation.  With respect generally to cases  involving  ETS  proxy
         appointment allegations, if the Respondent successfully establishes
         a prima facie case against an individual the burden then shifts  to
         that  person  to  demonstrate  that  dishonest  behaviour  was  not
         involved on his or her part".


17.  The judge at  paragraph  54  took  account  of  a  statement  dated  11
    September 2018 by Peter Lawson, Home Office  employee  since  2002.  At
    paragraph 55, the judge said that Mr Lawson presented at Annexes A  and
    B evidence provided by ETS in relation to the detail of the scoring  in
    the name of the appellant from tests undertaken on 17 July 2013.   Both
    results were recorded as invalid.  The three categories designated  are
    "invalid", "questionable" or "released".

18.  The judge noted at paragraph 56 that at Annex B the statistics for  the
    56 tests taken at Universal  Training  Centre  on  17  July  2013  were
    detailed.  No results were released, 13 out  of  56  tests  taken  were
    questionable and 43 out of 56 tests were invalid.  Accordingly ETS  was
    satisfied that there were no results which could be published which did
    not have some doubt.   Questionable results were 23% of the total  that
    day.  However, the much larger total,  77%  were  classed  as  invalid,
    being 43 tests.

19.  The judge held that taking  the  statements  of  Rebecca  Collings  and
    Peter Millington with the  specific  detail  provided  in  relation  to
    Universal Training Centre for the day concerned, he was satisfied  that
    sufficient evidence established that there was a  prima  facie  against
    the appellant.  In that respect he followed the guidance set out by the
    Upper Tribunal in SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC).

20.  At paragraph 60 the judge held that caselaw guidance makes  clear  that
    every case is fact sensitive.  He found that the burden rests with  the
    appellant to show that he did not cheat in the examination  process  on
    the date concerned.  Both the judgment in Shehzad and Chowdhury  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 615 and the Upper Tribunal decision  in  MA  [2016]  UKUT  450
    (IAC) emphasised that it is important to make a finding as to whether a
    prima facie Home Office case has been established.

21.  The judge also had regard to  the  views  expressed  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Ahsan and Others [2017] EWCA Civ 2009, where it was stated at
    paragraph 22 that "The Home Office case now  is  that  certain  centres
    were 'fraud factories' and that all test results  from  those  centres,
    generally or on certain dates are bogus".

22.  The judge said it was necessary to consider and find whether  deception
    did  occur  in  the  circumstances  of  this  appeal  on  the  evidence
    presented, including the oral evidence given by the appellant  and  his
    partner.  The judge took into account the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    wife was not in a relationship with the appellant at the  date  of  the
    test concerned and therefore she would have no direct evidence in  that
    respect.  The appellant indicated that the test had been  a  long  time
    ago (it was in 2013) and his own recollection on that basis.

23.  Based on the evidence which he heard from the appellant, the judge  was
    not persuaded that he had discharged his burden in  demonstrating  that
    his tests were taken personally.  The judge said the appellant had  not
    brought forward what he would consider to be evidence  of  strength  in
    denying that a  proxy  was  deployed  to  take  any  test  on  the  day
    concerned.  The appellant maintained that he had good English and still
    has good English skills and therefore would not  have  needed  to  have
    appointed a proxy.  However it has been acknowledged that  it  was  not
    only those with less than adequate English language skills who followed
    the option of appointing a proxy.  The judge said it was also  relevant
    to take into account that certain test centres  were  clearly  offering
    arrangements to encourage those who had registered for  tests  at  that
    location to pay sums in order for a proxy to take the test which  would
    be, in effect, a route to a guaranteed pass on each  test.   The  judge
    held that a person claiming that he or she had good English at the time
    of the test did not rule out that they paid a proxy.

24.  The judge's assessment of the evidence was that the appellant  had  not
    discharged his burden to show  that  he  did  not  cheat  in  the  test
    concerned.  The judge held that the evidence showing the complicity  of
    Universal Training Centre  was  very  significant  and  powerful.   The
    appellant would therefore need to show, based on the statistics annexed
    to the statement of  Peter  Lawson,  adequate  evidence  which  on  the
    balance of probabilities showed  that  he  had  not  been  involved  in
    cheating.  On the evidence the judge  held  that  the  burden  was  not
    discharged by the appellant.

25.  The judge therefore found that the appellant was correctly  refused  on
    human rights grounds with reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    judge held that this was in itself a weighty finding in  assessing  the
    overall merits of his human rights appeal.

26.  In failing to meet  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  judge  said  it  was
    appropriate to consider whether the appellant has  established  on  the
    evidence presented that  there  was  a  basis  on  which  it  would  be
    appropriate that he should be granted the immigration leave he seeks on
    an assessment of Article 8 human rights grounds outwith the Immigration
    Rules.  That required the consideration of  provisions  within  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act.  The judge agreed with the HOPO's  argument  that
    in the development of the relationship between the  appellant  and  his
    wife, the circumstances of the  appellant  were  precarious.   It  also
    applied particularly to the consideration of the private  life  he  had
    established in this country.  His wife has a  reasonable  income  which
    the HOPO submitted would satisfy  the  financial  requirements  if  the
    appellant made an application for entry clearance from overseas.

27.  The judge said he had taken into  account  the  personal  circumstances
    within the family of the appellant's wife.  She and her family had  his
    sympathy in that respect but in assessing proportionality, all  factors
    favouring both parties must be taken  into  account.  In  view  of  the
    failure by the appellant to establish his innocence in the  ETS  tests,
    the public interest must prevail, that is to say, the maintenance of an
    effective system of immigration control.

28.  For these reasons the judge found that the appellant could not  succeed
    in his application with reference to the Immigration Rules.   He  found
    that the appellant would not face obstacles on returning to India  with
    reference to sub-paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration  Rules  due
    to his background.  On return he would be in  a  position  to  make  an
    application to join his wife in  the  UK.  The  judge  found  that  the
    respondent's decision was not disproportionate.

29.  The decision by Judge Pickup to grant permission was only  in  relation
    to whether the judge properly applied the burden and standard of proof.

30.  Mr Makol submitted that in the light of SM and Qadir the  Secretary  of
    State discharges the burden of proof  and  which  then  shifts  to  the
    appellant to satisfy on a minimum  level  of  plausibility  whether  he
    cheated and then the burden shifts back to the Secretary of State.   He
    relied on page 6 of the skeleton argument which had been submitted  for
    today's hearing; he relied on Shen (Paper Appeals: Proving  Dishonesty)
    [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC) which held (a) that first were the  Secretary  of
    State alleges that an applicant has practised dishonesty  or  deception
    in an application for leave to remain, there is an evidential burden on
    the Secretary of State; (b)  the  spotlight  thereby  switches  to  the
    applicant if he discharges the burden, again, an evidential  one  -  of
    raising an innocent explanation namely an account which  satisfies  the
    minimum level of plausibility, a further  transfer  of  the  burden  of
    proof occurs; (c) where (b) is  satisfied,  the  burden  rests  on  the
    Secretary of State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities  that
    the appellant's prima facie  innocent explanation is to be rejected.

31.  Mr Makol submitted that in his evidence recorded at  paragraphs  22  to
    25 of  the  judge's  decision,  the  appellant  properly  answered  the
    questions that were  put  to  him.   The  appellant  confirmed  in  his
    statement what he said on the day in cross- examination.

32.  Mr Makol submitted that at paragraph 52 the judge set the burden  wrong
    and because of this, the judge's conclusions at  paragraph  54  and  55
    were legally wrong.  Mr Makol submitted that the  error  is  legal  and
    material.

33.  Mr Whitwell submitted that at paragraph 52 the judge set  out  the  law
    as to evidential and legal burden of proof  impeccably.   He  said  the
    question was whether the judge erred in looking at whether or  not  the
    appellant provided an innocent explanation.

34.  Mr Whitwell submitted that at paragraph 22 the judge recorded that  the
    appellant could not recall the detail location of where his TOEIC  test
    was taken.  The appellant said he had booked the  test  centre  through
    the college.  Mr Whitwell  submitted  that  the  judge  looked  at  the
    evidence in the round and came to a conclusion. Even if the judge erred
    in the  characterisation  of  the  standard  of  proof,  that  was  not
    material.

35.  Mr Makol replied saying that the appellant's test result  was  held  to
    be invalid.  There was however no fraud report or  certificate  to  say
    that the test had  been  taken  by  a  proxy.  He  said  if  the  legal
    foundation is not correct then the determination cannot stand.

36.  Having considered the submissions and the evidence that was before  the
    judge, I find that the judge did not err in law.

37.  I accept Mr Whitwell's submission that at paragraph 52  the  judge  set
    out the law as to the evidential and legal burden of proof impeccably.

38.  I find that at paragraph 57 following  consideration  of  the  evidence
    submitted on behalf of the respondent and following  the  guidance  set
    out by the Upper Tribunal in SM  and  Qadir  that  the  respondent  had
    submitted sufficient evidence to establish that there was a prima facie
    case against the appellant.

39.  I find that at paragraphs 60, 63 and 64, the judge correctly held  that
    the burden rests with the appellant to show that he did  not  cheat  in
    the examination process on the date concerned.  I accept that the judge
    did not in terms say that the burden on the appellant was an evidential
    burden and that he had to provide an innocent explanation.  I find that
    this omission was immaterial to the judge's decision.

40.  At paragraph 64 the judge held as follows:

         "My assessment of the evidence here is that the Appellant  has  not
         discharged his burden to show that he did not  cheat  in  the  test
         concerned.   The  evidence  showing  the  complicity  of  Universal
         Training Centre is very significant and  powerful.   The  Appellant
         would therefore need to show, based on the  statistics  annexed  to
         the statement of Peter Lawson,  adequate  evidence  which,  on  the
         balance of probabilities, showed that he had not been  involved  in
         cheating.  On the evidence before me that burden is not discharged.
         I also take into account in making my findings the Court of  Appeal
         judgment in Majumber and Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167, but here  find
         that the evidence concerning the overall outcomes of the  tests  on
         the date in question at the particular institution  outweigh  other
         factors".


41.  I accept that the judge was wrong to expect the appellant  to  show  on
    the balance of probabilities that he had not been involved in cheating.
    I accept that this was  a  high  burden  than  the  low  minimum  level
    required.  However, looking at the evidence that was before the  judge,
    I find that the error made by the judge was not material. The appellant
    could not remember the location of the test centre.   His  test  result
    was held by ETS to be  invalid.   The  judge  held  that  the  evidence
    showing  the  complicity  of  Universal  Training   Centre   was   very
    significant and powerful.  In the light of the  findings  made  by  the
    judge, I find that the questions the appellant  properly  answered  did
    not amount to an innocent explanation.

42. I find that the judge's  decision  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
