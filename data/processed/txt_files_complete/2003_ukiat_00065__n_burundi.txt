                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                     and





                                                                  Respondent




                         DETERMINATION  AND REASONS


  1. The Respondent is a citizen of Burundi.  The  Appellant  appeals,  with
     leave, against  the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Ms  P  Monro,
     allowing the Respondent's appeal under Article 3 against  the  decision
     of the Appellant on 31 October 2001 to  issue  removal  directions  and
     refuse  asylum.  Mr  L  Parker,  a  Home  Office  Presenting   Officer,
     represented the Appellant. Mr F Khan represented the Respondent.

  2. The Respondent is a Hutu. His father was a businessman  with  a  lorry,
     who travelled across  the  provinces.  They  lived  in  Bujumbura,  the
     capital, until anti-Hutu rioting in 1995, caused them to flee  Gisagara
     in Gitega Province, where he decided to  join  the  local  agricultural
     college. There was  rioting  in  Gitega  City  in  July  1996  and  the
     Appellant decided to leave the area. By that time he had  no  remaining
     family.  He withdrew his father's money and went to work as a  labourer
     in Buyenzi, where he remained until 1999.  He then heard that the  area
     was likely to be targeted by the government and decided  to  leave  the
     country.  He arrived in the UK illegally on 11 October 2000 and claimed
     asylum next day.

  3. The Appellant rejected his claim arguing that  he  was  not  even  from
     Burundi.  The Adjudicator, who heard the claim  in  the  absence  of  a
     Presenting Officer, concluded that the Respondent  was  a  national  of
     Burundi, but rejected his asylum appeal. However she allowed his appeal
     under Article 3. Her conclusions are set out in paragraphs 40 and 41 of
     the determination in the following terms
           40. I find that there is not a reasonable  likelihood  that  the
           [Respondent] will be persecuted for a Convention  reason  if  he
           were returned.  The civil war appears to  have  ended,  although
           violence continues.  There is no evidence to suggest  that  this
           Appellant would have reason to fear of persecution although  the
           situation in Burundi remains fragile.
           41. I now consider the claim that a return  would  infringe  the
           [Respondent's] Article 3 rights.  The humanitarian situation  is
           described in the CIPU report.  There are outbreaks of infectious
           diseases.  There is systematic looting of crops and  destruction
           of property carried out by armed political groups and government
           troops.  There is a shortage of food, basic social services  and
           economic opportunities.  Looking at  the  situation  overall,  I
           find that Article 3 would be breached on a return.

  4. The grounds of appeal challenge this decision on Article 3. There is no
     cross-appeal by the Respondent.

  5. Mr Parker argued in essence that Adjudicator erred in  concluding  that
     the humanitarian situation in Burundi awaiting  returnees  crossed  the
     severity threshold required under Article 3.  The  poor  conditions  in
     Burundi, described by the Adjudicator reflected the consequences of the
     long civil war and represented the quality of life of the population in
     general in Burundi, rather  than  any  specific  treatment  facing  the
     Respondent personally. He referred to two Tribunal  decisions  -  Amjal
     Khan [2002] UKIAT 01223 relating to Afghanistan and Ngandu  01/TH/01994
     relating to the Democratic Republic  of  Congo  -  to  demonstrate  the
     appropriate considerations involved. Mr Khan  disagreed  and  submitted
     that the Adjudicator was entitled to  conclude  that  the  humanitarian
     situation did cross the Article  3  threshold.  Neither  representative
     took any real issue with the Adjudicator's  summary  of  the  objective
     evidence, contained in paragraphs 39(a)-(j), save that Mr Parker argued
     that the Adjudicator did not give proper weight to the fact that  there
     had been a substantial  number  of  returns  from  Tanzania,  the  main
     country of refuge, since early 2002 and most of these  had  been  under
     the auspices of UNHCR, who would not have sponsored returning  refugees
     to face inhuman or degrading treatment. Apart from this main issue,  Mr
     Khan raised a related point concerning the scope of  the  Adjudicator's
     Article 3 finding, that we shall come to in due course.

  6. However first, we should take note of the applicable principles of law.
     Article 3 imposes an absolute bar on torture, or inhuman  or  degrading
     treatment or punishment.  It permits no  exceptions  and  there  is  no
     derogation. The standard of proof is that of real  risk.  However  ill-
     treatment must attain a minimum level of  severity  in  order  to  fall
     within Article 3, as held by the ECHR in Ireland v  UK.  In  SK  [2002]
     UKIAT 05613*, Collins J., when assessing whether returnees  to  Croatia
     after the civil war there would face humanitarian conditions in  breach
     of Article 3, held as follows;
           "We accept that an individual's circumstances can  be  relevant.
           Thus, for example, a person who  has  learning  difficulties  or
           some physical disability may suffer  disproportionately  because
           of his or her condition.  Nonetheless there must be a threshold,
           which is of  general  application.   Croatia  has  suffered  the
           ravages of a fierce and bitter civil war.  Thus  the  mere  fact
           that there will be a return  to  hardship  resulting  from  that
           cannot produce a breach of human rights.  The general  situation
           must be taken into account, as must what is  generally  accepted
           in the society in question."

  7. The Court of Appeal has refused leave to appeal against the decision in
     SK. With regard to the last sentence quoted above, this  reflects  what
     Collins J had earlier held in  Fazilat  [2002]  UKIAT  00973,  also  in
     relation to Article 3;
           "15. As the Court in Strasbourg has recognised, it  is  not  for
           signatures to the Convention to  impose  the  standards  of  the
           Convention on all of the world.  Recognition has to be handed to
           the situation in individual countries and to the standards  that
           are accepted, and expected in those  countries.   Of  course  in
           relation to Article 3 there is a line below which the  treatment
           cannot sink, if we may put it that way...... but, as  again  the
           Court in Strasbourg has indicated, the threshold  has  to  be  a
           high one."

  8. In essence, the assessment of Collins J. in SK,  is  reflected  in  the
     decisions in Ngandu, which relates to the conditions in the  Democratic
     Republic of Congo arising from the conflict there, and  also  in  Amjal
     Khan, which relates to the post-war situation in Afghanistan.

  9. It is from this basis of law and that we now turn to the issues  raised
     in the appeal before us

 10. As we indicated earlier, Mr Khan raised an issue relating to the  scope
     of paragraph 41 of the determination. He suggested that the  basis  for
     allowing the Article 3  claim  was  not  limited  to  the  humanitarian
     conditions  alone,  but  also  reflected  the  Adjudicator's   positive
     credibility finding in respect of the Respondent and the fact  that  he
     feared ethnic violence. We  can  deal  with  this  point  briefly.  The
     Adjudicator certainly accepted the  Respondent's  credibility,  in  the
     absence of any cross-examination on behalf of the  Appellant.   However
     the Appellant has no-one to blame but himself for this omission and  Mr
     Parker has not sought to challenge this finding.  When  then  assessing
     the asylum claim, the Adjudicator plainly had regard, not just  to  the
     risks arising from the conflict,  which  she  held  "appeared  to  have
     ended" but also to the wider risk of persecution  on  grounds  of  Hutu
     ethnicity, both by the state and by individuals. She concluded in terms
     in paragraph 40 "there is no evidence to suggest that this [Respondent]
     would have reason to fear persecution although the situation in Burundi
     remains fragile." Thus she concluded in effect there was no  real  risk
     that the Respondent would face treatment on or after return that  would
     cross the severity threshold, required to constitute persecution. It is
     true that she did not then specifically link this finding to a  related
     Article 3 claim on the basis of feared ethnic violence, but she did not
     need to do so because  she  found  in  the  Respondent's  favour  under
     Article 3 on the  separate  basis  of  the  humanitarian  situation  on
     return. We accept in principle that it is possible for Article 3 to  be
     contravened, even if the treatment could  not  be  said  to  amount  of
     persecution. However we  cannot  see,  in  the  circumstances  of  this
     appeal, having considered Mr Khan's submission, that there is any basis
     for any meaningful distinction between the asylum  claim  on  the  1951
     Convention basis of ethnic violence, and any associated Article 3 claim
     on the basis that the Respondent feared ethnic violence. On  the  facts
     of this appeal, the scope of persecution and of  inhuman  or  degrading
     treatment, cover the same ground and must stand or  fall  together.  We
     conclude therefore that paragraph 41 of the determination means what it
     says and relates to the humanitarian situation facing the Respondent on
     return, and in particular to the matters specifically  raised  in  that
     paragraph.

 11. We turn therefore to the main issue in this appeal,  which  is  whether
     the Adjudicator erred in her conclusion that the Respondent would  face
     a breach of  his  Article  3  rights  by  reason  of  the  humanitarian
     situation in that country. As we have said earlier, there  is  no  real
     challenge to the Adjudicator's summary of the objective  evidence.  The
     challenge relates to the conclusions she drew from it. The key  factors
     that led to the Adjudicator's decision to allow the  Article  3  appeal
     are plainly set out in paragraph 41. There are outbreaks of  infectious
     diseases. There is systematic  looting  of  crops  and  destruction  of
     property by armed political groups and government troops. There is  the
     shortage of food, basic social services and economic opportunities.  We
     have assessed whether, in line with the Court of Appeal's judgement  in
     Oleed, this is plainly wrong or unsustainable

 12. There are some notable omissions from the determination.  At  no  point
     did the Adjudicator set out the specific terms of Article  3  and  show
     understanding that they relate to "treatment" of the Respondent, rather
     than the general situation in Burundi. Nor did she show  any  awareness
     that this Article  has  a  minimum  severity  threshold.  Nor  did  she
     indicate that she had  taken  into  account  the  substantial  body  of
     jurisprudence on this subject, key elements of which we have summarised
     above.

 13. With regard to infectious diseases, and the shortage  of  food,  social
     services, and  economic  opportunities,  these  are  problems  that  in
     various degrees beset much of Africa. It is true that as a  consequence
     of the civil war, these problems are worse in Burundi than  most  other
     places. However the problems she described are  general  in  nature  in
     that country and affect the whole population.  The  population  of  the
     country in mid 1999 was estimated as being well over 6� million people.
     The logic of the Adjudicator's conclusion, bearing in mind she does not
     identify any specific risk to the Respondent, is that the whole country
     is in effect living in inhuman or degrading conditions. This is  not  a
     sustainable conclusion in the light of the evidence  and  the  guidance
     offered by Collins J. in SK and Fazilat about general  hardship  caused
     by a civil war and the need to have regard to the  standards  that  are
     accepted and expected in  the  country  being  assessed.  Nor  did  the
     Adjudicator have regard to the  fact  that  from  1996  until  he  left
     Burundi in 1999, when the civil war  was  fierce,  the  Respondent  was
     still then able to obtain employment and accommodation.  Poor  economic
     opportunity in general does not mean that a  fit  young  man  like  the
     Respondent could not find work and support  himself  again  on  return.
     This is especially so in the aftermath of the  conflict  when,  as  the
     objective  evidence  shows,  there  is  a  Government   programme   for
     rebuilding the infrastructure, and UNHCR  has  indicated  that  it  has
     funds available to assist the reintegration of returnees. Also there is
     no evidence that the Respondent is ill or in any need of  medical  care
     on return. It is also material, as Mr Parker  submitted,  that  in  the
     first nine months of 2002 at least 45,000 Burundian  refugees  returned
     to the country from abroad, and  25,000  of  them  did  so  with  UNHCR
     assistance. There  are  now  also  plans  for  more  extensive  returns
     especially from Tanzania. The  Adjudicator  does  not  appear  to  have
     considered the implausibility  that  UNHCR  would  sponsor  returns  to
     conditions that across the country as a whole would constitute  inhuman
     or  degrading  treatment.  We  find  the  Adjudicator's  conclusion  is
     unsustainable and her error springs from her  failure  to  address  the
     actual terms of  Article  3  or  to  take  into  account  the  relevant
     jurisprudence.

 14. The Adjudicator also referred in paragraph 41 to the looting  of  crops
     and the destruction of property. If by this she meant that the  country
     was the poorer for  this  having  happened,  that  is  true  but  those
     consequences fall within the ambit of  our  comments  in  the  previous
     paragraph.  Insofar as she was referring to continuing problems,  these
     would relate to areas where there  is  continuing  violence,  but  this
     covers only a limited part of the country as a whole, and not where the
     Respondent lived since 1995. It is essentially  confined  to  parts  of
     five provinces, namely Bujumbura-Rural (though not  the  city  centre),
     Bururi, Rutana, Ruyigi and Makamba provinces. Thus the Adjudicator  was
     also wrong to give such weight to this factor in the context of whether
     this Respondent would face inhuman or degrading  treatment  on  return,
     and her conclusion is unsustainable.

 15.  For  these  reasons,  we  accept  Mr  Parker's  submission  that   the
     Adjudicator's conclusion  to  allow  the  appeal  under  Article  3  is
     unsustainable and must be set aside. We conclude, on the basis  of  the
     Adjudicator's own summary of  the  objective  evidence  and  the  legal
     principles described above that, whilst the  situation  in  Burundi  is
     extremely poor for the population as a whole following the  civil  war,
     it does  not  in  context  cross  the  minimum  threshold  required  to
     establish a real risk  that  the  Respondent  would  face  torture,  or
     inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on return.

 16. For the reasons given above this appeal is allowed.
