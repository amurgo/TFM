For the Respondent:    Mr D Bazini  (Counsel )


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this matter is the Secretary of State. I  shall  refer
    to the parties as the Secretary of State or SSHD and to Mrs Goswami  as
    "the main Claimant".  This is an error of law hearing. The Secretary of
    State  has appealed against the  decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Norton-Taylor)("FTT") promulgated on 30th November 2016 in which
    the Claimant's appeal was allowed to the extent that the decisions made
    were not in accordance with the law  and  to  be  reconsidered  by  the
    Secretary of State.

Background

2.    The  Claimants  are  citizens  of  India  and  the  second  and  third
    Claimants are dependents  and  are  husband  and  daughter.   The  main
    entered the UK on December 2007 as a  student  and  was  granted  leave
    until February 2014.  Her subsequent application for leave  as  a  Tier
    one migrant was refused.  It was asserted  that  the  Claimant  used  a
    false document, namely a Certificate of sponsorship  purporting  to  be
    issued by Farringdon Care Homes.  The  application  was  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.  The Claimant accepted that
    the document was false but that she had no part in the deception  which
    was  facilitated  without  her  knowledge  by  advisors  that  she  had
    instructed.  Further she had in fact submitted a on line  crime  report
    followed by a letter to the Secretary of State in January  2015,  which
    was not challenged by the SSHD.  Her case was advanced on  the  grounds
    that the decision taken was not in  accordance  with  the  law  as  the
    Secretary of State failed to take into account the letter dated January
    2015 and /or the decision to remove was  a  breach  of  the  Claimant's
    Article 8 rights.

3.   The FTT found that the main Claimant was an entirely  truthful  witness
    and accepted that she had played no part in the deception in respect of
    which she had been a victim,  and  furthermore  she  had  notified  the
    Secretary of State of the deception [[33].  There was no evidence  from
    the Care Home and the FTT considered it relevant that the Secretary  of
    State, upon whom the burden was placed,  had  adduced  no  evidence  of
    having acted upon the  revelation  made  by  the  Claimant  as  to  the
    deception practised [36].  It was agreed that  the  FTT  could  make  a
    decision on the limited grounds of not  in  accordance  with  the  law,
    because the appeal fell  within  the  transitional  provisions  of  the
    Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 ("2002 Act") [13].   The  FTT
    found that the Secretary of State discharged the initial burden to show
    that there was dishonesty in respect of the false Certificate but  that
    the Claimant adduced good evidence in rebuttal and that  the  Secretary
    of State had not discharged the additional  burden  to  show  that  the
    Claimant was herself dishonest [39-40].

Grounds of application for permission

4.    In her grounds the Secretary of State argued that  the  FTT  erred  by
    misdirecting itself on the law in AA(Nigeria) v SSHD  [2010]  EWCA  Civ
    773 at  (67).   The  FTT  conflated  false  representations  and  false
    documentation.  In  the  latter  it  was  mandatory  to   dismiss   the
    application having found the document to be false.

5.     The FTT erred in considering that there  was  a  discretionary  power
    outside of the rules under paragraph  322  and/or  that  there  was  no
    procedural unfairness to render the decision taken as not in accordance
    with the law (EK(Ivory Coast) V SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 (37)).

Permission to appeal

6.  Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  (UT)  was  granted  by  FTJ
    Osborne on 5.6.2017.  In granting permission the  FTJ  found  that  the
    grounds advanced were arguable and that the Rules require  a  mandatory
    refusal when a false documentation has been made "whether or not to the
    applicant's knowledge."

Submisssions

7.   At the hearing before me no issue was taken as to  the  correctness  of
    the FTT's powers to remit the decision on the grounds that it  was  not
    in accordance with the law. Mr Duffy relied on the  grounds  of  appeal
    and argued that the FTT erred by the conflation of  the  two  forms  of
    dishonesty and that where a document is false there  is  no  discretion
    and it is not  a  requirement  to  consider  the  different  legal  and
    evidential burdens.

8.  Mr Bazini argued that there was no error as the FTT found that the  SSHD
    had failed to make a procedurally fair decision  on  all  the  relevant
    facts before her. The decision made by the FTT was clearly one that was
    open to it to make and thus there was no error in  law.   Alternatively
    the FTT should be required to consider Article 8 ECHR.


Discussion and conclusion

9.  I have considered the UT decision in Marghia cited by Mr Duffy in  which
    it is concluded that the unfairness of a decision is in relation  to  a
    procedural failure and not to decisions which are unfair per se.  There
    has been no specific argument from Mr Bazini that  the  decision  taken
    was unfair in the Wednesbury sense that no reasonable decision maker or
    public body could have arrived at such a  decision.   His  argument  is
    that the decision making procedure  was  not  fairly  followed  to  the
    extent that  the  respondent  failed  to  take  into  account  relevant
    material before her in reaching a decision as to  dishonesty.  I  agree
    with that submission. In Shen the UT endorsed the approach in  Adedoyin
    (formerly AA Nigeria) in  that  the  reference  to  "false"  must  mean
    "dishonestly" false [25]. If that approach is followed then the  stages
    following an application would be for the SSHD to start by  identifying
    the document/evidence that gave rise to a conclusion that deception  or
    dishonesty had been used.  There after it is open to the  applicant  to
    provide a plausible explanation in rebuttal and finally if an  innocent
    explanation is established then the SSHD bears a further burden to show
    that the applicant was dishonest.  It  is  of  note  that  the  wording
    "whether or not to the applicant's knowledge " is  applicable  to  both
    issues of false representation and false documents, which  in  my  view
    supports the argument pursued by  Mr  Bazini.  There  is  no  provision
    separating the requirements for the assessment of false representations
    and false documents and this approach is consistent with  AA  at  (71).
    The material issue is whether the applicant had been dishonest or  lied
    whether that be by documentation or representation.   It  follows  that
    the SSHD must consider all available evidence which  in  this  instance
    included a crime report and a letter setting out a  plausible  innocent
    explanation.  The failure on the part of the SSHD was found by the  FTT
    to be a procedural and substantive unfairness  rendering  the  decision
    not in accordance with the law.  The FTT was tasked to  assess  whether
    or not the decision made by the SSHD could be upheld on the basis of  a
    finding of dishonesty. Accordingly I am  satisfied  that  the  decision
    taken by the FTT was open to it to make and that the decision falls  to
    be reconsidered by the SSHD as  to  the  issue  of  dishonesty  of  the
    Claimant in light of the finding by the FTT that she was not dishonest.
