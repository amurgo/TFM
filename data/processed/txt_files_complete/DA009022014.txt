Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Smeaton of Counsel instructed by MKM Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Iraq who first came to this  country  in
    or around 1978.  It appears that he returned to Iraq  for  a  visit  in
    1980 but has not returned since then.  It is  not  suggested  that  his
    presence in this country has been anything other  than  lawful  and  in
    1982 he was granted indefinite leave to remain.  His birth name was  Mr
    Mohammed but on 12 August 1992 he changed his name by deed poll to  his
    current  name  which  is  Dean  Mazen  Ramsey.   Although  he  made  an
    application to be naturalised as a British citizen  in  February  1999,
    his tax and national insurance contributions were  not  up-to-date  and
    for this reason his application for British citizenship was refused.

 2. It does not appear that the appellant  has  any  family  life  in  this
    country which is a matter which will be discussed  below.   Clearly  he
    must have a private life here  but  by  about  2010  this  was  not  an
    entirely happy one because he was in dispute with his landlord and also
    some of his neighbours. Motivated by this dispute, on 22 September 2010
    he deliberately set fire to the property in which he and his neighbours
    lived.  The extreme seriousness of this offence is  apparent  from  the
    sentencing remarks of  Judge  Baucher  when  the  appellant  was  being
    sentenced for this offence which was one of arson being reckless as  to
    whether life is endangered.  The appellant was  sentenced  on  10  June
    2011 and I set out below relevant extracts from the sentencing remarks:

         "The facts of this matter are that on [22 September 2010] a  female
         attended  the  police  station,  subsequently   followed   by   the
         defendant, advising that a fire was in  place  at  a  semi-detached
         property... at 20 Oliver Grove, South Norwood.   The  flats  are  a
         basement, a ground floor,  and  a  first  and  second  floor.   The
         defendant resided on the first floor.   There  were  another  three
         families present: six adults, seven children with ages ranging from
         2 to 10 years.  There was no fire escape at the premises or  access
         or egress other than the internal staircase, and those exiting  the
         premises from upstairs had to pass the source of the  fire,  namely
         flat 3.

         There was a loud explosion  and  effectively  the  entire  building
         ultimately virtually collapsed; certainly the roof was blown out by
         the explosion.  Those on the top floor had to attend hospital  that
         night although  they  were  discharged  later  that  evening.   The
         emergency services had to attend.  The road was closed for a  week,
         facilities were  cut  off  for  several  hours  for  those  in  the
         immediate vicinity.  It was considered a major  critical  incident.
         The  emergency  services,  999,  attended,  together   with   local
         authority utility  companies,  demolition  experts  and  engineers.
         This is a semi-detached property and the property next to it is now
         in an unstable condition, to which I will return in due course.

         What is evident is that on that day the defendant  had  received  a
         notification from his landlord in relation to him having left a tap
         running.  This was in relation to a number of ongoing disputes with
         the neighbours.  Essentially in his interview he said:  'I  am  not
         going to let this bastard get away with  it'.   He  said:  'I  went
         straightaway, and I had petrol in the spare room, a tank, you know,
         that you carry in the car.  I used to have a car.  And I poured it.
          When I was pouring it I thought this is - this  is  it.   I  mean,
         this is what I am doing.  So, I mean,  I  poured  it  all  over  my
         stuff, furniture, everything, and I went to the bedroom and ignited
         it.  It didn't ignite and the second time I threw  the  match,  the
         second match, and suddenly, phew! It nearly took me out.  I mean, I
         had to run fast, which is not a long run.  I managed  to  open  the
         door with my rucksack - which I just come - I usually leave it next
         to the door, and I managed  to  get  out  and  run  downstairs  and
         shouted, 'get out, get out, get out' and the police station is just
         across the road.' "

 3. The next sentence is  particularly  important,  which  is,  "the  other
    residents, to whom I have already made reference, were in the  property
    at the material time".

 4. Having referred to the various evidence given by the families who  were
    all in the property at the time, the judge in  her  sentencing  remarks
    continues as follows:

         "All  those  families   had   to   be   provided   with   emergency
         accommodation. The adjacent property also had to be evacuated  and,
         as I have already indicated, that is in a parlous state.  Those  in
         flat 1, the top floor flat, lost  everything,  which  they  roughly
         estimate at �10,000; those in flat  2  lost  everything,  including
         their cat; the basement lost about �7,300 worth of  goods.   Second
         floor losses have been estimated at �22,500.  None of those  people
         are in a position to recover their losses as they were not  insured
         at the material time and the landlord's insurance  does  not  cover
         for their loss."

 5. The judge then deals with the request  to  make  a  compensation  order
    which was not appropriate because the appellant was not working and was
    obviously going to receive a substantial custodial  sentence.   However
    the point was made that not  only  did  the  appellant  place  ordinary
    decent people at very great risk of death or very serious harm  but  he
    also caused these people to lose what to them must have been   property
    of very significant value for which they will not be compensated.

 6. The judge then continues as follows:

         "That is a minimal part of the damage done.  The cost of repair  to
         the building is �620,000.  There are legal costs associated of some
         �20,000; there is contents damage to the building  itself,  another
         �50,000, there is the repairing of the central wall to the property
         next door of at least �50,000, and that is if  that  property  does
         not have to be demolished.  The landlord has  also  been  hit  with
         invoice costs from Croydon Council and Limbrook Services and  those
         invoices  are  in  excess  of  �177,000.   Those  costs  alone  are
         therefore in the region of �1 million and that is  on  top  of  the
         individual losses to those in the property.

         The landlord describes how he has been traumatised  and  unable  to
         sleep 'I have been particularly disturbed about how much worse this
         could have been in terms of human suffering.  I think  particularly
         of the  other  residents  at  number  20  who  managed  to  escape,
         especially the young child and her parents  in  the  top  flat.   I
         needed to visit my GP and was prescribed  sleeping  tablets'.   He,
         not being present in the building at the time, perhaps puts it more
         coherently than anybody else.  In  short  there  were  three  other
         families within that building, a total of seven children some 2  to
         10 years of age.  You on your own admission in  interview  accepted
         that you knew they were present, but  nonetheless  you  carried  on
         with what you were doing."

 7. The judge then goes out to set  out  what  she  regarded  (and  anybody
    looking at this offence must  also  regard)  as  aggravating  features.
    These were as follows:

         "There was premeditation.  You went to the store room (sic) to  get
         this petrol that you had, for whatever purpose I know not; you  had
         not got a car anymore but you had kept it.  And,  as  you  said  in
         your interview, you had an attempt to light the fire  and  then  it
         didn't work so you tried again.  The second aggravating feature was
         the extensive damage which I have detailed.  The third  significant
         aggravating feature is of course the number  of  occupants  in  the
         premises and the fact that there were so  many  children  on  those
         premises.  Another aggravating feature is that to some extent  this
         is a revenge attack; it is a revenge attack on the landlord, it  is
         a vendetta.  Another aggravating feature is your failure  to  raise
         any alarm whatsoever.  When you left the premises you shouted  'get
         out', but that was hardly sufficient given that you knew  that  the
         top floor was occupied.  Going to the police station when the  fire
         was in full swing can hardly be seen as a  mitigating  factor.   It
         was also well known to you that there  was  no  external  means  of
         exiting these premises.  The  only  one  means  of  exit  was  down
         through the internal staircase and  that  internal  staircase  came
         past your flat which was the source of the fire.   If  anybody  had
         any doubt at all, should this matter go elsewhere, as to the extent
         of the damage to the property or what was at  stake  here,  then  I
         invite them to look at the two bundles of  photographs  which  have
         been produced to me and properly copied.  These clearly capture the
         extent of the damage and what could have occurred given  that  this
         building was divided into four flats."

 8. Having set out the personal circumstances of the appellant and also his
    explanation that "in the few months prior  to  the  fire  my  behaviour
    became quite erratic  and  I  was  unable  to  cope  with  my  personal
    circumstances and felt very isolated" the judge referred to the  report
    from the Probation Services and  gave  her  reasons  why  she  did  not
    consider that the  public  needed  to  be  protected  by  means  of  an
    indeterminate sentence, saying that "I am satisfied that the public can
    properly be protected by means of a determinate sentence.   But,  as  I
    have already said, that has to be substantive".

 9. The judge then states as follows:

         "What is also clear in relation to arson of this type, as the Court
         of Appeal said in Attorney  General's  reference  (No.68  of  2008)
         reported at [2009] 2 Crim App R 48: 'Sentencing in arson  cases  is
         not an easy exercise.  Further, the dividing line between the worst
         cases of reckless arson and the least serious cases of  arson  with
         intent is a very fine one'.  I have no doubt, given the aggravating
         features of this case, that this falls at the upper  end  [if]  not
         the very top end of the offences of reckless arson...".

10. The judge also considered that other than in respect of the early  plea
    of guilty "there can be very little mitigation indeed".

11. Ms Smeaton who appears for the appellant before me today does not  seek
    to persuade me that this was not an exceptionally serious offence which
    could have had the most horrific consequences  not  only  in  terms  of
    monetary loss (which it did have) but also in terms  of  the  potential
    injury or even death of a very large  number  of  wholly  innocent  and
    decent  members  of  the  public.   Unsurprisingly,  even  though   the
    appellant had been in this country for a long time, the respondent made
    a deportation order in respect of him.  The respondent is by virtue  of
    the automatic deportation provisions now in place obliged to make  such
    an order unless as a consequence of her so doing  the  rights  of  this
    appellant would be breached either under  the  European  Convention  of
    Human  Rights  or  the  Refugee  Convention.   The  respondent,  having
    considered all the circumstances surrounding  this  offence  considered
    that it would not.  It is  not  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  this
    determination to set out the law in any great detail.  The  deportation
    order which was made against the appellant on  13  May  2014  was  made
    under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 on the  basis  that  his
    deportation was conducive to the public good and in the public interest
    because (as set out within paragraph 398 (a) of the immigration rules),
    he had been convicted of an offence for which he had been sentenced  to
    a period of imprisonment of at least four years.

12. The appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal  was  heard
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge R.J.N.B. Morris sitting at Hatton Cross on
    4 November 2014 and  in  a  Decision  and  Reasons  promulgated  on  27
    November 2014 Judge  Morris  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals against  that  decision  pursuant  to  permission
    which was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox on 17 December 2014.
     There are five grounds of appeal although it is fair to say  that  the
    fifth has not really been pursued before me today.   The  grounds  were
    settled by Ms Smeaton of Counsel who appeared for the appellant  before
    Judge Morris and has also represented the appellant before me.   It  is
    right that I record my appreciation to Ms Smeaton for the sensitive and
    persuasive way in which she has argued what is clearly on the facts  of
    this case an extremely difficult appeal.  She made the points which she
    felt were properly arguable in a thorough but  concise  manner  without
    attempting in any way to minimise what on any view was a  very  serious
    offence indeed.  She relied on the grounds which she summarised  before
    the Tribunal and I will attempt in this determination to state  briefly
    what they were.

13. It is clear that before Judge Morris the appeal had  been  put  on  the
    basis that the appellant's removal would  be  in  breach  of  both  his
    Article 3 and Article 8 rights.  So far as Article 3 is concerned there
    were two limbs to this argument.  In the first place it was  said  that
    the situation in Iraq was so serious now that it simply  was  not  safe
    for anyone to be returned there at this stage.

14. The second limb was related to the appellant's  personal  circumstances
    in that the reason why  he  had  changed  his  name  was  that  he  had
    repudiated his Muslim upbringing and so he would be returning  to  Iraq
    in circumstances where because he was an  atheist  who  had  repudiated
    Islam he would personally be at risk.  Both  these  factors  were  also
    relevant it is said to the appellant's Article 8  claim  because  taken
    together with everything else about this appellant, when looked  at  in
    the  round  these  factors  created  "very  compelling"   reasons   why
    notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence of  which  he  had  been
    convicted, the  deportation  of  this  appellant  to  Iraq  in  current
    circumstances would still be disproportionate.

15. I will deal with the Article 3 argument first.  It was I think accepted
    by Ms Smeaton that at least so far as the first ground is concerned  it
    would be difficult to argue that the judge was  not  entitled  to  find
    that the situation in Iraq was  not  so  dangerous  as  to  engage  the
    appellant's Article 3 rights.  Ms Smeaton still sought  to  argue  that
    the appellant's rejection of his Muslim identity would put him at  risk
    on return although it is fair to say that she does accept that not  all
    the evidence which might have been before the judge to support  such  a
    claim was in fact before the judge.  I will deal with this in a  little
    more detail below.

16. So far as Article 8 is concerned Ms  Smeaton's  primary  submission  is
    that the judge did not properly consider the arguments which  had  been
    advanced in support of the appellant's  Article  3  claim,  within  her
    consideration of Article 8.  It is the appellant's case as  now  argued
    that the defect in Judge Morris's reasoning was that having found  both
    that the situation in Iraq was not such as in itself to give rise to an
    Article 3 claim and also that atheists  as  such  were  not  persecuted
    (which was still challenged on behalf  on  the  appellant),  the  judge
    should nonetheless  have  gone  on  to  consider  whether  the  current
    situation in Iraq, albeit not so bad as to give rise to  an  Article  3
    claim, coupled with the difficulties faced by atheists  or  non-Muslims
    in Iraq, were such that when aggregated  with  all  the  other  factors
    could still lead to the conclusion that it  would  be  disproportionate
    for Article 8 purposes to  return  the  appellant  to  Iraq  now.  When
    considering this submission, I of course appreciate that the  Court  of
    Appeal has  in  a  number  of  cases  now  stated  that  there  may  be
    circumstances, albeit rare, where if an applicant's  Article  8  rights
    are engaged then factors which although themselves do not give rise  to
    an Article 3 claim might still, when aggregated with other factors,  be
    taken into account when considering whether removal is disproportionate
    for Article 8 purposes.  I have in mind in particular the  observations
    of the Court of Appeal made in MM Zimbabwe) [2012]  EWCA  Civ  279  and
    more recently in GS (India) & Others [2015] EWCA Civ  40,  although  it
    was made clear within the latter decision  (a  health  case)  that  the
    circumstances in which such an argument could succeed would be rare.

17. When considering the Article 8 position of  the  appellant  so  far  as
    ground 2 was concerned it was argued that Judge Morris should have  had
    regard to the HJ (Iran) point which is that she should have appreciated
    that it was not sufficient just to  assume  that  the  appellant  could
    change his name back to a Muslim name and adhere  to  Muslim  behaviour
    because this could be said to go to his whole identity.   It  was  also
    said within grounds 3 and 4 that there were factual errors  within  the
    determination itself.  Ms Smeaton acknowledged when advancing grounds 3
    and 4 that if these had been the only  grounds  then  in  Ms  Smeaton's
    words "I will have to concede they will be unlikely to succeed on their
    own" but she did submit that they were capable when considered  in  the
    round with her other grounds of being of  sufficient  weight  as  might
    have affected the proportionality exercise.  So  far  as  ground  3  is
    concerned, it is submitted that the judge when referring to the  length
    of time that the appellant had spent in Iraq prior to  coming  to  this
    country should have appreciated that the situation in Iraq now  was  so
    different from how it was when the appellant had left in 1978  that  it
    was not appropriate to  place  any  sort  of  weight  on  his  previous
    presence in that country.  Saddam Hussain came to power in  1979  which
    is the year after the appellant had left Iraq,  although  he  had  been
    back briefly the following year.  Ms Smeaton submitted that as Iraq now
    was so very different from how it was when the appellant left that  his
    previous presence was not very significant.  His  only  connection  was
    that he spoke the language.

18. The fourth ground relates to the judge's finding that  it  was  only  a
    matter of "conjecture" that the appellant no longer had any  family  in
    Iraq.  She referred to the evidence the appellant had  given  that  the
    country had been destroyed (in evidence he had said 'decimated') by the
    war in which he was referring to his home area, and this apparently was
    not challenged during that hearing.  Also, in his witness statement  he
    had said that even if his mother was still in Iraq she would  be  about
    80 now and his siblings had all married and moved away a long time ago.

19. Also the judge had incorrectly referred to the appellant  returning  to
    Iraq twelve years after his arrival in 1980, whereas  in  fact  he  had
    returned two years after his arrival in 1978 which was in 1980 and  had
    not been back to Iraq since then.  Also it was said that the judge  had
    ignored the background evidence of the high number of displaced persons
    there were within Iraq.  These  factors  were  all  capable  of  having
    weight when consideration was given to how easy it  would  be  for  the
    appellant to integrate within Iraq, the society as it was now, and  the
    judge's statement that because he had been able to integrate  into  the
    UK when he came he would be able to integrate into  Iraq  now  did  not
    follow because his ability to integrate into  Iraq  without  assistance
    under  current  circumstances  was  simply  not  comparable  with   his
    situation when he came to this country.

20. So far as the fifth ground is concerned this related to whether or  not
    the appellant would have difficulties  because  he  might  be  returned
    without documentation but as the current policy of  the  respondent  is
    that undocumented people are not returned to Iraq  at  the  moment  and
    also because it does not appear to be disputed that the appellant could
    himself assist in obtaining such documentation, so far as his Article 8
    rights are concerned that ground was not pursued before me.

21. On behalf of the respondent  Mr  Shilliday  responded  briefly  to  the
    grounds in turn.  So far as ground 1 is concerned it was  not  accepted
    that the tests have been conflated.  In the first  place  Judge  Morris
    had been asked to consider the same matters with regard to  Articles  3
    and 8 and it was clear from what was set out at paragraph 27  that  she
    had had in mind the correct test because, having considered the various
    factors she had stated that "although the  appellant  might  experience
    hardship and inconvenience in re-establishing himself in  Iraq,  it  is
    not unreasonable for him to return to Baghdad where he would not be  at
    real risk of persecution or other serious harm, especially since it  is
    possible to obtain the requisite documentation needed  to  re-integrate
    into the Iraqi way of life".

22. That in Mr Shilliday's submission is the appropriate test under Article
    8 so the judge had looked at the factors both in respect of  Article  3
    and Article 8.  So far as ground  2  was  concerned,  although  it  was
    accepted that in line with HJ (Iran) regard had to be had to whether or
    not the appellant would be required to deny an intrinsic  part  of  his
    personality, this in the circumstances of this case was  simply  not  a
    relevant factor.  The reality here is that there was simply no evidence
    before the Tribunal to establish that the appellant would  be  at  risk
    because he would be returning as an atheist who  had  renounced  Islam.
    What Judge Morris was saying in effect was that the appellant was not a
    Christian or a Yazidi and there was no other evidence that he would  be
    at risk on return; even if she did not say this in terms it would still
    not have been a material error because there was no evidence before her
    to support a case that he would be at risk on return for this reason.

23. So far as the other grounds were concerned I understood Mr  Shilliday's
    case to be that these were minor mistakes insofar as the judge got  the
    facts slightly wrong.  What was relevant  in  this  case  is  that  the
    appellant had absolutely no family life in this country  whatsoever  so
    when one compares the family life that he has here with the family life
    that he might have in Iraq whereas he clearly has  no  family  ties  in
    this country he might have some family ties in Iraq.  Mr Shilliday  did
    not dispute that the appellant would have some  private  life  in  this
    country but no factors have been put before the Tribunal to  show  that
    this life was such as  to  provide  very  compelling  reasons  why  his
    removal,  given  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  of  which  he  was
    convicted, would not be proportionate.

24. In reply Ms Smeaton briefly reiterated the case she was advancing.  She
    did not submit that the judge, had she taken full account  of  all  the
    factors, would have been  bound  to  find  that  the  removal  of  this
    appellant was disproportionate but asserted that she did  not  have  to
    establish this.  All she had to establish, which she submitted she had,
    was that if the judge had considered all the facts  properly  it  would
    have been open to her to find that there were very  compelling  reasons
    why this appellant should not be deported and  accordingly  the  errors
    within her determination were material ones.

Discussion

25. My starting point must be the relevant provisions as  contained  within
    the Immigration Rules (which were properly set out within  paragraph  6
    of the First-tier Tribunal's determination) as considered by the  Court
    of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ  1192.  Following  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) the Rules were  amended
    slightly to give effect to the judgment in  that  case  (so  that,  for
    example, the words "very compelling circumstances" were substituted for
    "exceptional  circumstances"),  but  these  changes  do  not  have  any
    material impact on this decision.  It is now established, following  MF
    (Nigeria), that in respect  of  deportation  decisions  the  Article  8
    rights of an applicant are incorporated within the Rules such that  the
    duty of a decision maker is to consider first whether deportation of an
    applicant would be in breach  of  that  applicant's  Article  8  rights
    having had consideration to the factors set out  within  paragraph  399
    and 399A, and if not then to go on  to  consider  under  paragraph  398
    whether there were  "compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    described in paragraphs 399  and  399A"  such  that  removal  would  be
    disproportionate.  The  last  section  of  paragraph  398  provides  as
    follows:

         "The  Secretary  of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  [that   the
         deportation of an applicant would be  contrary  to  this  country's
         obligations under Article 8] will consider whether paragraph 399 or
         399A  applies,  and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public  interest  in
         deportation will only be outweighed by other  factors  where  there
         are very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
         paragraphs 399 and 399A."

26. It is not suggested that any of the factors set out in  paragraphs  399
    or 399A apply in the circumstances of this case.   The  appellant  does
    not  have  a  relationship  with  a  child  and  nor  does  he  have  a
    relationship with a partner in the UK such as would  be  necessary  for
    paragraph 399 to apply.  So far as paragraph 399A is concerned this  is
    not applicable either because the  deportation  of  this  appellant  is
    conducive to the public good under  paragraph  398(a)  (and  not  under
    398(b) or (c)) "because he has been convicted of an offence  for  which
    he has been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least  four
    years" (in this case the appellant was  sentenced  to  imprisonment  of
    seven years).

27. Accordingly deportation is in the public interest and  this  will  also
    only be outweighed by other factors for Article 8 purposes "where there
    are very compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A".

28. So far as Article 3 is concerned I can deal with the  submissions  made
    on behalf of the appellant briefly because  in  my  judgment  they  are
    simply  not  arguable.   Under  current  jurisprudence  as  the   judge
    recognised the background information was not such as  was  capable  of
    providing support for the proposition  that  no  one  could  safely  be
    returned to Iraq because of the general situation within that  country.
    So far as the second ground is concerned  again  there  was  simply  no
    proper basis before the judge on which she could  possibly  have  found
    that the appellant would be at risk on return because  of  his  atheist
    westernised identity.  The highest that the case was put before me with
    regard to this ground was  by  reference  to  the  Iraq  OGN     of  31
    December 2013 (reissued on 22 August 2014) in which the "situation  for
    other religious minorities in central and southern Iraq" was set out at
    paragraph 3.14.20 as follows:

         "There were some reports that non-Muslim minorities felt obliged to
         adhere to certain Islamic practices, such as  wearing  a  Hijab  or
         fasting during Ramadan.  Some Muslims  threaten  women  and  girls,
         regardless of their religious affiliation, for refusing to wear the
         Hijab, for dressing in western style clothing, for not adhering  to
         strict interpretations of Islamic norms governing public behaviour.
          Numerous women, including Christians, reported opting to wear  the
         Hijab  after  being  harassed.   Two  Christian  female  government
         employees reported forcible transfer to another  section  of  their
         employing industry without notice or consent because  they  refused
         to wear head scarves."

29. As Mr Shilliday noted in his submissions, it would have  been  open  to
    the appellant in the absence of background information  supporting  his
    claim to have instructed an expert to give evidence on his  behalf  but
    he chose not to do so and in the absence of evidence an Article 3 claim
    or claim for asylum founded on an  alleged  risk  on  return  for  this
    reason is simply unarguable.

30. Turning now to Article 8, I do not accept the argument advanced  by  Ms
    Smeaton on behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the  judge  conflated  the
    different tests which  are  applicable  when  considering  respectively
    Article 3 and Article 8.  It is clear from was is said at paragraph  27
    that the judge having decided that an Article 3 claim was not made  out
    then adopted the correct test  when  considering  Article  8  which  is
    whether or not it would be reasonable to expect the appellant to return
    to Baghdad, and her finding that this would  be  reasonable  given  the
    background to this case, is entirely appropriate.   She  accepted  that
    the appellant "might  experience  hardship  and  inconvenience  in  re-
    establishing himself in Iraq" but given that "he would not be  at  real
    risk of persecution or other serious harm" considered that it would  be
    reasonable for him to go back there.  Whether or not the applicant  has
    family in Iraq is really beside the point.  He clearly  does  not  have
    family in this country and has not suggested that he has,  and  in  any
    event, when considering  whether  his  removal  is  proportionate,  the
    starting point must be that the offence which he committed was of  such
    exceptional seriousness and the revulsion which the  public  must  feel
    towards this offending is so great, that there would have  to  be  very
    compelling reasons (as the Rules make clear) for his forcible return to
    be seen as disproportionate.  Obviously if the appellant  would  be  at
    risk on return such that his Article 3  rights  would  be  engaged,  he
    could not lawfully be returned, but given the  extreme  seriousness  of
    this offence and the appellant's  lack  of  any  family  ties  in  this
    country, it is hard to conceive of any circumstances other  than  where
    the Article 3 threshold is met in which his return  could  properly  be
    said to be disproportionate.  He is a  healthy  man  and  there  is  no
    reason  to  believe  that  he  would  have  such  difficulties  in  re-
    integrating into Iraq as to amount to a very compelling  reason  as  to
    why he should not be required to do so.  Certainly none  has  been  put
    before this Tribunal.

31. On the facts of this case, I consider that any decision other than that
    this appellant's deportation was proportionate would have been arguably
    perverse.  In these circumstances it follows that this appeal  must  be
    dismissed.

Decision

There having been no material error of  law  in  the  determination  of  the
First-tier Tribunal the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
