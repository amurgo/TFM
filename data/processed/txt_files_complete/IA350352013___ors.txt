                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellants are a mother and two children who are nationals of
   Nigeria who had been living in Spain. Having previously travelled to the
   UK on multi entry visit visas they entered the UK on valid visit visas on
   the 25th of January 2012 and on the 30th of May 2012 applied for leave to
   remain on form FLR(O). The applications were refused for the reasons
   given in the Refusal Letters of the 6th of August 2013. The Appellants
   appealed by Notice and Grounds of Appeal of the 19th of August 2013.

2. The appeals were heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes at Stoke on
   Trent on the 18th of February 2014. In a determination promulgated on the
   26th of March 2014 the appeals were dismissed under the Immigration Rules
   but allowed under article 8 of the ECHR and section 55 of the Borders,
   Nationality and Immigration Act 2009. The Secretary of State sought
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in an application of the 4th
   of April 2014 and this was granted on the 17th of April 2014.

3. The First Appellant is the mother of the other Appellants. Their history
   is set out in the First-tier Tribunal determination and I do not need to
   repeat it here, it is referred to below. The Judge found that the
   Appellants could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules as
   they stood on the 8th of July 2012 nor the requirements of Appendix FM.

4. The appeals were allowed for the reasons given in paragraphs 20 to 25 of
   the determination. The Judge found that the children did not have any
   health difficulties but that they had been disrupted by their move from
   Spain. In paragraph 22 the Judge found that although the Appellants must
   have declared an intention to leave the UK in order to have been granted
   visit visa he was "satisfied that this was not the Appellants intended"
   and went on to consider the explanations given. He inferred that with
   possible homelessness they could not afford the delay that an entry
   clearance application would have entailed.

5. In paragraph 25 he considered proportionality. He accepted that the
   Appellants had established themselves in the UK with the help of their
   church and friends and that they are supported by the Sponsor. He did not
   analyse the finances available to the Sponsor or compare that with the
   requirements of Appendix FM. The Judge noted that the Sponsor is a
   British citizen with all the rights that entails.

6. The determination is flawed in a number of ways. Although the children
   may be entitled to British citizenship that is not the route that the
   family have taken and until they obtain citizenship they remain foreign
   nationals subject to immigration control along with their mother. The
   finding in paragraph 22 is effectively that the Appellant entered the UK
   by deception, i.e. that they did not intend to leave the UK despite
   having made a declaration to the contrary and that this was to avoid
   making a proper entry clearance application. That is a significant
   feature which was not weighed in the assessment of the circumstances that
   they had created against the public interest in the maintenance of
   immigration control.

7. It may the case that they were about to be required to leave the
   accommodation that they had but there appears to have been no enquiry by
   the Judge about the efforts that they might have made to obtain
   alternative accommodation. Given the recent and continuing financial
   crisis one of the well publicised issues from Spain is the overall
   surplus of accommodation and the significant fall in property values.
   There is no finding that the family could not obtain accommodation or
   that it would be unreasonable for them to do so.

8. The Appellants cannot apply using Appendix FM as they entered as
   visitors and so cannot rely on EX.1. However the provisions form the
   background for the assessment of the public interest and the extent to
   which the Appellants do or do not meet the analogous requirements are
   relevant.

9. The Sponsor's income requirements to support a spouse and two children
   amount to �24,800: �18,600 for the spouse; �3,800 for the first child and
   �2,400 each for subsequent children. In the Grounds of Appeal to the
   First-tier Tribunal it was stated that the Sponsor had earnings of over
   �21,000 but it was not given exactly. Taking �21,000 as the figure there
   was a shortfall of �3,800. Savings of two and half times the shortfall
   would be required to make up the shortfall. With savings of �25,000 the
   funds would be inadequate as the Sponsor would need a minimum of �16,000
   and a further �9,500. On the figures given that is �500 short but a near
   miss is not relevant. The Judge erred in not analysing the finances and
   not weighing the failure of the Sponsor's earnings to meet the
   requirements in the balance.

10. The best interests of the children are a relevant factor. However, as
   foreign nationals the presumption relating to their length of residence
   arises after 7 years and less weight is attached to first four years of a
   child's life. The fact is the Appellants only entered the UK in the
   circumstances outlined in 2012, with no expectation of being permitted to
   remain and by deception. The disruption to their lives in leaving Spain
   has been brought about by their actions and decisions for which they
   alone are responsible. The Judge mentioned the Sponsor's rights as a
   British national without noting the obligation on British citizens to
   obey the law and not to circumvent its provisions for personal
   convenience.

11. As matters stood before the First-tier Tribunal the Judge was faced
   with foreign nationals who had entered by deception in circumstances in
   which they could not have met the Immigration Rules relating to the entry
   of a spouse and children. They had been in the UK for a limited period
   with no expectation of being permitted to remain. There was nothing in
   those circumstances that would justify the Judge considering their
   position outside the Immigration Rules and if such a step were taken
   there was nothing that could be said to be compelling or exceptional to
   justify granting leave outside the rules.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law and I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal dismissing the appeal of the
Appellants.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order or direction.

Fee Award

In dismissing the appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
