Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellants are husband wife and  are  both  nationals  of  India.
       They appealed against the respondent's decisions of 11th January 2019
       and 15th January 2019 to  refuse  their  applications  for  leave  to
       remain in the UK.  The first  appellant  claimed  an  entitlement  to
       leave to remain on the basis of  10  years'  lawful  residence  under
       paragraph 276B of the immigration rules and her  husband  applied  as
       her dependant.  Their appeals were dismissed for the reasons set  out
       in a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Herlihy  promulgated  on
       23rd July 2019.


    2. The appellants immigration history is set out at paragraph [2] of the
       decision.  The first appellant arrived in the UK  on  8th  July  2008
       with leave to enter as a student valid until 30th  April  2009.   She
       was granted further leave to remain as a student until 30th September
       2016.  On 28th September 2016, the first appellant  made  an  in-time
       application for further  leave  to  remain  outside  the  immigration
       rules.  That application  was  refused  by  the  respondent  on  11th
       October 2017 with an out of  country  right  of  appeal.   The  first
       appellant did not leave the UK and exercise her right of  appeal  but
       instead, on 25th October 2017, applied for further leave  to  remain.
       That application was subsequently varied, on 30th January 2018, to an
       application for indefinite leave  to  remain.   The  application  was
       refused for the reasons set out in the respondent's decision of  11th
       January 2019.


    3. The judge refers, at [3], to the reasons given by the respondent  for
       refusing  the  application.  The  respondent  concluded   the   first
       appellant's leave to remain in the UK ended on 11th October 2017  and
       as the applicant had not accrued 10 years continuous lawful residence
       in the UK, her application cannot succeed under paragraph 276B of the
       immigration rules.


The decision of FtT Judge Herlihy


    4. The background to the appeal and the appellant's immigration  history
       is set out at paragraph [2] to [7] of the decision of the FtT  Judge.
       The judge heard oral evidence from both appellants and that  evidence
       is set out at paragraphs [13] to [18] of the decision.  The  findings
       and conclusions of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  are  set  out  at
       paragraphs [19] to [31] of the decision.


    5. The judge noted, at [20], it is accepted by the respondent  that  the
       appellant had lawful leave from 8th July 2008  until  30th  September
       2016.  The judge noted that  it  is  also  accepted  that  the  first
       appellant made a valid  in-time  application  for  further  leave  to
       remain on 28th September 2016, and that application was  refused  and
       certified as clearly unfounded under s94 of the  2002  Act,  on  11th
       October  2017.   The  judge  referred,  at  [21],  to   the   further
       application for leave to remain outside the immigration rules made on
       25th October 2017, which was varied  on  30th  January  2018,  to  an
       application for indefinite leave to remain. The  judge  recorded  the
       case advanced by the appellant at paragraph [22] of the decision.  At
       paragraph [24], the judge stated:


             "... I am not satisfied that the appellant can establish  that
             she has 10 years lawful residence in  the  United  Kingdom  in
             part accrued by 3C leave. The appellant is effectively  saying
             that after the refusal of her application on 11  October  2017
             that her leave from that date until she  submitted  a  further
             application on 25 October 2017 was again extended by 3C  leave
             and thus she relies on paragraph  39E.  However  I  find  that
             paragraph 39E does not apply to the applicant or  her  husband
             as 3C leave cannot be used to grant a further extension of  3C
             which is effectively what the appellant is arguing,"

    6. At paragraphs [26] and [27], the judge said:


             "26. The appellant would need to establish that she can  avail
             herself of section 3C leave in order to  rely  upon  paragraph
             39E and I find as stated by  the  respondent  in  the  refusal
             letter that her 3C leave came to an end on the 11 October 2017
             and could not extend beyond this period as she  had  not  been
             granted any in country right of appeal and that she had no  3C
             leave when she made her further application on 25 October 2017
             outside the immigration rules which was subsequently varied on
             31 January 2018 and refused on 11 January 2019...

             27.  I find that the appellant cannot satisfy the requirements
             of the immigration rules for the grant of leave  based  on  10
             years  lawful  residence  as  her  lawful  leave  expired   on
             11/10/2017 at which date she had been in  the  United  Kingdom
             nine years and three months.

    7. Having concluded the appellants cannot satisfy  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 276B of the immigration rules,  the  judge  considered  the
       Article 8 claim by reference to the requirements set out in  Appendix
       FM and paragraph 276ADE of the immigration rules.   The  judge  found
       that neither of the appellants are  British  citizens  and  that  the
       appellants and their child, who was born in the UK in 2017,  are  all
       nationals of India.  The  judge  found  the  appellants  have  strong
       family and cultural links  to  India  where  they  both  spent  their
       formative years, were educated, and  where  they  both  worked.   The
       judge referred to the public interest considerations set out in s117B
       of the 2002 Act and dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds.


The appeal before me


    8. The appellants claim the application made on 25th  October  2017  was
       made within  14  days  of  the  respondent  refusing  their  previous
       application on 11th October 2017, and they are therefore entitled  to
       rely upon paragraph 39E of the immigration rules.  It  is  said  that
       paragraph 39E(2) operates such that the first appellant's application
       was in-time and she should not be considered  to  be  an  overstayer.
       The appellants also claim the judge failed to  apply  the  principles
       set out in the authorities relevant to a consideration of the Article
       8 claim and taking into account the evidence before the Tribunal, the
       judge should have allowed the Article 8 appeal.


    9. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Povey
       on 28th of November 2019. In doing so, he considered it arguable that
       the judge failed to consider whether the appellants were able to rely
       upon paragraph 39E(2)(b)(i) of the immigration rules  such  that  any
       period of overstaying from 11 October 2017 to  25  October  2017  was
       disregarded, when calculating  whether  they  had  accrued  10  years
       continuous lawful residence as required  by  paragraph  276B  of  the
       immigration rules.


   10. At the hearing before me, Ms  Benitez,  acknowledged  the  difficulty
       that the grounds of appeal present, in light of the decision  of  the
       Court of Appeal in Ahmed -v- SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1070,  handed  down
       on 21st June 2019, but which did not feature in the decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal judge or the Grounds of Appeal.  She, rightly  in
       my judgement,  acknowledges  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that
       paragraph 276B(v) of the immigration rules does not operate so as  to
       cure short "gaps" between periods of lawful temporary residence which
       would entitle persons to claim "10 years continuous lawful residence"
       under paragraph 276B(i)(a).


   11. Ms Benitez submits that in reaching  a  decision  on  the  Article  8
       appeal, the judge failed to consider the  fact  that  the  appellants
       regulated their conduct because they understood, at  the  time,  that
       the 14 days between 11th October 2017 and 25th October 2017 would  be
       disregarded, and that  was  relevant  to  the  consideration  of  the
       application  outside  the  immigration  rules  and  was  capable   of
       amounting to an 'exceptional  circumstance'.   She  referred  to  the
       respondent's 'Long residence'  Guidance  (version  15.0);  3rd  April
       2017, which  states  at  page  19  of  43;  "Where  an  out  of  time
       application is submitted on or after 24  November  2016,  you  should
       must consider whether to exercise discretion in line  with  paragraph
       39E of the immigration rules.  This must be authorised  by  a  senior
       caseworker at senior executive officer (SEA) grade....".  She submits
       that here, the application was made within 14 days  of  11th  October
       2017 and a short single gap should not lead to a refusal.  That was a
       relevant  factor  that  should  have  been  considered  but  was  not
       considered by the judge.


   12. Mr Singh relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ahmed -v-
       SSHD and submits the decision of the judge that the appellant  cannot
       satisfy the requirements of the  immigration  rules  because  she  is
       unable to establish 10 years continuous lawful residence in  the  UK,
       is one that was open to the Judge on the  evidence.  He  submits  the
       claim now advanced that the appellant had relied upon the matters set
       out in the 'Long Residence' guidance in conducting their affairs, was
       not a claim advanced before the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  the  Upper
       Tribunal previously.


Discussion


   13. The only ground of appeal available to the appellants  was  that  the
       respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of the  Human  Rights  Act
       1998.  The appellant's ability to satisfy the immigration  rules  was
       therefore not the question to be determined by the Tribunal, but  was
       capable of being a weighty, though  not  determinative  factor,  when
       deciding whether the refusal of the application for indefinite  leave
       to remain  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  enforcing
       immigration control.


   14. Paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the immigration rules requires  an  applicant
       to establish they have  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
       residence in the United Kingdom. Paragraph 276A(a) of the immigration
       rules provides that "continuous residence" means residence in the  UK
       for an unbroken period. The rule sets out a number  of  circumstances
       in which a period shall  not  be  considered  to  have  been  broken.
       Paragraph 276A(b) provides that "lawful  residence"  means  residence
       which is continuous residence pursuant to, inter alia, existing leave
       to enter or remain.


   15.  The core issue in the appeal was whether the appellant  can  satisfy
       the requirement in paragraph 276B of the immigration rules  that  she
       has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK.


   16. Paragraph 276B(v) of the rules provides that the applicant  must  not
       be in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws,  except  that,  where
       paragraph 39E of the rules applies, any current period of overstaying
       will  be  disregarded.  That  is  not  to  say  that  the  period  of
       overstaying is to be treated as a period of  lawful  residence.   The
       rules simply makes provision for a short period of overstaying to  be
       disregarded. An individual that has 'overstayed' in the UK cannot  in
       my  judgment  be  regarded  as  an  individual  that  is   exercising
       continuous lawful residence in the UK, whilst he or  she  remains  in
       the UK as an 'overstayer'.


   17. In Ahmed -v- SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1070, Lord Justice Floyd  and  Lord
       Justice  Haddon-Cave  confirmed  that  paragraph   276B(v)   of   the
       immigration rules does not operate so as to cure short "gaps" between
       periods of lawful temporary residence which would entitle persons  to
       claim "10 years continuous lawful residence"  under  para.276B(i)(a).
       On any proper view of the  chronology,  the  first  appellant  cannot
       establish at least 10 years continuous lawful residence  in  the  UK.
       There was a gap in the first appellant's lawful residence in  the  UK
       following the refusal of her  application,  made  on  28th  September
       2016, on 11th October 2017.


   18. The judge referred to paragraph 39E of the rules  at  paragraph  [23]
       and found, at [24], the first appellant has not established that  she
       has 10 years lawful  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  first
       appellant had continuous lawful residence between 8th July  2008  and
       11th October 2017.  She could not therefore in my  judgment,  satisfy
       the requirement of paragraph 276B(i)(a) the rules and it was open  to
       the judge to conclude, at [27]:


             "I find that the appellant cannot satisfy the requirements  of
             the immigration rules for the grant of leave based on 10 years
             lawful residence as her lawful leave expired on 11/10/2017  at
             which date she had been in the United Kingdom for  nine  years
             and three months."

   19. As the Court of Appeal said  in  Ahmed  -v-  SSHD,  at  [15(8)],  the
       respondent's 'Long residence' Guidance (version 15.0); 3rd April 2017
       does not  accord  with  the  true  construction  of  paragraph  276B,
       although it may reflect a policy adopted by the SSHD. However, it  is
       axiomatic that  the  intention  of  the  Rules  is  to  be  discerned
       "objectively  from  the  language  used"  not  from   e.g.   guidance
       documents.


   20. Having found that the requirements of the immigration rules cannot be
       met, the judge had regard to the length of time the  appellants  have
       spent in the UK and their ties to India. The judge was satisfied that
       the appellant and her husband have strong family  ties  and  cultural
       links to India where they both  spent  their  formative  lives,  were
       educated and where they both worked and have  close  family  members.
       There was evidence that the appellants have returned to  India  since
       their arrival in  the  UK.  The  judge  noted  the  family  would  be
       returning as a family unit to India and it is  clearly  in  the  best
       interests of their son that he remains in the care  of  his  parents.
       The judge noted the appellant's son is under three years of age.  The
       Judge found that both the appellants are well-educated, and the judge
       saw no reason why they cannot re-establish themselves in  India  with
       the support of their close family. The  judge  noted  the  appellants
       have developed their family and private life in the United Kingdom at
       a time when they knew that the development  and  continuance  of  the
       same was dependent upon meeting the requirements of  the  immigration
       rules. The judge had regard to the factors set out in  s117B  of  the
       2002 Act and dismissed the appeal on rights grounds.


   21. It was in my judgement open to the Judge to find, for the reasons set
       out at paragraphs [28] to [30] of the decision, that the  removal  of
       the appellants from the UK would not be in breach of Article 8 and to
       dismiss the appeal.


   22. It follows that in my  judgement,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge is not tainted by a material  error  of  law  and  the
       appeal before me is dismissed.
