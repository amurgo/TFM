Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr G Davison, Counsel
For the  Respondent:     Ms  J  Isherwood,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                       Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission to
      the respondent on 23 May 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chohan  in
      respect of the determination of Immigration Judge  Aujla  who  allowed
      these entry clearance appeals. The determination was promulgated on 21
      March 2014. For convenience, I continue to refer to the  applicant  as
      the appellant and to the ECO/Secretary of State as the respondent.  No
      order for anonymity was  made  by  the  Tribunal  and  none  has  been
      requested of the Upper Tribunal.

   2.       The appellants are Afghan nationals but born in Pakistan  on  12
      December 1990 and 4 October 2012 respectively.  They  are  mother  and
      daughter and seek to join the sponsor, Mohammad Sadiq,  husband/father
      of the appellants. The applications were refused because the financial
      requirements of the rules were not met.

   3.       The judge found that the sponsor's income fell some short of the
      required amount (by some �7000) and  that  the  appellants  could  not
      therefore succeed under Appendix FM. He was however persuaded to allow
      the appeals on Article 8 grounds, finding that "there were  compelling
      circumstances" (at paragraph 26).  The respondent has challenged  this
      decision and maintains that the  judge  did  not  explain  what  those
      circumstances were and that he failed to apply the guidance in Gulshan
      [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 Admin which endorsed
      the Secretary of  State's  guidance  on  the  meaning  of  exceptional
      circumstances,  namely  ones  where  refusals   would   lead   to   an
      unjustifiably harsh outcome. It is also argued that the  judge  failed
      to take the child into his calculations when assessing finances.

   4.       The appeal came before me on 23 July 2013. I  heard  submissions
      on whether or not the First-tier Tribunal Judge made  an  error  on  a
      point of law.

   5.       At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision which  I
      now give with reasons.

Findings and Reasons

   6.       The facts of the case are not in  dispute.  The  sponsor  is  an
      Afghan refugee who came to the UK in 2006. He has  a  travel  document
      issued on 6 November 2011 and has limited leave until 21 June 2016. He
      married the appellant in Pakistan on 1 January 2012 so this is a post-
      flight event. The marriage was arranged and they have one  child.  The
      sponsor has been self employed at an internet caf� since 6 April 2012.
      The appellants were required to show that  his  income  was  at  least
      �22,400 per annum for the last financial year or as an average for two
      financial years. As no evidence of income was  shown  prior  to  April
      2012, the applications, which were made  on  22  November  2012,  were
      refused on 20 February 2013.

   7.       It is conceded by the  appellants  that  they  cannot  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules.
   8.       The relevant date for consideration is, as the judge noted,  the
      date of decision for both the immigration and the Article 8 claims.

   9.       The respondent's case is that the judge failed to  identify  any
      exceptional circumstances which would support  his  decision  to  find
      that Article 8 was engaged and that a grant of entry clearance outside
      the rules was appropriate. Ms Isherwood pointed to the  findings  made
      at paragraph 26 and submitted that the facts  of  this  case  did  not
      amount to anything compelling and that it was open to  the  appellants
      to make a fresh entry clearance application when the sponsor's  income
      met the required sum. Mr Davison, for the appellants, argued  that  it
      was for the judge to decide what factors were compelling and that  the
      respondent's challenge was simply a disagreement with the  outcome  of
      the appeal.

  10.       At paragraph 26, the judge sets out what he considers to be  the
      exceptional circumstances not covered by the rules. These are:
         . The sponsor is a recognised refugee
         . He had lived in the UK for five years  prior  to  the  grant  of
           status
         . He had done well in his business
         . He earned an income of around �13,400
         . He had a child.

  11.       In paragraph 24 the judge expressed the view  that  he  did  not
      consider it reasonable to expect the sponsor to put his family life on
      hold  indefinitely  "in  his  particular  circumstances".   The   only
      circumstances referred to in that paragraph are:
         . The sponsor arrived here in 2006 and was recognised as a refugee
           in November 2011
         . He got married two months after he was granted status
         . He set up a business five months after he was granted status.


  12.       I take account of Mr Davison's submission that  this  judge  has
      "been around" for some time but nevertheless  I  cannot  see  how  the
      factors identified above are exceptional. The fact that the sponsor is
      a refugee is of no relevance because  his  marriage  took  place  post
      flight and indeed was  arranged  after  he  obtained  his  status.  He
      married in Pakistan and has visited his wife once since  the  marriage
      and so can continue to do so in the future.  The  setting  up  of  his
      business is nothing out of the ordinary; financial  circumstances  are
      covered by the rules. It is unclear why the timing of the business  is
      of relevance or indeed why the  timing  of  the  grant  of  status  is
      important. The sponsor has a child but so do  many  other  individuals
      who make such applications.

  13.       Ms Isherwood is quite right to point out that the  judge  failed
      entirely to consider the remedy to the appellants of  making  a  fresh
      entry clearance application once the financial conditions of the rules
      were met. On the judge's own findings, that  the  business  was  doing
      well, there appears to be no reason why such a course of action cannot
      be followed. This is not  a  case  where,  as  the  judge  found,  the
      sponsor's family life, of short duration anyway, would be put on  hold
      "indefinitely".

  14.       For these reasons, I conclude that the judge erred in law.  This
      is not a disagreement with the decision on the part of the respondent;
      it is a valid challenge to what is an inadequately reasoned  decision.
      It is open to a judge to give succinct reasons but  they  have  to  be
      substantial enough for the losing party to understand why  the  appeal
      was  lost.  The  reasoning  in  the  concluding  paragraphs   of   the
      determination does not make that clear by any means. The  decision  as
      far as it pertains to Article 8, is set aside.

  15.       With regard to disposal, Ms Isherwood asked that I  re-make  the
      decision and dismiss the appeals. Mr Davison initially agreed  that  I
      could re-make the decision as the evidence had already  all  been  set
      out but on instruction  from  the  solicitor  then  sought  a  further
      hearing for up to date oral  evidence  on  visits  to  be  called.  Ms
      Isherwood objected on the  basis  that  such  evidence  would  not  be
      relevant as the date for consideration of the evidence was the date of
      the decision.  Mr Davison did not respond.

  16.       I have considered whether there would be any purpose  served  by
      adjourning this to another hearing but I cannot see that there  would,
      given that the evidence has been put forward and the issue  is  simply
      an application of the law to the undisputed facts.

  17.       I have considered the circumstances of the  appellants  and  the
      sponsor. I  appreciate  that  they  want  to  live  together  but  the
      requirements of the Immigration  Rules  have  not  been  met.  I  have
      considered the guidance in Gulshan (Article 8 - new  rules  -  correct
      approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC). Nothing exceptional has been
      put forward to justify a grant of leave outside the rules. This  is  a
      run of the mill situation where the financial  requirements  have  not
      been met (by a considerable margin) and where a family  are  therefore
      kept apart. There is nothing to suggest that the refusal has  resulted
      in such unjustifiably harsh circumstances as to  render  the  decision
      disproportionate. The appellants and  sponsor  have  been  meeting  in
      Pakistan (as is set out in the  visa  application  form).  It  is  not
      suggested they cannot continue to do so until the requirements can  be
      met or the circumstances change. The appellants of  course  also  have
      the option of making fresh entry clearance applications. Now that  the
      sponsor's business has had more time to establish itself,  it  may  be
      that the financial requirements can be met.






Decision

  18.       The First-tier Tribunal made errors  of  law  which  render  the
      determination unsustainable.

  19.       I remake the decision and dismiss the appeals on all grounds.
