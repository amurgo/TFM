Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M. Fazli, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was born on 1 January
         1994. He is now 25 years old  but  he  remained  a  minor  until  1
         January 2012, a circumstance which is material in this  appeal.  He
         appeals against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Onoufriou promulgated on 1 April 2019 in  which  he  dismissed  the
         appellant's appeal on all grounds.

      2. Both the Reasons for Refusal Letter and the Determination  suffered
         from having to deal with a multitude of issues,  including  asylum,
         humanitarian protection and human rights. Before me,  however,  the
         grounds argued were much more limited in scope and  correspondingly
         easier to deal with. In essence, the appeal before  me  focused  on
         whether  the  appellant  benefited  from  at  least  six  years  of
         Discretionary Leave entitling him to indefinite leave to remain.

      3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 3 December  2008,  aged
         14, and claimed asylum about a week later. This was refused but, on
         20 May 2009, he was granted discretionary leave as a minor until  1
         July 2011. By then, it was anticipated that he would have been 17 �
         years old.

      4. On 1 January 2012, the appellant ceased to be a minor.

      5. On 30 April 2013,  solicitors  acting  on  the  appellant's  behalf
         applied for further leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.  It  is
         clear from the foregoing that, when this application was made,  the
         appellant had ceased to be a minor and that his leave  had  expired
         on 1 July 2011, some 22 months before.

      6. The nub of this appeal centres upon  decision-making  made  by  the
         Secretary of State in 2014.

      7. In a letter dated 21 August 2014 [Bundle B, 86],  the  Home  Office
         wrote to the appellant acknowledging  the  grant  of  Discretionary
         Leave had been granted to the  appellant  in  accordance  with  its
         policy on Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children.  The  letter  also
         noted that the appellant's prior leave had expired on 1  July  2011
         and that the application for further leave was  made  on  30  April
         2013, namely well out of time. Nevertheless, the letter continued:

             'Whilst your application for further to leave to remain in the
             United Kingdom is pending, please be  assured  that  all  your
             rights and entitlements under the  terms  of  your  previously
             awarded Discretionary Leave To remain will continue and remain
             the same until your application has been considered.'

      8. No reference is made to the application being out of time or to the
         fact that the appellant had reached his majority on 1 January 2012.
         It would, of course, has been open to the  Secretary  of  State  to
         treat  the  application  as  being  out  of  time  and  dealt  with
         accordingly. However, it is clear that the Secretary of  State  did
         not do this. Instead, the status  quo  during  the  period  of  his
         Discretionary Leave was perpetuated. The  rights  and  entitlements
         remained unaltered.

      9. The Secretary of State made no alteration in this position when the
         decision was made on 2 December 2014 [B72-85]. Indeed, the decision-
         maker explained why it had been done. Paragraph 24 of the  decision
         letter [B74] provides:

             'At that time you were still a minor under instruction of your
             legal representatives. It appears they failed  to  inform  you
             that  a  [Discretionary  Leave]  application  needed   to   be
             submitted and you did not  do  this  until  you  sought  legal
             advice from RAMFEL. This suggests that you were not  at  fault
             for  the  late  submission  of   the   [Discretionary   Leave]
             application and it would be unfair to disadvantage you due  to
             this. Therefore your application  will  be  considered  as  in
             time.'

     10. The application of 30 April 2013 was  made  principally  on  asylum
         grounds with an alternative claim for humanitarian protection based
         upon the same facts. The associated human  rights  claim  based  on
         Article 8 relied upon little more than the appellant's presence  in
         the United Kingdom  and  had  no  prospect  of  succeeding  without
         establishing the appellant was at risk on return.

     11. The application was refused in December 2014 but an appeal was made
         in time and  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Khawar  who
         properly dismissed it following a hearing on 10  April  2015.   The
         determination  was  promulgated  on  22  May  2015.  The  date   is
         important, although coincidental.  On  20  May  2015  (or  adopting
         another method of calculation, 22 May 2015) the appellant had spent
         six years in the United Kingdom following  the  original  grant  of
         Discretionary Leave on 20 May 2009.  The  appellant  became  appeal
         rights exhausted on 9 July 2015.

     12. Since then, the appellant has had no further leave to remain.

     13. The issue in the current appeal turns upon  whether  the  appellant
         meets the requirements of the policy which provides for a holder of
         discretionary leave to qualify for indefinite leave to remain.  The
         respondent's policy found in the API on Discretionary Leave  of  18
         August 2015 provides that those who had been granted  Discretionary
         Leave before 9  July  2012,  will  become  eligible  to  apply  for
         settlement after accruing six years continuous Discretionary Leave.
         Although subject to exceptions,  none  is  said  to  apply  in  the
         circumstances of this case. The application has to be made no  more
         than 28 days before discretionary leave expires.

     14. The  resolution  of  this  issue  turns  upon  the  nature  of  the
         appellant's leave after the express grant  of  discretionary  leave
         expired on 1 July 2011.  Had the application made on 30 April  2013
         been made prior to 1 July 2011, the subsequent consideration of the
         application and the appeal that  followed  would  undoubtedly  have
         extended the period of Discretionary Leave by operation of s.3C  of
         the  Immigration  Act  1971,  effectively  preventing  a   claimant
         becoming an overstayer (but also legitimising his presence)  during
         the  period  during  which   a   further   application   is   under
         consideration, including an associated appeal.

     15. Hence, it is to s.3C that I now turn:

         'Continuation of leave pending variation decision

         (1)      This section applies if-

             (a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain  in  the
             United Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State for variation
             of the leave

             (b) the application for variation is  made  before  the  leave
             expires, and

             (c) the leave expires without the  application  for  variation
             having been decided.

         (2)      The leave is extended by virtue of this section during any
         period when-

             (a) the application  for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
             withdrawn,

             (b) an appeal under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Asylum
             and Immigration Act 2002 could be brought, while the appellant
             is  in  the  United  Kingdom  against  the  decision  on   the
             application for variation  (ignoring  any  possibility  of  an
             appeal out of time with permission), ...

             (c) an  appeal  under  that  section  against  that  decision,
             brought while the appellant  is  in  the  United  Kingdom, is
             pending (within the meaning of section 104 of that Act).

         (4)      A person may not make an application for variation of  his
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave  is
         extended by virtue of this section.'

     16. I have set out both subsections (1) and (2).  They  serve  distinct
         functions. Subsection  (1)  provides  the  circumstances  in  which
         continuation leave will operate. Subsection  (2)  provides  how  it
         will operate. Although various submissions were made in relation to
         subsection (2), this is not the material provision.  The  issue  is
         whether continuation leave operated at all and this is to be  found
         in subsection (1) and, in particular, whether the application  made
         by the appellant on  16  March  2016  was  made  before  his  leave
         expired.  In short, Mr Lindsay on behalf of the Secretary of  State
         submitted that the  appellant's  leave  expired  on  1  July  2011.
         Thereafter,  no  further  leave  was  granted  to  the   appellant.
         Accordingly, he never had the benefit of any continuation leave  or
         any other sort of leave.

     17. In doing so, Mr Lindsay does not seek to say that the  two  letters
         of August and December 2014 were not sent; merely that they did not
         have the effect of granting the appellant further leave.

     18. The two letters can be seen as part of the same  argument.  'Whilst
         your application for further leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
         is pending, please be assured that all your rights and entitlements
         under the terms of your previously awarded Discretionary  Leave  to
         Remain will continue and remain the same until your application has
         been considered.' This letter speaks from 21 August 2014,  slightly
         more than three years after  the  express  grant  of  discretionary
         leave  had  expired  in  July  2011.  Since  it  referred  to   the
         application  made  on  30  April  2013  and  spoke  of  rights  and
         entitlements continuing whilst the application is pending, it  must
         at least refer back to the date of application on 30 April 2013. It
         does not, however, expressly deal with the period 1 July 2011 to 30
         April 2013.

     19. Notwithstanding this, it would be illogical to acknowledge a period
         of Discretionary Leave until 1 July 2011 and to acknowledge, as the
         letter does, an assurance  that  all  the  appellant's  rights  and
         entitlements under the terms of his  previous  Discretionary  Leave
         will remain until the 2013 application is decided.

     20. Further, since the application made on 30 April 2013 was an  asylum
         claim, the practical effect was to permit the appellant  to  remain
         pending consideration  of  the  claim  without  the  need  for  the
         Secretary of State to acknowledge that his Discretionary Leave  (or
         the rights and entitlements  associated  with  it)  would  continue
         until the claim is considered and/or determined.   An asylum  claim
         does not require the claimant to be granted  interim  Discretionary
         Leave.

     21. The fact that an express grant of leave was made in favour  of  the
         appellant is not disputed in the decision made on 2 December  2014.
         As I have set out above, paragraph 24 acknowledges that, during  at
         least part of the relevant period, the appellant remained  a  minor
         and that his solicitors failed in their  duty  towards  him,  as  a
         minor, to pursue his interests. An express acknowledgement is  made
         that  this  suggested  no-fault  on  the  part  of  the  appellant.
         Importantly, the respondent  resolved  the  issue  of  fairness  in
         favour of the appellant by stating  that  it  would  be  unfair  to
         disadvantage him in such circumstances.  It  concludes:  'therefore
         your application will be considered as in time '.

     22.  An  application  made  in  time  operates,  in   accordance   with
         s.3C(1)(b), as the means of entitling the appellant to continuation
         leave. Continuation leave is not a separate category or  specie  of
         leave. Instead, it continues the pre-existing leave which,  in  the
         circumstances of  this  case,  was  Discretionary  Leave.  Had  the
         appellant made the application in time he would have  continued  to
         enjoy Discretionary Leave not a  different  type  of  leave  called
         Continuation  Leave.  The  Secretary  of  State  was  treating  the
         appellant as having the same benefits as would have accrued to  the
         appellant had  the  application  been  made  in  time.  It  is  not
         important to decide whether this was a grant of Discretionary Leave
         continued until the  application  was  made  in  April  2013  or  a
         concession that the application in fact made in April 2013  was  to
         be treated for all purposes as having been made before 1 July 2011.
         Since it was open  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  her
         discretion to grant further leave, either alternative was a  lawful
         operation of the respondent's powers.

     23. On this basis, it cannot reasonably be said that the appellant  was
         deprived of a continuing period because  the  application  was  not
         made before the leave expired.

     24. Mr Lindsay submitted that the statutory words of s3C could  not  be
         overridden and the application had to  be  made  before  leave  had
         expired and no decision-maker within the Home Office could derogate
         from the plain words of the subsection. However,  for  the  reasons
         that I have given, the respondent in the two letters  quoted  above
         was extending the period of discretionary leave, as  the  Secretary
         of State is entitled to do so as to provide the appellant  with  an
         unbroken period of leave,  the  absence  of  which  the  respondent
         expressly acknowledged to unfairly disadvantage the appellant.

     25. Mr Lindsay also submitted that the expression in  the  August  2014
         letter that the appellant continue to benefit from 'all your rights
         and  entitlements  under  the  terms  of  your  previously  awarded
         Discretionary leave to Remain will continue in remain the same' was
         confined to the  rights  and  benefits  (which  he  was  unable  to
         identify) attached to discretionary leave, such  as  the  right  to
         work or to claim benefits. The expression did  not,  he  submitted,
         extend Discretionary Leave itself. I do not consider there  is  any
         warrant in the words used in this letter to distinguish between the
         associated rights provided to a holder of Discretionary  Leave  and
         Discretionary Leave itself. If,  using  discretionary  powers,  the
         appellant  was  being  granted  a  right  to  remain  pending   the
         consideration  of   his   application,   he   was   being   granted
         Discretionary Leave. It is not possible for the appellant  to  have
         been granted Discretionary Leave for  some  purposes  but  not  for
         others.

     26. Furthermore, for the reasons advanced by the appellant's solicitors
         in their submissions to the Secretary of State and for the  reasons
         provided by the respondent in the decision of December  2014,  this
         was a proper  exercise  of  discretion.  The  vulnerability  of  an
         appellant would always be a fitting reason  why  the  Secretary  of
         State will overlook procedural failings,  including  a  failure  to
         comply with time limits. Indeed, in  the  case  of  a  minor,  such
         failings are likely to be viewed as  a  suitable  subject  for  the
         exercise of discretion. The respondent himself pinpointed  this  by
         using the expression 'unfair to disadvantage '. It may be that  the
         Secretary of State  took  an  overly  indulgent  view  because  the
         appellant reached his  majority  in  January  2012  and  the  delay
         continued after this date. The  fact  remains,  however,  that  the
         decision-maker undoubtedly exercised his or her discretion  and  it
         is immaterial if the result might have been different.

     27. I  acknowledge  that  in  most  circumstances  errors  made  by  an
         appellant's legal representatives will not operate by affording the
         appellant with a stronger form of protected private or family  life
         than he would otherwise have. By parity of reasoning, this probably
         applies in other circumstances. See Mansur  (Immigration  adviser's
         failings:  Article  8)  Bangladesh  [2018]  UKUT  274  (IAC).   The
         principle in Mansur does not apply in  the  circumstances  of  this
         case. It is not the Tribunal who is being asked  to  adopt  a  more
         lenient approach arising from failings of  the  appellant's  former
         solicitors. Rather, it was the Secretary of State was  being  asked
         to adopt a more lenient approach and, as he  was  entitled  to  do,
         doing so.

     28. This leaves only to deal with how this principle comes  before  the
         Upper  Tribunal  as  an  error  of  law.   First,   notwithstanding
         submissions made about the application of s. 3C to the Secretary of
         State, the decision-maker did not address them properly. The  issue
         was dealt with summarily in paragraphs 9 to 11 of the Secretary  of
         State's decision letter of 29 January 2019. In  paragraph  10,  the
         writer acknowledges the appellant was granted  Discretionary  Leave
         as a minor until 1 July 2011 but  then  simply  recorded  that  the
         application for further Discretionary Leave was made  on  30  April
         2013 and was out of time, thereby depriving the  appellant  of  the
         eligibility to rely upon s. 3C leave. In paragraph 11,  the  writer
         asserts that full consideration was given to the appellant's  claim
         when the application was  refused  on  2  December  2014  and  this
         decision was upheld by the Immigration Judge dismissing the  appeal
         on 22 May 2015. This misunderstands the  nature  of  those  earlier
         proceedings. They were not then a claim  for  indefinite  leave  to
         remain based upon six years continuous Discretionary Leave. Indeed,
         as a matter of fact, the period of six years had not  then  elapsed
         at the date of the hearing and it is apparent that the parties were
         then oblivious to its  impending  significance.  Consequently,  the
         decision letter did not address the crucial issue  of  whether  the
         respondent's letters of August and December 2014 were sufficient to
         extend the appellant's Discretionary Leave.

     29. In the determination, the First-tier Tribunal Judge approaches  the
         issue in a different way. He stated in paragraph 37:

             "The simple  fact  is  that  had  the  appellant  renewed  his
             Discretionary Leave on 1 July 2011, he may have  been  granted
             up to a further three  years  Discretionary  Leave  under  the
             respondent's policy until 1 July 2014 and therefore would have
             accrued at that time  just  over  five  years  and  one  month
             continuous Discretionary Leave. On 1 July 2014  the  appellant
             would have been aged 20 � years.   He  would  accordingly  not
             have been entitled to a further extension of his Discretionary
             Leave because it was originally based solely on the fact  that
             he  was  an  unaccompanied  minor.   Section   10.1   of   the
             respondent's policy clearly states that an applicant will only
             continue to be dealt with under  the  respondent's  policy  if
             they qualify for further leave on  the  same  basis  as  their
             original  Discretionary  Leave.  Clearly,  at  age   20,   the
             appellant could not possibly be  granted  Discretionary  Leave
             based on the fact that he was a minor and therefore he  simply
             does not satisfy the requirements of the respondent's  policy.
             Accordingly, the respondent was  not  acting  unreasonably  in
             failing to grant him further Discretionary Leave. Furthermore,
             as the appellant was aged 17 � at the  date  of  his  original
             Discretionary Leave, it  is  highly  unlikely  the  respondent
             would  have  exercised  its  discretion   to   grant   further
             Discretionary Leave on 1 July 2011.  It  is  not  usually  the
             respondent's practice to  grant  Discretionary  Leave  when  a
             minor is about to reach the age of  18  and  therefore  become
             liable to removal. The appellant's s. 3C leave claim  was  not
             sustainable in law  or  within  the  respondent's  policy  and
             therefore  does  not  engage  Article  8  in   this   respect.
             Accordingly, I do not consider that  headnote  (4)  of  Mansur
             applies to the appellant."

     30. This process of reasoning is based upon what might have happened if
         an application had been made in  2011  and  what  the  consequences
         might have been if a further happen application had  been  made  in
         July 2014. It may well be that the consequences identified  by  the
         Judge were reasonable ones. Nevertheless, they  are  based  upon  a
         series of hypotheses.  Unfortunately,  they  do  not  address  what
         actually happened. In particular, they do not  address  whether  in
         the circumstances that I  have  I  outlined  above,  the  appellant
         enjoyed a period of Discretionary Leave which exceeded  six  years.
         This, in turn, required the Judge to construe  the  effect  of  the
         respondent's letters of August and December 2014  which  the  Judge
         did not do.

     31. This amounts to a material error on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. I set aside the decision. I have already stated  why  the
         appellant had the benefit of a grant of Discretionary Leave  for  a
         period  that  exceeded  six  years.  Consequently,  I  re-make  the
         decision  allowing  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  he  met  the
         requirements of the policy under  which  Discretionary  Leave  will
         lead to the grant of indefinite leave to remain.

     32. This decision renders the other grounds of  appeal  immaterial.  No
         oral argument was addressed to me  that  the  Judge  erred  in  his
         treatment of the asylum claim or its associated  Article  8  claim.
         Suffice it to say that, had the appellant been unsuccessful in  his
         claim to meet the requirements for indefinite leave to remain,  his
         presence in the United Kingdom as  an  overstayer  would  not  have
         engaged Article 8.
