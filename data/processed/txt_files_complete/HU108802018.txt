Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms I Hussain of Counsel instructed on a direct
access basis
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh.  He is currently residing in
    France pursuant to a residence permit granted there.  There is an issue
    as to his date of birth but he claims in  his  current  application  to
    have been born on 5 September 1990.  He previously came to the UK on 23
    January 2011 as a Tier 4  Student.   The  passport  submitted  on  that
    occasion had the date of birth of 5 September 1992.   This  application
    was refused and the Appellant subsequently left the UK.

 2. On 14 December 2017 the Appellant made an application to enter  the  UK
    as the spouse of Ms Nasima Akhtar, the Sponsor.  This  application  was
    refused in a decision dated 25  April  2018.   The  Appellant  appealed
    against this decision and his appeal came before Judge NMK Lawrence  of
    the First-tier Tribunal for hearing on 5 April 2019.  In a decision and
    reasons promulgated on 17 April 2019, the judge dismissed the appeal on
    a number of bases, but in particular finding at [11] that the Appellant
    had attempted to hide the fact that he had used the passport previously
    in his 2011 application with  a  different  date  of  birth,  which  he
    considered was a deliberate decision to deceive.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought out of time.  However  a  decision  was
    made to extend time on the basis that the judge's decision and  reasons
    were sent to  his  previous  solicitors  and  that  he  was  no  longer
    represented by them.

 4. The grounds in support of the  application  for  permission  to  appeal
    asserted that the judge had erred materially in law in respect of:

      (i) his finding at [11] and his findings relating to  the  Appellant's
           identity pursuant to paragraph 320(3) of the Immigration Rules;

      (ii)    secondly, that the judge erred in  considering  whether  there
           were sufficiently aggravating circumstances  so  as  to  justify
           refusing to exercise discretion pursuant to paragraph 320(11) of
           the Rules. Reference was made to the judgment in  PS  (paragraph
           320(11) discretion care needed) India [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC);

      (iii)   thirdly, the judge erred in finding that it was a  requirement
           that the Appellant showed that the French  authorities  accepted
           his current claimed date of birth;

      (iv)    fourthly that the judge erred in finding that the Sponsor  was
           required to demonstrate family life could be  re-established  in
           France where the Appellant has limited leave;

      (v) fifthly, that the judge erred in finding that the Sponsor was  not
           a creditworthy witness at [17] and in  failing  to  balance  his
           finding with the fact that the Sponsor had reported her previous
           first husband to the immigration authorities  due  to  the  fact
           that he was residing illegally in the UK, and

      (vi)    sixthly the judge erred in his assessment of proportionality.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam in a
    decision dated 25  July  2019  with  reference  to  grounds  1  and  5.
    Permission however was granted on all grounds.

     Hearing

 6. At the outset of the hearing before the Upper  Tribunal,  Mr  Mills  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, accepted that the  grounds  disclosed
    that the judge had made a material error of law in that  it  was  clear
    from the judge's finding at [11] that he had proceeded on the basis  of
    a factual error, finding that the Appellant had attempted to  hide  the
    fact that he had used the previous passport, whereas it was clear  from
    section 99 on the Visa Application Form, part 8 additional information,
    that the Appellant had explained this stating:

         "The current passport is my first passport.  The passport  used  to
         enter the UK was arranged by agent  and  was  retained  at  the  UK
         Immigration on arrival and was not returned to me.  I did not  keep
         a copy hence I am unable to provide details.  My date of  birth  on
         the first passport is recorded as 5th September 1992.  This is  not
         my date of birth, the correct date of birth is 5th September 1990."



 7. Mr Mills accepted on that basis that the judge  had  clearly  erred  in
    failing to take that material admission into account.  The parties were
    agreed that the appropriate course of action would  be  a  remittal  de
    novo to the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham

     Findings and Reasons

 8. In light of Mr Mills' helpful  concession,  which  I  accept  as  being
    properly made, I find that the judge materially erred in law in finding
    against the Appellant at [11] in that it is clear from his  application
    form that the Appellant expressly acknowledged that he  had  previously
    used a different passport with a different date of birth and there  was
    thus no deliberate decision to deceive.  That finding goes to the heart
    of the judge's assessment of the claim, thus I set the Judge's decision
    and reasons aside and remit the appeal for a hearing de novo before the
    First tier Tribunal. I make the following directions:

                              _________________

                                 DIRECTIONS

                              _________________

    (i)  The case should be  listed  for  two  hours.   No  interpreter  is
    required.

    (ii) Any further evidence upon which the parties wish to rely should be
    submitted five working days  before  the  hearing  to  the  First  tier
    Tribunal and the other party.



No anonymity direction is made.
