Representation:
For the SSHD: Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For [AT]:     Mr J Howard, Fountains Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Neither party is content with the decision  and  reasons  statement  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Raikes that was promulgated on 24 July  2015.



 2. Each party applied and was granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The SSHD was granted such permission on 18  August  2015  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge.   [AT]  was  granted  permission  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 10 September 2015.

 3. Both sets of  grounds  of  appeal  challenge  Judge  Raikes's  decision
    regarding humanitarian protection.  In summary, the  SSHD  argues  that
    the judge could not have found that the appellant faced a real risk  of
    serious harm if  returned  to  Iraq  and  that  her  finding  that  the
    appellant benefited from article 15(c) of the  Qualification  Directive
    (2004/83/EC) was not open to her on the evidence  provided  because  an
    internal flight option was  available.   [AT]  argues  that  the  judge
    should have found that  he  was  a  refugee  because  when  making  her
    findings she identified a nexus between the risk of harm facing him  on
    return and a refugee convention reason.

 4. I begin by considering the  SSHD's  argument.   The  SSHD  accepted  at
    paragraph 33 of the reasons for refusal letter that the appellant could
    not return to  his  home  area  (Mosul,  the  capital  of  the  Nineveh
    province) because the criteria of  article  15c  of  the  Qualification
    Directive were met in that contested area.  The  judge  confirmed  this
    remained the situation at the date of hearing (see [30]).   The  SSHD's
    argument is that it was not unduly harsh to expect [AT] to relocate  to
    Baghdad.

 5. In our discussions Mr Harrison acknowledged that Judge Raikes had found
    that the appellant had no one to turn to in Iraq (see [17] - [18])  and
    that this reduced the strength of the  SSHD's  argument.   Mr  Harrison
    realised that the presenting officer at the First-tier Tribunal hearing
    had not sought to cross-examine the appellant or  to  make  submissions
    relevant to the issue of  internal  flight.   Instead,  the  presenting
    officer's submissions had focused on [AT]'s lack of credibility and the
    hope that ISIS would fall and he would be able to return to Mosul.  The
    references in the submissions to the ability of  [AT]  to  relocate  to
    Baghdad were general and did not address the evidence he had given.

 6. Mr Harrison focused his submissions on the judge's findings relating to
    internal flight ([35] and [36]).  He argued that Judge Raikes had  made
    no clear finding that [AT] could not rely  on  financial  support  from
    relatives and this "loose end" undermined the conclusion.

 7. As I indicated at the hearing, I disagree.  The  decision  and  reasons
    statement is sufficiently clear to show that Judge  Raikes  found  [AT]
    would be without support in Baghdad or any other part of Iraq where  he
    might be able to avoid the  serious  harm  he  faced  in  Mosul.   This
    position has been clarified in the country guideline case, AA  (Article
    15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC) (see paragraph 204, which contains
    the head note, of which paragraphs 14 to 16 are  relevant).   As  such,
    not only was the decision open to Judge Raikes but her findings can  be
    seen to be consistent with binding country guidance  even  though  that
    was not available to her when she heard the appeal.

 8. Turning to [AT]'s arguments, Mr Howard took me to  [28]  and  [29]  and
    identified that Judge Raikes found that [AT] faced persecution in Mosul
    because of his Kurdish ethnicity.  Judge Raikes found  that  he  was  a
    Kurd and that Kurds were at increased risk of  harm  in  the  contested
    areas.  It has  long  been  held  that  persecution  on  the  basis  of
    ethnicity  falls  within  the  convention  reason  "race".   Mr  Howard
    submitted that as there was no internal flight  alternative,  the  fact
    the appellant might be at increased risk because of his ethnicity meant
    that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Iraq and not merely a
    real risk of serious harm in relation to article 15c.

 9. In response, Mr  Harrison  argued  (although  not  strongly)  that  the
    threshold in relation to article 15c was different to that in  relation
    to persecution.  It is well established in a variety of cases that this
    is not a viable argument.  The Court of Justice of the European  Union,
    the European Court of Human Rights and the House of Lords/Supreme Court
    have all found that the thresholds in relation to  refugee  protection,
    serious harm and article 3 ECHR are coterminous.  It is certainly  more
    difficult for a person to show that there is a  real  risk  of  serious
    harm within the meaning of article 15c that  other  provisions  of  the
    Qualification Directive because of the number of criteria that need  to
    be met but the actual threshold is the same.

10. I am satisfied that Mr Howard has identified that Judge Raikes found  a
    nexus between the serious harm facing the appellant and his  ethnicity.
    As such, [AT] must be entitled to protection as a refugee and for  this
    reason his appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  I find that  Judge
    Raikes erred in law in relation to finding that [AT] was not a  refugee
    and I remake the decision to find that he is a refugee.

11. Before concluding, I mention that although the appeal was subject to an
    anonymity direction below, there has been  no  request  for  it  to  be
    renewed in the Upper Tribunal and  I  find  no  reason  for  it  to  be
    continued.

Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

[AT]'s appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The  decision  and  reasons
statement of Judge Raikes contains and error of law and  is  set  aside.   I
remake the decision and find that [AT] is a refugee.
