                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Widdup, promulgated on 14th  November  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 3rd November 2014.  In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Md Abdur  Mohon.   The  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born  on  5th
    January 1982.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer dated 26th September 2013, refusing  his  application
    to join his wife, Mrs Lutfa Begum, whom he  married  in  Bangladesh  on
    12th April 2012, and who is a British citizen, the refusal being on the
    basis that the marriage was not genuine and  subsisting  and  that  Mrs
    Begum could not show that she earned at  least  �18,600  per  annum  as
    required by the Immigration Rules.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that his wife, Mrs  Lutfa  Begum,  earned  the
    requisite amount because she  worked  at  the  Sonali  Supermarket  and
    provided her pay slips.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge took the  view  that  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  were
    genuinely married  in  a  subsisting  relationship,  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities, (see paragraph 39), but there was  an  issue  about  the
    Appellant being able to satisfy the financial requirement test, because
    of the manner in which his sponsoring wife had been working in the  UK.



 5. The Appellant's wife was not being provided with holiday pay,  and  the
    judge held that, "I find the employer is, or may be, acting  unlawfully
    so far as this employment is concerned" (see paragraph 26)  given  that
    the Sponsor's evidence was that she worked several days each  month  on
    an overtime basis but did not get paid for it.

 6. The judge went on to hold that,

         "The best evidence of the annual wage is, I find, to  be  found  in
         the P60 for the year ending April 5th 2014.   That  shows  that  in
         2013/14 the Sponsor earned �17,280.  The P60 for the previous  year
         was also disclosed.  This showed gross earnings of �4,680 ..." (see
         paragraph 30).

 7. The judge went on to hold that, although the submissions made on behalf
    of the Appellant was  that  the  judge  should  "assess  the  Sponsor's
    earnings for the previous six months and then gross them up  to  arrive
    at an annualised figure" (paragraph 32),  the  judge's  view  was  that
    there had been created ,

         "....an artificial figure for annual income in that  it  disregards
         the realities of the Sponsor's gross  earnings.   In  contrast  the
         2014 P60 figure shows earnings which  appear  to  take  account  of
         holiday.  Putting it another way, the Appellant earned �17,280  for
         all 52 weeks during which time she had four weeks' holiday in order
         to visit Bangladesh" (paragraph 33).

 8. The judge reasoned that given that  the  Appellant's  wife,  Mrs  Lutfa
    Begum, had gone to Bangladesh for a four week period during  that  year
    of 52 weeks in 2014, the failure of the employer  to  pay  her  holiday
    wages, meant that she could not show that she was earning the requisite
    �18,600, but could only show that she was earning �17,280 over  the  52
    weeks.

 9. The appeal was dismissed on the basis that the financial test could not
    be satisfied.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge materially  misdirected
    himself in law in that he took Mrs Begum's period of gross income  from
    1st March to 13th April 2014, when the requirement of Appendix FM-SE is
    that the level of income  shown  in  the  pay  slips  that  had  to  be
    submitted was for a period of six months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application.  During those six months, the  Sponsor  had  not  been  to
    Bangladesh.  She had not taken unpaid leave of four months.  She  could
    show  that  that  figure  earned  during  that  six  month  period,  if
    multiplied in  the  appropriate  manner,  could  lead  to  the  �18,600
    threshold being crossed.

11. Permission to appeal was granted on 21st May 2014  on  the  basis  that
    this was arguable and that it was also arguable that it was open to the
    employer and employee to agree a level  of  income  that  was  just  in
    excess of the requisite �18,600, and this does not in itself mean  that
    the employment or payments are contrived.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 23rd October 2015, Mr Hasan submitted  that
    the judge ought to have taken the six month  period  of  earnings  into
    account.  He submitted that no issue was taken in  the  refusal  letter
    with the bank statement, or with the wage  slips,  or  with  any  other
    evidence that related to the six month period.  It was  wrong  for  the
    judge to simply look at the P60, which after  all  related  to  a  full
    year's annual salary, and to deduce from that that  the  Appellant  was
    only earning �17,280, and not the requisite �18,600.  This was wrong as
    a matter of law because Appendix FM-SE  only  required  a  six  months'
    period to be taken into account.  After all, the  judge  accepted  that
    the Sponsor was genuinely employed.

13. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that this was not the reason  why  the
    judge had dismissed the appeal because he had other concerns about  the
    terms of the employment because he held that, "this  employment,  while
    genuine in the sense that the Sponsor does work at Sonali, is contrived
    so that  her  annual  income  appears  to  exceed  the  minimum  income
    threshold" (paragraph 35).

14. In reply, Mr Hasan submitted that the judge may well have been entirely
    sympathetic to the plight of the sponsoring wife having  to  work  long
    hours only so as to be able to show that she earned �18,600, but  if  a
    criticism was to be made of unlawful employment, it was a criticism  to
    be made of the employer, and not the employee working in that capacity,
    because she had, after all, to work in order to show  that  she  earned
    the requisite �18,600, in order to be able to sponsor her husband  from
    Bangladesh.  This was why the judge granted permission and said that it
    was open for the parties to reach an arrangement to enable a sponsoring
    wife or spouse to demonstrate that, in a genuine  employment,  she  was
    indeed earning the requisite amount needed for the Immigration Rules.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did involve
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  Plainly, the judge was wrong to have regard  to  the  twelve
    month period for the purposes of the  Rules  at  Appendix  FM-SE.   The
    judge in terms states that, "the best evidence of the annual wage is, I
    find, to be found in the P60  for  the  year  ending  April  5th  2014"
    (paragraph 30).

16. In point of fact, as Mr Hasan pointed out, Appendix FM does not require
    submission of a P60, which plainly relates to a year's earnings.   That
    must be for good reason.  What is required, is evidence of six  months'
    earnings prior to the date of the application.

17. During this six month period, the Appellant was able to  show,  on  the
    basis of wage slips, (and if necessary on the basis  of  HMRC  records)
    that his sponsoring wife did earn an amount, six months  prior  to  the
    date of the application,  which  when  grossed  up  would  lead  to  an
    annualised figure of �18,600.

Remaking the Decision

18. I have remade the  decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    Immigration Judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that  I
    have heard today.  For the reasons I have already  given  above,  I  am
    allowing this appeal.  The Appellant took a four weeks' unpaid  holiday
    during the twelve month period prior to the date  of  the  application,
    but did not do so during the six month period prior to the date of  the
    application, which if properly considered, showed that her earnings did
    reach the requisite threshold as  stipulated  by  Appendix  FM-SE,  and
    recourse to the  P60  was  unnecessary  in  circumstances  where  other
    evidence was plainly telling.

19. It is entirely irrelevant to say that the employment "is  contrived  so
    that her annual income appears to exceed the minimum income  threshold"
    (paragraph 35) because  in  the  nature  of  things,  people  during  a
    lifetime of working, may work less or more depending on their needs and
    circumstances (such as to buy a house or a car) and if for the purposes
    of showing an income  threshold  of  �18,600  having  been  reached,  a
    sponsoring spouse in the UK can show a period of genuine employment for
    a six months' duration prior to the date of the application, then  that
    meets with the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  There is nothing
    further to be said.

20. Insofar as there is illegality, which has not been proven on the  facts
    of this case, that is a matter between the state  authorities  and  the
    employer himself.  Its consequences  are  not  to  be  visited  upon  a
    sponsoring spouse, such as in the circumstances of this case.  For  all
    these reasons, this appeal succeeds.



Notice of Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

22. No anonymity order is made.
