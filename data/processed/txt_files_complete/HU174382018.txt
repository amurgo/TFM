                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge T R Smith promulgated on the 5th February  2019  whereby
    the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent to refuse the appellant's claims based on Article 8  of  the
    ECHR, family and private life.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Taylor on 14th May 2019. Thus the case  appeared  before
    me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law in the
    decision.

 4. The grant of leave provided that all the issues raised in  the  grounds
    may be argued.

Grounds of appeal

 5. The first challenge made to the decision was that the judge  failed  to
    take account of the fact that the requirements of the  rules  that  the
    income of the sponsor at the time of the application had to be  ï¿½18,600
    was met and accordingly the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. As is evident from the letter of refusal the appellant could  not  meet
    the requirements of the rules by reason of her immigration status.

 7. There had been a previous appeal by this appellant. At the time of that
    appeal the appellant had been in the  UK  with  other  members  of  her
    family, her father, mother and  brother.  The  family  had  entered  as
    visitors in 2007, when the appellant was 15. The family had remained in
    the UK.  In  2013  the  family  had  been  encountered  by  Immigration
    Enforcement Officers and sought to remain on the basis  of  Article  8.
    The appellant's application for further leave had been refused  as  had
    the applications of her family members. Appeals against the refusals of
    leave to remain had been dismissed in  2014  in  a  decision  by  Judge
    Upson. In considering the issues Judge Upson had dealt with each member
    of the family separately. The family had sought leave to appeal but had
    been refused. The decision of Judge Upson determined the rights of  the
    appellant at that time. The appellant, although initially  a  minor  on
    entry, was at the time of the appeal an adult  and  had  had  no  legal
    basis for remaining in the UK.

 8. The appellant was unlawfully in the UK. In accordance with Appendix  FM
    the effect of that immigration status was that  the  appellant  had  to
    meet the requirements of EX1, which required an appellant to show  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  in  the
    country to which they would be returned. The judge in  considering  EX1
    was required to consider whether the  appellant  had  established  that
    there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in
    Pakistan.   The   judge   carefully   assessed   whether   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles.  In  so  doing  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing in Pakistan and therefore the appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules. The judge has  therefore  correctly  applied
    the requirements of the rules.

 9. Whether the appellant and her sponsor had sufficient income to meet the
    requirements of the rules, whilst a relevant fact in looking at Article
    8 overall, was not determinative  of  whether  the  appellant  met  the
    requirement of the Immigration Rules.  What was  material  was  whether
    there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in
    Pakistan. The  judge  considered  the  issues  of  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles and has carefully set out reasons for  finding
    that  there  were  not  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  in
    Pakistan. The judge has properly considered the rules and  given  valid
    reasons  for  finding  that  the  appellant  could  not   satisfy   the
    requirements of the rules.

10. The second ground of appeal argues Judge Smith followed the decision of
    Judge Upson applying the principles set down in the case of  Devasselan
    [2002] UKAIT 00702. It is argued that the decision of  Judge  Upson  is
    based on caselaw that has subsequently been overruled  and  accordingly
    the decision of Judge Upson should not have been followed.

11. The findings of fact by Judge Upson stand as  there  is  no  suggestion
    that he was not entitled to make the findings that he did.  Whilst  the
    case of Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) has been considered in  the  case
    of R on the application of Sunasse [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin), one has to
    look at whether or not the  judge  considered  Article  8  outside  the
    rules.

12. The case of the appellant is  dealt  with  in  paragraph  47  of  Judge
    Upson's decision.  The  judge  having  assessed  the  facts  makes  the
    following finding:-

         "I find that none of this amounts to an arguably  good  ground  for
         granting leave to remain outside the rules."

    It is clear that the judge was considering the article 8 rights of  the
    appellant outside the rules. It is thereafter that the judge goes on to
    say:-

         "Additionally  I  find  that  it  does  not  amount  to  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules to  allow
         me to go on and consider Ms Sana Pervaiz's case outside the Rules"

13. In the judgement the judge  has  considered  whether  there  were  good
    grounds for granting leave outside of the rules on the basis of article
    8. Whilst thereafter he has followed the guidance given in the case  of
    Gulshan, any error in following the case would have  made  no  material
    difference. In any event the  approach  of  the  judge  considered  the
    principles and the conclusions reached  were  fully  justified  in  the
    circumstances.

14. In the light of that there is no material error of law in  Judge  Smith
    treating the previous determination as the starting point in  assessing
    the article 8  rights  of  the  appellant.  Judge  Smith  has  properly
    assessed the article 8 rights of the appellant and given valid  reasons
    for reaching the conclusions that he has.

15. The third ground raises the decision in the case  of  Chikwamba  [2008]
    UKHL 40.  The  submission  made  at  the  hearing  by  the  appellant's
    representative was that it was conceded  that  the  appellant,  if  the
    appellant were returned to Pakistan, would not be able  to  immediately
    make an application for entry to the  UK,  which  would  be  likely  to
    succeed. It is argued that the judge should have ignored the concession
    and should have looked at the  issues  of  whether  the  appellant,  if
    returned to Pakistan, could have made an application to enter and would
    have been likely to succeed. At the  hearing  before  Judge  Smith  the
    appellant's representative conceded that the appellant would be  denied
    entry under paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration Rules.

16. The judge has noted that the concession having been made there  was  no
    argument advanced on the issue.  The  respondent's  representative  may
    have had other grounds for arguing that the appellant  would  not  have
    succeed on such an application but as the concession was made  and  the
    point was not being argued, there was no need to advance an argument on
    such a point.

17. If the argument by the appellant's representative is correct  then  the
    representative for the respondent and the judge  would  have  to  cover
    every eventuality in an appeal whether argued or not on  behalf  of  an
    appellant. It was clear that  the  representative  had  considered  the
    matter of whether or not Chikwamba was relevant. The judge was entitled
    to accept the concession. It was therefore not necessary for either the
    representative of the respondent or the judge to take an argument  that
    was not being advanced on behalf of the appellant.

18. Thereafter the remaining grounds seek to suggest  that  the  judge  has
    taken into account irrelevant matters.  Included  in  those  irrelevant
    matters is the fact that prior to the  parties  marrying  both  parties
    knew of the appellant's immigration status. Whilst it was  accepted  in
    the grounds that the Tribunal were required  to  find  the  appellant's
    status was precarious following the case of Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC
    58, the judge thereafter should not have held  that  fact  against  the
    appellant as the responsibility for her being in the United Kingdom lay
    with her parents, who brought into the United Kingdom when  she  was  a
    minor. It sought to be argued that as the appellant was  a  minor  when
    she entered the bad behaviour of the parents consistent with  the  case
    of KO 2018 UKSC should not have been held against the appellant.

19. In that respect it has to be noted that at the time that the  appellant
    was first encountered by the immigration enforcement officers in  April
    2013 the appellant was 21.  Thereafter  the  appellant  had  an  appeal
    decided by Judge Upson. There was reference in that appeal to the  fact
    that the appellant was in a developing relationship  with  her  present
    husband. Consistent with  the  provisions  of  section  117(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  the  case  law  of
    Rhuppiah little weight should be given to a relationship formed with  a
    qualifying partner established at a time when  the  person  is  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully. The judge was entitled to  comply  with  the
    statutory provisions and take account of the circumstances in which the
    relationship with the appellant's partner was established.

20. In the circumstances there is no material error of law in the  decision
    and I dismiss the appeal.

    Notice of Decision

21. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
