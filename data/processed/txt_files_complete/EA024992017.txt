                            DECISION TO SET ASIDE


                          And DIRECTIONS TO PARTIES


      Decision to set aside

1.    By way of my decision granting permission signed  on  16  August  2017
     and sent to the parties under cover of a notice  ref:  IA102  dated  17
     August 2017, the Upper Tribunal notified the parties of its proposal to
     set aside the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Butler  in
     its entirety and remit the appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
     Judge of that Tribunal other than Judge  Butler  and  Designated  Judge
     Shaerf to re-make the decision on the appellant's appeal.  The  reasons
     for the proposal were set out in the decision granting permission.

2.    In my decision granting permission, the  parties  were  informed  that
     the Upper Tribunal will proceed to issue a decision to give  effect  to
     its proposal unless the parties objected, with reasons, by 4 pm on  the
     14th calendar day after the date of the Tribunal's notice.

3.    To date, no response has been received from the appellant.

4.    By a letter dated 31 August 2017, the respondent  informed  the  Upper
     Tribunal that she  did  not  oppose  the  appellant's  application  for
     permission to appeal and invited the Upper Tribunal  to  determine  the
     appeal with a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

5.    In the circumstances, I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  of  Judge
     Butler involved the making of an error on a point of law such  that  it
     falls to be set aside in its entirety. I set it aside in its  entirety.
     The reasons  for  my  decision  are  given  in  the  decision  granting
     permission to appeal. For the reasons given in the  same  notice,  this
     case is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  Judge  of  that
     Tribunal other than Judge Butler and Designated Judge Shaerf to re-make
     the decision on the appellant's appeal.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  errors  on
points of law such that the decision is set  aside  in  its  entirety.  This
case is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the  decision  on  the
appellant's appeal to be re-made on the merits on  all  issues  by  a  judge
other than Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Butler  and  Designated  Judge
Shaerf.
