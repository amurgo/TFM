                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant appeals against the decision dated 6th May 2020 of First-tier
Tribunal Judge Abdar, who dismissed her appeal against the refusal by the
Entry Clearance Officer of 16th August 2019 to grant her a spousal visa
under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (as amended).

The appellant and sponsor have been married for over 26 years and have
three adult children together.  The appellant and sponsor have lived in New
Zealand for the past 25 years and wish to settle in the UK because the
sponsor had obtained work in the UK commencing in September 2019.  The
appellant applied on 12th June 2019 for entry clearance.

The respondent considered the application and concluded that the appellant
met the relationship, suitability and English language eligibility
requirements but failed to meet the financial eligibility requirements of
paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1).

It was contended that the appellant had not submitted an employment letter
and the requisite six months of wage slips and bank statements dated from
December 2018 to May 2019 for her sponsor's then employment in New Zealand
and these documents were specified in the Immigration Rules in Appendix FM-
SE and should be provided.

The findings of First-tier Tribunal Judge Abdar considered the documents
which the appellant filed with her grounds of appeal on 5th September 2019
and stated that she had provided documents which were required but had only
submitted as follows:

"(a) Sponsor's former New Zealand employer's letter, Mitre 10, dated 10
August 2019, confirming position, salary and length of employment.

(b)  Six months of wage slips (February 2019 to August 2019).

(c)  Bank statements to show deposit of the Sponsor's pay.

(d)  Submitted the job offer in the UK letter for Sponsor and re-submitting
the same, dated 31 May 2019, which confirms offer of employment with
Toolstation starting on 30 September 2019, salary of ï¿½80,000, additional
bonus of up to 20% of salary and other benefits."

The judge noted that the appellant had emailed the Tribunal on 10th
February 2020 requesting an expedition of the appeal hearing as the sponsor
had moved to the UK in September 2019 to take up the offer of employment.
The appellant was a nurse for the NHS prior to relocating to New Zealand
with the sponsor 25 years ago and she intended to find employment again as
a nurse once permitted to work.

The judge found that the Entry Clearance Officer had not responded to the
directions, but the appellant had not filed any further evidence.  The
judge indicated that the appellant had accepted that she had not submitted
the necessary documentary and financial evidence as required by the Rules,
namely a letter from Mitre 10 and the sponsor's six months of payslips
together with corresponding bank statements for the same period.  The judge
noted that with the appeal the appellant had provided a letter from Mitre
10 and payslips and bank statements from February 2019 to August 2019 but
not the necessary payslips and corresponding bank statements for the six
month period to the date of application (which was in June 2019).  As a
result the appellant had failed to meet the requirements of the Rules.  The
judge considered the appeal outside the Rules on Article 8 grounds and
accepted that the sponsor had been in employment in the UK since 30th
September 2019, on a salary far above the required minimum to meet the
financial eligibility requirements of the Rules but no corroborating
payslips and corresponding bank statements had been filed with the
Tribunal.

The judge therefore decided that the appellant had failed to meet the
requirements of the Rules as at the date of the application and it was not
disproportionate for the appellant to make a fresh application with
adequate evidence for entry clearance rather than making an exception for
the appellant to satisfy the Rules.

In her grounds of appeal the appellant stated in relation to the documents
submitted:

"This was because a number of these documents were 'lost' after I submitted
them with my original visa application and again with the appeal
application.  These documents were submitted by me in the original
application as well as the appeal application but have not been
transferred/forwarded to the Home Office or included in the appeal bundle."

Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio on 25th
June 2020 on the basis that it was arguable there was an error of law in
failing to carry out a proper proportionality assessment in the
circumstances.

At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal Mr Tufan made reference to an
Entry Clearance Manager's letter which was not on file and which indicated
that the December 2018 payslip was not a requirement and he accepted that
all the relevant documentation had indeed been submitted by the appellant
with her application.  Mr Tufan conceded that the matter should be allowed
under the Immigration Rules and thus on human rights grounds.

The appellant attended in person by telephone at the hearing at 2.30am New
Zealand time and relayed her distress at the length of time that this
appeal had taken, that being over sixteen months.  She confirmed that she
was very particular in supplying the relevant evidence with the application
and the various transferring of documentation from one site to another
because of outsourcing led to the documentation being lost by the Entry
Clearance agents.

Unbeknown to the First-tier Tribunal judge there would appear to have been
further documentation on the Entry Clearance file and not disclosed to him
not least the Entry Clearance Manger's decision which acknowledged that
certain information was not required.  The judge, who noted that the Entry
Clearance Officer had not responded to a Tribunal direction to file further
documentation, therefore proceeded on an erroneous basis with regard to the
relevant documentation.  That, through no fault of the judge, was a
procedural irregularity and a material error of law. We set aside the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

In view of Mr Tufan's concession we consider that the appellant has met the
relevant requirements of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules and has
fulfilled the financial requirements criteria.  We therefore allow the
appeal on Article 8 grounds.  There has been no public interest objection
raised to allowing the appeal (indeed the appellant has fulfilled the
Immigration Rules) and further any such refusal would result in
unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellant and be in breach of
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  As the appellant
explained, she had been separated from her husband whilst he had taken up
employment in the United Kingdom and she had been forced to remain in New
Zealand.

Although we have no power to direct the Entry Clearance Officer to expedite
this matter, we would urge any official to consider issuing a visa as a
matter of urgency.



Notice of Decision

The appeal of Mrs Falkiner is allowed on human rights grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
fee award of any fee which has  been  paid  or  may  be  payable  not  least
because of the delay and administrative difficulties.
