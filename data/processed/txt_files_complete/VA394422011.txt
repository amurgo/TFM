                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. I refer to the directions which I issued  in  this  appeal  dated  2
       October 2012. I have received no communication from  the  respondent
       and I therefore allow the appeal and direct that it  be  reheard  in
       the First-tier Tribunal and the decision remade by that Tribunal.





    DECISION


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the determination and direct that the decision be remade in
    the First-tier Tribunal
