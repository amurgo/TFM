Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Fiona McCrae, instructed by Miles Hutchinson &
Lithgow
For the Respondent:    Mr M. Diwnycz of the Specialist Appeals Team


                                DETERMINATION


1.   On 18th May 2012 Miss Kamara's appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  came
    before Judge Grant-Hutchinson, who found  that  the  appellant  herself
    would not have required international protection had she been returning
    to Sierra Leone on her own, but that the baby  girl  to  whom  she  had
    given birth on 29th August 2011 would face a real risk of being  forced
    to undergo female genital mutilation ('FGM') in Sierra  Leone,  despite
    the objections of her mother.  This would make both mother and daughter
    members of a 'particular  social  group',  and  would  expose  them  to
    treatment in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.  The appeal was therefore
    allowed on asylum and human rights grounds.

2.    By way of grounds drafted by  David  Johnson  of  the  Newcastle  HOPO
    Unit, the respondent sought leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  and
    this was granted by Designated Judge Manuell on 7th June 2012.   It  is
    regrettable that such a long time should have elapsed before the appeal
    was listed for a hearing, but when the matter came before me  today  Mr
    Diwnycz was, very fairly, of the view that  Judge  Grant-Hutchison  had
    given adequate reasons for her decision, based on the expert report  by
    a social anthropologist, Dr Knï¿½rr of the Max Planck Institute.

3.   Mr Johnson's grounds took issue with the judge's conclusion  that  even
    if Miss Kamara exercised an 'internal flight option' out of  the  reach
    of her family,  her  daughter  would  still  be  at  risk  of  forcible
    circumcision.  The 'actors of persecution' (non-state  agents  in  this
    case) were said not to have been identified in the  report  upon  which
    Judge Grant-Hutchison relied.  But it seems to me that there was a  lot
    more in the report to justify a  finding  of  real  risk  to  both  the
    appellant and her daughter.  Miss Kamara has had a baby out of  wedlock
    and has converted from Islam to Christianity.  She has been disowned by
    her family, and will be without a male  protector  in  the  patriarchal
    society of Sierra Leone.  She will be  exposed  to  sexual  harassment,
    while her refusal to follow the Limba custom  of  having  her  daughter
    circumcised will incur discrimination by both men and women.

4.   In all the circumstances of this particular case, I am unable  to  find
    that it was not open to the First-tier judge, on  the  evidence  before
    her, to allow the appeal.




     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
