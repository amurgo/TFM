1.    When applying the judgment of the Court of  Justice  of  the  European
    Union in Ruiz Zambrano (European citizenship) [2011] EUECJ Case C-34/09
    OJ 2011 C130/2 and that of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]
    UKSC 4; [2011] 2 WLR 148, in relation to the  proposed  administrative
    removal or deportation of one or both of his non-national parents,  the
    welfare of a child, particularly a child who is a British citizen, is a
    primary consideration.
2.     National courts must engage with the question whether  removal  of  a
    particular parent will 'deprive [the child] of the genuine enjoyment of
    the substance of the rights attaching to the status of  European  Union
    citizen'.
3.    Where there are  strong  public  interest  reasons  to  expel  a  non-
    national parent, any right of  residence  for  the  parent  is  not  an
    absolute  one  but  is  subject  to  the  Community  Law  principle  of
    proportionality. There is no substantial difference between  the  human
    rights  based  assessment  of  proportionality  of   any   interference
    considered by Lady Hale in ZH (Tanzania) and the approach  required  by
    Community law.
4.    In this particular context, the Article  8  assessment  questions  set
    out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 should be tailored as follows, placing the
    assessment of necessity where it  most  appropriately  belongs  in  the
    final question dependent on the outcome of proportionality and  a  fair
    balance, rather than as part of the identification  of  the  legitimate
    aim:
         1. Is there family life enjoyed between the appellant and  a  minor
           child that  requires  respect  in  the  context  of  immigration
           decision making?
         2. Would deportation of the parent interfere with the enjoyment  of
           that family life?
         3. Is such an interference in accordance with the law?
         4. Is such an interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?
         5. Is deportation  necessary,  proportionate  and  a  fair  balance
           between the rights  to  respect  for  the  family  life  of  the
           appellant and the child and the particular  public  interest  in
           question?


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. This is an appeal from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dated  13
    October 2010 dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  a  deportation
    decision taken on the basis that he was a foreign criminal  within  the
    meaning of s 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

 2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born in December 1962.  He first
    came to the United Kingdom as a visitor in  September  1991.   He  made
    various applications to remain that were rejected and  a  decision  was
    made to deport him as an  overstayer  in  September  1996  but  he  was
    subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain in December 2002  under
    a regularisation scheme.

 3. In the year  2004  the  appellant  had  a  relationship  with  Titilayo
    Thompson.  It appears that the couple never lived together in a  common
    household or at least did not do  so  at  any  time  material  to  this
    appeal.

 4.  On 20 April 2005 Samuel Toluwalase Omotunde (otherwise Tolu) was  born
    to the couple in Lewisham.  His birth was registered  on  7  June  2005
    with both parents being given as informants;  the  appellant's  address
    was 62 Boone Street, Lewisham, London SE13 and that of  the  mother  52
    Dolphin Tower  Deptford SE8.  Although Tolu's father had at the time of
    his birth been given indefinite leave to remain, Tolu did not become  a
    British citizen at birth because s 50 (9) of  the  British  Nationality
    Act 1981 did not enable children born outside marriage to  trace  their
    nationality status through their fathers in the absence  of  subsequent
    legitimation by marriage.   This  differential  treatment  of  children
    according to their legitimacy status was the  subject  of  debate,  and
    with the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000
    it was highly doubtful whether such distinction in terms of nationality
    status could be justified taking Article 8 together with Article 14  of
    the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   Parliament  removed  the
    distinction by s 9 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    but unfortunately this Act did not come into force until July 2006  and
    then only applied to children born after that date, thus too  late  for
    Tolu to benefit.  Children born before  1  July  2006  had  to  acquire
    British nationality through registration under s 3(1)  of  the  British
    Nationality Act 1981.

 5. On 29  April  2008  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  two  counts  of
    conspiracy to make fraudulent claims for tax credits  and  transfer  of
    criminal property obtained during the conspiracy.  He was  remanded  in
    custody  on  that  date  and  sentenced  to  two  and  a  half   years'
    imprisonment at the Crown Court, Croydon on 27 June 2008.  The  judge's
    sentencing remarks and the  indictment  indicate  that  the  conspiracy
    lasted between July 2004 and March 2005  and involved  a  total  of  �2
    million of benefit from which a sum of �1 million was extracted by  the
    conspirators.  The judge was critical of the ease by  which  fraudulent
    claims could be made without any system for checking  operated  by  Her
    Majesty's Revenue and Customs without in any way suggesting  that  this
    constituted mitigation for dishonest people.  The appellant was not the
    leading light of the conspiracy but  was  associated  with  others  who
    were.  He was drawn into the wrongdoing to the tune of  about  �41,600.
    The  judge  applied  his  mind  to,  but  decided  not   to   make,   a
    recommendation for deportation of a number of the conspirators who  had
    children in this country noting that the children did not choose  their
    mother or indeed their father.  In the appellant's case the judge noted
    "You have a young child who you are a carer for".  He  recognised  that
    deportation was entirely a matter for  the  Home  Secretary.   In  fact
    shortly after the sentence was imposed provisions of the UK Borders Act
    2007  came  into  force  with  the  consequence  that  the  appellant's
    deportation was automatic under s 32 subject to an  exception  under  s
    33(2)(a) where  removal  would  breach  a  person's  rights  under  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

 6. The Home Office alerted the appellant to the fact that he was  eligible
    for deportation and from late 2008 conducted an investigation into  the
    care arrangements for Tolu during his father's  imprisonment  and  what
    arrangements were to be made for him in the event  of  the  appellant's
    deportation.

 7. The appellant had served the custodial part of his criminal sentence by
    about August 2009 but was  thereafter  held  in  immigration  detention
    pending a decision on deportation.  It appears he had been refused bail
    during this period but on 22 April 2010, two days after a decision  had
    been made to deport him, he was released on bail and  returned  to  his
    address at Boone Street and has remained living there to  the  date  of
    this appeal.

 8. In substance, the appellant indicated that during his period in custody
    he had made arrangements for Tolu through  a  team  of  carers  he  had
    assembled and called  Team  Tolu.   These  included  Titilayo's  sister
    Stella Ogonsaya (Stella) who lived in the Hammersmith  area  and  three
    pastors associated with the appellant's religious community, a  husband
    and wife team David and Lydia Olurunniwo and Mobogolegi  Carew.  In  an
    undated questionnaire completed when he was in detention  he  indicated
    that he was unable to give the Home Office up to date information about
    Titilayo's immigration status as he was not currently in  contact  with
    her. He repeated that she was unwilling  to  communicate  with  him  in
    September 2009 but indicated in response to a  direct  question  on  22
    October 2009 that she  had  not  renounced  interest  in  her  son  and
    maintained a contact through  Stella.  He  indicated  that  Tolu  would
    remain in the United Kingdom if the appellant were to be deported.

 9. From the  documentary  information  gathered  by  the  Home  Office  in
    pursuance of its enquiry the following picture  emerged  as  to  Tolu's
    education:

        i) He started at his nursery class of St Margaret's Lee  Church  of
           England School in Lewisham after Easter of 2008.  The offer  was
           made to the father at his address in October 2007.
       ii) Tolu did not receive an offer to enter St  Margaret's  reception
           class so sometime early in 2009 he was transferred to a  private
           school run by the church group, the Kings Kid Christian  School,
           New Cross.  The fees for this school were paid by Team Tolu.  In
           October 2009 the school informed the  Home  Office  that  Tolu's
           mother was dropping him off and collecting him.
      iii) In about January 2010 Tolu transferred to the  Melcombe  Primary
           School, Fulham  Palace  Road,  London  W6  where  he  made  good
           progress in his first  term.   The  appellant  stated  that  the
           reason for the move was that Team Tolu could  no  longer  afford
           the school fees at the Kings Kids School.  Melcombe  School  was
           close to Stella's address.

10. For completeness we can indicate that at  the  hearing  before  us  the
    appellant was  able  to  produce  documentary  evidence  that  was  not
    challenged and we accept is accurate. He told us that Tolu continued to
    attend Melcombe Primary School after the appellant  was  released  from
    custody and Tolu returned to live with him at 62 Boone Street.  However
    this involved a  substantial  cross-London  journey  from  Lewisham  to
    Hammersmith. Some nights Tolu would  spend  with  his  aunt  Stella  in
    Hammersmith.  His school was concerned that a young child was having to
    make such a long journey and the Headteacher secured  Tolu's  admission
    into a school much closer to the  Lewisham  area.  Tolu  attended  this
    school until 8 April 2011 and a fortnight later he was offered a  place
    and started attending the St Matthew Academy, St Joseph's Vale,  London
    SE3 very close to the appellant's address. On the application form  the
    appellant is given as the first contact and  his  address  the  one  to
    which correspondence should be sent; the mother as the  second  contact
    with an address in Abbeywood London SE2.

11. The Home Office enquiries revealed the fact  that  the  mother  had  no
    certain immigration status but had at some point  applied  for  an  EEA
    Family Permit through connection with her brother-in-law  but  had  not
    claimed Tolu as her dependant in that application.  The  appellant  had
    been consistent in his description of  the  care  arrangements  in  his
    communications with the Home Office, the Trial Judge and the  Probation
    Officer making the OASYS assessment of him on conviction.

The decision to deport

12. In the decision letter of 12 April 2010 the Home  Office  gave  reasons
    why it did not accept the appellant's human  rights  claim.   It  noted
    that the appellant had now been in the United Kingdom for approximately
    eighteen years, eight of which were pursuant to lawful  residence.   He
    had a minor previous conviction in April 2006 for soliciting  for  taxi
    hire services for which he was fined �100.

13. With respect to Tolu, having recited the care arrangements as described
    by the appellant, the decision letter states as follows:

       "You claim to  be  the  sole  carer  for  your  son  prior  to  your
       incarceration and you maintain that you will be his sole carer after
       you are released.  It is noted that you are in good health and there
       are no known reasons why your son could not  join  you  in  Nigeria.
       Should you feel that this is not possible for your son to  accompany
       you to  Nigeria,  it  is  believed  that  you  could  maintain  your
       relationship with him using modern means of  communication,  similar
       to those you may have used while serving  your  custodial  sentence.
       In the same way you could also  maintain  contact  with  your  other
       family members living here.  You further state  that  there  are  no
       court orders to state that you are the sole carer of your son.   You
       claim that you and Titilayo Thompson decided access amicably.   Your
       son is subject to deport action as your family member  and  will  be
       served with a notice of decision to make a deportation order against
       him.  He will be given a right of  appeal  against  the  deportation
       decision and will also have the option to accompany you  voluntarily
       which will enable him to leave the  United  Kingdom  and  return  to
       Nigeria without being made the subject of a deportation order".


    The letter then noted that Tolu (described by his given name of Samuel)
    was not British and was not entitled to the right of abode.  He was old
    enough  to  adapt  to  life  in  Nigeria.    There   were   educational
    opportunities for him in Nigeria.  It continued:


       "Given that the education will be freely available to Samuel  (Tolu)
       in Nigeria the Secretary of State does not believe that  re-location
       would interfere with his family life for the purpose of  Article  8.
       If Samuel does not join you in Nigeria it is noted  that  you  would
       like him to remain in the United Kingdom with his  aunt  Stella  ...
       and that he can use modern channels  of  communication  to  keep  in
       contact with you similar to those used whilst you were serving  your
       custodial sentence.  He can also make regular visits to see  you....
       Your son would be able to resume any education that he is  currently
       receiving in his mother tongue. For these reasons it is not accepted
       that the decision in question would give rise  to  any  interference
       with your family or private life.""


    Other parts of the letter indicate that any  interference  with  family
    life that might result from the appellant's deportation was permissible
    and proportionate in pursuit of the legitimate aim for  the  prevention
    of disorder and crime and the protection of health and morals.

The decision of the First tier Tribunal

14.   The appellant appealed the decision to deport him to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, who heard the appeal on 4 October and gave its decision  nine
    days later.  The appellant, Stella, Pastor Carew and another friend  of
    the  appellant  Mr  Fashode  gave  oral  evidence.   The  Tribunal  was
    unimpressed by the appellant's evidence as to the arrangements for Tolu
    and the degree to which his mother had contact  with  him.   They  were
    unimpressed by the evidence of the church witnesses in whose statements
    the appellant was described as honest, and on the central  question  in
    the appeal decided as follows:

       "23. We  do  not  accept  that  the  appellant's  deportation  would
           necessarily interfere with his family life.  As of the  date  of
           the hearing the appellant's son is a Nigerian national  with  no
           leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.   While  a  registration
           application has apparently been made we are not in a position to
           predict the outcome of that application.


       24.  Further Tolu's mother currently has no leave to remain  in  the
           United  Kingdom.   The  appellant  stated  that  she  was  still
           awaiting a decision on her application to remain in  the  United
           Kingdom as an extended family member of  an  EEA  national.   In
           these circumstances we  consider  that  the  appellant  has  the
           option of taking Tolu to Nigeria  with  him  and  there  was  no
           evidence to suggest that Tolu's mother  would  object  to  this.
           This would be the case regardless of whether Tolu is  registered
           as a British citizen or not.  Given Tolu's age,  the  fact  that
           Nigeria is an English-speaking country and that he has not  long
           started school and that he has a range of relatives  in  Nigeria
           including a grandmother and a half-sister  we  do  not  consider
           that it was unreasonable for Tolu  to  accompany  the  appellant
           regardless of his nationality.


       25.  The respondent is required to apply Section 32(5) of  the  2007
           Act to the appellant owing to the sentence he received following
           a criminal conviction and therefore the decision is lawful.   We
           also consider that the decision is necessary in that it is taken
           with the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder and crime.


       26.  We find that the decision was proportionate for  the  following
           reasons.  We attach weight to  the  appellant's  fairly  lengthy
           residence in the United Kingdom and the fact that  his  son  was
           born here and attends primary school.  The  appellant  has  also
           claimed to undertake voluntary work for his church and  for  his
           home town in Nigeria ...   We  consider  that  many  letters  of
           support produced on the appellant's behalf and the fact that  he
           has been assessed as being at low risk of re-offending.


       27.  ... From the sentencing remarks we deduce the following.   Most
           of the false  tax  credit  claims  were  based  on  non-existent
           disabled children under one.  The Sentencing Judge said that the
           fraud netted some �2 million of which �1 million was extracted.


       28.  The case was described by the Sentencing  Judge  as  'organised
           crime' and there were references to the money being disposed  of
           in Nigeria.  The appellant's role in the conspiracy was not  the
           least significant, compared with the others convicted, according
           to the aforementioned remarks and the sums involved.  We  accept
           that the appellant's son  is  a  primary  consideration  however
           given the lack  of  evidence  before  us  to  suggest  that  the
           appellant was likely to be separated from his son in  the  event
           of deportation,  we  conclude  that  the  respondent's  concerns
           outweighed the appellant's human rights."

15. Five days after the Tribunal promulgated its decision, the Secretary of
    State registered Tolu as a British citizen pursuant to s 3(1).  We  are
    aware that the current UKBA Guidance cited in  Macdonald's  Immigration
    Law and Practice Eighth Edition, Volume 1, paragraph 2.55, footnote  3,
    indicates that:

       "The main general criteria for discretionary registration  are  that
        the child's future should clearly be seen  to  lie  in  the  United
        Kingdom and that there are  close  connections  (either  through  a
        parent or otherwise and that the child of 13 or over has  lived  in
        the United Kingdom for two years)."


    (Cited in the decision  of  the  Administrative  Court  in  R  (on  the
    application of Mansoor v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2011] EWHC 832 (Admin), 23 March 2011  at  [21]  and  the  subject  of
    comment at [42]).

16. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal  on  3  February
    2011 on the basis that it  was  arguable  that  the  interests  of  the
    appellant's child were not given adequate consideration in the light of
    the guidance of the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.

Error of Law

17. The First-tier Tribunal did not have the benefit of the guidance in  ZH
    (Tanzania). We are satisfied that its examination of the impact of  the
    appellant's proposed deportation on  Tolu  and  its  conclusion  as  to
    proportionality at [28] were both inadequate. The child's welfare is  a
    primary consideration irrespective of the criminal  wrongdoing  of  his
    father and any diminished credibility that the father's evidence  alone
    might have as a result of that conviction. A  fair  assessment  of  his
    ties to the United Kingdom and where his best interests lay was needed.
    There was evidence before the Tribunal that the mother was in close and
    regular contact with Tolu (if not the appellant) and had  the  care  of
    him that day. His aunt had already played a  significant  role  in  his
    life. If Tolu could not lawfully have been deported as a member of  his
    father's family, an assessment was needed whether it  would  have  been
    reasonable to expect him to relocate to Nigeria with the loss of  those
    ties.  The fact that there is an educational system in Nigeria does not
    resolve what this child's best interests  are.  The  Tribunal  did  not
    consider the effect of separation of  mother  and  child.  It  did  not
    assess  his  educational  interests  or  the  consequences  for   those
    interests if the appellant were to remove him to Nigeria.

18.  We  do  not  understand  that  the  evidential  picture  of  the  care
    arrangements was in significant dispute. The  Home  Office  appears  to
    have accepted that the father was the primary carer  of  Tolu  who  was
    living in his  household,  indeed  that  was  the  basis  on  which  it
    concluded that it would deport Tolu as a family member.  The  appellant
    had never submitted to the Home Office that the  mother  had  abandoned
    any interest in the child, and he accepted in his  oral  evidence  that
    whilst he  was  in  prison  the  mother  may  have  visited  the  child
    frequently.  Stella indicated that the mother came four or five times a
    week when Tolu was at Hammersmith to see him.  Since it was  not  clear
    that the mother was to be removed to Nigeria as  well,  Tolu's  removal
    from the United Kingdom would separate him from the ability of  regular
    contact with his mother and his maternal aunt as well  as  interrupting
    the schooling that he had commenced in this country where he  was  born
    and spent his entire life.  If Tolu were to be  left  behind  he  would
    lose his daily contact with his father and primary carer.

19. In the light of the above, Mr Saunders did not  resist  the  contention
    that the Tribunal's reasoning on this critical question was  inadequate
    in the light of the case law.  We accordingly find  there  has  been  a
    material error of law; we set aside the decision of  the  Tribunal  and
    remake it.

Remaking the decision: our assessment of the facts

20. Although the directions of the Upper Tribunal had envisaged that in the
    event that we found an error  of  law  the  decision  could  be  remade
    without hearing evidence, and no witness statement had been served, the
    appellant gave evidence at our invitation. As already indicated, he was
    able to satisfy us as to the current educational arrangements for  Tolu
    and produced documents, for which he  could  not  have  anticipated  he
    would be asked, dealing with his care of the child.  This supports  the
    consistent picture that he plays a prominent role in Tolu's life and is
    the primary carer of his son.

21. We found the appellant's answers to be clear, detailed and evidentially
    supported. His evidence was not challenged by Mr Saunders.  The picture
    that he presented of Tolu's care arrangements had been  those  that  he
    had consistently indicated previously to those in authority  since  his
    arrest and conviction.  It was also consistent with the evidence in the
    witness statement of Stella.

22. Though it would undoubtedly have been helpful for the Home  Office  and
    the Tribunal to have heard  from  the  mother,  we  see  no  basis  for
    concluding that the absence of her evidence undermines  the  consistent
    picture that the appellant was the lead personality in caring for  Tolu
    and  making  arrangements  for  his  future,  albeit  that  the  mother
    maintains contact with her son and had not abandoned  her  interest  in
    him. We see no reason to reject Stella's evidence that  mother  remains
    in touch and regularly sees Tolu. We therefore reached a different view
    as  to  the  credibility  of  the  appellant's  account  of  the   care
    arrangements for Tolu than did the First-tier Tribunal.

23. We also have the considerable advantage over  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that we now know that the Secretary of  State  had  decided  that  Tolu
    should be registered as a British citizen.  It is very unfortunate that
    this important decision had not been taken before the  hearing  of  the
    deportation appeal, or that intimation could not have been given to the
    Tribunal that  the  application  was  likely  to  be  successful.   The
    exercise of discretion to register such a child as a British citizen is
    essentially based on the conclusion that the child's future should  lie
    in the United Kingdom.  It follows that exercising that  discretion  in
    Tolu's favour was  wholly  inconsistent  with  the  basis  of  decision
    explained six months earlier that he would be deported to Nigeria  with
    his father, as someone with no right of residence in this country.

24. It may also have been that the Tribunal could have been  given  greater
    assistance by the legal team of the appellant to the  effect  that  any
    refusal of registration of Tolu  and  his  intended  deportation  as  a
    family member would probably have been contrary to the Human Rights Act
    in  this  respect,  because  of  the  discrimination  based  upon   his
    illegitimate status and a delay in implementing Parliament's intentions
    to rectify that situation.

25. The picture that emerges from the evidence as a  whole  is  that  of  a
    bright six year old child, born and resident in the United Kingdom, and
    whose future is now recognised by the Secretary of State to lie in  the
    United Kingdom by reason of his discretionary registration as a British
    citizen. He has had a difficult three years as  a  consequence  of  his
    father's criminal wrongdoing and has attended  four  different  nursery
    and primary schools before recently being admitted to an Academy school
    where he has the prospect of remaining throughout the remainder of  his
    primary and secondary education.

26. We have no doubt that a period of educational continuity and  stability
    is in his best interests. The present position is that  he  lives  with
    the appellant at  62  Boone  Street  and  attends  school  nearby.  The
    appellant states that Tolu's mother collects him from school on  Friday
    and regularly has staying contact over the  weekend.  He  was  able  to
    supply us with the mother's current address.  We  accept  the  evidence
    that his father has taken an active and dominant lead  in  Tolu's  care
    before, during and after the prison sentence he has served. We  see  no
    indication that this was in any sense a contrived picture  of  parental
    concern. It is reflected in the arrangements  made  for  schooling  and
    care of Tolu, when the appellant was unable personally to take care  of
    his son while in prison.

27. The mother's precise relationship with Tolu is less clear  as  she  has
    not made a statement, been called as a witness or has been recorded  as
    expressing a view. We note that she apparently took Tolu to  school  on
    the day of the hearing before the  First  tier  in  October  and  as  a
    consequence it would not have been possible for mother  to  have  taken
    the child to school in Lewisham and collected him at  the  end  of  the
    school day and also to give evidence in Dorking. The Home  Office  were
    themselves in contact with mother  in  connection  with  her  residence
    permit application. We are told that this is  still  outstanding  after
    some two years and there is  no  evidence  that  the  Home  Office  has
    written to her asking for her views.

Remaking the decision:  interference with family life

28. We conclude that deportation of the father  to  Nigeria  would  deprive
    Tolu of his dominant carer throughout his  young  life,  and  seriously
    interrupt his daily care arrangements. We reject  the  submission  that
    family life hitherto enjoyed between an active parent and a small child
    could be appropriately maintained by telephone calls or  other  'modern
    methods of communication' from Nigeria.  We  note  that  this  Tribunal
    reached a similar conclusion in LD (Article 8- best interest of  child)
    Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC). Difficult as the issues in a case  such
    as the present are to decide,  their  resolution  is  not  assisted  by
    wholly unrealistic suggestions such as this.

29. If it is justified to interfere with the right of  respect  for  family
    life because of a contrary compelling public interest, so be it and the
    fact of electronic communication may provide some  means  of  continued
    contact, but the internet and telephone calls do not substitute for the
    daily care, engagement and attendance on a  young  child  that  is  the
    essence of family life in this context.

30. We pay particular attention to the decision of the Supreme Court in  ZH
    Tanzania, without lengthening this determination  by  the  citation  of
    substantial extracts from it.  It governs our approach to this case. We
    note the importance attached to nationality as an  indicator  of  where
    the child's best interests lay. Tolu cannot be deported as a member  of
    his father's family and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  him  to
    accompany his father to Nigeria where there is no  evidence  of  social
    ties or equivalent care.

31. We further recognise that Tolu's British nationality is not  merely  an
    aspect of what his best interests are, but may also afford him a  right
    to reside in his own country in both national and European Law see Case
    C-34/09 Ruiz  Zambrano  where  the  Court  of  Justice  in  its  ruling
    concluded:

      "Article 20 TFEU is to be interpreted as meaning that it  precludes  a
         Member State from refusing a third country national upon  whom  his
         minor children, who are European Union citizens, are  dependent,  a
         right of residence in the Member State of residence and nationality
         of those children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that
         third country national, in so far as such decisions  deprive  those
         children of the genuine enjoyment of the substance  of  the  rights
         attaching   to   the   status   of   European    Union    citizen."
         [Emphasis added]

32. As a result of this decision  national  courts  must  engage  with  the
    question whether removal of a  particular  parent  will  'deprive  [the
    child] of  the  genuine  enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the  rights
    attaching to the status of European Union citizen'.  We  conclude  that
    either requiring Tolu to live  in  Nigeria  or  depriving  him  or  his
    primary carer would undermine his rights of  residence.  The  Court  of
    Justice did not have to consider how Article 20  would  be  applied  if
    there were strong public  interest  reasons  to  expel  a  non-national
    parent.  We would conclude (subject to any further  guidance  from  the
    CJEU or the Court of Appeal) that any right of residence for the parent
    is not an absolute one but is subject to the Community Law principle of
    proportionality. We doubt whether there  is  a  substantial  difference
    between the human rights based assessment  of  proportionality  of  any
    interference considered by Lady Hale in ZH (Tanzania) and the  approach
    required by Community law.

Remaking the decision: proportionality

33. We recognise that the welfare of the child is not a trump card  or  the
    paramount consideration in considering the deportation of  his  father.
    The analysis of Lady Hale  at [26] and  [28]  and  Lord  Kerr  at  [46]
    indicates that it can yield to the rights of others  where  a  contrary
    course is convincingly demonstrated  by  the  public  authority,  which
    bears the burden of justification.  We  further  take  account  of  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in  Lee [2011] EWCA Civ  348  29  March
    2011 at [26] to [27] where the conduct of  the  drug  offending  father
    justified his deportation and indefinite separation from his young son,
    despite the child's best interests.

34. This is a case of automatic deportation where the  Secretary of   State
    has no discretion and the principle of N (Kenya) [2004] EWCA Civ  1094;
    [2004] INLR  612 that weight must  be  afforded  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy does not apply as it would in a  case  of  discretionary
    deportation: see MK (deportation - foreign criminal - public  interest)
    Gambia [2010] UKUT  281  (IAC);  [2011]  Imm  AR  70  and  contrast  BK
    (Deportation -public interest) Ghana [2010] UKUT 328 (IAC); [2011]  Imm
    AR 109.

35. The assessment of proportionality is a matter for us, in the  light  of
    the judge's sentencing remarks and the analysis of the public  interest
    engaged, and on the facts of the particular case:  see   RG  (Automatic
    deport - section 33(2)(a) exception)  Nepal   [2010]  UKUT  273  (IAC);
    [2011] Imm AR 84. We recognise that there can be a public  interest  in
    deporting both those who  are  personally  dangerous  or  a  persistent
    threat to public order and others  whose  offending  may  be  a  single
    instance but its nature and seriousness make deportation appropriate as
    a mark of public disapproval and the protection of public order by  the
    deterrent effect on others. Equally we recognise that "seriousness"  in
    this context is not  to  be  judged  by  the  threshold  for  automatic
    deportation, but the gravity of the offending as assessed by its  place
    in the criminal calendar.

Remaking the decision: conclusions

36. In the light of the foregoing we now re-examine  this  case  using  the
    guidance given by Lord Bingham in  R (Razgar) [2004] UKHL 28, [2004]  2
    AC 368 as endorsed in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41, [2009] I AC  1159  to
    structure our reasoning.  We take account of the fact that the original
    questions were addressed to a wide variety of family and private  life,
    where the appellant had no immigration leave to enter  or  remain.  The
    present context is the  more  familiar  one  in  deportation  cases  of
    lengthy residence in the UK and eight years residence  with  indefinite
    leave to remain.

37. We have tailored the questions to this  particular  context,  and  have
    placed the assessment of necessity where it most appropriately  belongs
    in the final question dependent on the outcome of proportionality and a
    fair  balance  rather  than  as  part  of  the  identification  of  the
    legitimate aim.

38. We accordingly ask the following questions:

         1. Is there family life enjoyed between the appellant and Tolu that
            requires respect in the context of immigration decision making?


            Yes: Father has been resident here for 18 years and was lawfully
            resident at the time of Tolu's birth here.


         2. Would deportation of the father interfere with the enjoyment of
            that family life?


            Yes: If father is  deported  and  Tolu  remains  in  the  United
            Kingdom, as he is entitled to, he loses his parent and  dominant
            carer. If Tolu joins father voluntarily in Nigeria he loses  his
            home, his school, regular contact with mother and aunt  and  his
            friends, and the benefit of being brought up in the  country  of
            his birth, as a British citizen, with  all  the  benefits  which
            flow  from  that  upbringing.  Telephone/email  contact  is   no
            substitute for the active care and contact Tolu now enjoys  with
            both parents while in his father's care.


         3. Is such an interference in accordance with the law?


            Yes it is required by s 32 of the UK Borders Act  2007,  subject
            to our assessment of the human rights claim under s.33.


         4. Is such an interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?


            Yes: deportation of the father is a measure reasonably connected
            with the interest of public  safety  and  protection  of  public
            order  and  the  rights  of  others.  It  is  not  necessary  to
            demonstrate that the  appellant  presents  a  personal  risk  to
            others and is likely to personally re-offend. Public safety  may
            be promoted by the deterrent effect of deporting those liable to
            it, provided the deportation is necessary and proportionate.


         5. Is deportation  necessary,  proportionate  and  a  fair  balance
            between the rights  to  respect  for  the  family  life  of  the
            appellant and his child and the particular  public  interest  in
            question?


            It is in this context that we make our assessment of the  weight
            to be attached to the  seriousness  of  the  offending  and  the
            proportionality  of  a  deterrent  effect.  We  note  that   the
            appellant has not  been  convicted  of  an  offence  of  serious
            intentional violence  or  sexual  misconduct;  nor  is  this  an
            offence of importing or dealing  in  class  A  drugs  or  people
            trafficking where deportation as a measure to deter  others  may
            have particular efficacy.  We note that the appellant is  not  a
            recidivist offender and is not assessed to have a high  risk  of
            re-offending. We take account, however, of  the  fact  that  the
            appellant participated as a mature adult in a serious  fraud  on
            public revenue to the tune of �41,600 in his personal case,  but
            that he was not considered by the trial judge to be the dominant
            personality in the overall conspiracy of a much greater value.


            We consider that Tolu has a strong claim to continue to enjoy
            the support of his father and continue to be brought up in the
            United Kingdom. Such a course is in his best interests and his
            rights as a British citizen and a citizen of the European Union.



39. In all the circumstances of the appellant's case and the best interests
    of his child we do not consider that the interference with  the  family
    and private life can be justified by the public interest identified  in
    this case. Deportation of the appellant would not  be  a  proportionate
    measure and is not a fair balance between the competing interests.

40. We remake the decision by allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  from  the
    decision of 20 April 2010.
