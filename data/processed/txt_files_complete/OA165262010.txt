                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Abiola Fausat Abeje Olutosin, date of birth 17.10.58,  is
    a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Whalan promulgated  16.10.14,  dismissing,
    on immigration grounds  but  allowing  on  private  life  human  rights
    grounds, the claimant's against the decision of the Secretary of State,
    dated 7.3.10, to refuse leave to remain (LTR) in the UK on the basis of
    long residence and on human rights grounds.  The Judge heard the appeal
    on 1.9.14.

 3. Designated Immigration Judge McClure granted permission  to  appeal  on
    15.5.10.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  For the reasons set out in my error of law decision, I found
    such error of law in the making  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as to require the decision of Judge Whalan to be set aside and
    remade before me in the Upper Tribunal.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found at �32 that the claimant could  not
    meet the long residence provisions and found at �35 that  the  claimant
    had not demonstrated the existence of relevant family life in  the  UK.
    There was no appeal or cross appeal against  those  findings  and  that
    part of the decision. Therefore, in adjourning for the continuation  of
    the hearing to remake the appeal I preserved the findings and  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal on immigration grounds  and  in  respect  of
    family life outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR and they must  stand
    as made.

 6. Thus the matter came back before me on 15.10.15, with the single  issue
    being that of private life outside the Rules on the basis of article  8
    ECHR.

 7. There was no attendance or representation on behalf of the claimant  at
    the continuation hearing before me. Very late in the day,  received  by
    the Tribunal only on 12.10.15, despite the length of time they have had
    to consider the error of law decision, the  claimant's  representatives
    requested that the continuation hearing should be vacated,  should  not
    be heard by myself, and that the case should be remitted to the  First-
    tier  Tribunal.  They  sought  to  raise  this  tardy  request   as   a
    'preliminary issue,' stating  that,  "a  careful  examination  of  part
    judgement shows that the Judge has already made up his mind and as such
    the case should be heard by another Judge. Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup has already expressed a near concluded view namely that it would
    be difficult to show that exclusion would be  disproportionate  because
    she has been outside the country for five years."

 8. The claimant's representatives did not have the courtesy to attend  the
    hearing. Their letter was put before me on the day of  the  hearing.  I
    refused the application. As noted at �20 of the error of law  decision,
    the  claimant's  representative  agreed  with  the  submission  of  the
    Secretary of State's representative that the appeal  should  remain  in
    the Upper Tribunal. There is thus no merit in the request to remit  the
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. The only reason for adjourning the remaking  of  the  decision,  rather
    than dealing with it at the hearing on 15.9.15, was the request by  the
    claimant's representative, Mr Gold, to adduce some further evidence  as
    to the claimant's  private  life  to  include  the  intervening  period
    between her removal from the UK in 2010 and the present  day.  At  that
    time, I considered that such evidence  was  arguably  relevant  to  the
    remaking of the decision. At �19 I left open for further submission the
    extent to which the Tribunal should take into  account  the  claimant's
    private life in the now 5 years since she was removed from the  UK.  It
    was arguable that the Tribunal should have considered the private  life
    circumstances at the date of hearing and  not  simply  focused  on  the
    private life developed in the UK up to the date of her removal in 2010.

10. I thus gave directions, confining the remaking of the decision  in  the
    appeal to the issue of private life outside the Rules on the  basis  of
    article 8 ECHR, and  directed  that  the  claimant  lodge  any  further
    evidence by way of a single consolidated, indexed and paginated  bundle
    all objective and subjective evidence to be relied on. There  has  been
    no compliance with that direction  and  no  bundle  or  any  additional
    evidence at all  has  been  received.  Neither  the  claimant  nor  her
    representatives have made any further submissions on the  issue  as  to
    what period the private life should be assessed  on.  It  follows  that
    adjourning the remaking of the decision  has  proved  to  be  a  rather
    pointless and unnecessary exercise.

11. Further, I see no basis to recuse myself from remaking the decision  in
    the appeal. First, it is impracticable  if  not  impossible  to  decide
    whether the alleged errors of law in the making of the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal are made out without in the  process  expressing  a
    view as to the merits of those arguments. Second, in any event, I  find
    no expressed view in my error of law decision  to  the  alleged  effect
    that,  "it  would  be  difficult  to  show  that  exclusion  would   be
    disproportionate because she has been  outside  the  country  for  five
    years." That phrase does not appear in my decision.

12. In the circumstances, I considered that it  was  in  the  interests  of
    justice to proceed with the  listed  continuation  hearing,  for  which
    court time had been allocated and for which Mr Wilding had prepared his
    submissions.

13. Before reaching any of my findings and conclusions in this case I  have
    carefully considered all of the material in the papers  before  me  and
    taken into account the submissions presented at the hearing  on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State.

14. I also note that the  claimant  remains  outside  the  UK,  settled  in
    Nigeria. She made no application to return to the UK for the purpose of
    her appeal, or to  give  evidence  by  video  link.  The  only  witness
    statement I have for her is that dated 24.2.12. There  is  no  evidence
    addressing her current circumstances in  Nigeria.  I  have  only  those
    material put before the First-tier Tribunal  on  which  to  assess  the
    claimant's case.

15. As referred to in my error of  law  decision,  there  is  a  convoluted
    history to the claimant's time in the UK. It is important to  ascertain
    the true nature of the claimant's status during periods of time she has
    spent living in the UK. I must  take  into  account  that  she  has  an
    appalling immigration history.

16. On 24.6.07 the claimant was refused leave to enter  at  port  when  she
    arrived from Nigeria on the basis of a valid visit visa issued  to  her
    in Nigeria. She claimed that she was going on to the USA where  two  of
    her children live. On questioning, it became clear  that  she  had  two
    children living in the UK, neither of whom had any  lawful  immigration
    status. In fact, the claimant first came to the  UK  in  1987  and  has
    contrived  by  various  means  to  remain  here  for  lengthy  periods,
    interspersed by returns to Nigeria. She  overstayed  a  visit  visa  in
    1998, remaining through to 2010. Her son was born her in 1999  and  her
    daughter joined her from Nigeria in 2000. In 2003  she  was  granted  3
    years' discretionary leave to remain outside the Rules.

17. An application for indefinite leave to remain was  refused  in  October
    2009 and a further application on the same basis was refused  in  March
    2010. As Judge Whalan explained at �6 the appeal was marked  as  having
    been lodged out of time and an application for extension  of  time  was
    refused. The claimant then lodged an application for  judicial  review,
    resulting in an injunction preventing her removal. However the Judicial
    Review application was refused in May 2010 and the  injunction  lifted.
    In consequence, the claimant was removed from the UK on 27.5.10, as the
    Secretary of State was entitled to do, and has not returned since.

18. Further Judicial Review proceedings were lodged, but in  January  2013,
    by consent, the JR application was withdrawn on the Secretary of  State
    agreeing to reconsider the application for an extension of time on  her
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 7.3.10.   Time
    was extended and the claimant's appeal  was  eventually  listed  before
    Judge Whalan on 1.9.14.

19. It is important to note that when the claimant was refused admission at
    port on 24.6.07, it was on the basis that she was seeking entry  for  a
    purpose other than that for which the visit visa had been  issued.  The
    claimant's period of discretionary leave outside the Rules  had  lapsed
    in 2006. She attempted to deceive immigration authorities into  letting
    her back into the UK by applying for a visit visa, stating that she was
    transiting to the USA to visit her children there, when in fact she had
    been living in the UK  on  and  off,  largely  without  leave,  working
    illegally, buying a house and living to all intents and purposes as  if
    she were settled in the UK. In those circumstances,  the  claimant  was
    refused admission but granted temporary admission for a period  of  two
    weeks only. Since that date she had no leave to enter the UK  and  that
    was her status when she applied unsuccessfully for leave to  remain  in
    2009. Her eventual removal in 2010  was  delayed  by  various  Judicial
    Review applications.

20. In summary, the appeal that is the subject matter of these  proceedings
    is against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 7.3.10, on the
    claimant's application of 27.10.09. The Secretary of  State's  decision
    is not a refusal of leave to remain, but a further refusal of leave  to
    enter, as is made clear  in  the  notice  of  immigration  decision  of
    7.3.10, because the claimant never  had  leave  to  enter  since  being
    refused in 2007.

21. Under section 82(2)(a) of the 2002 Act, there  is  a  right  of  appeal
    against an immigration decision which is a refusal of leave  to  enter.
    Section 85(4) provides that  on  an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  the
    Tribunal may  consider  evidence  about  any  matter  which  it  thinks
    relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence  which
    concerns a matter arising after the date of decision, subject  only  to
    the exceptions in section 85A(3), neither of which  apply.  It  follows
    that although the claimant is outside the UK,  this  is  an  in-country
    appeal (confusingly given an OA case reference) and the Tribunal should
    consider the circumstances appertaining at the date of this hearing, in
    other words the private life the claimant is continuing in Nigeria over
    the past 5 years. The Tribunal is not  restricted  to  considering  the
    claimant's private life at the date of the refusal  decision  in  March
    2010, when the claimant was still in the UK.

22. It is not clear why the 14 year long residence Rule was  argued  before
    or considered at all in the First-tier Tribunal.  Irrespective  of  the
    lengthy periods of absence breaking the continuity of residence, a long
    residence application is a route for leave to remain,  not  open  to  a
    person who has  been  refused  leave  to  enter.  Pursuant  to  section
    88(2)(d) a person  may  not  appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  an
    immigration decision taken on the grounds that he is seeking  to  enter
    or remain in the UK for a purpose other than one  for  which  entry  or
    remaining is permitted in accordance with Immigration  Rules.  However,
    section 88(4) permits an appeal on human rights  grounds  in  the  same
    circumstances. The claimant made her human  rights  representations  to
    the Secretary of State from within the UK and before the  decision  was
    made, and thus under section 92(3) she may bring an  appeal  against  a
    refusal of leave to enter the UK, on human rights grounds.

23. As  stated,  above  no  further  evidence  has  been  adduced  and  the
    claimant's witness statement is dated February  2012.  However,  it  is
    clear from the above chronology that  the  claimant  has  an  appalling
    immigration history. She has contrived to circumvent immigration  rules
    and immigration control by remaining in the UK on and off for  over  20
    years. But for her period of discretionary leave between 2003 and 2006,
    she has been living in the UK without leave and unlawfully, entering on
    various visit visas issued to her in Nigeria on the pretence  that  she
    had previously left the UK within the 6 months limit of such leave  and
    the false assertion that she intended no more than a short family visit
    and  would  leave  by  the  expiry  of  her  limited  leave.  In  those
    circumstances,  she  could  have  had  no  legitimate  entitlement   or
    expectation of being able to remain in the UK. During these periods  of
    unlawful presence, the claimant has  worked  illegally,  purchased  her
    council home, claimed state benefits, and  lived  as  though  she  were
    settled lawfully in the UK, until she was caught out in a lie in  2007.
    All of any private life developed in the UK was whilst her  status  was
    entirely precarious and, for the most part, unlawful.  It  would  be  a
    travesty to describe her  as  a  "law-abiding  tax  paying  citizen  of
    impeccable character," as she does at �12 of her witness statement.

24. The claimant does not meet the requirements of the Rules for  leave  to
    enter. Before going on to consider her claim outside the Rules  on  the
    basis of private life under article 8 ECHR, I have to consider  whether
    there are any compelling circumstances  justifying  granting  leave  to
    enter when she cannot meet the Rules and has in fact flouted and evaded
    the requirements of immigration control. I take into account everything
    set out in the papers before me  that  may  assist  the  appellant  and
    accept that  over  a  lengthy  period,  many  years,  she  developed  a
    substantial private life in the UK, one to which she was for  the  most
    part not entitled. In particular, I bear in mind her son  was  born  in
    the UK and apparently two children still  live  here.  There  are  also
    other family members here. She claims to  be  a  businesswoman,  buying
    commodities from all over the world for resale in the UK. However,  she
    was not entitled to set up or run any business  from  the  UK.  I  also
    accept that she will have established many social and business contacts
    with individuals,  groups  and  others  as  a  single  mother  of  five
    children, as claimed in �12 of her witness statement. She has had  long
    exposure to British culture and heritage.  In my view,  none  of  these
    circumstances or the other factors set out in the various papers before
    me amount to  compelling  circumstances.  The  situation  is  certainly
    extraordinary, and it is amazing that she managed to live  here  'below
    the radar' for such a lengthy period, but  it  is  not  compelling  and
    certainly does not justify granting leave to enter outside the Rules.

25. Even if I were to consider article 8 ECHR outside the  Rules,  applying
    the Razgar stepped approach to her claimed private life, of  which  the
    crucial factor is proportionality, I find,  for  the  reasons  set  out
    herein that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is  entirely
    proportionate and not disproportionate to her private life.

26. In considering the proportionality of the decision to refuse  leave  to
    enter, I am required to consider the public interest  consideration  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act, in particular that immigration control is
    in the public interest and the limited weight to be given to a  private
    life developed in the  UK  whilst  a  person's  immigration  status  is
    precarious. As AM (Malawi) held,  "A  person's  immigration  status  is
    'precarious' if their continued presence in the UK  will  be  dependent
    upon their obtaining a further  grant  of  leave."  Whatever  the  true
    chronology of the claimant's disputed absences and returns to  the  UK,
    it must follow that she was either unlawfully present, or, at the  very
    least, her immigration status was precarious. This is  highly  relevant
    to the proportionality assessment. As held in Dube (ss117A-117D) [2015]
    UKUT 00090 (IAC),  judges  are  duty-bound  to  "have  regard"  to  the
    specific considerations. The claimant can derive no assistance from the
    claimed command of English  or  alleged  financially  independence.  As
    emphasised in AM (s117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC),  "An  appellant
    can obtain no positive right to a grant of leave to remain from  either
    s117B(2) or (3), whatever the degree of his fluency in English, or  the
    strength of his financial resources."

27. Further, on the basis of Nasim & ors [2014] UKUT 00025,  article  8  is
    not intended to protect the private life of a person in the  claimant's
    circumstances. The decision does not impinge on her moral  or  physical
    integrity. More significantly, she has been able  over  the  past  five
    years to live within Nigeria and in reality the  private  life  that  I
    have to consider is not in the UK at all. There is nothing before me to
    suggest that she was not able to replicate  and  continue  her  private
    life in Nigeria, even if living conditions may not be as comfortable as
    those in the UK. I am not satisfied that the core private life  of  the
    claimant is in fact engaged at all on the facts of this case.

28. The principle that a person whose immigration status is precarious does
    in normal circumstances develop a private life protected by  article  8
    ECHR was established in Nasim,  where  the  Upper  Tribunal  considered
    whether the hypothetical removal of the 22 PBS claimants,  pursuant  to
    the  decision  to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would  violate  the   UK's
    obligations under article 8 ECHR. Whilst each case must  be  determined
    on its merits, the Tribunal noted that the judgements  of  the  Supreme
    Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC  72,  "serve  to  re-focus
    attention on the nature and purpose of article 8 of the  ECHR  and,  in
    particular, to recognise that article's limited utility in private life
    cases that are far removed from the protection of an individual's moral
    and physical integrity." The panel considered at length  article  8  in
    the context of work and studies. The respondent's case was that none of
    the  appellants  could  demonstrate  removal  would  have  such   grave
    consequences as to engage article  8.  �57  of  Patel  stated,  "It  is
    important to remember that article 8 is not a general dispensing power.
    It is to be distinguished from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to
    allow leave to remain outside the rules, which may be unrelated to  any
    protected human right... The opportunity for  a  promising  student  to
    complete his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in  general
    terms, is not in itself a right protected under article 8."

29. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

30. The panel pointed out that at this point on the continuum,

         "the essential elements of the private life relied on will normally
         be transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in
         their essential respects, following a person's return to their home
         country, (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its  limited  utility  to  an
         individual where one has  moved  along  the  continuum,  from  that
         Article's core area of operation towards what might be described as
         its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises, both from what  will  at
         that point normally be the tangential effect on the  individual  of
         the proposed interference and from the fact that, unless there  are
         particular reasons to  reduce  the  public  interest  of  enforcing
         immigration controls, that interest will  consequently  prevail  in
         striking the proportionality balance (even assuming that  stage  is
         reached)."

31. In the circumstances, I find both that the core  private  life  of  the
    claimant is not engaged and that even if it were engaged, the  decision
    is  not  disproportionate  given  the  background   and   history   and
    circumstances summarised above, including her claim to have  no  family
    or property in Nigeria and that she  has  survived  by  living  with  a
    succession of friends in difficult circumstances, of which there is  no
    satisfactory evidence other than the claim.  There is a  strong  public
    interest in maintaining immigration control and those factors that  may
    be deployed in the claimant's favour cannot and do  not  outweigh  that
    public interest, particularly given the claimant's immigration history.
    The claimant has failed to demonstrate that her core  private  life  is
    engaged on the facts of this case, particularly when considered at  the
    present date.

32. As stated above, there was no appeal or cross appeal in relation to the
    decision dismissing the appeal on immigration grounds and in respect of
    family life under article 8, and those parts of the decision must stand
    as made.

33. For the reasons set out above, the appeal must fail on both immigration
    and human rights grounds.

Decision:

         The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
