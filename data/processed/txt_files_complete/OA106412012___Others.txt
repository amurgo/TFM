                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Following remission of the appeal from the Court of Appeal, by  order  dated
23rd March 2015, for the purposes of permitting the Tribunal to undertake  a
reconsideration of the merits of the appeal by conducting a  proper  Article
8 balancing exercise taking into account the Appellants' circumstances.

And upon the parties agreeing the appeal shall be  remitted  to  the  First-
tier Tribunal as this task has not been undertaken by that Tribunal to  date
and to preserve the benefit of the right of an ongoing appeal to  the  Upper
Tribunal, if required

IT IS DIRECTED THAT:


      1. The appeal shall be remitted to Taylor  House  to  be  heard  by  a
         single salaried judge or panel nominated by the Resident  Judge  on
         15th February 2016 at 10.00 AM time estimate 2  hours.  Not  before
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Webb, Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins or any
         judge working at Wilson Solicitors LLP.

      2.  The  parties  must  file  and  serve  consolidated,  indexed,  and
         paginated bundles of all the evidence they intend to rely  upon  no
         later  than  4.00pm  29th  January  2016.  Evidence  not  filed  in
         accordance with this direction shall not be  admitted  without  the
         express permission of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to  which
         an application for permission must be filed before  the  expiration
         of the permitted time with a detailed explanation for the delay and
         proposed date of filing.

      3. A Somali Afreerhamar interpreter is required.
