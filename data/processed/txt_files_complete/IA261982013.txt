Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the continuation of an appeal by the Secretary of State against
    the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge S A Rowlands in which he
    allowed the appeal of the Claimant, a citizen of Jamaica,  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to refuse to issue a derivative Residence
    Card as confirmation of the Claimant's right to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom. Following a hearing on 8 April 2015 we allowed  the  Secretary
    of State's appeal to the extent that we set aside the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be remade by the Upper Tribunal.  We now proceed
    to remake that decision and in doing so will refer to  the  parties  as
    they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.


Background

 2. The Appellant applied on 18 January 2012  for  a  derivative  Residence
    Card as confirmation of a right to reside in the  United  Kingdom.  His
    application was based upon his relationship with his two  children  who
    are both British citizens born in the United Kingdom on 24 August  2006
    and 31 December 2010. The  application  was  refused  by  reference  to
    regulations 15A (4A) and 15A (7) of the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 (as amended) on 6 June 2013 because the  Appellant,  living  as  a
    family with his wife and children, could  not  be  described  as  their
    primary carer. Although in refusing the decision the Respondent did not
    make removal directions the Respondent stated  in  the  refusal  notice
    "you should now make arrangements to leave (the country). If  you  fail
    to make a voluntary departure a separate decision may be  made  ...  to
    enforce your removal from the United Kingdom".

 3. The Appellant exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    and in doing so did not challenge  the  decision  made  under  the  EEA
    regulations but asserted  that  the  decision  was  in  breach  of  his
    protected  rights  under  Article  8  ECHR  due  to  his  private  life
    established in the United Kingdom since his arrival here  in  1999  and
    his family life with his wife and two children.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal allowed his appeal but in doing so made  errors
    of law identified in our decision following  the  hearing  on  8  April
    2015. In making that decision we concluded that it was clear given what
    was known about the Appellant's circumstances and in view of the stated
    requirement to leave the country Article 8 was engaged (see JM  v  SSHD
    [2006] EWCA Civ 1402; [2007] Imm AR 293).

 5. In those circumstances and with the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    being confined to Article 8 ECHR it is on that  basis  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal now considers this appeal. In doing so the Appellant's  status
    under the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  is  relevant  in  that  the
    Appellant gave evidence to the First-tier  Tribunal,  accepted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, that his status had always been lawful.



The hearing



 6. At the hearing before us the Appellant was represented by  the  Ms  Lee
    who submitted a written skeleton argument,  a  copy  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal decision in Edgehill v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402, a copy  of  the
    Life in the UK test passed by the Appellant on 1 August  2011  together
    with the bundle that was before the First-tier  Tribunal.  Mr  Richards
    represented the Secretary of State and submitted a copy of the Court of
    Appeal decision in Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

 7. In opening submissions Mr Richards, referring to the assertion  in  the
    skeleton argument that the Appellant met the requirements of  paragraph
    276B(i)(b) of the Immigration Rules, said that no application had  been
    made under the rules. At the time of the  application  and  indeed  the
    decision the Appellant did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276B(i)(b). Further when the decision was made the 14  year  continuous
    residence rule was no longer in  existence.  Mr  Richards  referred  to
    Haleemudeen as authority for the argument that it was the rules of  the
    date of the decision that applied and in any event the 14 year  accrual
    was not reached until after the appeal process had started

 8. So far as the factual basis of the appeal is concerned Mr Richards said
    that he was happy that the evidence shows that the Appellant  is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage and jointly cares  for  his  two  young
    children.

 9. For the Appellant Ms Lee submitted that the assertion in  her  skeleton
    argument was justified because the application was submitted  prior  to
    the change in the Immigration Rules at a time when paragraph 276B(i)(b)
    was still in force. She accepted  that  it  was  not  until  after  the
    Respondent's decision and at a time when paragraph  276B(i)(b)  was  no
    longer in force that the Appellant would have met it  requirements  but
    argued that nevertheless the Appellant should be able to  benefit  from
    its provisions.


Oral evidence.

10. The Appellant gave  oral  evidence  and  adopted  his  written  witness
    statement. He accepted that he had misunderstood his situation and that
    the assertion in paragraph 2 and that his status in the  UK  had  never
    been illegal was incorrect. Nevertheless he said  that  he  had  always
    understood  his  situation  to  be  legal  because  he  still  had   an
    outstanding application and appeal. He accepted that he  had  no  valid
    leave  to  remain  since  2006  and  added  that  he  had  always  made
    applications thereafter to remain. He understood now that  he  had  not
    had legal status since 2006. The Appellant confirmed that he  is  still
    married and has been married nearly 10 years. He said that  he  has  no
    immediate family in Jamaica.

11. Cross-examined by Mr Richards the Appellant  said  that  his  wife  was
    aware of his pending appeal when they were married in 2004 and they had
    not discussed what would happen if that  appeal  was  unsuccessful.  He
    said they always believed that something would be sorted out, this  was
    never discussed but they had faith.

12. The Appellant said that he  works  as  a  barber.  His  wife  has  just
    finished a teaching course. Asked if there was any reason  why  he  and
    his wife could not go to work in Jamaica the Appellant said that he had
    never checked. He came to the United Kingdom straight  from  school  in
    1999.

13. Answering further questions from Ms Lee the  Appellant  said  that  his
    children were aged seven and three. They  both  attend  Upper  Horfield
    Community School and Nursery in Bristol and are doing well. He referred
    to a letter from the school. He drops them to school and picks them  up
    and supports them in their school activities.

14. The Appellant said that he wanted to stay in United Kingdom because the
    system here is the best for the children, his elder child enjoys school
    and the younger enjoys nursery. The children are in close contact  with
    other family members  in  United  Kingdom.  They  have  cousins  living
    locally who they see weekly. All of them go to the same  church  except
    the Appellant's mother and sister. His elder child performs  in  church
    every few months. The Appellant is a key-holder of the Church and  also
    an usher. He is involved in  a  leadership  role  organising  follow-up
    ministries, gospel concerts and managing the Church football  team.  He
    and the family are settled and established in Bristol and  their  lives
    would be impacted substantially if they  all  had  to  go  to  live  in
    Jamaica. There is a lack of security in Jamaica with a lot of crime and
    violence. They are safe here.

15. The Appellant said that he works six days a week as  a  barber  earning
    �270 to �300 per week on a self-employed basis. His gross income  shown
    by his tax return is in the region of �12,000 per annum.  He  does  not
    claim any benefits. Where necessary he is supported by the  Church  and
    his family. His wife has just finished her studies and has had a job as
    an examination invigilator. She is looking  for  a  permanent  teaching
    job. His wife obtained a degree in engineering and was employed in that
    area afterwards but stopped working when their daughter was born.

16. The Appellant said that only speaks English. He used to speak  Jamaican
    Creole. He has no health problems. His wife receives child  tax  credit
    and child benefit. The property they live in is rented and they pay �94
    per week. It has two bedrooms.

17.  Elsie  Brown,  the  Appellant's  wife,  gave  evidence  and  answering
    questions from Ms Lee adopted her written statement. She said that  she
    has completed her teacher training course and hopefully has a job as  a
    maths teacher in the City of Bristol  College  starting  in  September.
    Until now she has been doing temporary and agency work.  She  confirmed
    that she will be teaching  maths  at  GCSE  and  A-level.  The  witness
    confirmed that  she  had  an  engineering  degree  and  had  been  made
    redundant from her previous employment.

18. Cross-examined by Mr Richards the witness agreed that when she  married
    the Appellant in 2004 she was aware of his status. She went ahead  with
    the marriage because she loved him. If he was sent back to Jamaica  she
    would not go with him but would stay here with the children.  They  did
    not have any children in 2004. She has never been to Jamaica.

Submissions

19. On  behalf  of  the  Respondent  Mr  Richards  relied  on  his  earlier
    submissions. Paragraph 276B(i)(b) does not apply, the new rules  apply.
    The Respondent does not intend to split the family.  The  key  question
    taking into account paragraph Ex.1 of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules now in force is whether it is  reasonable  to  expect  the  elder
    child  to  relocate  to  Jamaica.  Mr  Richards  said   that   in   the
    circumstances it was reasonable. The  Appellant  is  Jamaican.  He  has
    lived here for the last eight years but has no claim to  remain.  There
    are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family  living  together  in
    Jamaica. Mr  Richards  said  that  having  heard  the  evidence  he  is
    satisfied that the Appellant is a truthful witness who has  been  doing
    his best to assist the court he is happy for him to be  accepted  as  a
    witness to the truth. However there are no compelling reasons  why  his
    case should be considered outside the rules. Even taking  into  account
    the best interests of the children it is clear that if the  family  all
    go to Jamaica they  will  remain  a  family  unit.  If  the  matter  is
    considered outside the Immigration Rules then the  wider  interests  of
    society need to be considered against the rights of the individuals.

20. For the Appellant Mr Lee  relied  on  her  skeleton  argument  and  her
    earlier submissions. If the appeal is  not  considered  under  the  old
    Immigration Rules it can only be considered under Article  8.  In  this
    respect it is not reasonable to expect the Appellant's eldest child  to
    leave the United Kingdom. She was born and is established in the United
    Kingdom and all of her  family  and  social  ties  are  here.  We  were
    referred to the evidence in the Appellant's bundle  and  in  particular
    the evidence from the school. Equally it is not  reasonable  to  expect
    the Appellant's wife and younger child to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    They are British citizens who have never been to Jamaica. There  is  no
    suggestion that the Appellant is or will  become  a  burden  on  public
    funds.


Decision


21. There are three core issues for us to consider. The  first  is  whether
    the application should be considered  under  the  long  residence  rule
    applicable at the time the application was made. The second is  whether
    the Appellant's situation should be considered outside the terms of the
    EEA regulations and the Immigration Rules. The third, dependent  on  an
    affirmative answer to the second question, is whether the  Respondent's
    decision is in breach the Appellant's rights protected by Article 8  of
    the Human Rights Convention.

22. So far as the first issue  is  concerned  this  appeal  relates  to  an
    application made for a derivative residence card as confirmation  of  a
    right to reside in the United Kingdom. It was never an application  for
    leave to remain; it was an application that could only  have  succeeded
    if the Appellant  already  had  the  right  to  reside  under  the  EEA
    regulations. The application was unsuccessful  and  the  Appellant  now
    recognises that he did not have the right to reside. To suggest that an
    application  which  was  never  one  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration Rules should nevertheless be considered on appeal in such a
    manner and further that the appeal should be allowed on the basis  that
    the Appellant, at the date of the appeal hearing but not  the  date  of
    the application or even the Respondent's decision, met a requirement of
    the rules as they existed at the date of the application but not at the
    date of the decision or the appeal hearing cannot have any merit.  This
    is not to say that the length of the Appellant's residence  should  not
    be factored into the proportionality balance if the Appellant's  appeal
    falls to be considered under Article 8 ECHR but it cannot  be  factored
    into the balance that the Appellant would have met the  long  residence
    requirements of the rules because he did not and could not.

23. Turning to the question of whether the Appellant's situation should  be
    considered outside the terms of the  EEA  regulations  and  Immigration
    Rules the first point to emphasise is that in our error of law decision
    we  did  not  find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by
    considering Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention. To  the  contrary
    we found that it was clear that Article 8 was  engaged  (paragraph  8).
    The grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  include  Article  8
    grounds and this is a ground of appeal provided for by  Schedule  1  to
    the EEA regulation and section 84(c) of the 2002 Act.  The  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal suggested only that the judge was wrong to
    consider Article 8 because no removal directions  had  been  made.  The
    grounds do not suggest, as Mr Richards put forward in submissions, that
    there are no compelling reasons why the current situation should not be
    considered outside the terms of the immigration rules.

24. This is an Appellant whose private life in the United Kingdom commenced
    15 years ago when he arrived in the United Kingdom as a student and who
    lives with his wife and family in the United Kingdom enjoying a  family
    life that has been established since before his marriage some 10  years
    ago. The family enjoy a private life that has been established over  an
    equally long period and which includes close connections with the local
    community in Bristol  and  two  children  attending  local  school  and
    nursery who have never known life in another country.  All  the  family
    speak English, the Appellant is  self-sufficient  and  the  Appellant's
    British Citizen wife is about to embark  on  a  new  career  where  the
    likely remuneration will ensure that the family remain self-sufficient.
    Mr Richards was at pains to accept the credibility of the Appellant and
    his wife. It is important in this regard to note  that  the  Appellant,
    although he now accepts that he was wrong to do so,  has  believed  his
    presence in the United Kingdom to be lawful throughout his time here.

25. If compelling reasons were needed to  consider  the  situation  of  the
    Appellant outside the terms of the EEA regulations and the  immigration
    rules  then  we  are  satisfied  that  such  reasons  exist.  In  Nagre
    (paragraph 30) Sales J states

        " after the process of applying the new rules and finding that  the
        claim for leave to remain under them fails, the  relevant  official
        or tribunal judge considers it clear that the  consideration  under
        the rules has fully addressed  any  family  life  or  private  life
        issues arising under Article 8 it would be sufficient to simply  to
        say that"

    and in paragraph 34

        "in cases where consideration of  the  new  rules  does  not  fully
        dispose of a claim based on Article 8, the Secretary of State  will
        be obliged to consider granting leave outside the rules".

26. In our judgement it is abundantly clear that Article 8, as  pleaded  in
    the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, must  be  considered.
    In the first place, and for the reasons that we have given,  there  are
    compelling reasons to do so but in the second place and  in  any  event
    the regulations under which the decision to  refuse  was  made  do  not
    fully address the family and private life issues arising.

27. In considering Article 8 we are assisted by Mr Richards' acceptance  of
    the Appellant's credibility and in any  event  make  our  own  positive
    decision in this respect. We have no doubt that the Appellant has lived
    in the United Kingdom since the age of 17, that  he  has  believed  his
    status to be lawful throughout, that  he  has  never  had  recourse  to
    public funds or otherwise been a burden  on  the  state,  that  he  has
    enjoyed a family life with his wife since sometime in 2001,  that  they
    have been married since December 2004 and that they have  two  children
    now aged seven (almost 8) and three. Following the Razgar principles we
    are satisfied that Article 8 is engaged in respect of both private  and
    family life. Because, despite his erroneous belief, the Appellant  does
    not have leave to remain in the United Kingdom and has  not  held  such
    leave since 2006 we are satisfied that  the  Respondent's  decision  is
    lawful and in pursuance of the legitimate aim of  immigration  control.
    So we move on to proportionality.

28. On the positive side of the proportionality  balance  this  is  a  long
    established, subsisting and secure the family unit in which  the  three
    of the four members are British citizens and where  it  would,  in  our
    judgement, be wholly unreasonable to expect them to re-establish family
    life in Jamaica, a country where the three British citizens have  never
    been. The maintenance of effective immigration control is of course  in
    the public interest and in considering the public interest question  we
    have had particular regard to the provisions of section 117A, 117B  and
    117D Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014. We are bound  to  do  so  because  although  this
    appeal was heard just prior to the commencement of section 117  we  are
    considering and making our decision after commencement and in any event
    the public interest must be a continuum. Section 117 states:

        117A Application of this Part
        (1)      This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required to
        determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
           (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private and family
        life under Article 8, and
           (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
        Rights Act 1998.
        (2)      In considering the public interest question, the court or
        tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
           (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B,
        and
           (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to
        the considerations listed in section 117C.
        (3)      In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means
        the question of whether an interference with a person's right to
        respect for private and family life is justified under Article
        8(2).


        117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
        cases
        (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
        the public interest.
        (2)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
        interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
        persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
        to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
        (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
        (b) are better able to integrate into society.
        (3)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
        interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
        persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
        financially independent, because such persons-
        (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
        (b) are better able to integrate into society.
        (4)      Little weight should be given to-
        (a) a private life, or
        (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that is
        established by a person at a time when the person is in the United
        Kingdom unlawfully.
        (5)      Little weight should be given to a private life
        established by a person at a time when the person's immigration
        status is precarious.
        (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
        the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
        (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
        with a qualifying child, and
        (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
        United Kingdom.


        117D Interpretation of this Part

        (b) do not include a person who has been sentenced to a period of
        imprisonment of that length of time only by virtue of being
        sentenced to consecutive sentences amounting in aggregate to that
        length of time;
        (c) include a person who is sentenced to detention, or ordered or
        directed to be detained, in an institution other than a prison
        (including, in particular, a hospital or an institution for young
        offenders) for that length of time; and
        (d) include a person who is sentenced to imprisonment or detention,
        or ordered or directed to be detained, for an indeterminate period,
        provided that it may last for at least that length of time.
        (5)      If any question arises for the purposes of this Part as to
        whether a person is a British citizen, it is for the person
        asserting that fact to prove it.

29. In this consideration we note that the Appellant speaks English and  is
    financially independent.  At  the  time  the  Appellant  commenced  his
    private life in this country and when he  and  his  wife  formed  their
    relationship and married he had leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.
    In our judgement the Appellant's immigration status was not  precarious
    when he established his private life between 1999 and 2006 and  whereas
    it may have become precarious thereafter this was  not  appreciated  by
    the Appellant.

30. In weighing the positive against the negative  in  the  proportionality
    balance we have  had  particular  regard  to  the  public  interest  as
    required by statute. In our judgement the balance falls  overwhelmingly
    in the Appellant's favour. The positive aspects as detailed  above  are
    clear both in relation to family and private life. The statutory public
    interest factors are in the specific circumstances  of  this  Appellant
    matters that weigh in the Appellant's favour. The Appellant's status in
    the United Kingdom by virtue of his failure to meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules or the EEA regulations is the only matter that we
    can identify that could conceivably  be  seen  as  a  negative  in  the
    proportionality balance and  this  almost  wholly  ameliorated  by  our
    finding that, whatever the reality, the Appellant always  believed  his
    status to be lawful.

31. The Appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  both  of
    his children. Both are  British  citizens  and  therefore  "qualifying"
    children within the terms of section 117D above. The  Appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife  who,  as  a  British
    Citizen, is a "qualifying partner". The relationship with his wife  was
    not formed at a time when the  Appellant  was  in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully. In our judgement, as stated above, it would be unreasonable
    to expect either child to leave the United Kingdom both  of  whom  were
    born here, are established in school and nursery here, have established
    relationships here  and  have  close  relatives  here  with  whom  they
    interact on a regular basis including  cousins,  uncles,  aunts  and  a
    grandmother. It is  therefore  not  in  the  public  interest  for  the
    Appellant to be removed.

32. It follows that  in  our  judgement  the  Respondent's  decision  is  a
    disproportionate interference in the Appellant's established family and
    private life in the United Kingdom and that  his  appeal  is  therefore
    allowed.



 Summary

33. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and has been set aside.

34. We remake the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  allowing  the
    Appellant's  appeal  by  virtue  of  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention.
