For the Respondent:        Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting

1. An application for leave to  remain  which  is  not  accompanied  by  the
specified fee is not a valid application (regulation 16 of  the  Immigration
and Nationality (Cost Recovery  Fees)  Regulations  2007  (S.I.  2007/936)).
Subsequent payment does not affect the earlier invalid application.

2. Except in the case of cash payments, an application is  "accompanied  by"
a fee for the purposes of  regulation  16  if  it  is  accompanied  by  such
authorisation (of the applicant or other person purporting to pay)  as  will
enable the respondent  to  receive  the  entire  fee  in  question,  without
further recourse having to be made by the respondent to the payer.



   NOTICE UNDER RULE 9 OF THE ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION TRIBUNAL (PROCEDURE)
                                 RULES 2005


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Mauritius born on 13 March 1965, had  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom as a student until  29  February  2008.
    The appellant wished to obtain further leave to remain as a student  at
    Inter-Continental College.  On  20  February  2008,  she  sent  to  the
    respondent a completed application form for such further leave.  It  is
    common ground  that  the  appellant  was  required  by  reason  of  the
    Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2007 to pay a fee of  �295  in
    connection with that application.  The appellant's  husband  filled  in
    details of his debit card number, card expiry date and the  last  three
    digits on the back of the card.  He wrote his full name in the relevant
    space provided in the form, which is prefixed by  the  words  "Name  on
    card".

2.   On 3 March 2008 the respondent wrote to the  appellant  to  inform  her
    that she had not made the required payment of the fee.  Having  checked
    with her husband, it was apparent that there was no shortage  of  funds
    in the husband's bank account.  The appellant realised  that  the  only
    possible disparity was that her husband had written his  full  name  on
    the form, rather than his initials and surname, which was the  way  his
    name appeared on his debit card. The appellant accordingly  resubmitted
    the form, this time with her husband's name as it appeared on his debit
    card.  The husband's bank account details indicate that the payment  to
    the respondent of the fee was cleared in the husband's  account  on  10
    March 2008.

3.   On 4 April 2008  the  respondent  decided  to  refuse  the  appellant's
    application  on  the  basis  that  Inter-Continental  College  was  not
    registered with the DFES and that the appellant had not shown that  she
    could maintain herself.  The notice of decision also said this:-

         "You made an application on 06 March 2008.  However, your leave  to
         enter/remain expired on 29 February 2008.  You  therefore  did  not
         have leave to remain at the time of your application.


         There is no right of appeal against this decision.


         You have no right to stay in the United Kingdom so are liable to be
         removed. You must leave as soon as possible.  If you do  not  leave
         voluntarily, you  may  be  prosecuted  for  an  offence  under  the
         Immigration Act 1971, the penalty for which is  a  fine  of  up  to
         �2,500 and/or up to six months' imprisonment and you will  also  be
         liable to be removed from the United Kingdom to Mauritius."

4.   The appellant nevertheless purported to appeal to the Tribunal.  On  10
    July 2008 at Taylor House her appeal came before an Immigration  Judge,
    who heard evidence from the appellant and her husband.  The Immigration
    Judge found both of  them  to  be  credible.   He  concluded  that  the
    appellant could maintain herself without recourse to public funds.   He
    also found, by reference to a computer printout of 9  April  2008  that
    Inter-Continental College was on the register of education and training
    providers. The respondent has not taken issue with those findings.

5.   There is no express reference in the determination to the  question  of
    whether  the  appellant  had  a  right  of  appeal.  The  closest   the
    Immigration Judge got to that issue was  in  the  following  unreasoned
    finding:

         "21. Finally, I find that the appellant's application was  made  in
         time."

6.   The Immigration Judge purported to allow the  appellant's  appeal.   On
    13 August 2008  reconsideration  of  his  decision  was  ordered  under
    section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on the
    application of the respondent, who contended that the Immigration Judge
    had provided no reasons for his finding in paragraph 21  and  that  the
    application purported to have been made by the appellant on 20 February
    2008 was invalid, having regard to the provisions  of  the  Immigration
    and Nationality (Cost Recovery Fees) Regulations 2007.

7.   The Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2007  (SI  2007/807)  came
    into force on 15 March 2007.  The order was made in pursuance of powers
    conferred on the Secretary of  State  by  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006,  having  been  laid  before  and  approved  by  a
    resolution of each House of Parliament.  The power to  make  the  order
    was conferred by section 51(1) and (2)(a).  Section 51(1) empowers  the
    Secretary of State to require an application  or  claim  in  connection
    with immigration or nationality to be accompanied by a specified fee.

8.   Article 3(1)  of  the  2007  Order  provides  that  an  application  in
    connection with  immigration  or  nationality  to  which  that  article
    applies must be accompanied by the fee for the time being specified  in
    relation to the application in question in regulations made under 51(3)
    of the 2006 Act.  Article 3(2)(b) provides  that  the  article  applies
    (inter alia) to applications for variation of leave to enter, or remain
    in, the United Kingdom given in accordance with the provisions  of,  or
    made under, the Immigration Act 1971.   Article  3(2)(b)  thus  plainly
    covers variations of leave under the Immigration Rules.

9.   The Immigration and Nationality (Cost Recovery Fees)  Regulations  2007
    (SI 2007/936) came into force on 2  April  2007.   They  were  made  in
    exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by  sections
    51(3) and 52(3) of the 2006 Act.  Section 51(3) provides:-

         "(3) Where an order under this section provides for  a  fee  to  be
             charged, regulations made by the Secretary of State -


             (a)  shall specify the amount of the fee,


             (b)  may provide for exceptions,


             (c)  may confer a discretion to reduce, waive or refund all or
                  part of the fee,


             (d)  may make provision about the consequences of  failure  to
                  pay a fee,


             (e)  may make provision about enforcement, and


             (f)  may make provision about the time or period of time at or
                  during which a fee may or must be paid."

10.   Regulation  4(1)  provides  that,  subject  to  exceptions  not   here
    relevant, in the case of an application to which article 3(2)(a) or (b)
    of the 2007 Order applies, where the application is for  limited  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom -

    (a) as a student;

    (b) to resit an examination;

    (c) to write up a thesis;

    (d) as a student union sabbatical officer; or


    (e)  as a prospective student,

    under the Immigration Rules, the fee  is  as  specified  in  regulation
    4(2). Regulation 4(2)(a) specifies a fee of  �500  for  an  application
    made by a  person  at  a  Public  Inquiry  Office  of  the  Border  and
    Immigration Agency of the Home Office.   For  an  application  made  by
    post, regulation 4(2)(b) specifies a fee of �295.  As we  have  already
    seen, that is the sum which the appellant eventually paid by  means  of
    her husband's debit card.

11.  Regulation 16 is entitled "Consequences  of  failing  to  pay  the  fee
    specified for an application".   It reads as follows:

         "16. -  (1)   Subject to paragraph (2),  where  an  application  to
                  which regulation 4, 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 refers is  to  be
                  accompanied by a specified fee, the application  will  not
                  be considered to have been validly made unless it has been
                  accompanied by that fee.


             (2)  An application referred to in regulation 3 or 4 which  is
                  made prior to 21 May 2007 will be treated as  having  been
                  validly made regardless of whether the  fee  specified  in
                  respect of that application has been paid.


             (3)  The Secretary of State may treat an application  referred
                  to in paragraph (2) as withdrawn  if,  having  written  to
                  inform the  person  who  made  the  application  that  the
                  specified fee has not  been  provided,  that  fee  is  not
                  provided within 28 days of the letter having been posted."

12.  As we have seen, section 51(3)(d) of the 2006 Act specifically  enables
    an order to be made so as to make provision about the  consequences  of
    failure to pay a fee.  It is quite clear from regulation 16, read as  a
    whole, that a distinction is being drawn between the post-21  May  2007
    situation and applications made prior to that date. In the latter case,
    a period of grace is, in effect, being  provided  to  those  applicants
    who, for whatever reason, failed to pay the requisite fee  when  making
    the application.  On the facts of the  present  case,  the  appellant's
    application would have been in time, had she  made  it  before  21  May
    2007.  The post-21 May regime, by contrast, is plainly intended to be a
    strict  one.    Unless  the  fee  accompanies  the  application,   that
    application "will not be considered to have been validly made".   Those
    words apply to the Tribunal, in cases (such as the present)  where  the
    validity  of  an  application  arises,  as  much  as  they  do  to  the
    respondent.

13.  Regulation 4(2)(a) prescribes a considerably higher fee in the case  of
    applications made in person, compared with applications made  by  post.
    Even in the case of personal applications, it can be assumed that many,
    if not most, payments of fees will in practice be by means  of  cheques
    or debit or credit card payments.  In the case of postal  applications,
    cash payments are presumably out of the question.

14.  What, then, is meant by "accompanied by that fee" in  cases  where  the
    payment is intended to be effected by means of a cheque or credit/debit
    card?  I consider that the only sensible interpretation of those  words
    in such cases is that the  application  must  be  accompanied  by  such
    authorisation (of the applicant or other person purporting to  pay)  as
    will enable the respondent to  receive  the  entire  fee  in  question,
    without further recourse having to be made by  the  respondent  to  the
    payer.

15.  On the facts of the present case, the application which  the  appellant
    purported to make on 20 February 2008 cannot be considered to have been
    validly made.  A valid application was only made on 3 March  2008  when
    the appellant, according to her statement of 9 April 2008, "amended the
    details requested and posted the form back again".  By that  time,  her
    leave had expired, with the result that the respondent could not decide
    to vary that leave, or refuse to vary it. The March  application  could
    not breathe life into the earlier invalid application.  The refusal  to
    grant leave to remain is  not  an  "immigration  decision"  within  the
    meaning of Part V (Immigration and Asylum Appeals) of the 2002 Act (see
    section 82(2)).  The appellant accordingly had no right  of  appeal  to
    the Tribunal and the Immigration  Judge  materially  erred  in  law  in
    finding that the application was "in time" and in his implicit  finding
    that there was jurisdiction to allow the appeal.

16.  Mr Sauhoboa submitted on behalf of the appellant that  this  result  is
    harsh.  On the facts of this case,  it  undoubtedly  is.   Mr  Sauhoboa
    submitted that Parliament, in permitting the 2007 Regulations  to  pass
    into  law,  cannot  have  expected  the  Regulations   to   have   such
    consequences.  He did not, however, suggest how else  regulation  16(1)
    should be interpreted; nor did he submit that regulation 16(1) fell  to
    be treated by me as ultra vires sections 51 and 52 of the 2006 Act.  In
    any event, however, I do not consider that regulation 16(1) can be said
    to be perverse or otherwise unlawful. The concept of requiring  payment
    with an application is hardly novel. The most obvious means of ensuring
    such payments are made is to preclude  applications  from  being  valid
    unless accompanied by the requisite fee.  There will in practice  be  a
    wide range of reasons why an application is  unaccompanied  by  a  fee,
    ranging from deliberate deceit or omission  to  innocent  inadvertence.
    Any system which expressly seeks to distinguish between  various  kinds
    of failure risks being administratively unworkable.

17.   Mr Sauhoboa submitted  that  the  respondent  could  and  should  have
    replied earlier than 3 March. If this had happened, say, by  return  of
    post, the appellant would have  been  able  to  rectify  the  situation
    before 29 February. That might be so, although the  respondent's  delay
    cannot be said to be so extreme as to smack of  maladministration.  But
    in any event a criticism of this kind cannot entitle  the  Tribunal  to
    disregard the plain intention and effect of regulation 16 and  arrogate
    to itself a jurisdiction it  does  not  possess.  Indeed,  one  of  the
    effects of (and perhaps intentions behind)  the regulation  may  be  to
    encourage applicants who are in a  position  to  do  so  to  apply  for
    variations in good time before the end of their existing leave,  rather
    than leaving it to very near the end, as often seems to be the case.

18.  The consequence for the appellant in  the  present  case  is  that  she
    never had a valid appeal to the Tribunal and  the  Immigration  Judge's
    determination, purporting to allow that appeal, cannot stand.  However,
    as I indicated at the hearing, I would very strongly recommend that the
    respondent  consider  granting  the   appellant   leave   outside   the
    Immigration Rules.  Whatever the legal position, the Immigration  Judge
    presided over a hearing on 10 July at which the substantive grounds  on
    which the respondent had decided to refuse to  grant  leave  to  remain
    were thoroughly examined, in the presence of a Presenting Officer,  who
    cross-examined the appellant  and  her  husband.   As  I  have  already
    stated, the Immigration Judge found both to be  entirely  credible  and
    further found  that  Inter-Continental  College  was  on  the  relevant
    register. The explanation for the failure to pay is also  credible  and
    falls very much at the bottom end of the range described  in  paragraph
    16 above.

Decision

19.  I find that there is no valid appeal before the Tribunal.
