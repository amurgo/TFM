Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr L Youssefian, instructed by Living Spring
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  allowing  AA's  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to  refuse  his  human  rights  claim
    further to the making of a deportation order pursuant to section  32(5)
    of the UK Borders Act 2007.

 2. For the purposes of this decision, we shall hereinafter  refer  to  the
    Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent  and  AA  as  the  appellant,
    reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 20 August 1984. He  first
    came to the UK on 5 February 1986, aged 18 months, with his mother,  as
    a visitor, and was subsequently granted indefinite leave to  remain  on
    30 June 1999 on the basis of his long residence  in  the  UK,  together
    with his family. From 18 March 2004 he  amassed  five  convictions  and
    nine offences. Those included  a  conviction  on  2  February  2007  of
    possessing a Class A controlled drug - cocaine, with intent to  supply,
    for which he was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment, and in light  of
    which he was served with a notice  of  intention  to  deport  which  he
    successfully appealed  on  human  rights  grounds  in  July  2007.  His
    subsequent conviction, on 18 February 2015, was for the index  offence,
    acquire/use/possess criminal property, for which he was sentenced on 20
    March 2015 to 18 months' imprisonment. The offence was  in  fact  money
    laundering, whereby the appellant was found with around ï¿½2000 which was
    mostly  derived  from  the  sale  of  Class  A  drugs.  Following  that
    conviction the appellant was served with  another  decision  to  deport
    pursuant to the UK Borders Act 2007. He submitted human rights  grounds
    in response to that decision and on  7  September  2015  a  deportation
    order was signed against him together with a  decision  to  refuse  his
    human rights claim. Subsequent to various challenges by way of judicial
    review and further submissions, the respondent made a new  decision  on
    21 August 2017 to refuse the appellant's human rights claim,  which  is
    the subject of this appeal.

 4. In that decision the respondent gave consideration to  the  appellant's
    relationship with his partner, Ms A, and his partner's  son  F  from  a
    previous relationship, the loss of the appellant's unborn child due  in
    December 2016 and to his mental health.  The  respondent  accepted  the
    appellant's relationship with his partner and step-child, both of  whom
    were British citizens, but considered that it would not be unduly harsh
    for Ms A to relocate to Nigeria with the appellant or for her to remain
    in the UK whilst he  was  deported.  The  respondent  did  not  accept,
    therefore, that the requirements of the  exception  to  deportation  in
    paragraph 399 were met. Neither was it accepted that the appellant  met
    the requirements of the exception in paragraph 399A on the basis of his
    private life as, although it was accepted that  he  had  been  lawfully
    resident in the UK for most of his life, it was not  accepted  that  he
    was socially and culturally integrated in the UK or that there would be
    very significant obstacles to integration in  Nigeria.  The  respondent
    did  not  accept  that  there  were   very   compelling   circumstances
    outweighing the public interest in the appellant's deportation.

 5. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal  was  heard
    in the First-tier Tribunal on 3 April 2019 by Judge  Black.  The  judge
    noted that the appellant and his partner had a son  born  in  2017  and
    that the evidence was that he had extensive family in  the  UK  and  no
    family or friends in Nigeria and had only visited Nigeria once with his
    mother for a holiday a number of years previously. The  judge  accepted
    that the appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  his
    partner and child and a close relationship with his partner's child  F,
    albeit not a parental relationship. The judge accepted that it would be
    unduly harsh for the appellant's partner to relocate to Nigeria as  she
    was a British citizen and her son F would be separated from his  father
    but did not accept that it would be unduly harsh for them to remain  in
    the UK whilst the appellant was deported. The judge accepted  that  the
    appellant had lived lawfully in the UK for most of his life and that he
    was socially and culturally integrated in  the  UK,  but  she  did  not
    accept  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
    integration in Nigeria. Having then gone on to consider the appellant's
    offending, the nine -year gap in  convictions,  the  low  risk  of  re-
    offending and low risk of harm, the appellant's  mental  health  issues
    and his significant private life in the UK the  judge  concluded  that,
    whilst she considered the case to  be  border-line,  the  circumstances
    were nevertheless very compelling and the appellant's deportation would
    be disproportionate. She accordingly allowed the appeal.

 6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by the respondent
    on the grounds that the judge had erred in  law  by  finding  that  the
    appellant  could  meet  the   stringent   test   of   very   compelling
    circumstances and had failed to identify what made this  a  case  where
    that threshold had been met, and  that  she  had  failed  to  give  the
    requisite weight to the public interest.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  all
    grounds.

 8. In a skeleton argument submitted subsequent to the filing of a Rule  24
    response, the appellant cross-appealed in a challenge  to  the  judge's
    finding that there were no very significant  obstacles  to  integration
    and that his deportation would not be unduly harsh on his  partner.  It
    was otherwise submitted that the respondent's grounds of appeal were no
    more than a disagreement with the judge's  properly  made  findings  on
    "very compelling circumstances".

 9. At the hearing before us both parties made submissions. Mr Lindsay  was
    content for the appellant to pursue the cross-appeal and we accept that
    he was able to do so, in light of the  guidance  in  Smith  (appealable
    decisions; PTA requirements; anonymity) [2019] UKUT 216.

10. Mr Lindsay expanded upon the grounds of appeal challenging the  judge's
    findings on "very compelling circumstances", submitting  that  she  had
    erred in her reliance upon Maslov v Austria - 1638/03 [2007]  ECHR  221
    and had failed to identify anything that was very  compelling  and  had
    failed to consider the relevant issues including the  strength  of  the
    public interest. Mr Youssefian, in his  response,  submitted  that  the
    judge had identified very compelling circumstances based not only  upon
    the appellant's length of residence in the UK but also the low risk  of
    re-offending, the nine year gap in convictions and  other  matters  and
    was entitled to conclude that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  be
    disproportionate,  particularly  given  the  factors  set  out  in  his
    skeleton argument and the period in which the appellant was entitled to
    apply for naturalisation  as  a  British  citizen.  There  was  nothing
    perverse in the judge's findings.

11. Both parties made submissions on the cross-appeal, with  Mr  Youssefian
    submitting that the judge had failed  to  take  into  account  material
    matters such as the appellant's vulnerability due to his mental  health
    difficulties when  concluding  that  there  were  no  very  significant
    obstacles to integration and failed to give proper consideration to all
    relevant factors when concluding that it would not be unduly harsh  for
    the appellant's partner to be separated from him.

12. We have no hesitation in concluding that both challenges are made  out.
    Whilst the Court of Appeal held in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department & Ors [2016] EWCA Civ 662 that matters relevant
    to the exceptions in paragraphs 399 and 399A of the  immigration  rules
    may  also  be  relevant  to   an   assessment   of   "very   compelling
    circumstances", that did not mean that the same matters which failed to
    meet the exceptions could then simply be used to  succeed  under  "very
    compelling circumstances", which is what the judge appears to have done
    in this case. We agree with Mr Youssefian that the judge did  not  rely
    solely on the appellant's length of residence in the UK in reaching her
    conclusion on very compelling circumstances, but we  fail  to  see  any
    particular matters identified by the judge other than those relevant to
    the assessment of  the  exceptions  in  paragraphs  399  and  399A  and
    certainly  no  identification  of  any  circumstances  that  could   be
    considered to  reach  the  high  threshold  of  being  very  compelling
    circumstances. That is particularly pertinent when considering that the
    judge found the  appellant's  case  to  be  "border-line",  a  somewhat
    unusual term to be used when concluding that a case is very compelling.
    As Mr Lindsay submitted, the appellant's family ties in the UK and lack
    of meaningful ties to Nigeria are not matters setting this case  apart,
    in the absence of any compelling features above the  considerations  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A. We cannot accept that a gap in the appellant's
    offending and a low risk of re-offending are matters of a  particularly
    compelling nature when considered together with the fact  that  he  had
    offended  again  after  previously  being  subjected   to   deportation
    proceedings. Whilst the judge  acknowledged  that  that  was  a  factor
    militating against the appellant, we agree with  Mr  Lindsay  that  the
    public interest was  not  fully  appreciated  or  accorded  appropriate
    weight by her in such circumstances.

13. We cannot agree with Mr Youssefian that the factor listed at [36(k)] of
    his skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal, namely the period
    in which the appellant was entitled to apply for  naturalisation  as  a
    British citizen, was a matter accorded  weight  by  the  judge  in  her
    assessment of "very compelling circumstances", particularly  as  it  is
    not clear from the last line of [26] of her decision that  that  factor
    was taken into account at all in her  assessment  and,  in  any  event,
    there was no proper engagement with the issue and no explanation as  to
    why that would be a compelling feature. The only other  notable  matter
    accorded weight by the judge in her paragraph  398  assessment  is  the
    appellant's  mental  health  issues,  yet  there  is  again  no  proper
    engagement with that matter and no explanation as to the level  of  the
    appellant's difficulties in that respect such as to  make  his  overall
    circumstances very compelling.

14. Indeed, it is particularly pertinent  when  observing  that  the  judge
    included the appellant's mental health difficulties in  her  assessment
    of very compelling circumstances, that that did not feature at  all  in
    her consideration of whether there were very significant  obstacles  to
    integration under paragraph 399A.  On  that  basis  we  find  that  the
    judge's  findings  on  very  significant   obstacles   are   also   not
    sustainable, having omitted consideration of what she went on to accord
    weight as a material matter for the purposes of paragraph 398.

15. For all of these reasons we agree with the respondent that the  judge's
    reasons for concluding that there were  very  compelling  circumstances
    were materially flawed. Likewise, we agree with the appellant that  the
    judge's assessment of the  exceptions  to  deportation  was  materially
    flawed. We therefore set aside the decision in its entirety.  It  seems
    to us that the appropriate  course  would  be  for  the  matter  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh, as  indeed  was
    the indication from both parties.



DECISION

16. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside.

17. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal pursuant  to  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and
    Practice Statement 7.2(b), to be heard  before  any  judge  aside  from
    Judge GA Black.




    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an  order  pursuant  to  rule  13  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014. We continue that order pursuant to rule 14 of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
