Decision: the application for judicial review is granted


Introduction

  1. These judicial review proceedings, issued on 21 June  2019,  challenge
     the respondent's decision dated 25 March 2019 granting the  applicants
     limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom rather  than  indefinite
     leave to remain.

Procedural history

  2. The applicants are citizens of Pakistan and were born on 4 March  1990
     and 7 February  1992,  respectively.  Their  immigration  history  and
     procedural background is as follows.

  3. On 15 July 2006 the applicants entered the United Kingdom  with  their
     mother as visitors. Their mother applied for asylum on 11 August 2006,
     with the applicants listed as child dependants. That  application  was
     refused on 11 September 2006 with an  in-  country  right  of  appeal,
     which was itself dismissed on 7 December 2006. The applicants'  appeal
     rights were exhausted on 28 February 2007.

  4. On 10 May 2007 and 11 June  2009,  the  applicants  submitted  further
     submissions, which were refused on 29 March  2010  with  no  right  of
     appeal.

  5. On 21 July 2010, the applicants  sought  a  reconsideration  of  their
     asylum claim under the 'Legacy' scheme. In  response,  the  applicants
     forwarded a completed Legacy questionnaire under  cover  of  a  letter
     dated 22 December 2010.  The  applicants  were  granted  Discretionary
     Leave (DL) on 30 September 2012, valid until 29 September 2015.

  6. By way of a letter dated 15 June  2013,  the  applicants  requested  a
     grant of ILR. There does not appear to have been a  response  to  that
     request.

  7. The applicants made an in-time application for a further grant  of  DL
     on 14 September 2015. That application was granted on  11  March  2016
     and was valid until 10 March 2019.

  8. The applicants made a second request for a grant of ILR on 17  October
     2018. The respondent replied on 25 October 2018, refusing that request
     and explaining that the  applicants  were  on  the  10-year  route  to
     settlement because the initial grant of DL was made after 9 July 2012.
     Three further requests for ILR were made between 30 October  2018  and
     27 November 2018 which met with the same response from  the  Secretary
     of State, the last response dated 13 March 2019.

  9. On 25 March 2019, the applicants were granted DL  until  12  September
     2021.

 10. The applicants sent pre-action protocol correspondence on 3 May and 22
     May 2019 in response to which the respondent maintained her  position,
     by way of a letter dated 29 May 2019.

 11. Both the original and renewed grounds argued firstly, that  there  was
     lack of clarity and irrationality in the decision-making process;  and
     secondly, that there was a legitimate expectation  for  the  grant  of
     ILR.

 12. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by Upper  Tribunal
     Pitt following an oral hearing on 3 September 2019, on  the  following
     basis:

        "It is arguable that the applicant's (sic) made an  application  for
        leave prior to 9 July 2012 that had not been decided by  that  date,
        that the grants of 36 months of leave and not  30  months  indicated
        that they were on the 6 year track to ILR, not the  10  year  track,
        and that the respondent relied on incorrect transitional  provisions
        in refusing to grant ILR."

 13. The respondent provided detailed grounds of defence, dated 1  November
     2019, in which it was requested that  all  aspects  of  the  claim  be
     dismissed, and that the applicants  meet  the  respondent's  costs  of
     defending this challenge.  The  arguments  made  on  the  respondent's
     behalf were as follows.  It was  common  ground  that  the  applicants
     could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules. It  was  not
     accepted that the applicants were entitled to  be  granted  settlement
     under the Asylum  Policy  Instruction  on  Discretionary  Leave  dated
     August 2015 because they were first granted DL after 9 July  2012;  it
     was irrelevant that they initially applied before that date  and  that
     they had not completed a period of 10 years' DL. Furthermore,  it  was
     not accepted that the transitional provisions in the API on DL applied
     because they were granted DL for similar  reasons.  It  was  contended
     that even had the applicants been granted DL before 9 July  2012  this
     would not entitle them to a grant of ILR after accrual of 6 years' DL.
      That the applicants were granted  two  periods  of  DL  of  3  years'
     duration was not the yardstick for a  grant  of  ILR.  Addressing  the
     grounds directly, it was argued that the initial grant  of  DL  for  3
     years was incapable of giving rise to a legitimate  expectation  of  a
     grant of ILR and there was no  promise  by  the  respondent  that  the
     applicants would be granted ILR on completion of 6 years' DL.  It  was
     not accepted  that  there  was  a  lack  of  clarity  giving  rise  to
     illegality or irrationality in the  decision-making  process.  Lastly,
     that the applicants were legacy cases was said to add nothing to their
     claim because this did not entitle them to the grant of leave.

 14. The applicant's skeleton argument was received on 15 January 2020. The
     grounds set out in the judicial review  application  continued  to  be
     relied upon and can be summarised as follows.  The  first  ground  was
     characterised as a failure by the respondent, in granting  further  DL
     rather than ILR, to follow  policy.  The  relevant  policy  being  the
     exceptional circumstances proviso in paragraph 5.1 of the API on DL of
     August 2015 which allowed for a departure from the usual  position  of
     granting 30 months' DL and for the person in question  being  eligible
     to apply for settlement after 6 years'  DL  rather  than  10.  It  was
     argued that the applicants fell firmly within the ambit of that policy
     and that there were no cogent reasons to justify departure from it. As
     for the second ground, the argument was that the policy made a  clear,
     unambiguous  statement,  devoid  of  relevant   qualification,   which
     established that the sole requirement for  ILR  (excepting  exclusion)
     was two grants of DL of 3 years' duration.

 15. The applicant sought the  following  outcome;  that  the  respondent's
     decision of 25 March 2019 be quashed.

The Relevant Law

Discretionary Leave policy 2009

     Standard Period for Different Categories of Discretionary Leave

     It will normally be appropriate to  grant  the  following  periods  of
     Discretionary Leave to those qualifying under the categories  set  out
     above. All categories will need to complete  at  least  six  years  in
     total, or at least ten years in excluded cases, before being  eligible
     to apply for ILR.

     Article 8 cases - three years

     Article 3 cases - three years

     Other ECHR Articles - three years

Asylum Policy Instruction:  Discretionary  Leave  (Version  7.0;  18  August
2015)

     "5.1 Exceptional circumstances

     Where  removal  is  no   longer   considered   appropriate   following
     consideration of the exceptional factors set out in paragraph 353B  of
     the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  guidance  in  Chapter  53  of   the
     Enforcement Immigration  Guidance  (EIG),  30  months'  DL  should  be
     granted, unless one of the following situations applies:

     ...

      . where the UK Border Agency (as it was) made a decision either before
        20 July 2011 or before 9 July 2012 that a  grant  of  leave  on  the
        grounds then listed in Chapter 53 was  not  appropriate,  but  after
        that date reconsidered that decision and - on the basis of the  same
        evidence (i.e. the evidence available to the original caseworker)  -
        it is decided that the earlier decision was wrong and  leave  should
        have been granted

     Where the above applies and the relevant date was before 20 July 2011,
     Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) outside the rules should be  granted.
     This is because before 20 July 2011 ILR was normally granted in  cases
     which met the exceptional circumstances criteria in Chapter 53.  Where
     the above applies and the relevant date was before 9 July 2012,  three
     years' DL  should  be  granted,  with  the  person  normally  becoming
     eligible to apply for settlement after 2 periods of  3  years'  DL  (6
     years' continuous leave). This is because from 20 July 2011 to 8  July
     2012 the UK Border Agency (as it was) granted 3  years'  DL  in  cases
     that met the exceptional circumstances criteria in Chapter 53.

     ...

     10.1 Applicants granted DL before 9 July 2012

     Those granted leave under the DL policy in force before  9  July  2012
     will normally continue to be dealt with under that policy  through  to
     settlement if they continue to qualify for further leave on  the  same
     basis as their original DL was granted (normally they will be eligible
     to apply for settlement after accruing  6  years'  continuous  DL  (or
     where appropriate a combination of DL and LOTR, see section 8 above)),
     unless at the date of decision they fall within the  restricted  leave
     policy.

     Caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances prevailing at  the
     time of the original grant of  leave  continue  at  the  date  of  the
     decision. If the circumstances remain the same,  the  individual  does
     not fall within  the  restricted  leave  policy  and  the  criminality
     thresholds do not apply, a  further  period  of  3  years'  DL  should
     normally be granted. Caseworkers must consider whether there  are  any
     circumstances that may warrant departure from the standard  period  of
     leave. ..."

The hearing

 16. The  parties  made  succinct  oral  submissions  in  line  with  their
     respective written  arguments.  In  addition,  each  made  submissions
     concerning the recent judgment in R (on the application  of  Ellis)  v
     Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (discretionary  leave
     policy; supplementary reasons) [2020] UKUT 82 (IAC).

 17. Mr Symes argued that the decision was useful to his arguments and that
     there was nothing in the applicants' case to render  it  abnormal.  He
     relied on headnote 2, in particular:

        "The Home Office discretionary leave policy should not  be  read  as
        saying that, once it is decided  that  an  individual  continues  to
        qualify for further leave on the  same  basis  as  before,  he  must
        automatically be granted indefinite leave to remain after  6  years'
        continuous discretionary leave unless at the  date  of  decision  he
        falls within the restricted leave policy.  The  word  'normally'  is
        used advisedly, so as to maintain the maximum  possible  discretion.
        Where a policy governs what is to happen  in  the  normal  case,  it
        remains open to the decision-maker to take a different course  in  a
        particular case, provided he or she takes account of the policy  and
        has reason for considering the case to be abnormal."

 18. Mr Malik submitted that there was no obligation on the  respondent  to
     grant ILR and that the natural words used  in  the  policy  should  be
     applied, having regard to the context.

 19. At the end of the hearing, I reserved my judgment.

Discussion

Ground one - irrationality/failing to follow published policy

 20. In reaching  this  decision,  consideration  has  been  given  to  the
     representatives' written and oral argument as well  as  the  documents
     before me.

 21. The applicants' case turns on whether their situation fell within  the
     exceptional circumstances to the August 2015 DL policy.  For  ease  of
     reference I will set this out again here.

        "Where the UK Border Agency (as  it  was)  made  a  decision  either
        before 20 July 2011 or before 9 July 2012 that a grant of  leave  on
        the grounds then listed in Chapter 53 was not appropriate, but after
        that date reconsidered that decision and - on the basis of the  same
        evidence (ie the evidence available to the original caseworker) - it
        is decided that the earlier decision was wrong and leave should have
        been granted."

 22. It is evident from the chronology in this case  that  the  applicants'
     circumstances fell squarely within  this  policy.  They  were  refused
     asylum as child dependents and had exhausted their appeal rights as of
     28 February 2007. Thereafter their case was  put  by  way  of  further
     representations to the Secretary of State on 10 May 2007 and  11  June
     2010. Those submissions were rejected as  fresh  claims  on  29  March
     2010, however the circumstances of the family as a whole were reviewed
     under the "legacy" exercise, which resulted in a  grant  of  DL  of  3
     years' duration on 30 September 2012.

 23. That grant of leave was consistent with paragraph 5.1  of  the  August
     2015 exceptional circumstances proviso that

        Where the above applies and the relevant  date  was  before  9  July
        2012, three years' DL should be granted, with  the  person  normally
        becoming eligible to apply for  settlement  after  2  periods  of  3
        years' DL (6 years' continuous leave).

 24. In the applicants' case, the respondent made a decision before both 20
     July 2011 and 9 July 2012 (the decision of 29  March  2010)  that  was
     reversed on the same evidence following the "legacy"  process.  As  Mr
     Malik rightly argued in his DGD, there was no entitlement to the grant
     of any particular type of leave in such cases. Indeed,  in  SH  (Iran)
     [2014] EWCA Civ 1469, Davis LJ said the following at [43]:

        "... the policy applicable to the cases in the legacy  programme  to
        be applied by CRD (and later CAAU) remained at  all  material  times
        the general law as it stood at  the  time  of  consideration  of  an
        applicant's case in the same way as elsewhere in UKBA.... The legacy
        programme created no new rights."

 25. The second period of DL granted to  the  applicants  was  also  for  a
     period of 3 years, rather than 30 months and was similarly  consistent
     with the published guidance. According to  that  guidance,  after  two
     periods of 3  years  DL  people  in  the  applicants'  position  would
     "normally" become eligible  to  apply  for  settlement.  There  is  no
     indication in this case of any reasons for the Secretary of  State  to
     conclude that  there  was  anything  abnormal  about  the  applicants'
     circumstances which would justify a departure from the policy.

 26. The decision of 25 March 2019 merely states that the  grant  of  leave
     was made "in accordance with the published Home Office  Asylum  Policy
     Instruction on Discretionary Leave." The respondent granted DL  rather
     than ILR without any regard to the Exceptional Circumstance proviso in
     the policy in question. The failure to follow  published  guidance  is
     unlawful, applying Mandalia [2015] UKSC 59.

 27. Accordingly, the applicants succeed on the first ground.

Ground two - legitimate expectation

 28. I am bound by what was held in Odelola [2009] UKHL 25 at [39]:

        "I have no doubt that the changes in the immigration  rules,  unless
        they specify to the contrary, take effect  whenever  they  say  they
        take effect with regard to all leave applications, those pending  no
        less than those yet to be made."

 29. Similarly, in relation  to  the  respondent's  policies  and  guidance
     documents, with reference to Rahman [2011] EWCA Civ 814, at [45]:

        "... a minister is entitled to review, to change and to  revoke  his
        policy whenever he considers it to be in the public interest  to  do
        so."

 30. In Mehmood (legitimate expectation) [2014] UKUT 00469 (IAC), the Upper
     Tribunal held:

        "The first question in every case concerning an  alleged  legitimate
        expectation is  whether  the  public  authority  concerned  made  an
        unambiguous representation,  promise  or  assurance  devoid  of  any
        relevant qualification."

 31. The previous DL policy of 2009 was in place when  the  applicants  put
     their circumstances to the respondent on 22 December 2010. While  this
     policy normally granted DL for a period of 3 years, that  the  initial
     grant of DL to the applicants was also for three years  was  incapable
     of giving rise to a legitimate expectation for  the  grant  of  ILR  6
     years later.

 32. There was no such "unambiguous representation,  promise  or  assurance
     devoid of any relevant qualification," referencing Mahmood;  that  the
     applicants would be granted ILR on completion of 6 years of DL.  There
     is no such indication on the  face  of  the  2009  policy  or  in  the
     correspondence from the Secretary of State. Accordingly, it cannot  be
     said that the previous  policy  created  an  express  and  unequivocal
     written representation that consecutive grants of 3 years' leave would
     entitle the applicants to apply for ILR and this ground fails.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
applicant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3
