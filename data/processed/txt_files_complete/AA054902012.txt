For the Respondent:    Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) This determination refers to parties  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

2) The appellant is a citizen of Iraq, born in 14 July 1993.

3) The SSHD appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Quigley, promulgated on 20 July 2012, dismissing the  appellant's  appeal
   on asylum grounds but allowing it in respect of  humanitarian  protection
   and under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

4) The SSHD's first ground of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  that  the
   judge materially misdirected herself about  the  risk  of  indiscriminate
   violence as defined in Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive,
   about country guidance, and about the country situation as at the date of
   her decision.   Mr Winter accepted that the  ground  discloses  error  of
   law.

5) That concession was sensibly made.  The determination  does  not  justify
   its conclusions in respect of humanitarian protection and of  Articles  2
   and 3 of the ECHR.

6) The SSHD's second ground of appeal is this:

      Failing to give reasons or adequate reasons for findings on a material
   matter.


      ... The judge has failed to consider the 5 step approach ... in Razgar
      [2004] UKHL 27 and, in not doing  so,  has  failed  to  give  adequate
      reasoning for [her] finding that to  remove  the  appellant  would  be
      disproportionate.


7) Mr Mullen pointed  to  the  facts  of  the  case,  and  argued  that  the
   reasoning is inadequate to explain why a  decision  was  reached  in  the
   appellant's favour.

8) I was not persuaded that the SSHD's grounds  show  error  of  law  as  to
   Article 8.

9) The appellant entered the UK, was arrested, and  made  his  claim  on  12
   January 2009, aged 15ï¿½.  Thus, as the judge found at paragraph 34, he has
   spent his "early adult and personal development years" here.   He  has  a
   girlfriend.  It seems that his girlfriend has a child, but the  appellant
   has no relationship with  that  child.   He  had  significant  supporting
   evidence in respect of his private life.  That was not  an  outstandingly
   strong Article 8 case, but the SSHD has not argued that it is  one  which
   no reasonable judge, properly instructing herself on the law, could  have
   reached.  In a case which arrives at the proportionality question, it  is
   immaterial that the five Razgar questions were not individually  set  out
   and answered.  The judge sets out all relevant  matters  on  both  sides.
   She does not say in terms  that  she  balances  the  public  interest  in
   immigration control against the points in the appellant's favour, but she
   could hardly have thought that she was doing anything else.  The SSHD may
   disagree with the outcome, and it may be a generous one which  would  not
   have been reached by many judges, but that is not the same  as  error  of
   law.

10) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal, insofar as it allowed  the
   appeal in respect of humanitarian protection and under Articles 2  and  3
   of the ECHR, is set aside.  A  decision  is  substituted  dismissing  the
   appeal, as originally  brought  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  in  these
   respects.  Insofar  as  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   dismissed the appeal on asylum grounds and allowed it under Article 8  of
   the ECHR, it shall stand.

11) For avoidance of doubt, the overall effect  is  this:   the  appeal,  as
   originally brought to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  stands  as  allowed  on
   Article 8 grounds only.

12) An anonymity order remains in place.
