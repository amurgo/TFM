                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a  citizen  of  Bangladesh  whose  date  of  birth  is
    recorded as 2nd January 1992.  He first arrived in the  United  Kingdom
    on 7th February 2013.  His leave was  granted  until  29th  June  2016,
    though on 6th March 2015 his leave was curtailed.  On 2nd February 2017
    he claimed international protection as a refugee.   The  basis  of  his
    claim was that he was homosexual.  The Secretary of State  refused  the
    application on 21st July 2017.  He appealed.  His appeal was  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal D Ross on 27th July  2018  sitting  at
    Taylor  House.   Judge  Ross  found  the  Appellant's  account  lacking
    credibility and dismissed the appeal.  Not content with  that  decision
    by Notice dated 26th September 2018 the Appellant sought permission  to
    appeal.  At first instance Judge Grant-Hutchison refused permission  on
    the basis firstly that the application was out of time and that in  any
    event, there was no merit in the grounds.  A  renewed  application  was
    made to the Upper Tribunal and on 14th  December  2018  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Perkins granted permission, thus the matter comes before me.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The grounds run to sixteen paragraphs.   Though  Judge  Grant-Hutchison
    refused permission,  rather  helpfully  she  has  summarised  what  the
    Grounds of Appeal are and I use her summary for the  purposes  of  this
    decision.

 3. It was submitted that the judge erred:

      a) by failing to apply the case of HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC  31  and  the
         background evidence to the facts and circumstances of the case;

      b) in not recognising the Appellant is a gay man he would be in danger
         on return;

      c) by focusing too much on the Appellant's credibility without  taking
         into account the evidence from the Appellant's friends which  ought
         properly to have been taken on its own merits.  Although there  are
         some contradictions and anomalies in the Appellant's  account,  the
         vital point is that the essential core of  his  claim  and  account
         still stands, namely that he is gay;

      d) by failing to take into account that the  Appellant's  relationship
         with his father had seriously broken down and that  he  would  have
         grave difficulties at the  hands  of  his  family  on  an  enforced
         return;

      e) by  failing  to  take  into  account  the  Appellant's  gay-related
         activities in the United Kingdom and that there has been no attempt
         to belatedly concoct a case of his being a gay man;

      f) by speculating the reason for the  Appellant's  delay  in  claiming
         asylum;

      g) by not addressing  important  evidence/legal  opinion  of  the  CLP
         lawyer from Dhaka;

      h)  by  failing  to  consider  humanitarian  protection,  Article   3,
         paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and Article 8.

 4. I am mindful of guidance given by McCombe LJ in the  case  of  VW  (Sri
    Lanka) [2013] EWCA Civ 522 in which at paragraph 12 he said:

         "Regrettably, there is an increasing tendency in immigration cases,
         where a First-tier Tribunal Judge has given a  judgment  explaining
         why he has reached a particular decision, of seeking to burrow  out
         industriously areas of evidence that have  been  less  fully  dealt
         with than others and then to use this as a  basis  for  saying  the
         judge's decision is legally flawed because it did not deal  with  a
         particular matter more fully.  In my judgment, with  respect,  that
         is no basis on which to sustain a proper  challenge  to  a  judge's
         finding of fact".

 5. The core  of  the  Appellant's  case  was  that  he  formed  homosexual
    relationships with two men in particular, one by the name of  Alvi  and
    the other by the name of Dhrubo.  These relationships  were  discovered
    by the Appellant's father and sister respectively.

 6. In refusing the Appellant's account Judge Ross pointed to a  number  of
    inconsistencies.  The judge was concerned to  note  that  although  the
    Appellant was claiming  that  were  he  to  be  returned  he  would  be
    prosecuted in respect of an offence  involving  a  neighbour's  son  in
    Bangladesh, that was not mentioned at all in the statement produced for
    the Appellant for the purposes of the hearing.  The statement  for  the
    hearing referred only to Alvi and Dhrubo.  Judge  Ross  took  the  view
    that the activities with  Akbar  were  in  fact  at  the  core  of  the
    Appellant's case because it was as a consequence of  the  risk  of  the
    prosecution being pursued against him on return that the Appellant  was
    principally at risk.  In his screening interview however, it was  noted
    that the Appellant had said that he had never been  accused  of  having
    committed an offence for which he could have been convicted.

 7. There were various court documents upon which the Appellant  sought  to
    rely but the judge was of the view  that  such  documents  were  easily
    obtainable in Bangladesh and so he was  not  willing  to  attach  great
    weight to them.  Further, Judge Ross considered  that  Akbar's  father,
    whom it was said was responsible for the commencement  of  proceedings,
    would not have commenced proceedings implicating his own son when  such
    would make public what had occurred and so disgrace the family.

 8. In a letter dated 21st June 2017 the Appellant had stated as well as in
    interview  that  he  had  been  threatened  by  fundamentalist  Islamic
    organisations, yet again such was not mentioned in the statement.

 9. Still further, the judge noted that the Appellant sought to argue  that
    he was at risk because of an association with a  man  by  the  name  of
    Julhaz Mannan who was murdered on account of his having started an LGBT
    magazine.  This, in the judge's view, was a cause  c�l�bre,  but  there
    was, the judge found, no sufficient evidence of association between the
    Appellant and the gay rights activists apart  from  some  documents  in
    respect of which the judge was unwilling to attach much weight.

10. The judge then went on to look at the  timescale  and  noted  that  the
    Appellant did not claim asylum despite having considerable time to have
    done so until February 2017, about two years after his arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom.

11. If that were the end of the matter, I  would  have  had  no  difficulty
    whatsoever in finding that this was a decision which was unimpeachable.
     However, the Appellant called two witnesses.  The first,  a  Mr  Sohel
    Ahmed who gave evidence not only that he knew the Appellant to  be  gay
    but also that he, Mr Ahmed, had had sex with the Appellant.   Mr  Ahmed
    described himself as a professional dancer  and  gay  rights  activist.
    His evidence went  further.   Mr  Ahmed  said  that  he  had  seen  the
    Appellant at a meeting of gay people and that he, Mr  Ahmed,  had  seen
    the Appellant kissing a person which, though not stated by the judge, I
    take to be a  man.   Additionally,  evidence  was  received  from  Rony
    Hussain.  He gave evidence that he had met the Appellant in a gay  club
    in December 2017.  His evidence was that  he  had  seen  the  Appellant
    indulging in sexual activity with a group of men.

12. The judge dealt with that evidence in this way:

         "The most powerful evidence which the Appellant has brought to show
         that he is gay comes from the evidence of his friends.   He  claims
         that he is not in touch with his most  recent  boyfriend.   I  have
         carefully considered the evidence  given  by  his  gay  friends  of
         seeing him at gay clubs, and other  events,  but  in  view  of  the
         anomalies and contradictions in  his  case,  I  have  come  to  the
         conclusion that I can place little weight on their  evidence.   For
         these reasons I conclude that the Appellant is not a homosexual and
         will not be at risk on return to Bangladesh".

13. For the Secretary of State  Ms  Kenny  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    considered all the evidence in the round and that at paragraphs  21  to
    26 the judge was highlighting  the  inconsistencies.   There  was,  she
    submitted, a particular inconsistency which  she  suggested  undermined
    the Appellant's case to such extent that there was no material error in
    any event that could be identified in the decision.  At paragraph 6  of
    his witness statement the Appellant said that he had not disclosed  his
    homosexuality in his  application  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    because he had been extremely hesitant to disclose the fact.   He  went
    on to say that he had preferred to hide the secret, though he  went  on
    to say that he was left with no alternative  but  to  disclose  it  and
    forced to claim asylum because of the threats of his father.   However,
    at paragraph 9 the Appellant was for saying that he had actively  acted
    in  a  homosexual  way  when  in  Bangladesh.   More  particularly,  at
    paragraph 9 of the Decision and Reasons the  judge  recorded  that  the
    Appellant had lived openly as a gay man since his arrival in the United
    Kingdom.  If having arrived in the  United  Kingdom  and  having  lived
    openly, then it made no sense that he was for saying that he wanted  to
    hide the fact.  Be that as it may, I am  concerned  by  the  manner  in
    which the judge so readily dismissed the evidence of the two witnesses.
     Although this is not a medical  case  the  guidance  in  the  case  of
    Mibanga [2005] EWCA Civ 365 is apposite:

         "24. It seems to me to be axiomatic that  a  fact-finder  must  not
             reach his or her conclusion before surveying all the  evidence
             relevant  thereto.   Just  as,  if  I  may  take  a  banal  if
             alliterative example, one cannot make a  cake  with  only  one
             ingredient, so also frequently one cannot make a case, in  the
             sense of establishing its truth, otherwise than by combination
             of a number of pieces of evidence.  Mr Tam, on behalf  of  the
             Secretary  of  State,  argues  that  decisions   as   to   the
             credibility of an account are to be taken by the judicial fact-
             finder  and  that,  in  their  reports,  experts,  whether  in
             relation to medical  matters  or  in  relation  to  in-country
             circumstances, cannot  usurp  the  fact-finder's  function  in
             assessing credibility.  I  agree.   What,  however,  they  can
             offer, is a factual context in which it may be  necessary  for
             the fact-finder to survey the allegations placed  before  him;
             and such context may prove  a  crucial  aid  to  the  decision
             whether or not to accept the truth of them.   What  the  fact-
             finder does at his peril is to reach a conclusion by reference
             only to the Appellant's evidence and then, if it be  negative,
             to ask whether the conclusion should be shifted by the  expert
             evidence".

14. I appreciate that the evidence of the  two  witnesses  was  not  expert
    evidence but equally, where in my  judgment  the  judge  erred  was  to
    conclude that the two witnesses  could  not  be  credible  because  the
    Appellant's  account  had  inconsistencies  within  it.   One  did  not
    necessarily follow the other.  The core of  the  Appellant's  case  was
    that he was homosexual.  The questions that the judge might have  asked
    himself were why would two men  both  come  to  the  Tribunal  to  give
    evidence that they were homosexual, and in the case of one of them that
    he had engaged in homosexual sex with the  Appellant?   Still  further,
    there was evidence that the  Appellant  had  been  associating  in  gay
    company.  Of course, the fact that someone  is  heterosexual  does  not
    mean that they might not have gay friends but in what circumstances did
    the Appellant find himself if it were the case, that he  was  attending
    gay meetings?  In other words, there was a failure on the part  of  the
    judge sufficiently to analyse the evidence given by the  two  witnesses
    other than to reject it on the  basis  that  the  Appellant's  evidence
    lacked credibility.  This was a flawed approach.

15. I find that the error is material because whether or not the  Appellant
    is gay is at the very core of the case.  The rejection of the  evidence
    of two witnesses on a  flawed  premise  clearly  puts  the  finding  in
    jeopardy, indeed so much so that I set it aside to be re-made.  I  have
    considered whether I can re-make the case but without  actually  having
    seen those witnesses, and without there having  been  a  more  thorough
    investigation of the concerns to which I have alluded, I  do  not  feel
    that I am able to make the finding without more that the  Appellant  is
    homosexual.  In the circumstances the better course in my  view  is  to
    set the decision aside to be re-made before another judge in the First-
    tier Tribunal to be listed at Taylor House, not before Judge Ross.   As
    I understand it  no  interpreter  was  required  but  it  may  be  that
    enquiries should be made of the solicitors to ascertain whether in fact
    that is the case.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law
and is set aside to be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal by a  judge  other
than Judge D Ross.
