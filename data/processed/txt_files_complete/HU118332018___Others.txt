Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M. Toesef, Counsel instructed by Global Migration

For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. There are three appellants.

    2. On 20 June 2018, the Tribunal gave  directions  that  the  appellants
       were to supply the Tribunal with grounds of appeal not later than  27
       June 2018.  Failure to comply with the  direction  was  expressed  to
       result in the dismissal of the appeals.  Such an order dismissing the
       appeals was duly made by First-tier Tribunal Judge Doyle on 17 August
       2018.

    3. Unbeknownst to Judge Doyle, the  appellants  had  complied  with  the
       direction.  A covering letter enclosing grounds of  appeal  dated  26
       June 2018 was sent by Global Migration Solutions (UK) Limited.  I  am
       satisfied that this was sent by fax transmission on 26 June  2018  at
       10.05 (7 pages) as evidenced by the transmission sheet.

    4. I do not fully understand the means by which this matter has come  to
       my attention at a hearing of the Upper Tribunal.  There may have been
       other routes by which this matter might have  been  remedied.   I  am
       unaware that this was made the subject of a grant of appeal.  Be that
       as it may, either a Judge sitting in the Upper Tribunal or as a First-
       tier Tribunal Judge, I set the decision of Judge Doyle aside.

    5. This effect of this order is that  the  appellants  are  entitled  to
       pursue their appeal in the First-tier Tribunal as would have occurred
       had Judge Doyle known that the directions had been complied with.

    6. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for the  appeal  to  be
       heard.

DECISION

  The Judge made an error on a point of law and I set aside the decision of
  Judge Doyle.  The appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
  hearing.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                                27 June 2019
