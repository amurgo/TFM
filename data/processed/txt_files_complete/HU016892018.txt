Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Walker promulgated on 17th December 2018 dismissing his appeal  on  the
    basis of his human rights in  relation  to  an  application  for  entry
    clearance considered automatically on the basis of his being  an  adult
    dependent relative, but in the context of his being the son of  a  late
    former Gurkha soldier, Mr Dil Prasad Rai, and being  sponsored  by  his
    mother Mrs Phul Sari Rai, the Sponsor and widow of  the  late  Mr  Rai.
    The decision of Judge Walker was appealed against  and  permission  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Buchanan in the following terms:

         "The Grounds of Appeal contend that the FTTJ arguably erred on  the
         basis that:-

         1.   The approach was unfair because  a  point  was  taken  without
             notice of the parties and because there are no  reasons  given
             for rejecting the Sponsor's evidence.

         2.   There was a failure to consider that evidence.

         3.   There was a failure to apply the correct test for family  life
             between  adults  and  there  was  an  error  in  relation   to
             proportionality.

         In relation to the second ground of appeal the  appellant  contends
         that  the  FTTJ   failed   to   consider   evidence   relating   to
         accommodation.  At paragraph 25, the FTTJ states  that  no  details
         are given of the appellant's home and nothing said about whether it
         is owned or rented.  By reference to the sponsor's statement it  is
         plain, as contended in ground 2, that details are given of the home
         and details are given about rented accommodation.

         In relation to the second part of the second ground of appeal,  the
         appellant contends  that  the  FTTJ  failed  to  consider  evidence
         relating  to  financial  support.   It  is  argued  that  the  FTTJ
         incorrectly stated at paragraph 23 that  only  an  additional  four
         money transfer receipts had been provided showing transfers between
         August and November 2018.  By reference to the addendum  bundle  on
         file, it is plain that there are more than an additional four money
         transfer receipts and that some fall out with the period defined by
         the FTTJ (see addendum bundle at page 3 as an example  showing  two
         receipts dated April 2018 and May 2018 respectively).

         As the foregoing matters go to issues of dependency which  were  at
         issue in the appeal,  in  my  judgement  the  appellant  identifies
         alleged errors of law in the decision.

         It is arguable by reference to the grounds of appeal that there may
         have been errors of law in the decision.   I  grant  permission  to
         appeal."

 2. I was not provided with a Rule 24 reply by the Entry Clearance  Officer
    but was given the indication that the appeal was resisted.

Error of Law

 3. At the close of the hearing I indicated I would  reserve  my  decision,
    which I shall now give.  I find that there is a material error  of  law
    in the decision, such that it should be set aside.  My reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

 4. In respect of the second ground of appeal, which  Mr  Balroop  did  not
    draft adopted in full,  as  observed  by  Judge  Buchanan  in  granting
    permission, there are indeed errors of  law  which  I  do  find  to  be
    material in that they  go  to  the  key  issue  of  dependency  by  the
    Appellant upon his sponsoring mother, the widow of his late  father  Mr
    Rai, a  former  Gurkha  soldier.   In  respect  of  Ground  2,  firstly
    concerning the contact between the Appellant and the Sponsor, the  oral
    evidence given which the FTTJ has failed to consider is that there were
    lengthy telephone calls between the Sponsor and the Appellant and there
    was never a gap of more than a day or so between  their  conversations.
    In addition to that evidence the documentary evidence also does not sit
    well with the judge's finding at �22 of the decision which stated  that
    it was unclear whose  telephone  number  was  given  on  the  telephone
    records, and that the records only revealed that the majority of  calls
    lasted a few seconds or a few minutes, which  pointed  to  insufficient
    irregular and meaningless contact between the Appellant and his mother.
     In fact, looking at pages 58 to 64 of the Appellant's bundle  and  the
    telephone records contained  therein,  on  page  58  I  note  that  the
    customer name given is that of the Appellant, and moreover I note  that
    the mobile number identified for this itemised  bill  is  that  of  the
    Appellant's, which matches his  personal  details  given  in  the  Visa
    Application Form at page 85 of the Respondent's bundle  (in  answer  to
    question 21 on the application form where his  primary  contact  number
    given there matches that given  on  the  first  page  of  the  itemised
    telephone log).  Furthermore, turning to the length of  these  calls  I
    note from the calls that over the time period concerned,  a  matter  of
    three months approximately, there were 175 calls, and  attempted  calls
    made between the Appellant and Sponsor, which is not  an  insignificant
    amount for a three month period.  Taking the  Appellant's  evidence  at
    its lowest, there was at least an extremely  lengthy  call  every  week
    between the Sponsor and Appellant,  not  to  mention  calls  of  lesser
    duration during the week which were by no means  wholly  insignificant.
    Thus it is plain that the assessment of the contact between the Sponsor
    and Appellant at �22 is inconsistent with the evidence before the judge
    and there has been a lack of anxious scrutiny given  to  the  evidence,
    both documentary and oral that was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    in relation to this topic.

 5. Turning to the findings in �23 regarding the  money  transfers  passing
    between  the  Sponsor  and  Appellant  and  his  dependency  not  being
    established (at least by financial means), as noted in the  Grounds  of
    Appeal there are in fact more  than  the  stated  four  money  transfer
    receipts provided to evidence the financial support between the Sponsor
    and Appellant and these do go  far  beyond  the  period  of  August  to
    November 2018.  Looking at the addendum trial bundle there  are  twenty
    receipts therein which, when combined  with  the  other  four  receipts
    mentioned, cover a period of approximately June 2017 to  November  2018
    and at least arguably establish dependency by the  Appellant  upon  the
    Sponsor, for a period of approximately one-and-a-half years.  As  noted
    in the grant of permission, these are contained at pages 1 to 10 of the
    addendum bundle, and in combination with the failure  to  consider  the
    evidence within the Sponsor's witness statement at paragraph  14  (that
    she did not see the significance of these money transfer  receipts  and
    did not keep any, thus explaining the absence  of  any  prior  to  June
    2017), it is plain that the assessment of the financial  dependency  of
    the Appellant upon his sponsoring mother has not been  looked  at  with
    anxious scrutiny either.

 6. Turning to the issue of accommodation at �25  and  the  statement  that
    there is no reference to the Appellant's living circumstances,  I  note
    that the Sponsor's witness  statement  at  paragraph  2  does  in  fact
    mention that the Sponsor's family did not have any money to purchase or
    build a house of their own and that they lived in rented  accommodation
    and the Appellant is residing at the address where his parents formerly
    did prior to their departure from Nepal.  Thus  in  that  light  it  is
    plain that the judge did not have a complete and  accurate  picture  of
    the Appellant's circumstances in Nepal, nor his dependency, as alleged,
    upon his sponsoring mother, such that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    could have lawfully assessed the question of whether the Appellant  was
    dependent upon his sponsoring mother as an adult in his own  right  and
    whether the support was "real" or "effective" or "committed" in nature,
    as it would need to be pursuant to Lord Justice  Sedley's  judgment  at
    [17] of Kugathas v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2003]
    EWCA Civ 31.

 7. Although the Grounds of Appeal also cite the decision of Patel & Ors  v
    Entry Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17, wherein at [14] it
    was stated  by  Lord  Justice  Sedley  that  "what  may  constitute  an
    excellent family life falls well short of what constitutes dependency",
    I note the decision in Rai v Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 320 at [17] wherein the decisions of Kugathas  and  Patel  are
    cited with approval, as well as that of Ghising in the  Upper  Tribunal
    at [18] in the context of analysing whether or  not  Article  8  family
    life is engaged (that matter being a Gurkha  family  life  appeal).   I
    find that the approach in Rai, Kugathas, Patel  and  Ghising  were  not
    followed, nor was the  approach  given  later  in  Rai  concerning  the
    application of Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act  2002  wherein  Lord  Justice  Lindblom  pointed  to  the   parties
    submissions with approval  at  [56]  to  [57]  that  "in  view  of  the
    'historic injustice' underlying... such considerations would have  made
    no difference to the outcome, and certainly no  difference  adverse..."
    to an Appellant; and that in that  context  "...considerations  arising
    under section 117A and B could not have made a difference...".

 8. Having identified material errors of law in respect of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's assessment of dependency and contact between the Sponsor and
    Appellant, notwithstanding my observations regarding  the  approach  in
    Rai not being followed in relation to Ground 3,  I  do  not  go  on  to
    consider the remaining grounds given that  I  have  clearly  identified
    material errors of law as argued in relation to the evidence before the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge which was not taken into consideration.

 9. In light of the above findings I set aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in its entirety.
