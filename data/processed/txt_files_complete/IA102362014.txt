               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Bhebe, Legal Representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect the anonymity of the appellant's daughter who is a minor.  This
    order prohibits the disclosure directly or indirectly (including by the
    parties) of the identity of the appellant.  Any disclosure  and  breach
    of this order may amount to a contempt  of  court.   This  order  shall
    remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal or court.

 2. This is an appeal against a decision and reasons promulgated by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Malins on 4th June 2015, in which  she  allowed  an
    appeal against the refusal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department on 5th February 2014 to issue a "Derivative Residence  Card"
    under Regulation  18A  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

 3. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondent to this appeal is SL.  However for ease of reference, in the
    course of this determination I shall adopt the parties'  status  as  it
    was before the First-tier Tribunal.  I  shall  in  this  determination,
    refer to "SL" as the appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    respondent.

Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Jamaica who was born on  17th  May  1977
    and arrived in the UK on 27th February 2002, aged 24.  She was  granted
    six months leave to enter as a visitor. The appellant then made various
    applications for leave to remain in the UK, all of which were  refused.
    On 4th June 2013, she made an application for  a  Derivative  Residence
    Card.  That application was refused on 5th February 2014 and gave  rise
    to the appeal before First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins.

 5. The application for a Derivative Residence Card was made upon the basis
    that the appellant is the primary carer of a  British  citizen,  namely
    her daughter "K", born on 26th June 2011.  K was born at a hospital  in
    the UK and the appellant is named  on  her  birth  certificate  as  her
    mother.  K's father is "PK", a British Citizen.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins

 6. At paragraphs [2] to [6] of her  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Malins sets out the appellant's immigration history  and  the  evidence
    before her.  Her findings of fact are set out at paragraph [9]  of  the
    decision:

         "a.  I find that the appellant has been present in the UK for  now,
         thirteen years, during twelve and a half of  which,  she  has  been
         present illegally;

         b.   however, notwithstanding the above, the UK state has  embraced
         the appellant in that she is almost wholly  funded  by  benefits  -
         apart from small earnings from two domestic jobs (�20 and  �30  per
         week respectively), she receives full housing benefit together with
         working tax credits and most significantly, child benefit and child
         tax credits;

         c.   during her time in the UK, the appellant has given birth to  a
         child whose Jamaican father must now be a UK citizen, as the  child
         herself, has a UK passport.  It is this  situation,  which  is  the
         foundation of the appellant's application for a Residence Card;

         d.   that the appellant does not live with her child's  father  and
         it appears that she has never done so;

         e.   that the appellant lives with her  child  in  a  rented  flat:
         there is a letter in the evidence to this effect from the landlord;



         f.   that the appellant's child has been attending a state  primary
         school,  [.....Lewisham],  since  September  2014  and   that   the
         correspondence relating to the place she has, was addressed by  the
         school administrator and the head teacher, to the appellant alone;

         g.   that in the light of (b), (d), (e) and (f) above, I find as  a
         fact, that the appellant is  the  sole  carer  of  her  UK  citizen
         daughter K;

         h.   that the appellant's connections with  the  UK  are  in  fact,
         despite her lack of immigration status,  deep.  Apart  from  having
         been here for so many years, her mother and four siblings  are  all
         here. This would appear to  be  a  case  where  a  Jamaican  family
         emigrated to the UK  to  settle,  leaving  one  child  behind  (the
         appellant), failing to apply for settlement for  her,  because  she
         was 18 years of age.  The  position  is  far  from  clear,  as  the
         appellant's representatives omitted any immigration / wider  family
         information, from the appellant's witness statement;

         i.   That the respondent has been aware that the appellant  was  an
         overstayer, since her  failed  student  application  for  leave  to
         remain 12 years ago  but  has  never  sought  to  remove  her.  The
         respondent's failure  to  acknowledge  the  deep  ties,  which  her
         inaction have allowed to develop - including  financial  dependence
         on the state - seems perverse. The respondent's assumption that the
         child's father can care full-time for a child not yet five years of
         age - despite his being married to another woman, and the father of
         another family - is, I find, unsustainable.

 7. At paragraph 10 of her decision, the Judge finds that the  respondent's
    decision to refuse the application was incorrect in law.  She refers to
    the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Ahmed  (Amos;  Zambrano;  reg
    15A(3)(c) 2006 EEA Regs) [2013]  UKUT  00089  (IAC)  and  concludes  as
    follows:

         "... It follows from all that I have stated and found  above,  that
         in my judgement, the appellant does  have  a  Derived  Right  to  a
         Residence Card under EU law, as she is  the  sole  carer  of  a  UK
         citizen (of necessity, also an EU citizen)  who  is  in  full  time
         education and could not therefore be expected to leave  the  UK  in
         order to continue living with and receiving, the care of her mother
         who is her sole carer.

         I would also add, although there is in the circumstances,  no  need
         to make a specific finding on the issue, that the appeal should  be
         allowed under Article 8 of the ECHR (family life) and section 55 of
         the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009"

The grounds of appeal

 8. The respondent contends that that the judge has made a  material  error
    of law in her determination. The respondent advances three grounds.

 9. First, the judge misdirected  herself  as  to  the  law  following  the
    decision in Zambrano -v- Office National de  l'emploie  [2011]  All  ER
    (EC) 491. The respondent submits that  the  Judge  failed  to  properly
    apply the principle of law that arises.  Taking the appellant's case at
    its highest, the appellant has not demonstrated why her  daughter  will
    be compelled to leave the UK because if she were left in  the  care  of
    her father, she would not be left without the resources  necessary  for
    her to live within the European Union.  In effect, the Judge  fails  to
    address the test of whether the  adverse  decision  would  require  the
    child to leave the territory of the Union.   Furthermore,  it  was  not
    open to the Judge on the evidence to find that  the  appellant  is  the
    sole carer of her daughter.

10. Second, the Judge has failed to give reasons or adequate  reasons,  for
    the finding that due to being married to another  woman,  and  being  a
    father to other children, the child's father would be  unable  to  care
    for his daughter on a full-time basis.

11. Third, the Judge made perverse or irrational  findings  on  a  material
    matter.  The respondent submits that the Judge  appears  to  place  the
    blame for the appellant's illegal stay in the UK, of nearly  13  years,
    on the respondent and suggests that the UK has embraced  the  appellant
    who is almost wholly supported financially by the state. The respondent
    submits that the appellant was aware that she had  no  legal  right  to
    remain in the UK, and as such should have returned to Jamaica 12  years
    ago.   The support given to the appellant  by  the  authorities  arises
    because she is the mother of a British citizen.

12. At the hearing before me, Ms Isherwood adopted the  grounds  of  appeal
    and submitted that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses  a
    material error of law capable of affecting the outcome of the decision.
    She submits  that  on  the  evidence,  the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant is the sole carer  of  her  daughter  is  one  that  was  not
    properly open to her.  She submits that in any event, the Judge has not
    considered the crucial question of whether the removal of the appellant
    would mean that her daughter could not remain in the  UK.  She  submits
    that there was no evidence before the Tribunal  that  PK,  the  child's
    father, was either unwilling or unable to look after his daughter.  She
    submits that that crucial issue  has  neither  been  addressed  in  the
    evidence before the Tribunal nor in the decision of the judge.

13. In reply, Mr Bhebhe on behalf of the appellant submits that  the  focus
    of the appeal should be upon the best interests of the child  and  that
    it is not in her interest for her mother to be removed from the UK.  He
    submits that the child's father, PK cannot make  suitable  arrangements
    for the child day-to-day care.

14. Mr Bhebhe submits that the Judge has properly summarised  the  evidence
    before her in her decision, and the decision should be read as a whole.
    He conceded that  the  Judge  does  not  appear  to  have  sufficiently
    considered the crucial question  as  to  whether  the  removal  of  the
    appellant would mean that her daughter could not remain in the UK.   He
    submits that PK could not take care of his daughter  if  the  appellant
    were required to leave the UK, because PK's wife would  not  allow  the
    appellant's daughter to live with him.

Error of Law

15. It is appropriate to deal first with the respondents challenge  to  the
    finding by the Judge at paragraph [10] that the appellant is  the  sole
    carer of her daughter. I remind myself that in R & ors  (Iran)  v  SSHD
    [2005] EWCA Civ 982, the Court of Appeal held that before the  Tribunal
    can set aside a decision of a Judge on the grounds of error of law,  it
    has to be satisfied that the correction of the error would have made  a
    material  difference  to  the  outcome,  or  to  the  fairness  of  the
    proceedings. A finding might only be set aside for error of law on  the
    grounds of perversity if it  was  irrational  or  unreasonable  in  the
    Wednesbury sense, or one that was wholly unsupported by the evidence.

16. In order to qualify for a right to reside in the UK under the "Zambrano
    principle", the test is not whether the appellant is the sole carer  of
    her daughter, but whether she is the primary carer.  For  reasons  that
    will become clear below, whether the appellant is the "sole  carer"  or
    "primary carer" is academic in this case and  the  use  of  the  phrase
    "sole carer" in the decision is unfortunate.  In  my  judgment  it  was
    open to the Judge to find that the appellant is the primary carer of K,
    for the reasons set out at paragraphs  9,  (d),  (e)  and  (f)  of  the
    decision.  If this were the sole ground of appeal,  that  ground  would
    not disclose a material error of law capable of affecting  the  outcome
    of the appeal.

17. The Court of Justice of the European Union decided in Ruiz Zambrano -v-
    Office National de l'emploie [2011] All ER  (EC)  ("Zambrano")  that  a
    Member State could not take measures to refuse the right  of  residence
    of a third country national who cared for an EU  national  child  in  a
    Member State, if that refusal would deprive the child  of  the  genuine
    enjoyment of the substance of his EU citizenship rights  by  having  to
    move out of the EU (the effective citizenship principle).

18. In Sanneh v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  [2013]  EWHC  793
    (Admin), Hickinbottom J considered a claim by a  Gambian  national  who
    had overstayed in the United Kingdom, but had a child who was,  through
    her father, a British national.  The court held that the  claimant  had
    rightly been refused interim payments  of  income  support,  child  tax
    credit  and  child  benefit  pending  the  determination   of   appeals
    concerning her entitlement to them.   That refusal did  not  engage  EU
    law by depriving the child of her right, as an EU citizen, to remain in
    the UK since, despite the mother's tight financial situation,  she  and
    the child were not compelled to leave:  they  had  been  provided  with
    accommodation and a small income from the local authority.  In reaching
    his decision, Hickinbottom J summarised the learning to be derived from
    various decisions handed  down  since  the  decision  of  the  CJEU  in
    Zambrano:

         i)   All nationals of all member states are EU citizens. It is  for
         each member state to determine how nationality of that state may be
         acquired,  but,  once  it  is  acquired  by  an  individual,   that
         individual has the right to enjoy the substance of the rights  that
         attach to the status of EU citizen, including the right  to  reside
         in the territory  of  the  EU.  That  applies  equally  to  minors,
         irrespective of the nationality of their parents, and  irrespective
         of whether one or both parents have EU citizenship.

         ii)  An EU citizen must have the freedom  to  enjoy  the  right  to
         reside in the EU, genuinely and in  practice.  For  a  minor,  that
         freedom may be jeopardised if, although legally entitled to  reside
         in the EU, he  is  compelled  to  leave  EU  territory  because  an
         ascendant relative upon whom he is dependent is compelled to leave.
         That relative may be compelled to leave by  dint  of  direct  state
         action (e.g. he is the subject of  an  order  for  removal)  or  by
         virtue of being driven to leave and reside in a non-EU  country  by
         force of economic necessity (e.g. by having insufficient  resources
         to provide for his EU child(ren) because the state  refuses  him  a
         work permit). The rights of an EU child will not be infringed if he
         is not compelled to leave. Therefore, even where a non-EU ascendant
         relative is compelled to leave EU territory, the article 20  rights
         of an EU child will not be infringed if there is another  ascendant
         relative who has the right of residence in the EU, and who can  and
         will in practice care for the child.

         iii) It is for the national courts to determine, as a  question  of
         fact on the evidence before it, whether  an  EU  citizen  would  be
         compelled to leave the EU to follow a non-EU national upon whom  he
         is dependent.

         iv)  Nothing less than such compulsion will engage articles 20  and
         21 of the TFEU. In particular, EU law will not be engaged where the
         EU citizen is not compelled to leave the EU, even if the quality or
         standard of life of the EU citizen is diminished as a result of the
         non-EU national upon whom he is dependent is (for example)  removed
         or prevented from working; although (a) diminution in  the  quality
         of life might engage EU law if (and only if) it  is  sufficient  in
         practice to compel the a relevant ascendant relative, and hence the
         EU dependent citizen, to leave, and (b) such actions as removal  or
         prevention of work may result in an interference  with  some  other
         right, such as the right to respect for family life under article 8
         of the European Convention on Human Rights .

         v)   Although such article 8 rights are similar in scope to the  EU
         rights conferred by article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental  Rights
         of the European Union, the provisions of the Charter are  addressed
         to member states only when they are implementing EU law. If EU  law
         is not engaged, then the domestic  courts  have  to  undertake  the
         examination of the right to family life under article 8;  but  that
         is an entirely distinct area of protection.

         vi)  The overriding of the general national right to refuse a  non-
         EU national a right of residence, by  reference  to  the  effective
         enjoyment of the right to reside of  a  dependent  EU  citizen,  is
         described in both Dereci (paragraph 67) and Harrison (paragraph 66)
         as "exceptional", meaning  (as  explained  in  the  latter),  as  a
         principle, it will not be regularly engaged.

19. In light of the authorities, I accept the submission made on behalf  of
    the respondent that the crucial question in this appeal is whether  the
    removal of the appellant would mean that her daughter could not  remain
    in the UK.  The appellant's daughter is a British citizen and must have
    the freedom to enjoy the right to reside in the UK,  genuinely  and  in
    practice. That freedom may be jeopardised if, although legally entitled
    to reside in the UK, she is compelled to leave because her mother, upon
    whom she is dependent, is compelled to leave.

20. In my judgment, Mr. Bhebhe was right to concede that the Judge did  not
    adequately address whether the removal of the appellant would mean that
    her daughter could not remain in the  UK.   At  paragraph  [6]  of  her
    decision the Judge  sets  out  the  evidence  of  the  appellant.   The
    evidence of the appellant herself was that although she had never had a
    subsisting relationship with PK, he has always been very supportive and
    "PK has always wanted K to know him and have a close relationship  even
    though he cannot live with K.  He has also made it a point that K knows
    her half sisters.  PK takes K  at  least  one  day  a  week,  over  the
    weekend.  K then meets and plays with her half sisters - PK's children.
     PK also contributes voluntarily about �50 per week towards K's  upkeep
    ...".  In her findings and conclusions,  the  Judge  fails  to  address
    whether PK, who has the right of residence in the EU, can and  will  in
    practice, care for K.

21. It was for the Judge to determine,  as  a  question  of  fact,  on  the
    evidence before her, whether K would be compelled to leave  the  EU  to
    follow the appellant who is her primary carer.  As the authorities make
    clear, nothing less than compulsion to leave the UK, will suffice.  The
    Judge failed to determine whether K would be compelled to leave the  UK
    if her mother, who is her primary  carer,  is  removed.   The  decision
    therefore to allow the appeal against the  refusal  of  the  Derivative
    Right of Residence discloses a material error of law and is set aside.

22. The decision of the Judge as to  Article  8  is  far  from  clear.   At
    paragraph [10] she simply states:

         "I would also add, although there is in the circumstances, no  need
         to make a specific finding on the issue, that the appeal should  be
         allowed under Article 8 of the ECHR (family life) and Section 55 of
         the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009"

23. The decision of the Judge as to Article 8 is devoid of any  reasons  at
    all. That is despite the fact Article 8 is an entirely distinct area of
    protection ordinarily requiring an examination of the right  to  family
    life under Article 8.

24.  In any event, in Amirteymour and others (EEA  appeals;  human  rights)
    [2015] UKUT 466 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held  that  where  no  notice
    under section 120 of the 2002 Act has been  served  and  where  no  EEA
    decision to remove has been made, an appellant  cannot  bring  a  Human
    Rights challenge to removal in an appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations.
    Insofar as the Judge allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, she erred
    in law and the decision is set aside.

Re-making the decision

25. Directions were issued to the parties in advance of the hearing  before
    me requiring the parties to prepare for the hearing on the basis  that,
    if the Upper Tribunal decides to set aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, any further evidence, including supplementary oral
    evidence, that the Upper Tribunal may need to consider if it decides to
    re-make the decision, can be so considered at that hearing. No  further
    evidence was relied upon by the appellant and there was no  application
    made pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.

26. At the hearing before me, Mr Bhebhe provided me  with  a  copy  of  the
    appellants witness statement and skeleton argument that had  previously
    been before the First-tier Tribunal.

Derivative Right of Residence

27. In the respondent's decision  of  5th  February  2014,  the  respondent
    states:

         "You are applying on the basis that you are the primary carer of K,
         British  citizen  child.   In  support  of  your  application   you
         submitted: ....

         There is, however, insufficient evidence to show that  the  British
         Citizen child, K would be unable to remain in the United Kingdom or
         EEA if you were forced to leave. You have not provided evidence  as
         to why the child's father PK is not in a position to o care for the
         British citizen child if  you  were  forced  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom.

         ...

         It  should  be  noted  that  any  unwillingness  to   assume   care
         responsibility is  not,  by  itself,  sufficient  for  the  claimed
         primary carer to assert that another direct relative or guardian is
         unable  to  care  for  the  British  citizen.  Notwithstanding  the
         information regarding PK's employment or his commitments, it is his
         choice to undertake such employment/commitments  and  it  does  not
         negate his responsibilities for the child.

         Furthermore, to be considered the primary carer we would expect you
         to provide evidence to show that the child lives with you or spends
         the majority of her time with you, that you make  the  day  to  day
         decisions in regard to the child's health, education etc  and  that
         you are financially responsible for the child. Moreover,  you  have
         not provided sufficient documentary evidence to demonstrate you are
         the primary carer. You have only submitted a letter of support from
         your GP and your child's personal  health  record,  this  does  not
         suffice the evidence needed  to  show  that  you  are  the  child's
         primary carer.

         In making this assessment, the  burden  of  proof  remains  on  the
         applicant  and  the  standard  of   proof   is   the   balance   of
         probabilities. This means the onus is on you, as the applicant,  to
         demonstrate that you the- primary carer of a  British  citizen  and
         that your removal would force the  British  citizen  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom or EEA.

         Based upon these factors the Secretary of State does  not  consider
         that you satisfy the requirements of the  criteria  for  Derivative
         Right of Residence and it has been decided to  refuse  to  issue  a
         Derivative Residence Card...."

28. First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins accepted the evidence of the appellant
    as set out in her witness statement.  As I have set out previously,  in
    my judgement it was open to the Judge to find that the appellant is the
    primary carer of K.  The Judge found that the appellant does  not  live
    with K's father and has never done so.  She found  that  the  appellant
    and her daughter live in a rented flat and that correspondence from the
    school that K attends, is addressed to the appellant alone.  I have  no
    reason to interfere with those findings.   Furthermore, the evidence of
    the appellant in her witness statement is that the appellant makes  all
    the day to day decisions on K's welfare and well-being, including  what
    she eats, wears, and which school she attends.   The  evidence  of  the
    appellant was not challenged before the First-tier Tribunal  or  before
    me.

29. K lives with the appellant and clearly spends the majority of her  time
    with the appellant.  PK has his daughter at least one day a week,  over
    the weekend and makes a voluntary �50 per week contribution towards K's
    upkeep.  I find that  the  appellant  makes  the  day-to-day  decisions
    regarding K's health and education, and that on the whole,  it  is  the
    appellant  that  is  financially  responsible  for  K,  albeit  with  a
    voluntary contribution from her father. I find that  the  appellant  is
    the primary carer of K.

30. Whilst the appellant is the primary carer of K, that is not the end  of
    the matter because I must determine, as  a  question  of  fact  on  the
    evidence before me, whether K would be compelled to  leave  the  EU  to
    follow the appellant who is  her  primary  carer.   To  that  end,  the
    evidence before me is limited.  The appellant  states  in  her  witness
    statement that was before the First-tier Tribunal:

         "5.  I wish to make it clear to  the  court  that  I  never  had  a
         subsisting relationship with PK. He has a family and  children.  So
         it was very clear from  the  time  I  decide  to  go  through  with
         pregnancy that I would not expect PK to be the primary carer of  K.
         He however has always been supportive.

      6. PK has always wanted K to know him and have  a  close  relationship
         even though he cannot live with K. He has also made it a point that
         K knows her half sisters. PK takes K at least one day a week,  over
         the weekend. K then meets and plays with her half  sisters  -  PK's
         children.  PK also  contributes  voluntarily  about  �50  per  week
         towards K's upkeep. He gives this in cash when he comes to  pick  K
         up.

      7. I live with K. I make all the day to day decisions on  K's  welfare
         and well-being concerning what she eats, wears and which school she
         attends. I have however told the school that PK is  K's  father  in
         case he has to pick her up from school or attend future events..."

31. The  onus  is  upon  the  appellant  to  establish,  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities, that she is entitled to a Derivative Right of Residence.
     I am not satisfied that the appellant has, on the evidence before  me,
    established K would  be  compelled  to  leave  the  EU  to  follow  the
    appellant, who is her primary carer.  K's father, PK continues to  play
    a role in his daughter's life.  There is no evidence before me that  PK
    cannot and will not, in practice, care for K.

32. PK may not at present be the primary  carer  of  K,  but  even  on  the
    appellant's own account he has always been supportive.  PK  has  always
    wanted K to know him, have a close relationship, and has also made it a
    point that K knows her half sisters. PK takes K  at  least  one  day  a
    week, over the weekend and PK also contributes voluntarily, towards K's
    upkeep.  The school attended by K, is aware that PK is  K's  father  in
    case he has to pick her up from school or attend future  events.  There
    is no evidence before me that PK could not, and would not, in  practice
    be willing to become the primary carer of K should the need arise.

33. I reject the claim by the appellant that K will be compelled  to  leave
    the UK in the event that the appellant is required to leave the UK.  It
    follows that the appellant does not meet the criteria for a  Derivative
    Right of Residence and I dismiss her appeal in that respect.

34. As I have set out previously, where no notice under section 120 of  the
    2002 Act has been served and where no EEA decision to remove  has  been
    made, an appellant cannot bring a Human Rights challenge to removal  in
    an appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Notice of Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses and error of law  and
    is set aside.  I remake the  decision,  dismissing  the  appeal  by  SL
    against the refusal by the SSHD to issue a 'Derivative Residence  Card'
    to her.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal by the SSHD and in remaking the decision, have
dismissed the appeal by SL and therefore there can be no fee award.
