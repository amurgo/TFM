   DECISION ON APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL TO THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                                     and

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant wishes to  appeal  against  the  determination  dated  21
    January 2013 of First-tier Tribunal Manchester made on the papers which
    dismissed the appeal against the respondent's refusal dated 2  November
    2012 of the appellant's application for further leave to  remain  as  a
    Tier 4 student under paragraph 245ZX of the Points Based System (PBS).

 2. The appellant's application to the First-tier Tribunal  for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  refused  on  14  May  2013.  The
    appellant does not dispute that the application was made over 3  months
    out of time. His explanation for the delay, contained in the grounds to
    the First-tier Tribunal and in the grounds before me, was that  he  had
    misunderstood the outcome of the First-tier Tribunal appeal. He thought
    his appeal had been allowed. He showed it to a few friends who had made
    similar applications and been granted further leave to remain and  they
    thought he had won his appeal also. The appellant maintains that he and
    his friends thought this because the final paragraphs of the First-tier
    Tribunal determination stated:

             "31. The appeal in relation to the decision to refuse to  vary
             leave under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

             32. The appeal on human rights  grounds  in  relation  to  the
             decision to refuse to vary leave is dismissed.

             33. The appeal in so far as it relates to the decision under s
             47 is allowed. (my emphasis)"

 3. The appellant's explanation for the delay went on to state that  as  he
    thought that  his  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  been
    allowed, he did not challenge it. He did so only  after  he  telephoned
    the respondent on 30 April 2013 to find out when  he  would  be  issued
    with his further leave to remain.  He was told he had lost his  appeal.
    He instructed his current solicitors  immediately  but  was  already  3
    months out of time to appeal.

 4. He made an application for permission to appeal  nevertheless.  It  was
    refused by the First-tier Tribunal on  14  May  2013.  The  refusal  of
    permission to appeal stated:

             "2. The application for permission to appeal was  received  on
             6th May 2013. The Appellant has explained the late application
             by saying he was confused about the decision  to  dismiss  the
             appeal against the Respondent's decision under the immigration
             rules because the appeal against the decision to make  removal
             directions under s.47  was  allowed.  I  do  not  accept  that
             explanation. The decision to dismiss the  appeal  against  the
             refusal of leave is perfectly clear from paragraph 31  of  the
             determination, which is consistent with what  the  Judge  said
             about his reasons for doing so in paragraph 20.

             3. The Tribunal was asked to decide the appeal on the  papers,
             which it did, taking account of all  relevant  documents.  The
             Judge found that the  documents  submitted  to  the  Tribunal,
             including a mini statement from an ATM and a letter  from  the
             bank, did not discharge the burden of proof to the standard of
             balance of probabilities, and  that  was  a  decision  he  was
             entitled to reach. There is no arguable error of law. I  would
             not have granted permission in any event."

 5. The appellant then made an in-time application to renew his application
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and thus the application
    came before me.

 6. On 25 June 2013 I issued the following direction:

           1.  The  appellant  has  applied  to  the  Upper  Tribunal   for
              permission to appeal.


           2. This follows the refusal of permission to appeal by the First-
              tier Tribunal, contained in a decision dated 14 May 2013.  As
              set out in that refusal of permission, the application to the
              First-tier Tribunal for permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
              Tribunal was lodged over 3 months late  and  the  application
              was found to be out of time.

           3. The subsequent application to  the  Upper  Tribunal  includes
              grounds for the application to be admitted as in time  and  a
              statement from the appellant explaining  why  he  lodged  his
              application to the First-tier Tribunal so late.

           4. In Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060
              (IAC), the head note states:


                  "The expectation is that it will be an  exceptional  case
                  in which permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
                  should be granted where the lodging  of  the  application
                  for permission is more than 28 days out of  time.  Where,
                  in such a case, a judge is minded  to  grant  permission,
                  the preferable course is to provide an opportunity to the
                  respondent  to  make  representations.  This   might   be
                  achieved by listing the permission application  for  oral
                  hearing".


           5. This application for  permission  to  appeal  is  accordingly
              listed for an oral hearing. If  the  appeal  is  admitted  in
              time, the Tribunal will proceed to consider  the  grounds  of
              appeal to establish if the determination  of  the  First-tier
              Tribunal contains an error on a point of law. If  a  material
              error of law is found, the Tribunal is  likely  to  be  in  a
              position to proceed to remake the appeal at that hearing.


           6. The parties are put  on  notice  as  to  the  following.  The
              appellant applied for further leave to remain on 5 April 2012
              when the specification as to the form of financial  documents
              was contained in guidance  rather  than  in  the  Immigration
              Rules.  The  requirements  had  been  incorporated  into  the
              Immigration Rules by the time that the decision was made on 2
              November 2012 but the application  was  not  refused  by  the
              respondent for  that  reason.  It  was  refused  because  the
              appellant was not found to have an  established  presence  so
              needed to show funds of �7,200 which he could not do.


           7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the  appeal  on  the
              papers and found for the appellant on  the  sole  reason  for
              refusal put forward by the  respondent,  accepting  that  the
              appellant had an established presence and only needed to show
              funds of �1,600.


           8. The  First-tier  Tribunal  went  on  to  refuse  the  appeal,
              however, on another point, one on which the appellant did not
              have a chance to make submissions or  adduce  evidence  where
              the appeal was  determined  on  the  papers.  The  First-tier
              Tribunal Judge found that the  appeal  had  to  fail  as  the
              financial documents were not in the  form  specified  in  the
              Immigration Rules at the date of the decision.


           9. If the application for permission to appeal is accepted as in
              time, this raises two possible questions:


                 i) Did  a  procedural  error  arise  where  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal did not put the point concerning  the  form  of
                    the financial documents to  the  appellant  so  that  he
                    could respond to it before the appeal was decided?


                ii) If the respondent wishes to take  the  point  about  the
                    form  of  the  appellant's  documents,  did  common  law
                    fairness demand that the respondent notify the appellant
                    before the decision was made that  the  requirements  of
                    the Immigration Rules had changed by November  2012  and
                    request him  to  provide  that  evidence  again  in  the
                    required form?


          10. The appellant should note that if he  wishes  to  defeat  any
              point taken about the form of  his  financial  documents,  he
              would need to provide his financial  evidence  again  in  the
              format specified in the Immigration Rules which  precludes  a
              mini-statement."

 7. There is no issue as to the application to the First-tier Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal being made over 3 months out of time which  is  an
    extremely long period. Following the reported case of Boktor and  Wanis
    [2011] UKUT 00442 and Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2013]
    UKUT 00060 (IAC) factors relevant to  the  exercise  of  discretion  to
    extend time include a. the length of any delay, b. the reasons for  the
    delay, c. the merits of the appeal and d. the degree  of  prejudice  to
    the respondent if the application is granted. Both cases  confirm  that
    the merits of the case cannot be decisive. It must  also  be  the  case
    that the more extreme the delay the more compelling must be the  reason
    for the delay and the merits.

 8. Having heard submissions from Mr Makol and Mr Tufan on  these  matters,
    it was my view that the  appellant's  explanation  for  the  delay  was
    credible. He has been entirely consistent. It was not suggested for the
    respondent that he was not being truthful. I accepted  that  he  had  a
    genuine belief until 30 April 2013 that his appeal  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  had been allowed.

 9. As to the merits of the substantive error of law challenge to the First-
    tier Tribunal, it was clear that the appellant had never  been  put  on
    notice that his application fell to be refused for  want  of  financial
    documents in the correct format but this was why his appeal before  the
    First-tier Tribunal  failed.  An  arguable  procedural  fairness  issue
    arose, therefore.

10. In addition, at the time that he applied for further leave to remain in
    April 2012, the appellant had submitted documents in  a  lawful  format
    under the Immigration Rules,  the  guidance  on  the  format  of  those
    documents at that time being outside the Rules and only incorporated on
    9 July 2012.

11. The appellant therefore argued that the respondent  should  have  asked
    him for the documents in the  correct  format  in  line  with  the  new
    Immigration Rules before refusing his application in November 2012.  He
    relied on the respondent's "evidential flexibility policy" which by the
    time  of  the  respondent's  refusal  on  2  November  2012  had   been
    incorporated into  the  Immigration  Rules  at  paragraph  245AA.  This
    paragraph states:

           245AA. Documents not submitted with applications

           (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A state
           that specified documents must be provided, the UK Border Agency
           will only consider documents that have been submitted with the
           application, and will only consider documents submitted after
           the application where they are submitted in accordance with
           subparagraph (b).

           (b) If the applicant has submitted:

           (i) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the
           sequence have been omitted (for example, if one bank statement
           from a series is missing);

           (ii) A document in the wrong format; or

           (iii) A document that is a copy and not an original document,

           the UK Border Agency may contact the applicant or his
           representative in writing, and request the correct documents.
           The requested documents must be received by the UK Border Agency
           at the address specified in the request within 7 working days of
           the date of the request.

           (c) The UK Border Agency will not request documents where a
           specified document has not been submitted (for example an
           English language certificate is missing), or where the UK Border
           Agency does not anticipate that addressing the omission or error
           referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a grant because the
           application will be refused for other reasons.

           (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

           (i) in the wrong format, or

           (ii) that is a copy and not an original document,

           the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the UK
           Border Agency is satisfied that the specified documents are
           genuine and the applicant meets all the other requirements. The
           UK Border Agency reserves the right to request the specified
           original documents in the correct format in all cases where (b)
           applies, and to refuse applications if these documents are not
           provided as set out in (b).


12. The appellant maintained that the respondent should have asked him  for
    the financial  evidence  in  the  correct  format  following  paragraph
    245AA(b)(ii). The respondent could not pray paragraph 245AA (a) in  aid
    as the First-tier Tribunal had found for him on the only  reason  given
    by the respondent for refusing the application, that of his  having  an
    established presence and only needing to show funds of �1,600.

13. As indicated at [10] of my direction, for this  argument  to  have  any
    force, the appellant has to  show  that  he  could  have  provided  the
    financial evidence in the correct format if the  respondent  had  asked
    for it prior to the decision. He did  so  at  the  hearing  before  me,
    providing an original bank statement for the  required  period  showing
    the required funds.

14. Mr Tufan accepted for the respondent  that  the  appellant  would  have
    provided  the  financial  document  in  the  correct  format  had   the
    respondent followed paragraph 245AA (b) (ii) of the Immigration  Rules.
    He confirmed that were I to extend the time  for  the  application  for
    permission to appeal, his position was that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal disclosed an error on a point of law for this reason such
    that it should be set aside and the appeal re-made as allowed.  He  did
    not concede that the permission to appeal  should  be  accepted  as  in
    time, however.

15. It was my view that the overriding objective  in  Rule  2  (1)  of  the
    Procedure Rules for those Rules to enable the Upper  Tribunal  to  deal
    with cases "fairly and justly" and the matters  set  out  above  should
    lead me to extend the time for the application for permission to appeal
    under Rule 5(3)(a). In making that decision I have taken  into  account
    the extremely lengthy delay, the appellant's credible reason  for  that
    delay, the accepted  merits  of  the  appeal  and  the  low  degree  of
    prejudice to the respondent given  Mr  Tufan's  concessions.  Following
    Rule 21 (7) I admitted the permission to appeal  as  in  time,  finding
    that it was in the interests of justice to do so.

16. Having done so, for the reasons agreed by Mr Tufan as set out  in  [13]
    above, I found that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  disclosed
    an error on a point of law and re-made the appeal as allowed under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Decision

17. The application for permission to appeal is  accepted  as  having  been
    made in time.

18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that it should be set aside other than  the  decision
    relating to Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006.

19. I re-make the appeal as allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Fee Award

Note: this is not part of the determination.
In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I make a whole fee award following rule 23A of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007)  with  reference  to  the  Joint
Presidential Guidance Note: Fee  Awards  in  Immigration  Appeals  (December
2011).
