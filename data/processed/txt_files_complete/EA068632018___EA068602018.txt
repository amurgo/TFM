Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Nicholson, instructed by JJ Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 8 August  1990  and  25
    December 1992 respectively. They appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett promulgated on  11  June  2019  dismissing
    their appeals against the refusal of permanent  residence  cards  under
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 [2016 Regulations].

2.   The Appellants  applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  two  grounds.
    Firstly, it was accepted that the Appellants were dependant on the  EEA
    national sponsor (the first Appellant's father) prior to coming to  the
    UK and accepted that they lived with him  in  the  UK.  The  Appellants
    therefore satisfied  Regulation  8.  Secondly,  the  judge  misdirected
    himself in adopting a restrictive  approach  to  dependency  which  was
    inconsistent with Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) UKUT 00314 (IAC).

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Pickup  on  7
    November 2019 for the following reasons:

         "... it is arguable that even if the appellants are  not  presently
         dependent on the sponsor, on the facts of the case  the  appellants
         were arguably dependent on the sponsor before coming to the UK and,
         even if not presently dependent, may nevertheless be members of the
         sponsor's household and thus qualify as extended family members. If
         the first appellant has lived in the UK in accordance with the  EEA
         regulations for a period of five  years  she  may  be  entitled  to
         permanent residence. It does not appear, however, that  the  second
         appellant can so qualify. It is arguable that these issues were not
         adequately addressed in the impugned  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. In the circumstances all grounds may be argued."

Submissions

4.   Mr Nicholson relied on Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012]  UKUT
    00079 (IAC) and submitted the Appellants were extended  family  members
    given the judge's finding that it was accepted they were  dependant  on
    the EEA sponsor prior to coming to the UK and members of his  household
    since arriving in the UK.

5.   There was then some discussion about whether the first Appellant  could
    satisfy the five year period required to establish a right to permanent
    residence when she had entered as a family member under  Regulation  7,
    but had subsequently become an extended family member under  Regulation
    8. I was referred to no authority on the point.

6.   In relation to ground 2, Mr Nicholson relied on the grounds  of  appeal
    and  submitted  the  judge  had  adopted  a  restrictive  approach   to
    dependency. His reference at [13] was similar to the  test  Kugathas  v
    SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31, which was not relevant to the application  of
    the 2016 Regulations and contrary to the guidance referred to  at  [14]
    of the grounds. Applying the correct test, it could not  be  said  that
    the first Appellant did  not  continue  to  be  dependant  on  the  EEA
    sponsor.

7.   Ms Cunha relied on the Rule 24 response and referred to paragraph 6  of
    the 2004/38/EC Directive. She submitted that the 2016  Regulations  did
    not allow for a change in the exercise  of  Treaty  rights.  The  first
    Appellant had entered as the dependant daughter of the EEA sponsor  and
    could not now become an extended family member.  The  second  Appellant
    was now dependant on the first Appellant,  not  the  EEA  sponsor.  The
    presence of the second Appellant in the UK was not  necessary  for  the
    exercise of Treaty rights by the EEA sponsor. The second Appellant  was
    no longer an extended family member. The situation was  distinguishable
    form Dauhoo. Prior dependency no longer existed.

Conclusions and Reasons

8.   On 2 July 2018, the EEA  sponsor  applied  for  a  permanent  residence
    card. His wife, two daughters, son and son-in-law  requested  residence
    cards on the basis of the EEA sponsor's status in  the  UK.  The  first
    Appellant is the EEA sponsor's daughter. On 22  August  2018,  she  was
    refused a permanent residence card under Regulations 7 and  15  on  the
    basis that there was insufficient evidence to show that she was  living
    with/or dependant on the EEA sponsor.

9.   The second Appellant is the EEA sponsor's son  in  law.  On  22  August
    2018, he was refused a permanent residence card under Regulations 7,  8
    and 15 on the grounds that he was not dependant on or residing with the
    EEA sponsor and he had not resided  in  the  UK  for  five  years.  The
    Respondent also stated he was not entitled to a residence card  on  the
    current evidence.

10.  The judge made the following factual findings: The first Appellant  has
    lived with the EEA sponsor (her father) since she came  to  the  UK  in
    2013. She lives in the family home with her parents and  siblings.  The
    EEA sponsor pays the mortgage and most  of  the  household  bills.  The
    first Appellant works for a business and the EEA sponsor is a  director
    and shareholder. She earns ï¿½1200 per month from which she meets her own
    personal expenses, gives money to her husband  (the  second  Appellant)
    and buys food for the family. The second Appellant entered  the  UK  in
    January 2018 and has lived  in  the  same  family  home  as  the  first
    Appellant since then.

The first Appellant

11.  The judge found at [13]: "The first appellant is  married  to  the  2nd
    appellant. By virtue of this marriage she has  formed  her  own  family
    unit with her husband. She is a young adult who has relatively recently
    married and therefore she maintains ties to her parents  and  siblings.
    However I am not satisfied that the  relationship  that  the  appellant
    maintains with her father is one of emotional dependency of a different
    nature to that enjoyed between adult children and adult parents who  do
    not live with each other. I do not accept that the mere fact of  living
    in the same  property,  even  with  the  financial  conditions  I  have
    described below, establishes emotional dependency."

12.  I find that the judge has erred in law in his assessment of  dependency
    under the 2016 Regulations. Firstly, on the facts found by  the  judge,
    his conclusion that the first Appellant had formed her own family  unit
    was irrational. Secondly, he applied the wrong test in concluding  that
    the first Appellant was not dependant on the EEA  sponsor.  My  reasons
    are as follows:

13.  Firstly, the first Appellant entered the UK as an  adult  dependant  of
    the EEA sponsor. She continued to be part of the  same  household  even
    after her husband, the second Appellant, came  to  the  UK  in  January
    2018. The first Appellant lived with the EEA sponsor as  his  dependant
    for almost five years before the second Appellant joined the household.
    Both Appellants continue to live  in  the  family  home  with  the  EEA
    sponsor and other  family  members  since  their  marriage.  The  first
    Appellant continues to work and  her  financial,  physical  and  social
    conditions have not changed since the second Appellant came to the  UK.
    The evidence did  not  support  the  judge's  finding  that  the  first
    Appellant had formed her own family unit with the second Appellant.

14.  Secondly, on the facts found by the judge,  the  EEA  sponsor  provided
    accommodation, utilities and food and  therefore  supported  the  first
    Appellant's essential needs. It was not necessary for the  EEA  sponsor
    to meet all or most of her  essential  needs.  The  test  of  emotional
    dependency applied by the judge was relevant to  Article  8.  The  test
    under the 2016 Regulations is different. I find  the  judge  adopted  a
    more restrictive approach to that permitted in EU law on the  issue  of
    dependency. On a proper application of Reyes  (EEA  Regs:  dependency),
    the first Appellant is dependant on the EEA sponsor.

15.  I find that the judge misdirected himself in  law  in  concluding  that
    the first Appellant was not dependant on the EEA sponsor. On the  facts
    found by the judge, the first Appellant had shown that she was a family
    member under Regulation 7 of the 2016 Regulations. She has been  living
    and working in the UK in accordance with  the  Regulations  since  July
    2013 and has, therefore, acquired  the  right  to  permanent  residence
    under Regulation 15.

The second Appellant

16.  The second Appellant does not have a right of  appeal  under  the  2016
    Regulations. His application was refused prior to the amendment brought
    about by the Immigration (EEA Nationals)  (EU  Exit)  Regulations  2019
    which applied  from  29  March  2019.   The  amendment  does  not  have
    retrospective effect.

17.  I informed the parties of my provisional view on 26 February  2020  and
    issued a direction that the parties file and serve written  submissions
    by 10 March 2019. The Appellants have  complied  with  that  direction.
    There was no response from the Respondent on the court file.

18.  The Appellants submit that  following  Banger  (EEA:  EFM  -  Right  of
    Appeal) [2019] UKUT 000194 (IAC) the second Appellant could  request  a
    new decision from the Respondent or rely  on  the  doctrine  of  direct
    effect. Mr Nicholson relied in his written submissions on [39] to  [43]
    of Banger and submitted the second Appellant issued a notice of  appeal
    which was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal and he  was  entitled  to
    rely on the direct effect  of  the  CJEU's  ruling  in  SSHD  v  Banger
    (Citizenship of the Union - Right of Union citizens to move and  reside
    freely within the territory of the EU) [2018]  EUECJ  C89/17  (12  July
    2018):

         "Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted  as  meaning
         that third- country nationals envisaged in that provision must have
         available to them a redress  procedure  in  order  to  challenge  a
         decision to refuse a residence authorisation  taken  against  them,
         following which the national  courts  must  be  able  to  ascertain
         whether the refusal decision  is  based  on  a  sufficiently  solid
         factual basis and whether the procedural safeguards  were  complied
         with. Those safeguards include the  obligation  for  the  competent
         national authorities to undertake an extensive examination  of  the
         applicant's personal circumstances and to  justify  any  denial  of
         entry of residence."

19.  I am persuaded by the UKUT's conclusions  at  paragraph  40  of  Banger
    that a statutory appeal is required to make findings of  fact  and  the
    Respondent has recognised this aspect of the CJEU judgment in  amending
    the 2016 Regulations and providing a statutory appeal.  The  Respondent
    did not raise the issue of jurisdiction before the First-tier  Tribunal
    or before me at the error of law hearing  and  no  written  submissions
    have been made. I  will  therefore  proceed  to  determine  the  second
    Appellant's appeal.

20.  The judge erred in law in failing to apply Dauhoo  (EEA  Regulations  -
    reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 00079 (IAC). The  judge  found  that  the  second
    Appellant was dependant on the sponsor prior to coming to the UK and he
    was a member of the sponsor's household since he came to  the  UK.  The
    second Appellant satisfied Regulation  8  and  is  an  extended  family
    member. He came to the UK in January 2018.  He  does  not  qualify  for
    permanent  residence.  Under  Regulation  17,  the  Respondent  has   a
    discretion to issue a residence card.

Summary

21.  I find that the judge erred in law and his decision of 11 June 2019  is
    set aside. I remake the  decision  and  allow  the  appeals  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

22.  The notice of hearing sent on 3 March  2020  was  sent  in  error.  The
    promulgation  of  this  decision  has  been  delayed  pending   written
    submissions from the parties on a point not raised at the error of  law
    hearing. A further oral hearing was not necessary in the circumstances.
