                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal brought on behalf of the Secretary of  State,  having
    been given permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingsworth on  21
    December 2018.

 2. In short, this appeal concerns a 35-year-old Pakistani man who  applied
    for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B of the  Immigration
    Rules ('the Rules') having resided in the United Kingdom for 10 years.

 3. The matter was listed before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Oliver  on  14
    September 2018. The focus of the appeal concerned the then  appellant's
    tax affairs. The Home Office had identified a discrepancy in the amount
    disclosed in the tax year  2012/2013.  The  figures  submitted  by  the
    appellant's accountants to HM Revenue  and  Customs  ('HMRC')  differed
    from the amount of income he had declared to the Home Office as part of
    his Tier 1  (General)  application.  The  appellant  at  first-instance
    attributed the error to a health issue at the time. The  central  issue
    for the tribunal judge to decide was whether this error was  a  genuine
    or careless mistake or whether it  was  deceitful  or  dishonest.  When
    alleging dishonesty, the  burden,  as  correctly  identified  by  Judge
    Oliver, initially stands  with  the  Home  Office  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities. (For the operation of the standard and burden of  proof,
    see   Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Shehzad  and
    Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615.)

 4. Judge Oliver found that the appellant satisfied paragraph 276B  of  the
    Rules  and  that  his  application  should  therefore  succeed.  In  so
    concluding, he found that the Secretary of State had  not  made  out  a
    case for deception.

 5. It is against that background that this matter was listed before me.

 6. The grounds of appeal can be summarised thus: firstly, that  the  judge
    failed to provide reasons and failed to make any adequate  findings  on
    material matters; and secondly, that the judge  materially  misdirected
    himself on the law.

 7. In terms of a failure  to  provide  reasons,  the  Secretary  of  State
    identifies paragraph 10 of the determination, where the judge at first-
    instance held:

    "Many of the occasions on which the respondent has applied this section
    are cases involving employment and self-employment and  the  respondent
    has not always shown any understanding that the tax years in  each  may
    be different. Because the allegation is one of deception, the onus lies
    on the respondent to establish this. It might  be  thought  surprising,
    therefore, that the respondent has not provided any expert evidence  to
    show that this possible explanation does not apply in the case  of  the
    appellant. On the  other  hand,  it  is  equally  surprising  that  the
    appellant has not produced evidence from his own accountant, with  whom
    he has stated he is still in contact. He has also stated that he handed
    all the papers to his accountant throughout."

 8. I concur with the Secretary of State that the judge  therein  fails  to
    provide an adequate reason for why he has concluded that the respondent
    has not made out a case of deception. The above paragraph  begins  with
    what can only be described as anecdotal  evidence  emanating  from  the
    judge himself. It is not specific to this appeal. I share the Secretary
    of State's concern that the suggestion that the respondent must in some
    way provide expert evidence to demonstrate that the judge's  conjecture
    does not apply sets the bar too high.

 9. The judge was required to address the evidence in  this  matter.  While
    the  judge  has  endeavoured  to  give  a  detailed  narrative  of  the
    appellant's case in the introduction to his judgement,  he  then  makes
    insufficient findings of fact in terms of what elements of that case he
    accepted, as opposed to what  the  Secretary  of  State  said  was  the
    position. As Judge Hollingsworth observes  in  granting  permission  to
    appeal, the essence of the case  was  that  in  the  period  ending  28
    February  2013  in  respect  of  the  appellant's  Tier   1   (General)
    application, the appellant had claimed an income made up of  �20,241.03
    from PAYE employment and �15,350 of dividends from  his  company.  That
    brought his income to over �35,000 and accordingly he  was  awarded  20
    points under the previous earnings category for Home  Office  purposes.
    However, in the appellants tax return for 2012/2013 the  appellant  had
    initially not declared any income from self-employment or dividends.

10. There was no  dispute  an  error  had  been  made.   In  terms  of  the
    discrepancy, the judge was required to address whether it was a genuine
    error or deceitful.

11. The issue is highlighted in R (on the application of  Shahbaz  Khan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  UKUT  00384  (IAC),
    where the court found that where there  was  a  significant  difference
    between the income claimed in  a  previous  application  for  leave  to
    remain and the income declared to HMRC,  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    entitled to draw an inference that the applicant had been deceitful  or
    dishonest and therefore he should be refused indefinite leave to remain
    within paragraph 322(5) of  the  Rules.  Such  an  inference  could  be
    expected where there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.

12. In my finding, the judge  has  failed  to  provide  cogent  reasons  to
    support the conclusion he has reached or why the inference was not made
    out, other than the bare statement at paragraph 11 of his determination
    that the respondent's assertion of deception failed.  It  follows  that
    the Secretary of State must succeed on the first ground of this appeal.



13. For completeness, I also address  the  second  ground  of  appeal  -  a
    material misdirection on the law.

14. The judge appears to have considered  the  appellant's  health  issues,
    which  were  the  appellant's  explanation  for   the   error,   before
    considering whether the Home Secretary had satisfied  the  tribunal  of
    the initial evidential hurdle, namely whether there  had  been  deceit.
    The judge appears to dismiss the evidence relating to  the  appellant's
    health, finding that he could place  little  reliance  on  the  medical
    reports and had formed a strong impression that during the hearing  the
    appellant 'was exploiting this claim to further what  he  perceived  as
    his own interests in the appeal', suggesting, on  one  view,  that  the
    evidential burden had shifted in the instant matter to  the  appellant.
    It was at least arguable, if it had shifted to the appellant, that  the
    judge made no specific findings about hyperthyroidism, or how  that  or
    the other health issues associated with  it  might  have  affected  the
    appellant at the relevant time.

15. Equally, the judge's statements on terrorism and serious criminality in
    paragraph 12 do not assist the reader in ascertaining  how  the  First-
    tier Tribunal arrived at its conclusion and trespasses to a  degree  on
    speculation.

16. In my finding, the judge's alternative hypothesis, combined  with  what
    is said about the medical condition, provides an insufficient  analysis
    in terms of the operation of  the  relevant  Rules  and  amounts  to  a
    material misdirection in terms of the law.  The  second  limb  of  this
    appeal also succeeds. I therefore propose to set this decision aside.

17. I add for completeness that it was not possible for me to  rehear  this
    matter on the day. My decision was reserved and  I  have  come  to  the
    conclusion that this matter is better remitted to the First-tier as the
    fact-finding tribunal. To  assist  the  judge  and  the  parties  going
    forward, I append to this decision the guidance that was produced by Mr
    Justice Martin Spencer in the case of Khan.



NOTICE OF DECISION

18. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is in error of law and  is  set
    aside.

20. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing  on
    all issues.

21. The matter will now be referred to a tribunal case  officer  at  Hatton
    Cross for a pre-hearing review and for the listing of this matter as an
    oral hearing.

Appendix - extract from:

R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC)

    Guidance


    37.  In order not to fall into the  trap  which  I  consider  that  the
         Secretary of State (or those acting on her  behalf)  fell  into  on
         this occasion, it may assist  for  me  to  give  some  guidance  in
         relation to the  decision-making  process  where  there  have  been
         discrepancies between previous applications  for  Leave  to  Remain
         (with points claimed on the basis of earnings or profits)  and  tax
         returns which  have  been  made  covering  the  same  period.  This
         guidance stems from my observations at paragraphs 32-34 above:


         (i)  Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules.  I  would
             expect the Secretary of State to  draw  that  inference  where
             there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


         (ii) However, where an Applicant has  presented  evidence  to  show
             that, despite the prima facie inference, he was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary  of  State  is
             presented with a fact-finding task: she  must  decide  whether
             the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in  her  view,  to
             displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.


         (iv)  However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
             accountant for an "error" in relation to  the  historical  tax
             return will not be the end of the matter: far from  it.  Thus,
             the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account  that,
             even where an accountant has made  an  error,  the  accountant
             will or should have asked the tax payer to  confirm  that  the
             return was accurate and to have signed  the  tax  return,  and
             furthermore the Applicant  will  have  known  of  his  or  her
             earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.  If,
             realising  this  (or  wilfully  shutting  his  eyes   to   the
             situation),  the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
             reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of
             State may be entitled to conclude either that  the  error  was
             not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively,  the
             Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies a
             conclusion that he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest
             and therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)
             of the Immigration Rules.


         (v)  Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a
             tax  return  has  been  dishonest  or  merely  careless,   the
             Secretary  of  State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence
             pointing in each direction and, in her decision,  justify  her
             conclusion  by  reference   to   that   evidence.   In   those
             circumstances, as long as the reasoning is  rational  and  the
             evidence has been properly considered,  the  decision  of  the
             Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


         (vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State
             to consider in reaching her decision in these cases, including
             (but these are by no means exclusive):


             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;


             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;


             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;


             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay.


         (vii)    In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary  of
             State is likely to want to see evidence which goes beyond mere
             assertion: for example, in a case such as  the  present  where
             the explanation is that the Applicant was  distracted  by  his
             concern for his son's  health,  there  should  be  documentary
             evidence about the matter. If there is, then the Secretary  of
             State would need to weigh up whether  such  concern  genuinely
             excuses or explains the failure to  account  for  tax,  or  at
             least displaces the inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful/dishonest. The Secretary of State, before making her
             decision, should call for the  evidence  which  she  considers
             ought to exist, and may draw an  unfavourable  inference  from
             any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.


         (viii)   In her decision, the Secretary of State should  articulate
             her reasoning, setting out the matters  which  she  has  taken
             into account in reaching her decision and stating the  reasons
             for the decision she has reached.
