For the Appellant:     Ms Rutherford, Counsel instructed by Halliday Reeves
                    Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national  of  Iran  born  in  February  1989.   He
       appeals with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal (Judge IF Taylor) date the 29th August 2019 to  dismiss  his
       protection and human rights appeals.

    2. The Appellant has a long history of interaction with the  immigration
       services. For the purpose of this decision the relevant dates to note
       are as follows. He is known to have been in the United Kingdom  since
       the 18th September 2005 when he  was  encountered  in  a  vehicle  at
       Dover. He claimed asylum on that date, a claim that was rejected. His
       efforts to appeal against that  decision  came  to  nothing  and  his
       appeal rights were exhausted on the 30th August 2007.  The  Appellant
       subsequently obtained permission to marry, and on the 23rd July  2010
       he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain, for  reasons  that  remain
       opaque. Seven years later, however, the Appellant put that  leave  in
       jeopardy when he was convicted of assault occasioning  Actual  Bodily
       Harm for which he received a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment. The
       particulars of the offence were described by the  trial  judge  as  a
       "not  insignificant  glassing".   This  was   his   eighth   criminal
       conviction, and the  length  of  sentence  triggered  the  'automatic
       deportation under s32 Borders Act 2007.

    3. In response to the decision to deport him  the  Appellant  relied  on
       both human rights and protection grounds.

    4. In respect of Article 8 the Respondent recognised that the  Appellant
       has children in the United Kingdom, but found him to have  failed  to
       demonstrate that it would be unduly harsh for those  children  if  he
       were to be deported. She refused to grant leave  and  the  First-tier
       Tribunal found the relevant exception at s33 of the Borders  Act  not
       to be engaged. There is no appeal against that decision.

    5. That leaves the protection grounds.  Before the  First-tier  Tribunal
       the Appellant argued that he has a well-founded fear of serious  harm
       in Iran because he is a Kurd, and because he is a  draft  evader.  He
       does not wish to undertake military service because of  human  rights
       abuses perpetrated by the Iranian military.  The Appellant  submitted
       that he would be at risk on arrival because he left  Iran  illegally,
       has been out of the country a long time and  has  not  completed  his
       military service: he relied in this  regard  on  the  "hair  trigger"
       approach by the Iranian security services towards  Kurdish  returnees
       as set out in HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430  (IAC).    Further
       he argued that once back in Iran he faces a real risk of  prosecution
       and imprisonment for his draft evasion, in conditions amounting to  a
       violation of his inviolable Article 3 rights.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the  Appellant's  original  asylum
       claim had been rejected  as  fabrication,  his  account  being  found
       "neither reliable nor credible".  That  said,  there  does  not  ever
       appear to have been any dispute that the Appellant is  a  Kurd.   Nor
       does there appear to be any dispute that given his age, and  date  of
       arrival in the United Kingdom, it is reasonably likely  that  he  has
       not yet completed military service in Iran. The First-tier Tribunal's
       findings can be summarised as follows:

             i) Military service is compulsory in Iran for males.  It  lasts
                between 12 and 24 months and is undertaken between the  ages
                of 18 and 40;

            ii)  Although  it  is  'compulsory'  there  are  a  plethora  of
                exceptions and "buy outs" - an individual can  for  instance
                pay a sum of money ($6500) in lieu of service;

           iii) The Appellant had not demonstrated that he would  be  unable
                to buy his way out;

            iv) Even if the Appellant did undertake service there is  not  a
                real risk that he would be required to be involved  in  acts
                contrary to the basic rules of  human  conduct.  Whilst  the
                Iranian army are currently active in Syria, and human rights
                violations are occurring, the evidence  indicates  that  the
                conscripts sent there are  generally  poor  Afghan  refugees
                hoping to gain Iranian citizenship through their service;

             v) The conditions experienced by conscripts are  grim  but  not
                sufficiently inhuman or degrading to engage Article 3;

            vi) Although there is a possibility of  a  prison  sentence  the
                Appellant could avoid this by paying, or by undertaking  his
                military service. "There appears to be  little  appetite  to
                prosecute  longstanding  service  defaulters  and   in   the
                circumstances it would be unlikely that the Appellant  would
                serve a prison sentence"

           vii) If an individual were sent to prison for  draft  evasion  he
                would face conditions that would violate Article 3

    7. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal on the  15th  November
       2019 on the grounds that in  reaching  its  decision  the  First-tier
       Tribunal erred in the following material respects:

             i) A failure to have regard to country  background  information
                indicating that while  the  standard  punishment  for  draft
                evasion is imprisonment for between 6 months  and  2  years,
                "longer draft evasion (one year during peace or  two  months
                during war) may result  in  criminal  proceedings  before  a
                military court";

            ii) A failure to consider the material fact that  the  Appellant
                is a Kurd who has previously spent time in Iraq;

           iii) Misunderstanding the objective evidence in respect  of  "buy
                out" options - these are available only at the time of  call
                up, and are not likely to be offered as an alternative after
                16 years of evasion

    8. Before me Ms  Rutherford  submitted  that  there  was  no  evidential
       foundation for the Tribunal's conclusions in respect of ground (iii).
       If it was wrong about that, the  appeal  should  have  been  allowed,
       since on the Tribunal's own findings the Appellant could, as  a  long
       term draft evader, end up facing conditions breaching Article 3 in an
       Iranian jail.

    9. Mr McVeety opposed the appeal on all grounds.  He submitted that  the
       Appellant's case is entirely hypothetical since there was no evidence
       before the Tribunal  of  actual  prosecutions,  prison  sentences  or
       otherwise. No matter what the Iranian law said, the  Appellant  could
       only make out his claim if he faced an actual risk of punishment  for
       the evasion thus far. 'Real' did not mean notional.  Furthermore, the
       grounds as argued were all irrelevant since the Appellant  could,  in
       the final analysis, avoid prosecution, prison and/or  persecution  by
       simply undertaking his military service. He has raised no  reason  of
       conscience as to why he would not wish to do so,  and  his  assertion
       that he would be required to undertake acts  contrary  to  the  basic
       rules of human conduct was expressly rejected by the Tribunal.




       Discussion and Findings

   10. At the end of its paragraph 23 the First-tier Tribunal,  citing  from
       the CPIN, says this:

           "In the latest budget the administration propose that those  who
           have defaulted on their service for more than eight years [which
           would include the Appellant] can pay a fine  to  buy  out  their
           military service. The fines differ based on level of  education,
           with a higher education demanding higher fines"

       It is on the basis of this information that the  First-tier  Tribunal
       goes on to find that this is an option available  to  the  Appellant,
       and rejects his contention that he would be unable to find the money.

   11. Ground (iii) takes issue with this  proposition,  alleging  that  the
       Tribunal misunderstood the evidence. The written grounds (which I  do
       not understand to have been drafted by Counsel) assert that  the  "IJ
       fails to grasp" the nature of the buy out, and that it is  an  option
       not available after such a long time.

   12. The CPIN before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  published  in  October
       2016. Section 5 of that CPIN Iran:  Military  Service  sets  out  the
       available information on the buy out under the heading "exemptions or
       alternatives".   It notes that there are many reasons a man could  be
       exempted, including but not limited to "payment in lieu  of  service"
       [5.1.6]. It then discusses some proposed shifts in  attitude  towards
       the 'buy out',  with  military  leadership  complaining  that  it  is
       discriminatory - I note that there is no evidence that the scheme was
       ever scrapped and this issue was not raised in the appeal before  me.
       At 5.2.3 comes the crucial evidence, at least in  respect  of  ground
       (iii):

           "In the latest budget, the administration  proposed  that  those
           who have defaulted on their military service for more than eight
           years can pay a fine to buy out of their military service".

   13. This was evidential foundation for the Tribunal's findings that  this
       was one option for the  Appellant  if  he  wished  to  avoid  prison,
       alongside  actually  performing  the  military  service  legitimately
       ordained by law in Iran.  If there were any doubt about that, I  note
       that it is dispelled by new evidence provided in the  latest  version
       of the CPIN (April 2020):

           5.5.3 The Interests Section of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran
           found on the Embassy of Pakistan's website provided  information
           regarding the purchase of military service. Form  011,  dated  7
           January  2019  stated:  'In  accordance   with   notice   number
           22213/12/3 dated 7 May 2017 by Headquarters of the Armed Forces,
           and the budget resolution for 2017, all men who have been absent
           from [evaded] military service for more than 8  years  can  take
           action to purchase their military service.

   14. This is followed by a detailed list of the  documents  etc  that  the
       applicant is required to produce. I am satisfied that the  First-tier
       Tribunal based its decision  on  the  available  evidence,  which  in
       retrospect has been supported by  yet  further  evidence.  There  was
       nothing before the First-tier Tribunal to indicate that the  buy  out
       would not be an available option for the Appellant. Ground  (iii)  is
       not made out.

   15. I return to ground (i). this ground is concerned with the standard of
       proof, and whether the statements in the CPIN that  an  evader  "may"
       face  prosecution  before  a  criminal  court  were   sufficient   to
       demonstrate a 'real risk'.

   16. By the time it came to consider whether this constituted a real  risk
       the Tribunal had  of  course  already  rejected  the  idea  that  the
       Appellant would face prosecution at all, holding that he could simply
       buy his way out. I note that  this  finding  of  fact  has  not  been
       challenged.  That said, the Tribunal acknowledges, at  its  �33,  the
       passage upon which the grounds rely.  It goes on to cite 7.2.1 of the
       CPIN that the punishment could "possibly" include imprisonment but it
       then concludes "there  seems  to  be  little  appetite  to  prosecute
       longstanding service defaulters such as  the  appellant  and  in  the
       circumstances I find that it would be  unlikely  that  the  appellant
       would have to serve a prison sentence". At 7.2.3: "it  is  not  known
       whether, in practice, the Iranian  authorities  pursue  a  policy  of
       actively  tracking  down  and  prosecuting  draft  evaders....".  The
       Tribunal concludes, in the absence of any positive evidence of people
       actually  being  prosecuted  or  imprisoned,  at  its  �37:  "in  the
       circumstances I am not satisfied that the appellant has  established,
       even to the low standard required, that if returned to Iran there  is
       a real risk that he will face persecution...or serious harm".

   17. I am satisfied that here the Tribunal  expressly  considered  whether
       the term "may" was capable  of  establishing  a  real  risk,  but  it
       concluded, on the evidence before it,  that  it  was  not.  The  CPIN
       features words such as "punishable", "liable",  "may"  and  "the  law
       provides for" but what is lacking is any evidence at all that anyone,
       including Kurds, has actually gone to prison for  failing  to  report
       for duty, even for a lengthy period.  In the absence  of  any  actual
       risk, the Tribunal was correct to find that the  notional  threat  of
       prosecution was insufficient to discharge the  burden  of  proof.   I
       note that there is nothing in the new CPIN that offers the  Appellant
       any assistance in that regard.

   18. That leaves ground (ii). The Tribunal expressly recognised that Kurds
       face discrimination in Iran [at its �32] but again there was  nothing
       in the evidence before it to indicate that Kurds  would  be  excluded
       from the 'buy out' scheme or that they face a  disproportionate  risk
       of prosecution. I note that  the  CPIN  does  expressly  address  the
       position of  groups  perceived  to  be  at  greater  risk,  including
       religious minorities or LGBT individuals.   Being  Kurdish  does  not
       feature.  I was taken to no evidence to the  contrary.   The  grounds
       place reliance on HB but as that decision makes clear, being  Kurdish
       does not in itself create a real risk of harm.  This Appellant has no
       political profile that might bring him to the  adverse  attention  of
       the Iranian authorities - I note that his original claim was based on
       a local fight and had nothing to do with the regime. Ground  (ii)  is
       not made out.




       Anonymity Order

   19. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having  had  regard  to
       Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the
       Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I therefore
       consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

       Decision and Directions

   20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  upheld.  The  appeal  is
       dismissed.

   21. There is an order for anonymity.
