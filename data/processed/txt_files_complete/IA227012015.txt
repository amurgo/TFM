                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Ms Jenna Chasinghawk date of birth 1 January 1982, is  a
    citizen of the USA.  Having considered all the circumstances, I do  not
    consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. Though this is an appeal by the respondent, the Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department, I have kept the designation of the parties as they
    appear in the original decision.

 3. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore promulgated  on
    19th December 2016, whereby the judge allowed  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the decision of the SSHD. The Secretary of  State  had  refused
    the appellant indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on  the
    basis of 10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK under paragraph
    276 B of the Immigration Rules  and  thereby  refused  the  appellant's
    application under Article 8 of the ECHR, family and private life. Judge
    Moore allowed the appeal on the basis that the appellant had accrued 10
    years lawful residence from 2001 through to 2012.

 4. By a decision of 18 September  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Doyle
    granted permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   Thus  the  case
    appeared before me to decide whether there was a material error of  law
    in the original decision. In granting leave Judge Doyle identified  the
    following issues with regard to the substantive issues  in  the  appeal
    namely :-

      a) the judge failed to engage with the  refusal  letter  and  made  no
findings in relation   to the respondent's argument that the  appellant  did
not have leave to remain in the   United Kingdom for 633 days.

      b) the judge had found that the  appellant  had  been  in  the  United
Kingdom since 2001     and had only been out of  the  United  Kingdom  since
that date for 38 days. However     the  judge  has  made  no  findings  with
regard to the history of the  application  for  and    grants  of  leave  to
remain. In the circumstances it is arguable  that  there  are     inadequate
findings within the decision.

 5. The grounds set out that the Refusal letter had identified  periods  of
    time when the appellant had been absent from  the  United  Kingdom  and
    periods when the appellant had had no leave. Paragraph  276B  not  only
    required a person to be resident but also to have leave, rendering  the
    residence lawful. The appellant's immigration history is  according  to
    the Refusal Letter as follows: -

      a) The appellant had entered the United Kingdom  firstly  on  15  July
         1998 with leave valid until 12 December 2001.

      b) After her leave had expired the appellant made an  application  for
         leave to remain as a student on  19  December  2001.  However  that
         application was withdrawn on 29 May 2002.

      c) The appellant then made an out of time  application  on  12  August
         2002 for further leave to remain as a student. That application was
         granted on 15 August 2002. The appellant was given leave  until  31
         October 2002.

         However for the period from 13 December 2001 through to  the  grant
         of leave on 15 August 2002 the  appellant  had  no  leave  and  was
         therefore not lawfully in the United Kingdom.  That  represented  a
         period of 243 days.

      d) The refusal letter states that the appellant then left  the  United
         Kingdom but does not give a date for that.  Equally it is not clear
         whether the appellant accepts that she was out of the  country  and
         if so for how long.

      e) The appellant re-entered the United Kingdom with leave as a student
         on 26 September 2003. The appellant's leave was then valid until 31
         October 2004.

         Therefore between the period of 1 November  2002  to  25  September
         2003 again the  appellant  had  no  leave  and  was  therefore  not
         lawfully in the United Kingdom. Otherwise the  appellant  was  also
         absent  from  the  United  Kingdom  for  a  period  of  time.  That
         represented a period of 327 days without lawful leave.

         The argument on behalf of the respondent  is  that  the  judge  has
         failed to take that into account in considering whether or not  the
         appellant had been lawfully resident in the United  Kingdom  for  a
         continuous period of 10 years as required by Paragraph 276B.

         Clearly if the matter stopped there then there would be much to say
         about the calculations made by the judge and whether or not he  was
         right  to  make  the  finding  that  he  did.  However  the   later
         immigration history is of significance.

      f) There is no evidence of the appellant leaving  the  United  Kingdom
         but on  29  December  2004  the  appellant  made  an  out  of  time
         application for leave  to  enter  or  remain  as  a  student.  That
         application was granted. The appellant  was  given  leave  from  30
         December 2004 until 30 June 2006.

      g) On 15 August 2006 the appellant applied for leave to  remain  as  a
         student. That was granted from 4 September 2006 until  30  November
         2010.

         However again that would mean for the period 1 July 2006 through to
         3 September 2006, the appellant again was without leave.

      h) However having been granted leave on 4 September 2006,  with  leave
         valid until 30 November 2010, on 10 August 2010, that is whilst the
         appellant still had lawful leave the appellant applied for leave to
         remain as the unmarried partner in a  same-sex  relationship.  That
         leave was granted on 21 September 2010  with  leave  being  granted
         until 21 September 2012.

      i)  On  20  September  2012  the  appellant  submitted   the   present
         application. That application was refused. There are two  decisions
         one made on the 5th June and one made on  the  26  June  2013.  The
         decisions made were  a  decision  to  refuse  her  application  for
         indefinite leave and  a  decision  to  remove  in  accordance  with
         section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

      j) It appears that  the  appellant  exercised  that  right  of  appeal
         initially lodging her appeal in time. There were  issues  with  the
         date of lodging the appeal. However the appellant lodged the appeal
         in  time  and  subsequently  the  appeal  was  reinstated  when  it
         transpired that a payment for the  appeal  had  not  been  assigned
         correctly. The appeal as lodged  was  reinstated  as  of  September
         2013.

      k) The appeal was heard on 8 April 2015 and First-tier Tribunal  Judge
         Beg  remitted  the  case  back  to  the  Home  Office  for  further
         consideration under the Immigration Rules.

      l) The application was further refused  on  the  9th  June  2015.  The
         appellant appealed in time. The appeal was heard by Judge Moore  on
         the 1st December 2016.

 6. In considering the appeal before assessing whether  or  not  the  judge
    correctly looked at the facts prior to September 2006, I wish  to  look
    at the period post 4 September 2006.

 7. I  draw  attention  to  the  provisions  of  section  3C  of  the  1971
    Immigration Act:-

    3C Continuation of leave pending variation decision

    1) This section applies if-

    a) a person who has limited leave to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State  for  the  variation  of  the
    leave,

    b) the application for variation is made before the leave expires, and

    c) the leave expires without the application the variation having  been
    decided.

    2) The leave is extended by virtue of this section  during  any  period
    when-

    a) the application for variation is neither decided no withdrawn,

    b) an appeal under section  82  (1)  of  the  Nationality,  Asylum  and
    Immigration Act 2002 could be brought, while the appellant  is  in  the
    United Kingdom against the decision on the  application  for  variation
    ignoring any possibility of an appeal out of time with permission,

    c) an appeal under that section against that decision brought while the
    appellant is in the United Kingdom is pending  within  the  meaning  of
    section 104 of that act, or

    d) an administrative review of the  decision  on  the  application  for
    variation-

    i) could be sought, or

    ii) is pending

    .....

 8. At this stage an issue which does not appear to have been considered by
    any of the parties in the proceedings is the length of  time  that  the
    appellant has been in  the  United  Kingdom  post  September  2006  and
    whether the appellant has throughout  that  period  had  lawful  leave.
    There is no evidence that the appellant has  left  the  United  Kingdom
    since September 2006. If the  appellant  has  had  lawful  leave  since
    September  2006  then  the  appellant  now  has  10  years  lawful  and
    continuous residence and did so at the time of the hearing before Judge
    Moore. The appellant would meet the requirements of the rules  for  the
    period post September 2006.

 9. The appellant had leave from September 2006 through to  21st  September
    2012. The appellant lodged an in-time application, which was decided on
    the 26th June 2013. Thereafter the appellant appealed in time  in  June
    2013 and her appeal was reinstated as  of  September  2013.  Given  the
    circumstances it was accepted that the appeal should be  reinstated  as
    lodged. In the circumstances this was not an appeal out of time but was
    the original appeal proceeding.

10. The appeal was heard  by  Judge  Beg,  who  remitted  it  back  to  the
    respondent for further consideration by decision of the 8th April 2015.



11. By the time that the appeal  came  to  be  heard  by  Judge  Moore  the
    appellant had accrued 10 years residence and the residence  was  lawful
    by operation of Section 3C.

12. At the beginning of the hearing  I  pointed  out  the  details  to  the
    representative for the respondent. It was accepted that  the  appellant
    had therefore accrued 10 years lawful  residence  from  September  2006
    through to December 2016. I would note that that  lawful  residence  is
    continuing.

13. Whilst Judge Moore has failed to assess whether the  residence  of  the
    appellant was lawful and whether the appellant's leave was  lawful  may
    be subjected to scrutiny, it would if  the  appellant  had  accrued  10
    years  lawful  leave  post  September  2006  make  no  difference.  The
    appellant  would  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules. In that event the appellant meeting the requirements
    of the rules the fact that the judge allowed  it  and  the  basis  upon
    which the judge allowed it may not be made out on the facts of the case
    is not a point  which  matters  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  The
    appellant's application under the Immigration rules  should  have  been
    allowed on the basis that by the time of the hearing before Judge Moore
    she had accrued 10 years lawful residence from September 2006.

14. In such circumstances whilst this is an appeal under Article  8  family
    and private life, significant weight would have to be given to the fact
    that the Secretary of State has acknowledged in the  Immigration  Rules
    where the balance lies with  regard  to  private  life.  The  appellant
    clearly  meets  the  rules  and  in  the  circumstances  presented  has
    established family and private life in the United Kingdom. With  regard
    to private life whilst the decision would be in accordance with the law
    and for the purposes of maintaining immigration control as an aspect of
    the economic well-being of the country, consideration has to  be  given
    to  the  immigration  rules  and  whether  or  not  the   decision   is
    proportionately taking such into account. Whilst consideration  has  to
    be given to section 117B of the 2002 Act, even taking that into account
    I find that the decision would in  any  event  not  be  proportionately
    justified.

15. In the circumstances if one were to examine what the  First-tier  Judge
    has done the judge has failed to take account  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant did not have lawful leave at material  times  during  the  10
    years under consideration. That having  been  said  however  given  the
    factors outlined above the appeal stands to be  allowed  on  the  basis
    indicated.
