Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Nizami instructed by Sterling Chance Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He  appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the respondent's decision  of  13  December  2016
    refusing his application for a residence  card  on  the  basis  of  his
    relationship with [RH] a Lithuanian national.

2.   The judge noted the relatively low  earnings  of  the  sponsor  between
    2012 and 2016.  She had earned �8,616 in the year 2016 to 2017 but  the
    levels  of  income  in  the  previous  years  were   noted   as   being
    substantially lower than the primary earnings thresholds  for  each  of
    the years 2011 to 2016.  The judge noted that her income figures  apart
    from that one year had been very low, being around �2,000  and  in  one
    year she earned nothing.  The judge concluded  that  even  taking  into
    account all the circumstances for maternity leave and that her  husband
    earned enough money to support the family  her  self-employment  though
    genuine was not effective and therefore she did not meet the definition
    of a "worker" within the meaning of Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

3.   The appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal on the  basis
    that the judge, having accepted  that  in  the  most  recent  year  the
    sponsor earned well above  the  primary  earnings  threshold  had  done
    sufficient to justify the award of a residence card.  There was also an
    argument in respect of Regulation 6  and  the  sponsor  satisfying  the
    criteria set out for self-sufficient persons in  Regulation  4  of  the
    Regulations.

4.   Due to the fact that the appellant had  now  different  representatives
    from those who had  acted  for  him  at  the  appeal  and  yet  further
    representatives who had dealt with the  subsequent  matter,  there  had
    been some confusion as to exactly what his situation was.  It  appeared
    that the third set of solicitors who had not acted in respect of either
    appeal had written to the respondent making a further application for a
    residence card, on 17 November 2017, and  a  residence  card  had  been
    issued to the appellant on 28 February 2018, for five years.

5.   It appeared therefore that the  appeal  was  essentially  academic,  Ms
    Nizami argued that it would be of assistance to have a finding  on  the
    error of law and possible remaking of the decision.  She accepted  that
    the claim in respect of Regulation 6 could not succeed as there was  no
    evidence of comprehensive sickness insurance, but she argued  that  the
    judge had erred with regard to genuine ineffectiveness.

6.   Mr Whitwell argued that the findings were open  to  the  judge  on  the
    evidence.  He had noted at paragraph 6 that the appellant was  paid  in
    cash and there was no audit trail.  He could not however challenge  the
    point made at paragraph 15 where the judge noted there was no challenge
    to the accuracy of the current level of income claimed.

7.   I am satisfied that the judge erred in law in this case.  On the  basis
    of the level of earnings in 2016 to 2017 it was  not  correct  to  find
    that the appellant had not shown  that  the  sponsor's  employment  was
    genuine and effective.  It is relevant also to bear  in  the  mind  the
    point made by Ms Nizami that the primary earnings threshold  is  geared
    towards the employed rather than  the  self-employed  into  which  that
    category the sponsor falls.  She also relied on what had been  said  in
    Kempf (case 139/85) that a  part-time  employed  music  teacher  giving
    twelve one hour lessons a week was found to be engaged in a genuine and
    effective work.  It is however  in  particular  on  the  basis  of  the
    accepted earnings in 2016 and 2017 that I conclude that the sponsor  is
    properly to be regarded as meeting the definition of a "worker"  within
    the meaning of Regulation 6, and as a consequence  the  appeal  against
    the refusal to grant a residence card is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
