For the Respondent:    Mr I Khan Counsel instructed by Blackrock Solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith promulgated on the  13th  October
    2017 whereby the judge allowed  the  appeal  of  Mrs  [B]  against  the
    decision of the ECO  to  refuse  her  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all of the circumstances I do not consider
    it necessary to do so.

 3. The respondent, Rasheda [B] date of  birth  10  September  1972,  is  a
    citizen of Bangladesh.

 4. The original application was made by Mrs [B] on 3 June 2016  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as an adult  dependent  relative  of  a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom under the  Immigration
    Rules, Appendix FM, and under Article 8 of the ECHR. By decision of the
    15 September 2016 the ECO refused the application.  That  decision  was
    upheld on review by the entry clearance manager on 14  September  2017.
    Mrs [B]'s "sponsors" were her offspring, 4 adults and 1 child.

 5. Mrs [B] appealed against the decision by the ECO. The  appeal  appeared
    before Judge Griffiths, who in a decision  promulgated  on  13  October
    2017, allowed the appeal The ECO appealed against the decision of Judge
    Griffiths.

 6. The application for permission to appeal was considered  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge JM Holmes who on the 15 December 2017 gave the following
    reasons for granting permission:-

         "4 Arguably there is no clear finding of "family life" between this
         adult parent and any member of the family now  living  in  the  UK,
         even if some a minor children of hers, and it  is  far  from  clear
         that such a finding should be made in the light  of  the  evidence,
         and the current jurisprudence; Singh, Butt, Ghising. There  was  no
         evaluation of whether 'family life' between the Appellant  and  any
         of her minor children had been terminated or eroded by what appears
         to have been a tacit acceptance of the long separation.

         5  Even if Article 8 was engaged by the decision,  it  is  arguable
         that the Judge's approach  to  the  assessment  of  proportionality
         failed to apply either the relevant jurisprudence, or the statutory
         provisions of s117A-B 2002 Act. The Judge notes real concerns  over
         the reliability of the evidence  over  the  true  circumstances  of
         minor children within the UK, and how they were  being  cared  for;
         but also notes that social services had not seen fit to  intervene.
         The Judge also notes that the Appellant 'does not come near meeting
         the requirements of the Immigration Rules for entry  as  an  "adult
         dependent relative.""

 7. On the basis of the leave granted the  appeal  appeared  before  me  to
    determine in the first instance whether or not  there  was  a  material
    error of law in the decision of Judge Griffiths.

 8.  It was accepted before Judge Griffiths that Mrs [B] could not meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules as an  adult  dependent  relative
    under Appendix FM and that the appeal had to be decided on the basis of
    Article 8 outside the rules. I would note that at the  commencement  of
    the hearing before me I did point out that  Mrs  [B]  could  have  been
    considered as a parent under Appendix FM but again it was accepted that
    she could not meet the requirements under Appendix FM for  entry  as  a
    parent.

 9. It is accepted that Mrs [B]'s husband, [BM],  was  a  British  citizen.
    There is reference in the papers to the fact that [BM] was  in  the  UK
    from when he was 4 years old. It appears that certainly from 1999  (see
    paragraph 28 of the decision) onwards [BM] was  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom. There appear to be 5 children of the marriage between [BM] and
    Mrs [B], (according to paragraph  5  of  the  decision  and  the  entry
    clearance manager's review). Of those 5 children at  the  time  of  the
    present application 2 of them were  still  minors,  the  other  3  were
    adults. The offspring are British citizens and all 5 were at  the  time
    of the application and are at present living in the UK.

10. It appears that the children of the family came to the  United  Kingdom
    in two groups. According to paragraph 5  of  the  decision,  3  of  the
    children came in 2009 and the remaining 2 came in February 2011. It was
    admitted that at various stages Mrs [B] had sought entry clearance as a
    spouse but her applications had been refused because she could not meet
    the requirements of the rules as a spouse.

11. On 17 March 2016 Mrs [B]' husband, [BM], died. It appears  that  the  5
    children remained in the United Kingdom  living  in  the  accommodation
    that was the family home. As noted in paragraph 8 of the decision there
    was a suggestion that the 2 youngest  children  were  known  to  Social
    Services but the enquiries by the ECO were to  the  contrary  as  their
    information was that social services were unable to contact the family.
    The suggestion that they were known to social services comes  from  the
    evidence of the sponsors and in a letter from the solicitors at page 30
    of the bundle wherein it is stated first paragraph final sentence:-

         "The social services report  is  enclosed  please  kindly  consider
         this."

12. It does not appear  that  the  report  was  in  fact  enclosed  and  as
    indicated the ECO was indicating that social services  were  unable  to
    make contact with the family in the UK.  Judge  Griffiths  did  comment
    that evidence from social services would have  assisted.  Whatever  the
    state of the evidence, there was no evidence of involvement  of  social
    services such as to evidence serious concerns as to the welfare of  the
    children.

13. Mrs [B] made her application for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom
    in June 2016.

14. The evidence given at the First-tier hearing is set out from  paragraph
    14 to 23. A number of assertions were made by the  sponsors  about  the
    age and medical condition of Mrs [B]. The judge noted that the lady was
    only 43 years  old  and  whilst  assertions  were  made  that  she  was
    suffering from a number of medical  conditions,  including  depression,
    brain damage, blood pressure and other diseases,  the  judge  found  at
    paragraph 25 that there was no evidence or at least no medical evidence
    that she was suffering from depression or stress or any other  ailments
    serious or otherwise. The judge did note that she had been admitted and
    treated in hospital for 4  days  suffering  from  syncope  [a  loss  of
    consciousness due to a fall in blood pressure] and  disorientation,  it
    is suggested, immediately after the death of her husband. However there
    was no  evidence  that  she  had  any  ongoing  symptoms  or  that  the
    assertions otherwise as to medical conditions were made out. The  judge
    therefore concluded that were no medical conditions which  could  bring
    her within the terms of the Immigration Rules. [Appendix FM paragraph E-
    ECDR.2.4 requires that a person must  as  a  result  of  age,  illness,
    disability, require long term personal care]. The  judge  concluded  in
    paragraph 25 that Mrs [B] did not come near meeting the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules.

15. The judge went on to find that Mrs [B] may be living to  an  extent  on
    her own but she had the assistance of a servant, who cooked for her. It
    was suggested that she had no relatives in Bangladesh. However Mrs  [B]
    was living with an uncle's family, although there were questions as  to
    who owned the house in which she was living.

16. The evidence before  the  judge  was  to  the  effect  that  the  adult
    offspring in the United Kingdom financially supported Mrs [B].

17. Of the children, who were minors at the date of the application, at the
    time of the hearing one was 18  and  in  full-time  education  and  the
    youngest of all was in 6th form again still  in  education.  The  judge
    concluded that there was no evidence of  social  services  involvement.
    The judge pointed out the  discrepancies  between  what  had  been  the
    result of the ECO's contact with the social services and the family and
    the evidence of the older offspring.

18. In coming to a conclusion the judge had taken account of the case  that
    was cited by representative for the ECO of Britcits [2016] EWHC 956 and
    found that it was not relevant as it was a judicial review challenge to
    the legality of  the  rules  relating  to  adult  dependent  relatives.
    Further the Britcits case was related to  the  family  life  and  frail
    elderly parents of sponsors, who were settled in the United Kingdom.

19. In dealing with the issues in the case the judge took  account  of  the
    fact that there was one minor child and four  young  adults  that  were
    living together without any parental oversight. He suggests that  those
    circumstances are undesirable and that merely by  reason  of  the  fact
    that 4 of them were adults, it had to be acknowledged that there was no
    bright line in such circumstances concluding that there were minors and
    young adults without appropriate adult supervision.

20. The judge took account of the positive obligation of the United Kingdom
    to facilitate family reunion taking account of the  best  interests  of
    the child he found that their interests and the interests  of  Mrs  [B]
    outweighed the public interest in maintaining immigration control.  The
    judge then stated that in coming to that decision he had taken  account
    of the provisions of Section 117B. He acknowledged that  the  appellant
    did not speak English and that she  was  not  financially  independent.
    However he  was  satisfied  that  2  of  her  offspring  supported  her
    financially and that would continue if she came to the  United  Kingdom
    and she was therefore unlikely to be a burden on the taxpayer.

21. With respect that seems to ignore the guidance given in such  cases  as
    Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and SM & others [2015] EWCA  Civ  223.  The
    problem with many of the cases cited is that they are not dealing  with
    the relationship between a parent and a minor child but rather  dealing
    with the situation where adult appellants and adult parents or siblings
    are involved. Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160 -  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    were adults; Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 630 again adults; Butt  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 184 again both the appellants were adult daughters.

22. Even Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 was again dealing with  the  situation
    in which an  adult  appellant  and  other  adult  family  members.  The
    guidance given in paragraph 25:

         "25      Because there is no presumption  of  family  life,  in  my
         judgment a family life is not established between an  adult  child
         and his surviving parent or other siblings  unless  something  more
         exists than normal emotional ties: see S v United Kingdom (1984) 40
         DR 196 and Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and  Balkandali  v  United  Kingdom
         [1985] 7 EHRR 471. Such ties might  exist  if  the  appellant  were
         dependent on  his  family  or  vice  versa.  It  is  not,  however,
         essential that the members of the family  should  be  in  the  same
         country. The Secretary of State accepts that that  possibility  may
         exist, although in my judgment it  will  probably  be  exceptional.
         Accordingly there is no absolute rule that  there  must  be  family
         life in the United Kingdom,  as  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal
         held."

23. In the present case one is not dealing just with  adult  relatives  but
    with a child. In that respect SM may provide some guidance. In the case
    it was 5 children, 3 of whom were children of the sponsor and  two  who
    were nephews or nieces of the sponsor, who were seeking  entry  to  the
    United Kingdom but the children  were  aged  between  14  and  16.  The
    children had been left in Ethiopia with relatives and friends  and  had
    been there for over 4 � years prior to the date of the application. The
    sponsor had come to the United Kingdom with her husband. Whilst it  was
    found that on the facts of the case Article 8 was engaged Lord  Justice
    Bean at paragraph 15 indicated that it was  far  from  clear  that  the
    refusal of  entry  clearance  to  the  appellants  constituted  serious
    interference with family life:-

         "15      I accept that Article 8 is engaged in  the  present  case,
         but it is far from clear that the refusal of entry clearance to the
         appellants in 2009  constituted  serious  interference  with  their
         family life at all. The fact is that since 2004, when the  youngest
         was 8 and the oldest was 10, the children had not been living  with
         the sponsor, the mother of three of them and the aunt  of  the  two
         others. She had left them in the care of her half brother  Mohammed
         Sabriye both for the two years leading up to her  divorce  in  2006
         and for the two years thereafter until he was killed in  2008,  and
         maintained regular contact with them. By the time  the  application
         for entry clearance was made the youngest of the  children  was  13
         and the oldest was 15. The case is quite different  from  the  more
         typical one where the  status  quo  before  the  refusal  of  entry
         clearance or the proposed removal was or is  a  united  family.  As
         Toulson LJ observed the last time the case was before this court in
         the passage italicised above, the trauma of breaking  up  a  family
         and thereby rupturing family ties may be significantly greater than
         the effect of not  facilitating  the  reunion  of  a  family  whose
         members have become accustomed to living apart following a decision
         by part of the family to live elsewhere."

24. Similarly in SM paragraph 18 it was recognised that there was a  strong
    emotional need to reunite the children  with  the  sponsor  who  had  a
    maternal bond with all of the children concerned. However the Court  of
    Appeal upheld the decision to dismiss the appeal on the basis that  the
    continued separation of the  appellants  from  the  sponsor  would  not
    prejudice their family life in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount
    to a breach of the fundamental right protected  by  article  8,  having
    regard to the factors in favour of refusal.  One  material  factor  was
    that it was suggested that the sponsor had not  voluntarily  chosen  to
    leave the appellants but even that was not sufficient.

25. As outlined in the case law the ages of the children  being  considered
    were significantly younger at the time of  the  application,  then  the
    children in the present case. The period of separation since the  child
    or children had lived with sponsor was also a  significant  factor.  On
    the facts of SM separation was for a period of a little over 4 � years.



26. In the present case the family have chosen as they were entitled to  do
    to live in the UK and have done so for over 6 or 7  years  without  the
    appellant.

27. In the circumstances whilst there would be a finding that  family  life
    did exist with the minor child, the judge has failed properly to assess
    in accordance with the case law  outlined  above  whether  it  was  the
    refusal that interfered with that family life  as  established  by  the
    family itself. The judge has concentrated merely on the  obligation  to
    promote family reunion and proportionality. Clearly from the  case  law
    there are other factors  in  determining  whether  or  not  it  is  the
    decision of the ECO that is  interfering  with  that  family  life  and
    whether taking the other factors into account it is the  decision  that
    seriously interferes with family life  as  established  by  the  family
    itself and thereafter such  outweighs  the  significant  importance  of
    maintaining immigration control. Not least  amongst  those  factors  is
    that the Immigration Rules make provisions under  which  an  individual
    can seek entry to the United Kingdom and Mrs [B]  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules and the sponsors had not lived with  Mrs  [B]
    for 6 or 7 years.

28. In the light of the matters set out the judge has made a material error
    of law. The only appropriate course is for the case to be remitted back
    to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  hearing  afresh  were  a  proper
    assessment can be made of the respective rights.

29. I have considered whether any of the findings of fact made by the judge
    should be preserved. It appears to me that there is  no  reason  to  go
    behind the findings with regard to the Immigration Rules. The remit  is
    therefore limited to the extent the proper assessment of the article  8
    rights outside the Immigration Rules.

    Notice of Decision

30. I allow the appeal of the Secretary of State for the Home Department to
    the extent that the appeal is remitted back to the First-tier  Tribunal
    on the basis indicated.

31. I do not make an anonymity direction

Case law



SSHD v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387

In the light of these authorities, we consider that the state has a wider
margin of appreciation in determining the conditions to be satisfied before
LTE is granted, by contrast with the position in relation to decisions
regarding LTR for persons with a (non-precarious) family life already
established in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State has already, in
effect, made some use of this wider margin of appreciation by excluding
section EX.1 as a basis for grant of LTE, although it is available as a
basis for grant of LTR. The LTE Rules therefore maintain, in general terms,
a reasonable relationship with the requirements of Article 8 in the
ordinary run of cases. However, it remains possible to imagine cases where
the individual interests at stake are of a particularly pressing nature so
that a good claim for LTE can be established outside the Rules. In our
view, the appropriate general formulation for this category is that such
cases will arise where an applicant for LTE can show that compelling
circumstances exist (which are not sufficiently recognised under the new
Rules) to require the grant of such leave
