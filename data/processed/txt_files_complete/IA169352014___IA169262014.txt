Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Iqbal of Counsel instructed by Britton
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The first appellant is the mother of the  second  appellant.  They  are
    both citizens of India.  The first appellant was born on 15th December,
    1978.  The second appellant was born on 8th  July,  2006.   The  second
    appellant's appeal is dependent  on  that  of  her  mother  and  future
    reference to "the appellant" in this determination is  a  reference  to
    the first appellant.

2.   The  appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student  on  13th
    September, 2008 and her daughter joined her as  a  dependant  in  March
    2009.  Leave was extended until 19th May, 2010 and before leave expired
    the appellant made application to settle in the United  Kingdom.   That
    application was refused  and  her  appeal  against  that  decision  was
    dismissed in November 2013.  The appellant then applied  for  leave  to
    remain as an entrepreneur offering a tuition service  in  the  Hounslow
    area catering mainly for children living locally.   The  appellant  was
    interviewed in connection with that application which was  subsequently
    refused on 2nd April, 2014.

3.   The reason the application was refused was because the  respondent  was
    not satisfied that the appellant genuinely intended setting up  such  a
    business.  The respondent assessed the application by  considering  the
    requirements of paragraph 245DD(h) and the factors listed in  paragraph
    244DD(i) of Statement of  Changes  in  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as
    amended) ("the Immigration Rules").  Reference was made in the  refusal
    letter to the viability and credibility of funds held by the  applicant
    which were said to be the result of a gift of �50,000 from her  sister-
    in-law with whom she  lives  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Concerns  were
    expressed about the appellant's business plan and market  research  and
    her relatively limited experience of teaching or setting up a business.
     No points were awarded for attributes.

4.   The appellant appealed and her appeal was  heard  at  Hatton  Cross  on
    17th November, 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Widdup.

5.   The judge's determination was promulgated on 28th  November  2014.   He
    found that a home tuition business was  entirely  credible.   He  found
    that there  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  any  previous
    experience in setting up a business on  the  scale  she  proposed.   He
    noted that paragraph 245DD(h)(ii) requires that the appellant show that
    she generally intends to invest �50,000 in the business.  He said:

         "This part of the appellant's case was damaged by her own  evidence
         that she could have financed the business  with  �10,000  and  that
         initially she would only need �5,000  or  �6,000.   She  could  not
         justify her calculation of needing �50,000 and  accepted  that  the
         need for that amount was to meet a requirement of the rules."

    He found that the appellant had acquired the �50,000 from her sister-in-
    law to meet the requirements of the Rules  rather  than  because  there
    were particular business needs which would make such  a  sum  necessary
    for the business.

6.   Although not required to submit a  business  plan,  the  appellant  did
    submit one.  The judge found its credibility to be undermined in  three
    aspects.  At page 3 reference was made to a "devoted  and  well-trained
    team of teachers".   The  judge  found  that  that  was  not  a  proper
    reflection of the state of the appellant's business.  It did not add to
    the credibility of the business plan but the appellant's case was  that
    business plans were all much the same and that hers was "taken off  the
    shelf" by requiring it online.  The last damning aspect  was  that  the
    appellant told the judge that she had read the business plan  but  that
    she had not had much time.  He believed that the business  plan  lacked
    credibility  and  cast  further  doubt  on  the  genuineness   of   the
    appellant's intentions.  He found that on the  balance  of  probability
    the appellant was not a  genuine  entrepreneur  and  he  dismissed  the
    appellant's Article 8 appeal.

7.   Dissatisfied with the decision, the appellant lodged Notice of  Appeal.
     Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsey granted permission and in  doing  so  she
    said this:

         "Judge  Widdup  found  that  the  first  appellant's  home  tuition
         business was entirely credible at paragraph  38  of  the  decision;
         that the appellant had transferrable skills from teaching and  that
         she had access to �50,000.  It is arguable, given  these  findings,
         that it was irrational to  find  that  use  of  an  off  the  shelf
         business plan as the starting point for  the  appellant's  business
         plan; obtaining students initially through personal  recommendation
         rather than through advertising; the fact that the first  appellant
         had not yet established her team of teachers or invested  the  full
         funds meant that the business was not genuine."

8.   Mr Iqbal submitted that the judge had erred in  failing  to  find  that
    the appellant was  a  genuine  entrepreneur.   He  submitted  that  the
    appellant was entitled to the benefit of  the  doubt.   But  the  judge
    failed to find on the balance of probabilities that the appellant was a
    genuine entrepreneur.  He accepted that the appellant  has  the  money,
    that she has transferrable  skills  and  that  she  has  the  necessary
    experience to run the business.  What the judge failed  to  understand,
    he submitted, was that the appellant did not need to  invest  the  full
    amount of money within three years.  She was starting her business on a
    small scale that inevitably would  grow  and  would  require  the  full
    �50,000 which had been secured by her.   Mr  Norton  told  me  that  he
    simply relied on paragraphs 40 and 41 of the determination.  I reserved
    my decision.

9.   Paragraph 245DD(h) and (i) provide as follows:-

         "(h) Where the  applicant  is  being  assessed  under  Table  4  of
         Appendix A, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that:

             (i) the applicant genuinely:

                  (1) intends and is able to establish, take over or  become
                  a director of one or more businesses in the UK within  the
                  next six months, or

                  (2) has established, taken over or become  a  director  of
                  one or more businesses in the UK and continues to  operate
                  that business or businesses; and

             (ii) the applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
             referred to in Table 4  of  Appendix  A  in  the  business  or
             businesses referred to in (i);

             (iii) the money referred to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  is
             genuinely  available  to  the  applicant,  and   will   remain
             available to him until such  time  as  it  is  spent  for  the
             purposes of his business or businesses.

             (iv) that the applicant does not intend to take employment  in
             the United Kingdom other than under  the  terms  of  paragraph
             245DE.

         (i) The applicant must provide a business  plan,  setting  out  his
         proposed business activities in the UK and how he expects  to  make
         his business succeed.

         (j) In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:

             (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;

             (ii) the viability and credibility of the source of the  money
             referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;

             (iii)  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the   applicant's
             business plans and market research into their chosen  business
             sector;

             (iv)  the  applicant's  previous  educational   and   business
             experience (or lack thereof);

             (v) the applicant's immigration history and previous  activity
             in the UK;

             (vi) where the applicant has already registered in the  UK  as
             self-employed or as the director of a business, and the nature
             of the business requires mandatory accreditation, registration
             and/or insurance,  whether  that  accreditation,  registration
             and/or insurance has been obtained; and

             (vii) any other relevant information.

10.  It will be noted that 245H(ii) requires that  the  applicant  genuinely
    intends to invest the money referred to  in  the  business.   Paragraph
    245DD(i) directs the Secretary of State to  take  into  account  (inter
    alia) viability and credibility of the appellant's  business  plan  and
    market research into her own chosen business sector and also any  other
    relevant information (vii).  The difficulty for this appellant is  that
    at the hearing when giving evidence she accepted that  she  could  have
    financed the business with �10,000 and that initially  she  would  only
    need �5,000 or �6,000.   She  could  not  justify  her  calculation  of
    needing �50,000 and accepted that the need for that amount was to  meet
    the requirement of the Rules.

11.  The Rules do not permit anyone to remain in the United  Kingdom  simply
    because they are starting a business.  Mr Iqbal suggested  to  me  that
    the money could be invested over a period of three years.  So  it  can,
    but that does not mean that this business will require  �50,000  to  be
    invested in it over the next three years; the  appellant  is  satisfied
    that it could have been financed with �10,000.  As Judge Widdup said at
    paragraph 47 of the determination, "there would also appear to be a gap
    between the claims  in  the  business  plan  and  the  reality  of  the
    business".  The business plan  is  full  of  advertising  "puff".   The
    business may very well provide one or two people with a  modest  income
    but that is not the purpose of the Immigration Rules.   The  judge  was
    entitled to make the findings he did at paragraphs 40  and  41  of  the
    determination.  Although not relied on by Counsel in addressing  me  it
    is right that I should deal with the other challenges to  the  decision
    on which permission was granted. Criticism is made of  what  the  judge
    says at paragraph 35 of the determination where the appellant  made  no
    mention of her home tutoring during a previous appeal hearing.   It  is
    suggested that the appellant should not be unfairly penalised for this.
     With respect, she was not penalised at all because of this.

12.  The  poorly  drafted  grounds  suggest  that  the  business  plans  are
    something prepared for the future, three or five years,  and  that  the
    sum of �50,000 may well be required in the future.  With respect,  this
    wholly misunderstands  the  purpose  of  the  Rule.   The  Rule  is  to
    encourage business creativity and entrepreneurship.  It is not a  means
    by which people who wish to stay in the  United  Kingdom  can  start  a
    little business and remain here.  If  the  appellant  had  proposed  to
    start a new college, acquiring premises, employing staff and  embarking
    on an advertising campaign to recruit students, then the sum of �50,000
    (or possibly higher) would be required.   The  appellant  herself  said
    that her business could be financed on �5,000 or �6,000.

13.  The rule do require the production of a business plan, setting out  the
    appellant's proposed business activities in the UK and how she  expects
    to make her business succeed, and the Secretary of State  was  entitled
    to take account of it and the judge was entitled to make  the  comments
    he did in respect  of  it.   The  business  plan  contained  misleading
    statements.  The appellant does not have, "a devoted  and  well-trained
    team of teachers".  The judge was  entitled  to  find  that  a  genuine
    entrepreneur setting up a business which would require an investment of
    �50,000 would not acquire a business plan  from  "an  expert"  off  the
    shelf and submit it for consideration, even though it  was  inaccurate.
    The fact that she did so inevitably cast doubt on  the  genuineness  of
    her intentions, as the judge found.

14.  Having carefully read the determination I am  satisfied  that  it  does
    not contain any material error  on  a  point  of  law.   I  uphold  the
    determination.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
