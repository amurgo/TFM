Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Nathan (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Sri Lanka, who was born on  5th
    December 1985.  She appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
    decision of the Respondent, taken on 17th  April  2015,  rejecting  her
    application for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  her  family
    life  with  [VM],  a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  UK.   The
    application was considered under Appendix FM and  paragraph  276ADE(1),
    as well outside the Immigration Rules on an  exceptional  circumstances
    basis.

 2. The Appellant's appeal was heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Kimnell  at
    Hatton Cross on 28th January 2016.  He took into account the fact  that
    at the time of the appeal, the Appellant  was  pregnant,  although  the
    Respondent authority was of the view  that  it  was  possible  for  the
    Appellant's husband to find suitable employment in Sri Lanka, where  he
    had spent a considerable period of his life  and  the  application  had
    been refused on this basis.

 3.  The  Appellant  had  argued  before  Judge  Kimnell  that  there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles" in that the Appellant  cannot  live  in  Sri
    Lanka because she has a baby now of eight months and her husband  works
    long hours.  The Appellant has been in the UK a long time  and  claimed
    asylum.  She did not know how long the couple would be  parted  if  she
    returned to Sri Lanka to make an application from abroad.  It would  be
    known in Sri Lanka that she claimed asylum.  Her  child  is  a  British
    citizen, on account of the citizenship of the child's father,  and  his
    life would be in danger in Sri Lanka because of the  problems  in  that
    country.

 4. The judge accepted that the Appellant, who had come to the UK  on  27th
    November 2007, and had  made  a  failed  asylum  application,  was  now
    married to a British citizen, formerly a national  of  Sri  Lanka.   He
    came to the UK as an unaccompanied minor at the  age  of  15.   He  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in 2010  and  he  became  a  British
    citizen subsequently.  He had lived in the  UK  for  more  than  twenty
    years.  He had established himself in business here and received income
    which exceeds the threshold for the spouse application of ï¿½18,600  (see
    paragraph 43).  A child now born on 17th  May  2015  also  had  British
    citizenship.

 5. The judge, however, held that there were no "insurmountable  obstacles"
    within the meaning of the applicable Rule.  There were  family  members
    living in Sri Lanka.  There were no health issues  that  needed  to  be
    addressed.  The Appellant's husband had the wherewithal to establish  a
    business in Sri Lanka (paragraph 49).   There  is  no  reason  why  the
    couple could not return together to Sri Lanka with their  child.   Both
    the husband and the wife had family members there.  They both spoke the
    Tamil language.

 6. Furthermore, if regard was  had  to  Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act,
    immigration control was in the public interest.

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on  5th  August  2016.   The  Tribunal
    observed that the judge had expressed himself confusingly because there
    was a reference at paragraph 52 to the Sponsor still having a valid Sri
    Lankan passport, but at paragraph 3  of  the  decision  the  judge  had
    referred to the Sponsor to being a British  national  of  formerly  Sri
    Lankan nationality and so it could not be stated that the Appellant had
    a  valid  Sri  Lankan  passport.   Second,  although   the   Respondent
    authority's  argument  had  been  accepted  that  there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles because both the Appellant and the  Sponsor  were
    failed asylum seekers, there was no consideration specifically  of  the
    fact that the Sponsor was a British national  at  paragraph  47  or  at
    paragraph 49 and so there  was  an  insufficient  analysis  as  to  the
    conclusion that was reached regarding very significant difficulties.

 9. The judge had plainly attached weight to the  Sponsor  still  having  a
    valid Sri Lankan passport with respect to the conclusion arrived at, at
    paragraph 58 and that the Sponsor had a business which could be carried
    out in Sri Lanka, given the nationality of the Appellant's husband.

10. In the same way, the "best interests" of the child was  not  considered
    in the context of Section 117 with specific reference to  the  question
    of "reasonableness" where a person has a genuine parental  relationship
    with a qualifying child, such that it would not be reasonable to expect
    the child to leave the United Kingdom.  It had to be borne in mind that
    the child was a British citizen here.

11. At the hearing before me on 26th September 2016, Mr  Nathan,  appearing
    on behalf of the Appellant  relied  upon  his  skeleton  argument.   He
    submitted that at the date of the Respondent's  initial  decision,  the
    Appellant did not have a child, but now that the child was  some  eight
    months old at the time of the decision before the judge, Section 11  of
    the Respondent's IDI on Family Migration, in the form  of  Appendix  FM
    1.0 Family Life (as a partner or parent) and  private  life:  ten  year
    routes (August 2015) stood to be applied.

12. This policy was in accordance with the well-known cases of  Izuazu  and
    Sanade, which in any event ought  to  have  been  applied  because  the
    Respondent's decision ran contrary to these cases,  the  extant  policy
    now stating as follows:

         "Where a decision to refuse the application would require a  parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the  EU,  the  case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be  unreasonable
         to expect a British citizen child to leave the EU with that  parent
         or primary carer.

         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to  the
         Appellant or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with
         the child, provided  that  there  is  satisfactory  evidence  of  a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship".

13. This, submitted Mr Nathan, was the Home  Office's  own  policy,  and  a
    failure to follow the policy promulgated by the  Respondent  authority,
    specifically for cases of this kind, was an error of law.  Second,  and
    in any event, the decision was not in accordance with the principles of
    proportionality if the five step approach in Razgar was adopted.

14. For his part, Mr Tufan submitted that the appeal had specifically  been
    predicated on the question of "insurmountable obstacles" (see paragraph
    9) and the Court of Appeal judgment in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 made
    it quite clear that ownership of British citizenship was not ipso facto
    demonstrative of  the  existence  of  "insurmountable  obstacles".   My
    attention was drawn to paragraph 25 of that judgment  where  the  quote
    stated that,

         "The mere fact that Mr Benette is a British citizen, has lived  all
         his life in the United Kingdom and has a job  here  -  hence  might
         find it difficult and might be reluctant to relocate  to  Ghana  to
         continue  their   family   life   there,   could   not   constitute
         insurmountable obstacles to his doing so".

15. In reply, Mr Nathan made two discrete submissions  before  me.   First,
    Agyarko was not a case involving children.  Indeed, the court  made  it
    clear (at paragraph 33) that, "exceptional circumstances were found  to
    exist" where,

         "... the case involved a family with children,  where  the  husband
         and children of the applicant were all Netherlands'  nationals  and
         where the authorities had tolerated the applicant's presence in the
         country for a considerable period of time".

    (The reference here being to Januzi v Netherlands [2015] 60  EHRR  17).
    Second, such a decision, was in point of fact, entirely consistent with
    the Home Office's own policy in relation to family life that  had  just
    been referred to, which expressly made it clear  that  "The  case  must
    always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect
    a British citizen child to leave the EU with  that  parent  or  primary
    carer".  In fact, the case of Chen [2015] UKUT  00189  makes  it  clear
    that,

         "In cases involving children, where removal would interfere with  a
         child's enjoyment or family life with one or other of  his  or  her
         parents whilst entry clearance is obtained, it  would  be  easy  to
         show that the balance on proportionality falls  in  favour  of  the
         claimant than in cases which do not involve children..." (paragraph
         39).

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law  (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCA 2007.  The decision is in error  for  precise
    reasons that were set out in the grant of permission.

17. This is a case where the judge has set out an insufficient analysis  in
    a relation to the test of "reasonableness" given the findings that were
    made in relation  to  the  child's  father's  business,  the  level  of
    economic stability which had been established, and the prospects in Sri
    Lanka.

18. Moreover, the judge  had  clearly  proceeded  on  the  wrong  basis  in
    assuming that the Appellant still had a valid Sri Lankan passport.  The
    crucial fact of the Sponsor being  a  British  national  had  not  been
    factored into the analysis at paragraphs 47 and 49 of the decision  and
    the "best interests" of the child was not considered in the context  of
    criteria set  out  in  Section  117  where  there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child such  that  it
    would not have been reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

19. In remaking the decision, I have had regard  to  the  findings  of  the
    original judge, the evidence before him, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.



20. First, the Respondent Home Office is bound to  apply  its  own  policy.
    This policy first considers whether the child in question is "a British
    citizen" (see paragraph 11.2.2); and then  having  done  so,  enquires,
    "Would it be unreasonable to expect a British citizen  child  to  leave
    the UK" (see paragraph  11.2.3)  before  setting  out  to  reflect  the
    judgment in Zambrano, and to posit the principle that,  the  case  must
    always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect
    a British citizen child to leave the EU with  that  parent  or  primary
    carer where consideration is given to the return of a parent or primary
    carer to a country outside the EU.

21. The sponsoring husband of the Appellant is not a  Sri  Lankan  citizen.
    He has British nationality.  He is settled in the UK.   He  arrived  at
    the age of 15 and has acquired the ultimate settlement status  after  a
    grant of indefinite leave to remain.  He has economic security  and  he
    employs a number of people in his business.

22. If the Appellant is  required  to  return  to  Sri  Lanka  to  make  an
    application she will take the eight month old child with her  and  that
    quite simply violates the Home Office's own policy which is clear  that
    such a course of action would  be  "unreasonable  to  expect"  where  a
    British citizen child is unlawful.

23. Second, the case of Chen [2015] UKUT 00189  endorses  this  fundamental
    approach to evaluating how the balance of proportionality will stand to
    fall in a case where a British citizen child  is  involved  because  it
    addresses the  situation,  "where  removal  would  interfere  with  the
    child's enjoyment or family life with  one  or  other  of  his  or  her
    parents whilst entry clearance is obtained", and makes  it  clear  that
    "It will be easy to show that the balance of proportionality  falls  in
    favour of the claimant..." which  I  so  find  to  be  the  case  here,
    especially  in  circumstances  that  both  parents  are  failed  asylum
    seekers.

24. Third, and no less importantly, the case of Agyarko considered there to
    be "exceptional circumstances" where "the case involved a  family  with
    children".  I find that to be the case here.  In considering  the  case
    of "a family with children" as here, one cannot ignore  the  fact  that
    the Sponsor is not a person with Sri Lankan citizenship, so that whilst
    he may have established himself as a successful businessman in the  UK,
    employing people, it does not follow that as a British citizen he  will
    be able to establish himself in Sri Lanka, or to  continue  himself  in
    his business dealings, with the result that if the Appellant returns to
    Sri Lanka to make a valid entry clearance application  (notwithstanding
    all the difficulties that that raises in relation to the Home  Office's
    own policy which runs to the contrary), the sponsoring husband  of  the
    Appellant, and the British citizen father of the British citizen child,
    is unlikely to be able to follow suit, and if required to do so,  would
    be placing himself in "exceptional circumstances" of the kind that  the
    Rules are designed to identify.  All-in-all, therefore, this appeal  is
    allowed.

Notice of Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.

26. This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
