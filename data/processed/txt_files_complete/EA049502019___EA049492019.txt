For the Appellant:     Mr West, Counsel instructed by Blackfields
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Nigeria. They are  respectively  a
    mother (date of birth 30th January 1972) and her daughter (9th  January
    2008). They seek permission to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
    Regulation 16 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016. In particular  Mrs  Ekundayo  asserts  that  she  should  not  be
    required to leave the United Kingdom, and thereby the  European  Union,
    because she is the primary carer for her son, Toluwalase Ekundayo (22nd
    April 2002), a national of the Republic of Ireland.


 2. The Appellants made their applications for residence cards on the  27th
    March 2019.  The decision to refuse was made on the 3rd September 2019.
    Appeals were lodged with the First-tier Tribunal on the 16th  September
    2019, and the appeals dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Head  on
    the 3rd February 2020. Permission was granted on the 21st December 2020
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson.  Before  me  the  parties  agreed  that
    notwithstanding the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union
    the transitional provisions apply  so  as  to  preserve  the  right  of
    appeal.



    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The case for the Appellants before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that
    they both reside in Manchester with Toluwalase, who at the date of  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing was a minor.  Applying Regulation 16(2) his
    mother was his 'primary carer' and thereby derived a right of residence
    in the United Kingdom; by extension  his  sister  derives  a  right  of
    residence under Regulation 16(6).


 4. The First-tier Tribunal set  out  the  background  facts.    All  three
    members of this family had arrived in the United Kingdom  from  Nigeria
    on the 24th December 2018, with leave to enter as  visitors.  They  had
    come to visit a Mrs Griselda Nwakaku Jiya, the mother of  Mrs  Ekundayo
    and grandmother to the two children. They are now living in  her  home.
    Toluwalase decided that he wanted to stay here  with  his  grandmother,
    and so submitted an application  for  a  self-sufficient  EEA  national
    child. After this was granted, the Appellants made their  applications,
    Mrs  Ekundayo  for  derivative  residence,  and  Sinmiloluwa   as   her
    dependent.  It is said that Mrs Jiya is unable to care  for  Toluwalase
    because she is the full-time carer for her  other  daughter,  an  adult
    with various disabilities and health issues, including Down's Syndrome.

 5. Turning to the requirements of the Regulation the  First-tier  Tribunal
    accepted that Toluwalase was, at the  date  of  hearing,  a  minor.  It
    accepted that Mrs Ekundayo is his mother,  and  that  he  is  an  Irish
    national.   There was not however any indication that he  required  any
    personal or physical care from his mother. He is studying, and  working
    part time. He hoped to start university the following academic year. He
    is a healthy and competent young man. There were no reasons given as to
    why he could not simply live with his  grandmother.  Having  regard  to
    those matters the Tribunal was not satisfied that Mrs Ekundayo  is  her
    son's "primary carer". He does not need  a  carer.   If  he  becomes  a
    burden to his grandmother, he could move to independent  accommodation.
     As to whether he would return to Nigeria if the  Appellants  did,  the
    Tribunal found that he would elect not to do so. He is  not  unable  to
    live in the United Kingdom without his mother and sister, and would not
    be compelled to leave with them.  The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

 6. The Appellants submit that the First-tier Tribunal decision  is  flawed
    for the following material errors:

              i) Misdirection in respect of Regulation 16(8), in  particular
                 the definition of 'primary carer';


             ii) Failure to give adequate reasons/misdirection in respect of
                 Regulation 16(2), in particular whether Toluwalase would be
                 unable to remain in the United Kingdom if his mother  left.
                 It is submitted that the test is  one  of  compulsion,  not
                 election;

            iii) Procedural unfairness, in particular a failure to give  Mrs
                 Ekundayo/Toluwalase an opportunity to respond to an adverse
                 point in the  decision,  in  particular  the  finding  that
                 Toluwalase could live independently  of  his  mother  which
                 failed to take into account the fact that at  the  date  of
                 the appeal, he did not do so.


    Discussion and Findings

 7. Insofar as is material Regulation 16 provides as follows:



         Derivative right to reside

           16.-(1) A person has a derivative right  to  reside  during  any
         period in which the person-

                 (a) is not an exempt person; and

                 (b) satisfies each of the criteria in one or more of
            paragraphs (2) to (6).

           (2) The criteria in this paragraph are that-

                 (a) the person is the primary carer of an EEA national; and

                 (b) the EEA national-

                       (i) is under the age of 18;

                       (ii) resides in the United Kingdom as a self-
                       sufficient person; and

                       (iii) would be unable to remain in the United Kingdom
                 if the

                       person left the United Kingdom for an indefinite
                 period.

           (3)...

           (4)...

           (5) ....

           (6) The criteria in this paragraph are that-

                 (a) the person is under the age of 18;

                 (b) the person does not have leave to enter, or remain in,
                 the United Kingdom under the 1971 Act;

                 (c) the person's primary carer is entitled to a derivative
                 right to reside in the United Kingdom under paragraph (2),
                 (4) or (5); and

                 (d) the primary carer would be prevented from residing in
                 the United Kingdom if the person left the United Kingdom
                 for an indefinite period.

           (7)...

           (8) A person is the "primary carer" of another person ("AP") if-

                 (a) the person is a direct relative or a legal guardian of
              AP; and

                 (b) either-

                       (i) the person has primary responsibility for AP's
                    care; or

                       (ii) shares equally the responsibility for AP's care
                       with one other person who is not an exempt person.

           (9) In paragraph (2)(b)(iii), (4)(b) or (5)(c), if the  role  of
         primary carer is shared with  another  person  in  accordance  with
         paragraph (8)(b)(ii), the words "the person"  are  to  be  read  as
         "both primary carers".

           (10) Paragraph (9) does not apply if the person with  whom  care
         responsibility is shared acquired a derivative right to  reside  in
         the United Kingdom as a result of  this  regulation  prior  to  the
         other person's assumption of equal care responsibility.

           (11) A person is not be regarded as  having  responsibility  for
         another person's care for the purpose of paragraph (8) on the  sole
         basis of a financial contribution towards that person's care.

           (12) ...



 8. The  Appellants  lost  their  appeal  on  two  issues,  and  they  have
    permission to challenge the findings in respect of both matters.


 9. The first arises under Regulation 16(2) and (8): is Mrs Okundayo, as  a
    matter of law, her son's "primary carer". At the  date  of  the  appeal
    Toluwalase was 17 years and 9 months old. As Judge Head found,  he  was
    studying independently and  working  part  time.  He  hoped  to  go  to
    university. As is apparent from the decision,  the  Tribunal  evidently
    thought these matters relevant to whether his mother provides him  with
    "care": it did not find that he  required  her  "personal  or  physical
    care" and so found the requirements at Regulation 16(8) not met.

10. The written grounds, drafted on the 17th February 2020, take issue with
    this approach, and submit that  in  fact  all  that  the  Tribunal  was
    required to do in the case  of  a  Zambrano  minor  child  was  satisfy
    itself, according to Regulation 16(8)(i), that the carer  had  "primary
    responsibility" for the child's care. As a parent it could be  presumed
    that she did - indeed this was the effect of Home  Office  guidance  on
    the point set out in the grounds.

11. Unfortunately the grounds do not appear to have taken into account  the
    guidance issued by the Supreme Court on this matter  in  Patel  (FC)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] UKSC 59, handed  down
    some two months before they were drafted.   As the  Court  there  makes
    clear  there  should  be  no  automatic  assumption  that  a   Zambrano
    dependency exists between parent and child. There the Court cites  with
    approval the CJEU's analysis at �76 of   KA  and  Others  (Regroupement
    familial en Belgique) [2018] 3 CMLR 28

           "It follows from paras 64 to 75 of this judgment that article 20
           TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that:

                 -                    where the Union citizen is an adult, a
                 relationship of dependency, capable of justifying the grant
                 to the third-country national concerned of a derived  right
                 of residence under article 20 TFEU, is conceivable only  in
                 exceptional cases, where, in the light of all the  relevant
                 circumstances, any form of  separation  of  the  individual
                 concerned from the member of  his  family  on  whom  he  is
                 dependent is not possible;

                 -                    where the Union citizen is  a  minor,
                 the assessment of the existence of such a  relationship  of
                 dependency must be based  on  consideration,  in  the  best
                 interests of the child, of all the specific  circumstances,
                 including the age of the child, the  child's  physical  and
                 emotional development, the extent of his emotional ties  to
                 each of his parents, and the risks  which  separation  from
                 the third-country national parent  might  entail  for  that
                 child's equilibrium. The existence of a  family  link  with
                 that third-country national, whether natural or  legal,  is
                 not sufficient, and cohabitation  with  that  third-country
                 national is not necessary, in order  to  establish  such  a
                 relationship of dependency."




12. Here  the  undisputed  facts  were  that  Toluwalase  had  applied  for
    residency as a self-sufficient child who was going to  be  living  with
    his grandmother.   The Tribunal took into account the fact the  he  was
    already moving towards independence, and in fact was planning to go  to
    university in a matter of months.   In those circumstances  it  is  not
    easy to see what risks there  might  have  been  to  his  "equilibrium"
    should his mother and sister return to Nigeria as had  originally  been
    planned when they made their applications to enter the  United  Kingdom
    as visitors, a procedure that they could no doubt go through  again  if
    they wanted to see him in the United Kingdom outside of term time.   It
    seems to me that the Tribunal's reasoning was in material part in  line
    with the Supreme Court's decision in Patel.   Whilst  the  grounds  are
    correct in submitting that there was no need, for instance, to look for
    a need for personal care, ground 1 is not made out.


13. Ground 2 takes issue with the Tribunal's finding that Toluwalase  would
    not "elect" to return to Nigeria.   Mr West submits  that  the  correct
    test was whether he would be unable to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Again, it is difficult to see where material error can be found.  True,
    the question of what Toluwalase chose to do was  not  really  relevant:
    the focus should have been on  what the inevitable consequence  of  his
    mother's departure might be. As is apparent from my findings on  ground
    1, this too is misconceived. On the findings of fact  made,  reasonably
    open to the Tribunal, there is no question that  Toluwalase  was  quite
    able to live in the United Kingdom without his mother.  He  could  stay
    with his grandmother, or in due course move into  university  halls  of
    residence if he so wished.  In his own statement he mentions his  hopes
    in that regard, as well as the fact that he had, at  the  date  of  the
    appeal, three part time jobs, had joined a gym, had made  many  friends
    and was doing brilliantly at college, having gained  a  Distinction  in
    his BTEC extended diploma.   He  was,  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,
    technically a child, but one on the cusp of adulthood, whose  affection
    for his mother notwithstanding, was evidently able  to  embark  on  the
    next phase in his education without her: indeed that was his very plan.
    I do not think, reading the  holistic  approach  advocated  in  KA  and
    approved in Patel, that the First-tier Tribunal can be  criticized  for
    placing weight on those matters.


14. Mr West further submits, in something of a departure from the  grounds,
    that the Judge's reasoning on the test at Regulation 16(2)  was  flawed
    for a failure to take material evidence into account, namely  the  fact
    that Toluwalase was very close to his mother because  she  had  been  a
    single parent for a long time, and they had together faced adversity. I
    accept that the Tribunal did not specifically address that  element  of
    the evidence, but I am not satisfied  that  if  it  had  done  so,  its
    decision could have been any different.  The totality of  the  decision
    is that Toluwalase has from his grandmother, in his  own  words,  love,
    kindness and financial support.  The First-tier Tribunal found that  he
    needed no more than that. That was, in  the  circumstances,  a  finding
    open to the Judge.

15. The final ground raises issues of procedural fairness. It is  submitted
    that the Tribunal acted unfairly in not giving the witnesses the chance
    to address its  concerns  about  the  ability  of  Toluwalase  to  live
    independently of his mother. Mr West points out that at the date of the
    appeal he did not  as  a  matter  of  fact  do  so,  and  the  Tribunal
    impermissibly speculated/ acted unfairly when it dismissed  the  appeal
    on the basis that at some point in the future he would cease to do  so.
     The grounds pray in aid the decision in O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] UKHL
    1 to submit that it is a fundamental right of natural  justice  that  a
    party is afforded a reasonable opportunity of learning what is  alleged
    against him. And so it is. But here neither the  Appellants  nor  their
    representatives can possibly  have  been  unaware  of  this  particular
    concern, since it was squarely the basis upon which  the  Secretary  of
    State put her case, as long  ago  as  3rd  September  2019.     At  the
    hearing I invited Mr West to identify what  particular  aspect  of  the
    Tribunal's findings fell foul of this principle of natural justice.  He
    was unable to do so.

16.  None of the grounds are made out and the appeal is dismissed. For  the
    avoidance of any doubt if I am at all wrong about any of the  foregoing
    I should note that it matters not, since Toluwalase is  now  an  adult,
    and in the absence of any particular dependency upon  his  mother,  the
    appeal would therefore fail on Zambrano grounds if remade today.


    Decisions


17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.


18. There is no order for anonymity.
