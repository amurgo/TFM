Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  Appeal number: IA/19703/2014


                            The Immigration Acts


                                                  Notice sent on 18 May 2015


                                   Before

                          Upper Tribunal Judge Gill


                                   Between

                                Darshan Gore
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


         Decision on Appellant's application to withdraw his appeal

1.    On 26 March 2015, the Appellant was granted permission  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

2.    By a letter dated 13 May 2015, Visa Inn Immigration  Specialists,  the
    Appellant's representatives, informed the Tribunal that  the  Appellant
    wished to withdraw his appeal.  It is said that he wishes to  submit  a
    fresh application for leave.

3.    I have decided to treat this as an application  by  the  Appellant  to
    withdraw his case, given that the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (Upper Tribunal Rules) do not make provision for a party  to
    withdraw its appeal. Rule 17 of the Upper Tribunal Rules provides for a
    party to withdraw its case before the Upper Tribunal, with the  consent
    of the Tribunal.

4.    The Upper Tribunal hereby consents to the withdrawal by the  Appellant
    of his case.

5.    This means that the Respondent's case before the  Upper  Tribunal  (as
    set out in the Reply dated 20 April 2015)  is  unopposed.  Accordingly,
    the determination of the First-tier Tribunal stands and the  appeal  of
    the Appellant to the Upper Tribunal dismissed.

6.    The hearing on 18 May 2015 will therefore be vacated.
