                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge E.M.M. Smith sitting at Priory  Court,  Birmingham,  on  6  June
    2018) dismissing their appeals against the decision of  the  respondent
    made on 27 October 2017 to refuse to grant  them  leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds outside the Rules.   The First-tier  Tribunal  did
    not make an  anonymity  direction  and  I  do  not  consider  that  the
    appellants  require  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The first appellant is the partner of the second appellant, and both of
    them are citizens of Nigeria.   The  first  appellant  entered  the  UK
    illegally on 28 December 1998, and has remained unlawfully  in  the  UK
    ever since.  The second appellant entered the UK as a visitor on 3 July
    2007,  and  overstayed  after  the  expiry  of  his  visit  visa.   The
    appellants have had three children together, the oldest of  whom  is  a
    daughter, "P", who was born in the UK on 28 January 2010.  Accordingly,
    P had accrued seven years' residence in the UK as of 28  January  2017.
    The two younger children were born in 2012 and 2014  respectively,  and
    so they have still not reached the seven year residence threshold.

 3. In an application made on 22 February 2017, the  appellants  sought  to
    regularise their status in the UK on the  ground  that  P  had  accrued
    seven years' residence in the UK.  On 27 October  2017  the  respondent
    refused the application for the following  reasons.  Firstly,  although
    one of their children had now been in  the  UK  for  over  the  minimum
    threshold, it was not accepted that they would not be able to integrate
    into Nigeria as a family unit of Nigerian  nationals.   Secondly,  they
    had no legal basis to stay in the UK and they were present in the UK in
    breach of immigration laws.  Accordingly, paragraph EX.1 did not apply.
    Thirdly, EX.1(a) did not apply for an additional reason, which was that
    they were both in a parental relationship  with  P.   As  they  were  a
    family of Nigerian nationals, there were no barriers in them relocating
    to Nigeria to benefit from their  full  rights  as  Nigerian  citizens.
    They would be able to secure  work  to  support  themselves  and  their
    family, and their children would be  able  to  benefit  from  Nigeria's
    education system.  Also, they already had family in Nigeria  and  there
    was no reason to  suggest  that  their  family  in  Nigeria  would  not
    adequately support and assist them and their children on return.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Smith.   Mr  Adekoya
    of Atlantic Solicitors appeared on behalf of the appellants.  The Judge
    received oral evidence from both appellants, and from [JA] and [SO].

 5. In his witness statement, [SO] said that he was  a  Pastor  of  Victory
    Bible Church International and he confirmed  that  the  appellants  and
    their family were active members of the Church.  P was  a  very  active
    member of the Sunday School and Junior Church.  She was a  very  caring
    girl to other members of the Church, especially  her  age  group.   She
    showed compassion to other children.  The whole Church community  would
    miss her greatly if she had to leave.  In his opinion, if P was made to
    leave the community she loved and was actively involved  in,  "it  will
    adversely affect her."

 6. In his statement, [JA] said that he was a serving Elder in the  Victory
    Bible Church International in Birmingham.   He  had  observed  P  among
    other children in their Sunday School lessons as being very hardworking
    and  respectful,  and  also  very  friendly  to  other  children.   His
    daughter, Jennifer, and P were very  close  together  both  at  school,
    church, swimming, Explorer lessons and in many other social activities.
     He wished to recommend "this good and innocent little girl".

 7. In her subsequent decision, Judge Smith summarised what had happened at
    the hearing at paragraphs [12]-[16].  She recorded  the  names  of  the
    witnesses who had given oral evidence. At paragraph [14], she said  she
    was going to summarise the evidence and submissions as necessary in the
    course of explaining her reasons, and she added that a full  record  of
    the evidence and the submissions was to  be  found  in  the  record  of
    proceedings.

 8. The Judge gave her reasons for dismissing  the  appeals  at  paragraphs
    [20]-[38]. At paragraph [22], she recorded that it was accepted by both
    parties that the previous decision of Judge Coates should be considered
    as a starting point for her assessment of the evidence,  in  accordance
    with the decision in  Devaseelan  [2002]  UK  IAT  00702.  Among  other
    things, the following could be distilled from Judge  Coates'  decision:
    the credibility of the appellants was poor;  the  appellants  had  been
    working illegally; it was not credible that they had been supported  by
    charitable donations from their church; and the  first  appellant  owed
    the NHS ï¿½1,000.

 9. At paragraph [25], the Judge said that P had been attending  a  primary
    school since September 2014, and that there was sufficient evidence  to
    establish that each child was settled and doing well.  According to the
    first appellant, P suffered from eczema and received cream to help, but
    there was no medical evidence to support that claim.

10. At paragraph [26], she noted evidence from the Anglican Church of Light
    at page 21 of the bundle, setting out details of P's attendance  there.
    The  Judge  continued:  "[JA]  is  from  the   Victory   Bible   Church
    International (AB p29) and he also confirms the family's attendance  at
    that church.  I have considered all the evidence within the  papers  in
    regard to the children and the family as a whole."

11. At paragraph [29], the  Judge  held  that  P's  education  was  in  its
    infancy, and she was satisfied that it could not be argued that "it  is
    yet at a crucial stage".  She reminded himself that in  Azimi-Moayed  &
    Others [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC), the Tribunal had held  that  seven  years
    from the age of four was likely to be more significant to a child  than
    the first seven years of life.

12. At paragraph [36], the  Judge  accepted  that  there  was  family  life
    between the appellants and their children, but found that  this  family
    life could continue if their appeals were refused.  They  would  return
    as a family unit.   The  private  life  of  the  appellants  and  their
    children had accrued of over many  years  of  overstaying  and  neither
    parent showing any willingness  to  return  to  Nigeria.   Accordingly,
    private life acquired in such circumstances carried less  weight.   The
    Judge continued: "While [P]  does  have  a  private  life  with  school
    friends, it is very limited."

13. At paragraph [37], the Judge held that the stage that  each  child  had
    reached in their development did not on  the  evidence  establish  that
    they could not take up school life and friends in Nigeria.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

14. The appellants applied for permission to appeal on the ground that  the
    Tribunal had erred in law in not giving adequate consideration  to  the
    evidence of the relationships which P had outside of her  family  unit,
    "and the effect breaking those relationships would have on her and  her
    friends."

The Reasons for the Initial Refusal of Permission to Appeal

15. On 24 July 2018 First-tier Tribunal Judge Mailer refused permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons: "The Judge  has  ...  considered  the
    human rights claims  of  the  appellants  in  detail.   [She]  directed
    himself in accordance with EV (Philippines) & Others  -v-  SSHD  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874 regarding the best interests of the  children.  [She]  has
    considered the best interests of  [P]  at  [29-30].   [She]  has  given
    sustainable reasons for  dismissing  their  appeals  under  Article  8.
    There are no arguable grounds of appeal."

The Reasons for the Eventual Grant of Permission to Appeal

16. Following a reviewed application for permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal,  on  25  October  2018  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill  granted
    permission "reluctantly", as in her view it  was  just  about  arguable
    that the Judge may have failed to adequately engage with  the  evidence
    in the bundle concerning the existence and the strength of the  private
    life ties of P.

17. Judge Gill added that, if a material error of law was found  such  that
    the decision needed to be remade, then in view of  the  strong  adverse
    credibility assessments by both Judge  Coates  and  Judge  Smith,  "the
    Tribunal may wish to hear evidence as to how these statements [about P]
    were  requested,  who  requested  them  and  any  explanation  for  the
    similarity in the written evidence, although this would be a matter for
    the Judge hearing the case."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, I invited Mr Adekoya to identify, in accordance with Judge  Gill's
    directions, the specific passages in the written evidence relating to P
    to which the Judge was said to have had inadequate regard.

19. Firstly, he identified the passage in [SO]'s witness statement where he
    opined that P would be adversely affected by being separated  from  the
    Church community:  see  paragraph  [5]  above.  Secondly,  he  drew  my
    attention to a passage at page 34 of the bundle where [CR] (who was not
    called as a witness) expressed the belief that separating  P  from  the
    other children would jeopardise "her future ambitions for  herself  and
    the community at large."

20. Mr Adekoya acknowledged that, as observed  by  Judge  Gill,  there  was
    considerable similarity in the statements  or  letters  that  had  been
    garnered from various people on the topic of P.  He explained that  the
    appellants had taken legal advice and had been advised as to  what  the
    letters should contain, and they had told the people making the letters
    what they should say in the letters.  That it is why they said  similar
    things about P.

21. Mr Adekoya confirmed that it was not  the  appellants'  case  that  the
    Judge had failed to address any evidence that had  been  given  orally.
    He confirmed that none of the witnesses had given oral evidence to  the
    effect that the family's removal would have an adverse effect on P.

22. Mr Clarke adopted the Rule 24 response settled by a colleague  opposing
    the appeal.  He submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  taken
    everything into account, and  had  clearly  stated  that  the  children
    should not be blamed for their parents' conduct.

Discussion

23. In South Bucks District Council v Porter (2) [2004] UKHL 33 Lord  Brown
    said at [26]:

         The reasons for a decision must be intelligible and  they  must  be
         adequate.  They must enable the reader to understand why the matter
         was decided as it was and what  conclusions  were  reached  on  the
         'principal important  controversial  issues',  disclosing  how  any
         issue of law or fact was resolved.  Reasons can be briefly  stated,
         the degree of particularity  required  depending  entirely  on  the
         nature of the issues  falling  for  decision  (my  emphasis).   The
         reasoning must not give rise to a substantial doubt as  to  whether
         the decision maker erred in law, for example,  by  misunderstanding
         some relevant policy or some other important matter or  by  failing
         to reach a rational decision on relevant grounds.  But such adverse
         inference will not readily be drawn.  The reasons need  only  refer
         to  the  main  issues  in  the  dispute,  not  to  every   material
         consideration (my emphasis).

24. There is a crucial distinction to  be  drawn  between  (a)  not  giving
    weight to certain pieces of evidence and (b) simply not taking  certain
    pieces of evidence into account at all. It  is  clear  that  the  Judge
    considered the written evidence as  well  as  the  oral  evidence.  For
    example, she picked up on the fact  that  P  purportedly  attended  the
    Anglican Church of Light on a regular basis as  well  as  the  Victoria
    Bible Church International, although P's  attendance  at  the  Anglican
    Church of Light is nowhere referred to in the witness statements of the
    appellants or the witness statements of  the  two  witnesses  who  were
    called to give oral evidence.  Indeed, I note in passing that P herself
    in an undated statement only refers to regularly attending one  church,
    and it is unclear which one this is.

25. The Judge's characterisation of P having only a "very limited"  private
    life with school friends is nonetheless potentially  controversial  for
    two overlapping reasons.  The first is that a concerted effort was made
    to garner a number of letters or statements to the effect  that  P  had
    forged close friendships with fellow church-goers  of  her  own  age  -
    albeit that some (and possibly most) of these children were also school
    mates. The second is that, at the same time,  a  concerted  effort  was
    made to garner letters or statements to  the  effect  that  these  ties
    outside the home were particularly strong and hence not "very limited".

26. However, I do not consider that  the  Judge  was  bound  to  treat  the
    written evidence as showing that, at the age of 8,  P  had  established
    such a significant private life outside the home  as  to  constitute  a
    weighty factor in the assessment of her best interests,  let  alone  in
    the real world assessment which is required to address the question  of
    reasonableness arising under s117B(6) of the 2002 Act. P  can  continue
    to enjoy a private life in all its material aspects in the  country  of
    return, albeit with a different set of friends at church and at school.
     This is so obvious that it did not need to be spelt out by the  Judge.
    It was open to the Judge to focus on what has been  identified  by  the
    authorities as important in assessing the strength of a child's private
    life claim, which is the child's length of residence since the  age  of
    four, and whether the child has reached a critical stage in his or  her
    education.

27. It was not an error of law for the Judge not to comment on the opinions
    expressed by [SO] and [CR] as to the detrimental effect  on  P  of  her
    being separated from the church community, or  as  to  the  detrimental
    effect on the church community of P's departure. The opinions expressed
    by these witnesses as to the effect on P of relocation to  Nigeria  did
    not have any identifiable evidential foundation (such  as  P  having  a
    diagnosed illness or vulnerability), but  were,  on  the  face  of  it,
    simply based on conjecture and the tacit assumption that P would not be
    able to enjoy similar private life ties in Nigeria.

28. For the above reasons, no error of law is made  out.   The  Judge  gave
    adequate reasons for finding that the refusal of the appellants'  human
    rights claims was proportionate.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.

These appeals to the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
