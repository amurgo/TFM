                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Richard Jones), sitting at Newport on 7 November  2013,
    to  outside the Immigration Rules a work permit holder's appeal against
    refusal of indefinite leave to remain on 24 April 2013, by a citizen of
    Mexico, born 27 January 1982. For reasons which will soon become clear,
    the judge was understandably sympathetic towards  the  appellant;  and,
    though it  was  accepted  before  him  that  she  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 134 (iv) of the Rules as they  stood  by  the
    date  of  the  decision,  he  allowed  the  appeal  "...  because   the
    application should have been granted on a discretionary basis ..."  and
    under article 8.





HISTORY

 2. The appellant has been in this country since 15 November 2002, first as
    a student till 31 October 2006, then from 4 November till the same  day
    in 2007 under the Science and Engineering Graduate scheme  [SEGS],  and
    finally as a work permit holder from 6 December 2007 till the same  day
    in 2012. In a nutshell, her case depends on the unchallenged fact that,
    as the Immigration Rules stood at the time she applied for  and  got  a
    work permit, she could have expected, other things being equal, to  get
    indefinite leave to remain at the end of  the  five  years  it  lasted.
    However, some time before  her  work  permit  expired,  the  Rules  had
    changed, so that she needed to satisfy additional  requirements,  which
    she could not do.

 3. Miss Stickler helpfully provided me with an electronic version  of  her
    skeleton argument, from which I have extracted the following summary of
    the  development  of  the  Rules,  with   explanatory   memoranda   and
    ministerial statements as to how they would operate: Mr Bramble did not
    challenge its accuracy. The starting-point is 6 December 2007, the date
    of the decision to issue the appellant with a work permit.

 4. At that time, the Rules provided that, after five years  here  on  that
    basis, a person of employable age, who for all that time could maintain
    themselves without  recourse  to  public  funds  and  could  and  would
    undertake only the employment specified in their work permit, for which
    they had the necessary entry clearance, and  were  still  required  for
    that employment, and had the necessary knowledge of English and of life
    in the United Kingdom, 'may' be granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
    under paragraph 134 as it then  stood.  While  that  'may'  imported  a
    discretion, it is common ground that, at the decision under appeal, the
    appellant continued to satisfy those requirements, and could reasonably
    have expected the discretion to be exercised in her favour.

 5. In February 2008, the statement of changes (HC 321)  made  no  relevant
    changes in paragraph 134, though it allowed time spent under the Highly
    Skilled Migrant Programme [HSMP] to count towards the  five  years.  In
    June 2008 (HC 607), time spent in other categories was  added  to  that
    provision. In November that year (HC 1113) there were more far-reaching
    changes:  no  more  work  permits  were  to  be  issued,  but   pending
    applications, and applications by existing work permit  holders,  would
    be dealt with 'under the existing Immigration Rules'.

 6. The explanatory memorandum to HC 1113  contained,  at  paragraph  6.13,
    this assurance about the changes made: the new tier 2 Rules would

       ... include transitional arrangements to  minimise  their  impact  on
       existing work permit holders. Provided they are working for the  same
       employer, their job meets our  skill  level  requirements  and  their
       employer has obtained a sponsor licence, these migrants will be  able
       to extend their stay in the UK up to a total of  five  years  without
       having to meet the  specific  Tier  2  criteria  for  qualifications,
       prospective earnings and English language.



 7. In March/April[1] 2011 HC 863 for the  first  time  made  a  change  in
    paragraph 134 which was potentially relevant to this appellant's  case:
    it now included a requirement that the work  permit  holder's  employer
    "... certifies that he is paid at or above the appropriate rate for the
    job as stated in the codes of practice for tier 2 sponsors published by
    the UK Border Agency". This time the relevant part of  the  explanatory
    memorandum ran as follows:

    12. As a transitional arrangement, Tier 2 (General) Migrants, and those
        in pre-Tier 2 predecessor categories (such as Work Permit  Holders)
        who are already in the UK under the Rules in place before  6  April
        2011 will be able to apply  to  extend  their  stay  without  being
        subject  to  the  annual  limit,  the  new   graduate   level   job
        requirement, the new salary threshold, or the new English  language
        level. This applies  whether  they  are  extending  with  the  same
        employer or changing employers.

    13. As with Tier 2 (General) Migrants, Work Permit Holders applying for
        indefinite leave to remain will need to provide  confirmation  that
        they continue to earn at least the UK appropriate rate for the  job
        they are doing.

 8. In October 2011, HC 1511 again changed paragraph 134,  this  time  with
    reference  to  the  documents  to  be  provided;  but  once  more   the
    explanatory  memorandum  gave  the  following  reassurance:  the  April
    changes had required work permit holders and others

       ... to demonstrate that they are continuing  to  meet  at  least  the
       minimum income threshold which applied when they last extended  their
       permission to stay in the  UK.  ....  For  Tier  2  and  Work  Permit
       migrants, their employer must certify in writing that they are  being
       paid at or above the appropriate rate for the job as set out in codes
       of practice published by the United Kingdom Border Agency.




    There had been a similar reassurance given in a  ministerial  statement
    of February 2011.

 9. In March 2012 HC 1888 deleted what were described  in  the  explanatory
    memorandum as "redundant provisions relating to Work Permit  employment
    ...", but left paragraph 134 as it  stood.  However  in  June/July  the
    following changes were made to  paragraph  134:  HC  194  inserted  the
    requirement that a work permit holder "... must not be  in  the  UK  in
    breach of immigration laws except that any period of overstaying for  a
    period of 28 days or less will be disregarded". This would  have  ruled
    out this appellant, by a matter of only four days: as seen  at  2,  the
    gap there between the end of her SEGS leave on 4 November and the start
    of her work permit holder leave on 6 December 2007  had  been  no  more
    than 32 days.

10. In July 2012 a further statement of  changes  (Cm  8423)  made  changes
    which Miss Stickler suggested, clearly rightly on the evidence  of  the
    explanatory memorandum, were intended to make those of March/April 2011
    (HC 863) comply with Pankina  [2010] EWCA Civ 719. References  to  "the
    codes of practice for tier  2  sponsors  published  by  the  UK  Border
    Agency" were replaced with "the Codes of Practice in  appendix  J".  In
    November/December there were further  changes  (HC  760),  not  at  all
    relevant here.

11. Finally, in March/April 2013[2] HC 1039 made changes to  paragraph  134
    which are not relevant in themselves, but which incorporated new  codes
    of practice in appendix J. The  explanatory  memorandum  contained  the
    following statements:

       7.7    The Codes of Practice are  contained  in  Appendix  J  of  the
       Immigration Rules. They set out which occupations are skilled to  the
       appropriate levels and the minimum appropriate salary rates for  jobs
       in each occupation. They apply ... to work  permit  holders  applying
       for settlement. Changes are being made  following  a  review  by  the
       Migration Advisory Committee.

       7.11   These changes do not affect applicants who have a  Certificate
       of Sponsorship from  their  sponsoring  employer  that  was  assigned
       before the changes come into effect on 6 April 2013; no  work  permit
       holders ... are prevented  from  extending  their  stay  to  continue
       working in the same job for the same employer as a  result  of  their
       occupation being reclassified at a different skill level.

12. On 24 April, only 18 days after those changes  took  effect,  the  Home
    Office refused the appellant's  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain. They gave as their only reason that the appellant was paid only
    at an hourly rate of �10.41, while code 3541, in appendix J, set �11.44
    as the rate for a  "buyer  and  purchasing  officer",  the  appropriate
    category for her employment.

ERROR OF LAW?

13. There is no dispute but that the rates given in the refusal letter were
    correct at the time, and properly applied to the appellant, in terms of
    appendix J as it stood by then. The judge noted this state  of  affairs
    at paragraph 15; but at paragraph 16 he went on to allow the appeal, on
    the basis that the decision was not in accordance with the law. He gave
    the following reasons for this:

       ... the Points Based System was not in existence  at  the  time  when
       [the appellant] was granted her work permit visa. She came under  the
       old system and not the new one and never  needed  and  never  held  a
       certificate [sci. an employer's certificate of  compliance  with  the
       salary requirements in the code of practice] No guidance  as  to  the
       salary level applicable to her existed when she was granted her  visa
       and ... having regard to ... Philipson [(ILR  -  not  PBS:  evidence)
       India [2012] UKUT 39 (IAC)], at paragraph 14, that as  there  was  no
       guidance as to the salary level applicable to her, paragraph 134 (iv)
       would not apply and that her  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
       remain should have been granted.

14. It is now time to discuss Philipson: there are two main  things  to  be
    said about this decision. First it was heard on 19 December 2011,  long
    before the 'new Rules' (in force from 9 July  2012)  and  the  changing
    attitude to article 8, starting in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192,
    and since extended outside deportation cases, to  which  that  decision
    gave rise.

15. Second, paragraph  14  of  Philipson   does  no  more  than  record  an
    assumption made by the Tribunal: it runs as follows

       First,  although  we  will  assume  for  present  purposes,   without
       deciding, that there is an appropriate salary rate for the claimant's
       job issued under  the  Tier  2  guidance  on  6  April  2011  because
       transitional arrangements D applies [sic] to her,  we  are  far  from
       convinced that this is the case. Transitional arrangement D refers to
       those  who  hold  a  Tier  2  certificate  of  sponsorship  and   the
       certificate of sponsorship confirms that the holder will  be  working
       as a senior care assistant (SOC code 6115). As we understand  it  the
       claimant never needed a certificate of sponsorship because  she  came
       under the old system and not the new PBS one  and  accordingly  never
       held one.  If there was no guidance as to the salary level applicable
       to her, then rule 134(iv) would not apply and her claim to settlement
       should have been granted without more.

16. The fact that this was all an assumption on the  Tribunal's  part  does
    not of course mean that the judge was not entitled to come to the  same
    conclusion; but, since the point was in issue before him, he needed  to
    give reasons for doing so, rather than relying on something  which  was
    not only obiter, but specifically left undecided by  the  Tribunal.  On
    that basis, there was an error of law on  the  part  of  the  judge  in
    dealing with the appeal under the law and the Rules, and I  shall  need
    to re-make that part of his decision for myself.

17. If I reach the same result as the judge did,  then  there  will  be  no
    reason to consider article 8. If I do not, then I  shall  have  to  re-
    decide the appellant's article 8 appeal on the basis of my own decision
    on the law and the Rules, and current authorities, not available to the
    judge, such as Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
    Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), and Shahzad  (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)
    Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC)).

DECISION RE-MADE: LAW AND RULES

18. The first question to be decided is about what rules  applied  to  this
    appellant's case at the date of the decision. Miss Stickler  sought  to
    supplement the judge's reliance on Philipson  by  reference  to  Ferrer
    (limited appeal grounds; Alvi) Philippines [2012] UKUT  304  (IAC).  As
    the long title suggests, Ferrer  was not mainly decided on  this  point
    at all; but it does contain the following proposition, as summarized in
    paragraph (6) of the judicial head-note:

       Applying Philipson (ILR - not PBS: evidence) [2012] UKUT 00039 (IAC),
       where the provisions in question are ambiguous or obscure, then it is
       legitimate to interpret the provisions by assuming that Parliament is
       unlikely to have sanctioned rules which (a) treat a limited class  of
       persons  unfairly;  and  (b)  disclose  no  policy  reason  for  that
       unfairness.

19. The next point is about whether the Rules as they stood at the date  of
    the decision under appeal (24 April 2013) either contained no  guidance
    as to  the  salary  level  to  be  applied  in  this  appellant's  case
    (Philipson) or were ambiguous or obscure in their provisions  (Ferrer).
    Paragraph 134 (iv) of the Rules, as it stood at the date of the hearing
    in either of those cases, required of a work  permit  holder  applicant
    for indefinite leave to remain that

       ...  his  employer  certifies  that  he  is  paid  at  or  above  the
       appropriate rate for the job as stated in the code  of  practice  for
       Tier 2 sponsors published by the UK Border Agency

20. It was perhaps surprising, on the face of it, that a work permit holder
    should be asked to satisfy the requirements  of  a  new  separate  code
    under the points-based system [PBS]; but I am not  concerned  with  the
    merits of any argument that this provision either gave no guidance,  or
    was ambiguous or obscure as to how it related to work permit holders at
    the time of those decisions, when it was in force.

21. The reason is that, by the date of the decision in the present  appeal,
    there was a different provision in paragraph 134, which  now  requires,
    very specifically, that an applicant:

       (i) has spent a continuous period of 5 years lawfully in the  UK,  of
       which the most recent period must have been spent  with  leave  as  a
       work permit holder (under paragraphs 128 to 133 of these  rules)  ...
       [and]

       (iv) provides certification from the employer that the  applicant  is
       paid at or above the appropriate rate for the job as  stated  in  the
       Codes of Practice in Appendix J

22. Subject to appropriate job classification, as  to  which  there  is  no
    issue here, that could not in my judgment be  clearer.  This  appellant
    does satisfy (i), but that in turn  requires  her,  as  a  work  permit
    holder, to satisfy the Codes of Practice,  which  it  is  accepted  she
    could not, and cannot do.  There  is  no  'lack  of  guidance'  and  no
    'ambiguity or obscurity', and the judge's decision on  this  point  can
    neither be supported by the reason he gave for  it,  nor  by  any  more
    informed reference to Philipson or Ferrer, so  far  as  the  actual  or
    presumed meaning  of  the  Rules  at  the  date  of  the  decision  are
    concerned.

23. That leaves Miss Stickler's next argument, which is that,  for  reasons
    which may already  be  clear,  based  on  the  legislative  history  of
    paragraph 134 (iv), it was unfair of the Home Office  to  apply  it  to
    this appellant, as it stood at the date of their decision. The  leading
    decision on the effect of changes in the Immigration Rules  on  someone
    who may have counted on them staying as  they  were  is  still  Odelola
    [2009] UKHL 25 .

24. Dr Odelola was a medical practitioner with a degree  from  an  overseas
    institution, whose application for further leave to remain was  pending
    when the Rules changed, so as to require a United Kingdom  degree.  The
    leading speech was delivered by Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood,  who
    expressed the ratio in this way at paragraph 39:

       I have no doubt that the changes in  the  immigration  rules,  unless
       they specify to the contrary, take effect whenever they say they take
       effect with regard to all leave applications, those pending  no  less
       than those yet to be made.

25. All the Lords of  Appeal  agreed  with  that,  and  with  Lord  Brown's
    additional point that justice imperatively required the appellant's fee
    to be returned to her. There was also general agreement that statements
    of changes to the  Immigration  Rules  operated  as  signposts  to  the
    administrative practice to be followed from time to time,  rather  than
    creating any  legitimate  expectation  of  or  vested  right  to  their
    remaining as they were.

26. For the reasons given in Odelola, I do  not  think  the  Home  Office's
    assurances about future practice, given with HC  1113,  can  help  this
    appellant, on the Rules to be applied to her case. While the assurances
    given at paragraph 7.12 of the explanatory memorandum to the  statement
    of changes of March/April 2011 (HC 863: see 7) appear to be in conflict
    with the changes themselves, which referred to the 'codes  of  practice
    for tier 2 sponsors', that is as far as the appellant's case can go, in
    terms of Home Office assurances, not about future,  but  about  present
    practice in applying the Rules as they stood when made.





27. The changes made in March/April, and in October  2011  (HC  1511)  were
    unlawful, being contrary to Pankina, as implicitly recognized  in  July
    2012 (Cn  8423).  However,  from  that  point  on,  the  administrative
    practice likely to be adopted by the Home Office in a case of this kind
    was perfectly clear, and, from July 2012, perfectly lawful. Whether  it
    was fair, in the ordinary sense of the term, does not  in  my  judgment
    help her, much as I might regret that: it is an inevitable  consequence
    of Odelola. As with Dr Odelola, this appellant certainly ought to  have
    her fees returned to her; but that is  not  the  real  subject  of  her
    appeal.

28. The result is that the appellant's case fails,  on  the  basis  of  her
    position under the Rules as they stood at  the  date  of  the  decision
    under appeal. Nor does she have the benefit of any  back-dated  pay  to
    bring her above the minimum required at that time, as in Philipson.  It
    only fails by a very small amount. Miss Stickler gave me figures  which
    were not in dispute: at the date of the application, the appellant  was
    earning �10.52 an hour, while appendix J required �11.44. Grossed up to
    an annual figure, her actual earnings of �10.81  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing made �22,484.80, an annual shortfall of only just over �15 from
    the �22,500 now required.

29. However Miss Stickler recognized that, following Miah &  others  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 261, a  'near-miss'  could  not  be  regarded  as  substantial
    compliance with the Rules; not even if it were a very near miss indeed,
    as in this case. That must also apply to the four  days  by  which  the
    appellant missed out (see 9) on the ten  years'  lawful  residence  she
    would have needed for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph  276B.
    Such considerations might be thought to lessen the public  interest  in
    her removal, so far as the  balancing  exercise  under  article  8  was
    concerned; but I shall deal with that later.

30. The appellant's employers clearly value her, and are  anxious  to  keep
    her on; she has an agricultural diploma from this country, and they say
    her knowledge of Spanish is particularly valuable to  them  in  dealing
    with suppliers in their fruit and vegetable trade.  However  they  have
    other workers to consider, and say they cannot  increase  her  pay-rate
    without trouble from them. I have to deal with this appellant according
    to what she is actually paid, and on  that  basis  she  cannot  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules as they have stood since July 2012.

ARTICLE 8

31. The judge noted at paragraph 18 that the appellant could not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraphs 276ADE or DE of the  'new  Rules'  and  Miss
    Stickler accepted that this was correct. No doubt at the  time  he  was
    writing, it had not occurred to him, or to a good many other first-tier
    judges, that the various decisions which have followed the 'new  Rules'
    (some in any case not available at that time) might affect the approach
    to be taken to article 8 in cases not involving  deportation.  However,
    it is now clear that, where a case is covered by the Rules, it is wrong
    in law to go straight to an open-ended consideration of article 8;  and
    the judge's article 8 decision would in any case need to have been  re-
    made for that reason.

32. Miss Stickler accepted that, for an appeal  of  this  kind  to  succeed
    under  article  8,  there  would  have  to  be  some  'exceptional'  or
    'compelling' features in the case - provided that the Rules covering it
    formed, in the words used  in  MF  (Nigeria),  a  'complete  code'.  In
    suggesting that the Rules to be applied in this case did not do so, she
    referred me to Shahzad  at paragraph 29; but it seems to  me  that  the
    point is best illustrated by the following paragraphs:

       30. It follows from the other part of the ratio of MF - that the  new
       rules on deportation of foreign criminals are a complete code because
       they contain an express  provision  requiring  consideration  in  the
       Article 8 context of "exceptional circumstances" and "other  factors"
       - that any other  rule  which  has  a  similar  provision  will  also
       constitute a complete code (rule S-EC.1.4,  dealing  with  exclusion,
       would seem to be a further example);
       31. Where an area  of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
       mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31] in particular  and
       Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640
       (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the requirements of the
       rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting  leave
       to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes  to  go
       on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
       sufficiently recognised under them.

33. It seems to have been assumed in Shahzad  that, because Part 5  of  the
    Immigration Rules: 'Persons seeking to enter or remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom for employment' does not contain any reference to article 8, or
    to exceptional circumstances, it cannot be a 'complete code' within the
    meaning given to that in MF (Nigeria) . I shall go on  to  assume  that
    this is right, and so the procedure set  out  in  Shahzad   has  to  be
    followed.

34. Deciding first whether there are 'arguably good  grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside the rules', this appellant is a very worthwhile
    member of society, who has now spent  very  nearly  all  the  last  11�
    years in this country, without becoming the subject of reproach of  any
    kind. As the judge found, she has no 'family life'  here;  but  she  is
    clearly an appealing person, who may be assumed to have as much or more
    'private life' in this country over that  time  as  anyone  else.  That
    could  not  in  itself  be  enough  to  outweigh  the  public  interest
    considerations  in  removing  those  who  are  unable  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules approved by Parliament for deciding who is to
    stay, and who to go, even, as in this case, where the  margin  is  very
    small.

35. The appellant's only real argument on  article  8  comes  back  to  the
    perceived unfairness, not of her treatment as an individual, but of the
    changes in the Rules, as they affected  anyone  in  her  position.  The
    primary  jurisdiction  of  the  appellate  authorities  to   allow   an
    immigration appeal comes from s. 84 (1) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, specifying the grounds on which it may be  brought
    as follows:

       a) that the decision is not in accordance with immigration rules;
       b) that the decision is unlawful [as racially discriminatory]'
       c) that the decision  is  unlawful  [as]  contrary  to  Human  Rights
          Convention ...;
       d) that the appellant is an EEA national or a member of the family of
          an EEA national and the decision breaches the  appellant's  rights
          under the Community Treaties in respect of entry to  or  residence
          in the United Kingdom;
       e) that the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law;
       f)  that  the  person  taking  the  decision  should  have  exercised
          differently a discretion conferred by immigration rules;
       g)  that  removal  of  the  appellant  from  the  United  Kingdom  in
          consequence of the immigration decision would  breach  the  United
          Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee  Convention  or  would  be
          unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998  as  being
          incompatible with the appellant's Convention rights.

36. Looking at the individual  grounds,  the  only  ones  which  have  been
    relevant to this case are (a), (c)/(g) [the  human  rights  limb  only,
    apparently duplicating (c)], and (e). While paragraph  134  now  begins
    "Indefinite leave  to  remain  may  be  granted  on  application  ...",
    seemingly importing a discretion, it is quite clear from the  following
    words that this may only be exercised "... provided the appellant"  can
    meet the individual requirements which follow; so (f) does  not  apply.
    Odelola to my mind disposed of any argument under the law  outside  the
    Rules and the Human Rights Convention, removing the  need  to  consider
    (e). It follows that the area remaining for consideration has come down
    to a potential conflict between (a),  where  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules are treated as a given, at least for the  appellate  authorities;
    and (c)/(g), which requires respect for the Human Rights Convention.

37. While there remains ample scope for application  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention in cases where appellants have significant  family  life  in
    this country, it seems to  me  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  use  the
    Convention effectively to side-step the decisions in Odelola  (allowing
    the Home Office to change the Rules from time to time as they see  fit)
    and Miah, where Stanley Burnton LJ, giving the only reasoned  judgment,
    said this at paragraph 26:

       In my judgment, there is no Near-Miss  principle  applicable  to  the
       Immigration  Rules.  The  Secretary  of  State,  and  on  appeal  the
       Tribunal, must assess the strength of an Article  8  claim,  but  the
       requirements of immigration control is  [sic]  not  weakened  by  the
       degree of non-compliance with the Immigration Rules.

38. The appellant in this  case  accepts  that  the  'near-miss'  principle
    cannot allow her to succeed; and, on the basis of that authority, it is
    hard to see how it could help her at all. Her real  complaint  is  that
    the Immigration Rules which have been laid before Parliament from  time
    to time are unfair to her, or to anyone else in her  position,  because
    of the assurances given on previous occasions. In the light of Odelola,
    the Secretary of State did not need to  give  such  assurances,  though
    clearly they might have lulled persons in the appellant's position into
    a false sense of security.

39. However, that could only have been the position up to 2011:  while  the
    changes made during that year might have been ineffective on  challenge
    under the rule in Pankina, only a rather learned immigrant  could  have
    been  expected  to  realize  that  defect;  and  only  a   particularly
    optimistic one to believe that it would not be put right, as it was  in
    July 2012. From then on, the present terms of the Rules have been quite
    clear, and there is no  room  for  the  operation  of  the  presumption
    referred to in Ferrer.

40. Even if a fairness argument were available to this appellant, I do  not
    think it would have been necessarily unfair for the Secretary of  State
    to expect that a person in her situation, with 20 months  of  her  work
    permit leave to run at the date of the April 2011 changes, should  have
    been unable to get a job or a wage which satisfied the requirements for
    tier 2 of the PBS, before applying for further  leave  to  remain.  The
    appellant's argument on the perceived unfairness of the changes made to
    the Rules can in my view no more succeed under article 8  than  on  the
    terms of the Rules themselves.

41. It follows that the appellant's appeal must be  dismissed;  but,  as  I
    have already made clear, she is an entirely worthy person, for  whom  I
    have a great deal of sympathy, as clearly did the judge. Now  the  Home
    Office have established the principle for which  they  contended,  they
    might well like to consider giving her  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules; but that of course must be entirely up to them.
