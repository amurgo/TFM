                      MD SALAH UDDIN (SECOND APPELLANT)

                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents:   Not present or represented

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondents, Masuma Akhter and MD  Salah  Uddin,  are  citizens  of
    Bangladesh.   I  shall  refer  hereafter  to  the  respondent  as   the
    appellants and to the Secretary of State as  the  respondent  (as  they
    were respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellants had appealed against decisions of the  respondent  dated
    17 June 2013 refusing their applications for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.   The  first  appellant  is  the  wife  of  the  second
    appellant who had applied for leave to remain as her dependant.   Their
    child, NS, is a dependant in the appeals.  The appellants had  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge R A Jones) which, in a  determination
    promulgated  on  31  March  2014,  dismissed  the  appeals  under   the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the ECHR  but  allowed  the  appeals
    against  the  decisions  to  remove  them  under  Section  47  of   the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3.  The  appellants  have  not  appealed  the  judge's  determination  the
    Secretary of State has  been  granted  permission  in  respect  of  the
    appellants' removal.

 4. The appellants did not attend the Upper Tribunal hearing at Field House
    on 23 June 2014.  Their solicitor (Judith Maurice) remains on the court
    record as acting for them and both she  and  the  appellants  had  been
    served by first class mail with notice of the hearing on 21  May  2014.
    In the absence of any explanation for the absence of the appellants  or
    their legal representative, I decided to proceed with  the  hearing  in
    any event.

 5. I find that the Secretary of State's appeal in respect of  the  removal
    decision should be allowed.  The judge's  reasoning  for  allowing  the
    Section 47 removal decisions was erroneous because it  was  based  upon
    law prior to 8 May 2013, the day upon which Section 51 of the Crime and
    Courts Act 2013 came into law.  The previous difficulties identified by
    the judge at [15] and also in Admally and Jaferi  (Section  47  Removal
    Decisions: Tribunal  Procedures)  [2012]  UKUT  00414  (IAC)  had  been
    removed by the coming into force of Section 51 of the 2013 Act.   There
    was, therefore, no illegality in the "joint" decision by the respondent
    refusing  the  appellants'  substantive  applications  to  vary   leave
    providing for their removal under Section 47  of  the  2006  Act.   The
    immigration decisions in the instant appeal were made on 17 June  2013,
    that is after the date upon which Section 51 came into force.   I  have
    therefore set aside the determination and have  re-made  the  decision.
    The appeals in respect of the Immigration  Rules  are  dismissed.   The
    appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.

DECISION

 6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal as promulgated on 31 March
    2014 is set aside.  I have re-made the decision.

 7. The appeals in respect of the Immigration Rules are dismissed.

 8. The appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds.


Signed                              Date 20 July 2014
