For the Appellant:       Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:      Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction.

1) The appellant presently identifies herself as Tabara Touray,  a  national
   of Gambia, born on  25  December  1981.   She  has  previously  used  the
   identity of Ruba Jaye, born on 11 December 1981.

2) The appellant says that she entered the UK unlawfully in 2000 and  worked
   unlawfully here from 2006 to 2011.  She has a son, born in the UK  on  24
   October 2009.  The birth certificate names Tabara Touray  as  his  mother
   and a Gambian-born student as his father.  The appellant does  not  claim
   to be in any current family relationship other than with her child.

3) The appellant applied on 3 March 2011  for  leave  for  herself  and  her
   child to remain, outwith the Immigration Rules, on the basis of Article 8
   of the ECHR.  That application seems to have been  refused,  and  not  to
   have been appealed.  She made an asylum application on 25 February  2013.
   The respondent refused that application for reasons explained in a letter
   dated 2 April 2013.   The  refusal  is  made  by  reference  the  Refugee
   Convention; to humanitarian protection; and  under  the  ECHR,  including
   consideration of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  the  best
   interests of her child.

4) First-tier Tribunal Judge McGavin dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  for
   reasons explained in her determination promulgated on 6 June 2013.

Grounds of appeal to the UT.

5) The grounds on which permission was granted are as follows:

   Article 8 Claim: (paragraph  40-53):  the  FTTIJ  has  erred  in  law  in
   concluding (paragraph 53) that interference in her family and/or  private
   life is proportionate:


               i) An arguable  case:  although  it  is  accepted  that  the
                  appellant cannot succeed  within  the  Immigration  Rules
                  (for reasons set out between paragraphs 41-47), the FTTIJ
                  then needs to consider whether:


                  "... there remains an arguable case (emphasis made)  that
                  there may be good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain
                  outside the Rules by reference to  Article  8  ...  (only
                  then) ... will be necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go
                  on to consider whether there are compelling circumstances
                  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  new  rules  to
                  require the grant of such leave" (Nagre  v  Secretary  of
                  State for the Home Department (2013) EWHC 720 (Admin).


                  The test of a "good arguable case" has now  been  adopted
                  by the Inner House of the Court  of  Session  (See  MS  v
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department (2013) CSIH 52
                  9para 28)).


              ii) Exceptional factors: the FTTIJ has not only applied  this
                  test, but applied one which is wrong  in  law:   she  has
                  considered whether there are any "... exceptional factors
                  not contemplated by the said Rules ..."  (paragraph  48).
                  This she has done in line with the decision in Green  (to
                  which she refers) but the UT in that case referred to not
                  only  exceptional  factors  but  also  whether  the  "...
                  decision is an unlawful one and disproportionate  to  the
                  legitimate aim ..." (Green at  Head  Note  2).   She  has
                  erred by focussing only on exceptional  factors  and  not
                  carry out a balancing exercise (taking into  account  the
                  Razgar questions).


             iii) Unjustifiably harsh consequences: having  regard  to  the
                  above authorities, the FTTIJ should not  have  considered
                  only whether  there  were  any  exceptional  factors  but
                  rather considered if there was a good arguable case  that
                  despite the fact that the  appellant  could  not  succeed
                  within the Rules, there might be compelling circumstances
                  (as these are described in paragraph 13  in  Nagre  -  by
                  reference to Policy Guidance  issued  by  the  SSHD)  not
                  sufficient recognised under the Rules.  This required the
                  FTTIJ  to  adopt  a  far  wider  approach   than   simply
                  addressing the question of whether it  was  in  the  best
                  interests of the child to remain in  the  UK.   The  term
                  "exceptional" (or any variant of the term) is  ambiguous,
                  and should not be used (see the  Inner  House  in  MS  at
                  paragraph 27  and  the  decision  of  the  UT  in  Izuazu
                  (referred to  by  the  FTTIJ  at  paragraph  41  (of  her
                  decision) at paragraph 50).

              iv) Conclusion: the FTTIJ has erred in law by  not  assessing
                  whether the appellant may have a good arguable case  that
                  there may be grounds for granting her leave  outwith  the
                  Rules; by confining her assessment of exceptional factors
                  to only one issue (best interest of the child);  and  not
                  adopting a sufficiently rounded or wide approach  to  the
                  issue of proportionality by taking into account  all  the
                  circumstances which might amount to a good arguable case.




Submissions for appellant.

6) Mr MacKay firstly sought to  identify  an  error  which  is  not  in  the
   grounds (including the grounds on which  permission  was  refused).   The
   judge said at paragraph 46 of her determination, based on paragraphs  33-
   36 of the refusal letter, that the respondent did  not  accept  that  the
   appellant has a son. The judge went on, "The appellant  has  provided  no
   credible evidence ... that she is Tabara Touray or ... that she has  used
   this name ... in the UK for work  and  other  purposes  ...  the  claimed
   father of the child did not give  evidence."  Mr  MacKay  said  that  the
   refusal letter, in particular at paragraphs 12, 42, 50, 52  and  53,  did
   acknowledge that the appellant had a child, although that was not set out
   in the recital of material facts accepted at paragraph 34  and  35.   The
   judge misunderstood the respondent's position.  Mr MacKay  accepted  that
   the judge went on to consider the case on the alternative basis that  the
   child is the appellant's (paragraph 47 onwards of the determination).  He
   also accepted that on all information  available  the  child  would  have
   Gambian citizenship and would not be eligible for any other  citizenship.
   He did not say what consequences should flow from the error, if there was
   one,  of  misunderstanding  whether  the  respondent  accepted  that  the
   appellant has a child.

7) Turning to Article 8, Mr MacKay relied on the grounds set out above.   He
   accepted that the judge considered Article  8  "outwith  the  Immigration
   Rules", but said that broadly she did so on the wrong test of exceptional
   circumstances rather than the correct tests of  compelling  circumstances
   and unduly harsh consequences of return.  The determination at  paragraph
   41 records Mr MacKay's submission in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  it
   would not be in the best interests of the child to return to  the  Gambia
   which is a small, socially and religiously conservative, country, as  the
   child of a single woman, born out of wedlock.  He accepted that the judge
   had not found the appellant credible and that  her  claim  to  have  been
   disowned by her  family  had  not  been  established.   Nevertheless,  he
   submitted that the factors in the appellant's favour  cumulatively  -  in
   particular the length of her residence, 13 years, the age  of  the  child
   and his best interests - pointed to  a  proportionality  outcome  in  her
   favour.  The determination should be reversed.



Submissions for respondent.

8) Mr Mullen acknowledged that the refusal letter was framed  on  the  basis
   that the child is the appellant's, but said that the issue raised  by  Mr
   MacKay was of no substance.  The judge did not make  a  positive  finding
   that the appellant does not have a child.   She  merely  pointed  to  the
   unsatisfactory state of the evidence  about  the  true  identity  of  the
   appellant.  There was no reason why the appellant could not have provided
   good evidence on that point, as she has never said she has reason to fear
   her national authorities.

9) In any event, the determination went  on  to  resolve  the  case  on  the
   footing that the child is the appellant's.  The rest of the determination
   resolved around the child's best  interests.   The  judge  plainly  found
   herself bound to make a free standing Article 8 assessment,  irrespective
   of the rules, and irrespective of the respondent's  decision.   She  took
   into account factors such as citizenship, relationships with parents, and
   such meagre information as she had on what might be in the  child's  best
   interests.  No significant case was before her  to  show  that  the  best
   interests of the child would be adversely affected by removal  to  Gambia
   as opposed to remaining in the UK.  The  appellant  relied  on  her  long
   residence, but she had not proved the time she claims to  have  spent  in
   the UK, having been found an unreliable witness.  Her adverse immigration
   history and unauthorised employment was against her.  Her son was aged 3�
   at the time of the First-tier Tribunal.  That is an age which  the  child
   could not be expected to have formed significant links  other  than  with
   his mother, in the home.  The judge properly struck the Article 8 balance
   and her decision should not be interfered with.

Discussion and conclusions.

10) The judge was entitled to comment as she did on  the  lack  of  credible
   evidence  of  the  appellant's  true  identity.    Misunderstanding  over
   whether  the  respondent  accepted  that  the  appellant  has  a  son  is
   irrelevant to the outcome, because it was plainly reached  by  the  judge
   accepting that she does.  There was no application to amend  the  grounds
   of appeal, and no submission as to what the outcome should be should  be,
   were this alleged  error  established.   The  point  does  not  take  the
   appellant's case any further.

11) On Article 8, I find the grounds and submissions formulaic  rather  than
   substantial.   They do not amount to  more  than  disagreement  with  the
   expression of the tests to be  applied  under  Article  8  and  with  the
   outcome.  The case was not complicated or unusual.  The best interests of
   the child are served by his remaining with his mother,  and  he  is  very
   young.  It was not shown  that  anything  significantly  adverse  to  his
   interests might come about by moving to Gambia.  It was  not  established
   that there would be a lack of family support.   Even  if  that  had  been
   proved, it would have been far from decisive in the appellant's favour. A
   good arguable case under Article 8 of  the  ECHR  opens  the  way  for  a
   decision to be made.  It is not a test requiring that decision to  be  in
   an appellant's favour.  The judge did  find  an  Article  8  case  to  be
   resolved.  I detect no error of law in her approach which might have  had
   any effect on the outcome.

12) While it is not necessary to go any further for  present  purposes,  the
   case is of an overstayer with nothing to her credit  in  the  immigration
   history; a 3 or 4 year old child; and no serious evidence of disadvantage
   through return.  It might have been difficult to justify  an  outcome  in
   her favour.

13) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14) No anonymity order is in force, and none was requested.
