Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Kullar of SH & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Turkey who  was  born  on  5th  November,
    1997.  He was granted leave to remain the United Kingdom on 19th  June,
    2014 valid until 19th December, 2014 as  a  visitor.   He  attended  an
    English language programme at beginner level with Twin Group from  14th
    July, 2014 to 15th August, 2015.

2.   The appellant made application on 16th  December,  2014  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom under the  terms  of  the  Turkey-European
    Community  Association  Agreement,  to  establish  a   business.    The
    appellant indicated that he intends to  set  up  a  business  providing
    leaflet distribution services to takeaway shops, restaurants and  other
    businesses in and around the Warrington area.

3.   On 16th June, 2015, the respondent refused the appellant's  application
    and the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

4.   The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Siddiqi
    on 25th August, 2015, at Manchester.   On  18th  September,  2015,  the
    judge's determination was promulgated and she dismissed the appellant's
    appeal.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb,  who
    believed  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  judge  had   imposed   an
    unreasonable requirement on the appellant (in particular the  terms  of
    his business plan and practical implementation of it)  to  show  he  is
    proposing a viable business (not yet set up) under paragraph 21  of  HC
    501 applying the approach in  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  on  the
    Ankara Agreement in Akinci (paragraph 21 HC  510  -  correct  approach)
    [2012] UKUT 00266 (IAC).

6.   Ms Kullar referred me  to  the  grounds  submitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  She referred me to what the judge had said at paragraph  37,
    namely:-

         "It is for the appellant  to  demonstrate  that  he  has  a  viable
         business plan.  Based on the totality of the evidence before me and
         for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs, I  find  he  has
         not established that he meets the requirements of paragraph  21  of
         HC510.  The respondent has referred to the appellant  entering  the
         UK as a visitor for six weeks but remaining in the UK  beyond  that
         period.  The appellant claimed he entered the UK for six months  to
         study English, C-Visit visa.  I note that the  appellant  has  only
         provided evidence of having studied for a month  in  the  UK.   The
         respondent concluded that the appellant's application was  more  of
         an attempt to secure leave in the UK.  Given my findings as to  the
         inadequacy of the appellant's business plan, I  find  there  to  be
         considerable merit to the respondent's argument."


7.   Ms Kullar quite properly pointed out  that  there  was  no  requirement
    under the Immigration Rules that a business plan  should  be  submitted
    with an application and so, she submitted, it was quite  wrong  of  the
    judge to refer to the fact that the appellant had failed to demonstrate
    that he had a viable business  plan.   All  that  is  required  of  the
    appellant is that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities
    the business may incur and that his share of profits will be sufficient
    to support him and any dependants.  The appellant has no dependants and
    the judge found that she was satisfied that the appellant's total start-
    up costs would amount to �1,530.

8.   The judge makes unfair criticisms of the four letters from  prospective
    customers the appellant submitted, Ms Kullar  said.   The  judge  found
    that these letters were generic in content and given that  the  wording
    was identical, she was not prepared to accept the reliability of  these
    letters.  Nonetheless the letters were prepared on the instructions  of
    the individual authors of the letters by the appellant's solicitors and
    as evidence they should have been given due weight, she said.

9.   The judge was wrong to find that the  applicant  should  have  included
    the  exact  number  of  takeaway  and  restaurant  businesses  in   the
    Warrington area in his business plan.  That is highly unreasonable,  Ms
    Kullar  submitted.   The  inclusion  of  the  number  of  takeaway  and
    restaurant businesses in the appellant's business plan  would  make  no
    difference to the viability of the applicant's proposed business.

10.  She submitted also that it was  wrong  to  find  that  the  appellant's
    ability to undertake leaflet distribution services is hampered  by  the
    area he can cover on foot  and  public  transport.   By  its  nature  a
    leaflet distribution requires door to door  distribution  on  foot  and
    because it is a simple business the distributor does not need a private
    vehicle to operate.  Public transport can be  utilised.   The  business
    plan  and  financial  forecasts  and  spreadsheets  should  have   been
    considered by the judge  in  the  appellant's  favour.   There  was  no
    requirement of the appellant to produce these documents and given  that
    it was a simple business proposal, the  judge  was  wrong  to  hold  it
    against the appellant that the business plan was not viable.  The judge
    failed to consider that the proposed business is a simple business  and
    that the plan is simply a projection.  It was wrong for  the  judge  to
    make presumptions as to whether or not the appellant would be  able  to
    find sufficient numbers of customers within the appellant  first  being
    allowed to run his business for six months and then submit evidence  at
    a later time.  The  judge  was  wrong  to  find  that  the  appellant's
    application is no more than an attempt to secure leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom because the appellant is entitled at any time during the
    currency of his visa to submit an Ankara Agreement application.

11.  Ms Kullar also drew  my  attention  to  paragraph  28  of  the  judge's
    determination where she said:-

         "Therefore, even if the appellant's business  plan  is  similar  to
         others received by the respondent,  I  have  not  taken  this  into
         account  when  considering  whether  the  appellant  has  a  viable
         business plan."

    Again, Ms Kullar submitted, that shows that the  judge  is  considering
    whether the business plan is viable and that, she  submitted,  was  the
    wrong test.


12.  Mr Harrison relied on his Rule 24 response  which  submitted  that  the
    grounds were  without  merit  and  amounted  to  nothing  more  than  a
    disagreement.  I reserved my decision.

13.  I have concluded that the judge did err, but  for  the  reason  I  give
    below, the error was not material to the outcome of the appeal.

14.  She was, without, entitled to consider the  appellant's  business  plan
    which had been submitted by the appellant and  was  relied  on  by  the
    appellant.  As such it was evidence which needed to  be  considered  in
    the round with all the other evidence.  However, she  should  not  have
    concerned herself with whether or not the business plan was viable  but
    instead with whether or not:

              "the appellant will be devoting  assets  of  his  own  to  the
             business proportional to his interest in it, that he  will  be
             able to share his share of any liabilities  the  business  may
             incur and that his share of profits  would  be  sufficient  to
             support him and any dependants. "

15.  However, I do not  believe  that  the  judge's  error  is  in  any  way
    material to the outcome of the appeal.  By suggesting that the business
    plan was not  viable  it  is  clear  from  a  careful  reading  of  the
    determination as a whole, that what Judge Siddiqi was  actually  saying
    was that the appellant's share of any profits will not be sufficient to
    support him.

16   The appellant makes it clear in the business plan that  he  intends  to
    make door to door leaflet distribution to homes and businesses  in  the
    areas targeted by his customers.  He proposes to charge  a  minimum  of
    �40 for distributing 1,000 leaflets and  believes  that  he  will  earn
    between �40 and �60  a  day.   There  is  nothing  in  the  appellant's
    business plan to show that the appellant  has  considered  whether  his
    charges are in line with prospective competitors'  charges  or  whether
    they may be more than competitors' charges or  less  than  competitors'
    charges.  If they are less than competitors' charges then that will  of
    course suggest that he would be in a good position to compete with  any
    competitors, but he has not demonstrated that he has  fully  considered
    what opposition and competition he may have.  The appellant  gave  some
    oral evidence about this, but in relation only to  one  competitor  who
    will deliver two or more customers leaflets together for �25 per 1000.

17.  Given that the business simply requires the delivery  of  leaflets  and
    no highly skilled training, it is likely that in addition to the  Royal
    Mail,  there  will  be  several  other  competitors  operating  in  the
    Warrington area.  The  appellant  appears  not  to  have  any  detailed
    investigation of the charges that  those  businesses  make;  he  merely
    pointed out that one will deliver multiple leaflets for �25 per 1000.

18.  The appellant has produced three letters  from  prospective  customers,
    two of which are kebab and pizza houses and the other appears to  be  a
    takeaway  food  business.   The  appellant   believed   there   to   be
    considerable demand for leaflet distribution business services, because
    of competition between the takeaway shops and restaurants,  but,  given
    that competition, does not appear to have given  any  consideration  to
    the fact that competing businesses may well not wish to  use  the  same
    distribution service to distribute their advertising leaflets.

19.  Similarly, competing business may  well  object  to  their  advertising
    material being delivered to homes and businesses at the same time as  a
    competitor's advertising material is being delivered, on the basis that
    a potential customer is unlikely to take much notice  of  two  leaflets
    both advertising kebab and pizza houses, if they are delivered  at  the
    same time.

20.  The judge  was  perfectly  entitled  to  criticise  the  business  plan
    because that was what the appellant relied on and was evidence that the
    judge was required to consider.   The  appellant  was  not  obliged  to
    submit a business plan, but having done so it was  incumbent  upon  the
    judge to examine it carefully.  The judge was entitled to note that the
    appellant claims that there are not  many  small  businesses/individual
    leaflet distributors in Warrington, but the appellant does not give any
    information as to how he reaches that conclusion.

21.  And in paragraph 31, the judge was  entitled  to  point  out  that  the
    appellant's ability to distribute leaflets will depend to  some  extent
    on the availability of public transport.  He has no  transport  of  his
    own and will of course need to visit homes and businesses on foot.  But
    inevitably, there will be  areas  of  Warrington  where  his  customers
    require leaflets to be  delivered  which  are  not  covered  by  public
    transport.

22.  The judge was  entitled  to  point  out  that  the  appellant  has  not
    demonstrated what area he could cover in  a  normal  working  day.   He
    believes that he could earn between �40 and �60 per day,  but  assuming
    he charges �40 for distributing 1,000 leaflets he has not indicated how
    many leaflets he could distribute in a day.  If he were  serious  about
    starting a business earning sufficient to  provide  for  his  needs,  I
    believe that he would have walked around the are his  business  was  to
    serve and satisfy himself that he would be able to visit at least  1000
    homes and businesses in a day.

23.  The weight to be placed on the letters from prospective  customers  was
    a matter for the judge and her alone.  She was entitled  to  point  out
    that in order to earn between �40 and �60 a day,  working  six  days  a
    week, he would need to be delivering 1,000 to 1,500 leaflets  each  day
    and would need considerably more customers to achieve this target.   On
    the  basis  of  those  three  letters  (and  assuming  the   individual
    businesses do not  have  any  objection  to  him  working  for  similar
    competing businesses at the same time as distributing  their  leaflets)
    he would only be earning �120 per fortnight from which he would have to
    deduct national insurance, tax and his transport costs.

24.  Similarly the judge was entitled to point out in paragraph 32 that  the
    appellant has not addressed how he  would  compete  with  a  competitor
    offering to distribute 1,000 at �25 per 1,000 on the  basis  that  they
    deliver several competitors' leaflets at the  same  time.   Again,  the
    judge was entitled to find that the appellant's level of English  would
    not be sufficient  to  enable  him  to  compete  with  English-speaking
    customers based on a four  week  beginners'  course.   The  appellant's
    response was that he would only be communicating with  Turkish-speaking
    customers but, as the judge points out, this would significantly  limit
    the appellant's pool of customers.  At the hearing the judge noted that
    the appellant claimed his cousins would assist him  but  there  was  no
    evidence from his cousins to  indicate  that  they  would  be  able  to
    provide him with such support as and when he required it.

25.  On the basis of the evidence before the judge, I do  not  believe  that
    the appellant has demonstrated, on the balance of  probabilities,  that
    his share of profits will be sufficient to support him.  The respondent
    concluded that the appellant's  application  was  more  an  attempt  to
    secure leave in the UK and given her findings the judge  was  perfectly
    entitled to find that there was considerable merit in the  respondent's
    conclusion.

26.  I find that the judge did err in her determination, but that her  error
    was not material and I uphold her decision.  The appellant's appeal  is
    dismissed.
