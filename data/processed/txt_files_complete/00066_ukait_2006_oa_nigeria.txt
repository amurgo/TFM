For the Appellant:           Mr M. O'Connor, counsel, instructed by
                       Cranbrook, solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr P. D'Silva, Home Office Presenting Officer

A serving prisoner is not a worker for the purposes of the Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 or 2006 and a spouse is not,
therefore, entitled to a residence card.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction - the procedural history

   1. The appellant, born 27  October  1972  is  now  aged  33.   She  seeks
      reconsideration of the determination of Immigration Judge  S.  Clarke,
      promulgated on 28 July 2005 in which  she  dismissed  the  appellant's
      appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State made  under  the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000.  The  basis  of
      the respondent's decision was that  he  was  not  satisfied  that  her
      husband was in the United Kingdom and a qualified  person  within  the
      meaning of the 2000 regulations.  Accordingly, on her arrival  in  the
      United Kingdom from Marseilles, he revoked her  residence  permit  and
      cancelled her leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


   2. On further inquiry, it transpired that her husband, Mr R, a Portuguese
      national, was serving a seven-year term  of  imprisonment  imposed  at
      Croydon Crown Court on 9 March 2005 for an offence of being  knowingly
      concerned in the importation of a Class  A  drug.   The  Secretary  of
      State therefore took the view that, as a  person  serving  a  term  of
      imprisonment, the appellant's  husband  was  not  a  qualified  person
      exercising treaty rights pursuant to  the  2000  regulations,  thereby
      justifying the respondent's  earlier  decision,  albeit  on  different
      grounds.


   3. By a decision made on 16 May 2005, the Secretary of State notified the
      appellant of the material immigration decision revoking her  residence
      permit and  refusing  her  admission  to  the  United  Kingdom.   This
      deprived the appellant of any lawful basis for remaining in the United
      Kingdom and the Secretary of State required her  to  leave  by  giving
      directions  that  she  be  removed  to  Nigeria.   In  the  Notice  of
      Immigration Decision - Refusal of Admission under  European  Community
      Law,  the  appellant's  removal  was  proposed  in   accordance   with
      Regulation 21 (3) and 26 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2000 as amended.  This was an  appealable  decision  under
      section 82 (1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.
      The appellant appealed.

   4. At a hearing before the Tribunal on 21 April 2005, Senior  Immigration
      Judge Storey found that there was a material  error  of  law  for  the
      following reasons:

           "1. At paragraph 5 the Immigration  Judge  wrote:  'I  told  the
           parties that I would not consider the  interview  transcript  or
           the report dated 17 May 2005 in so far as it  was  a  source  of
           facts.'  The  aforementioned  report  was  the  only  source  of
           evidence before her stating  that  the  appellant's  spouse  was
           imprisoned.  However, at paragraph 17 and 18  she  gave  as  her
           reasons for dismissing the appeal the fact that the  appellant's
           husband, being a detainee, could not  be  a  'qualified  person'
           under   the   Immigration   (EEA)   Regulations   2000.     This
           contradictory approach to the  evidence  and  to  the  issue  of
           whether it was right to exclude such evidence (even though going
           on to rely on it) amounts to a material error of law.
           2. I agree with the parties that I am not in a position to  deal
           with the second-stage reconsideration at this stage,  as  it  is
           clearly  relevant  for  there  to  be  evidence  presented   and
           considered as to (1) the relationship between the appellant  and
           her husband, and (2)  his  economic  activities  in  the  United
           Kingdom, prior to being imprisoned and whilst in prison."

The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (S.I.  2006  No.
1003)

   5. At the material time, the rights of the appellant were  determined  by
      the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000.  These were
      replaced by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
      (S.I. 2006  No. 1003) which came into force on 30 April  2006.   Under
      paragraph 5 of  Schedule  4  (Transitional  Provisions)  to  the  2006
      Regulations, where an appeal against an EEA decision  under  the  2000
      Regulations is pending immediately before 30 April 2006, the appeal is
      to be treated as a pending appeal under the corresponding EEA decision
      under the 2006 Regulations.  This appeal falls to be determined  under
      the  2006  Regulations.   See  MG  and  VC  (EEA   Regulations   2006;
      "conducive" deportation) Ireland  [2006]  UKAIT  00053  in  which  the
      Tribunal stated:


           "15. We need  only  add  that  the  previous  statutory  regime,
           contained  in   the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
           Regulations 2000  (SI  2000/2326  as  amended)  is  for  present
           purposes  entirely  revoked  with  no  savings  or  transitional
           provisions.


           16. The first thing that is apparent is that the new Regulations
           came into force immediately on  30  April  2006,  and  that  the
           previous law is no longer in effect.   The  effect  on  existing
           decisions and appeals is  quite  remarkable:   they  are  to  be
           treated as decisions and appeals under the new Regulations.  The
           consequence may be that a decision lawful when it was made,  and
           a determination by the Tribunal containing no error of law  when
           it was made, may now disclose an error of  law  because  of  the
           retrospective change of the decision and its authority.


           17. Those considerations apply directly in relation to decisions
           under the previous Regulations and appeals against EEA decisions
           under those Regulations."


The appellant is a spouse

   6. At the commencement of the hearing before us, Mr D'Silva, who appeared
      on behalf of the Secretary of State, conceded that there was no  issue
      in relation to the first of  the  matters  identified  by  the  Senior
      Immigration Judge, namely, the state of the relationship  between  the
      appellant and her husband.  For the purposes of both the 2000 and  the
      2006 Regulations, a spouse is defined in Part 1 as  not  including  "a
      party to a marriage of convenience".  Whilst there was a  considerable
      volume of material directed towards this issue before us, as a  result
      of the concession made by Mr D'Silva, we approach this appeal  on  the
      basis that this was not a marriage of convenience.


The Immigration Judge's determination

   7. Whilst it is not now necessary to  consider  the  Immigration  Judge's
      determination in any detail, she found that  the  appellant's  husband
      was not a qualified person  because  the  appellant  had  provided  no
      evidence on the issue other than the fact that her husband was then in
      prison.  She found as a fact that a detainee is not capable of falling
      within the definition of a qualified worker.  There  was  no  evidence
      that he was registered with an unemployment office.  In  paragraph  19
      of her determination, she said:


           "I find that Mr R is  not  a  qualified  person  because  he  is
           imprisoned and there is no evidence before me that he is engaged
           in an economic activity, or ever was, other than paragraph 3  of
           the statement of Mr R which simply states that he was employed."


   8. She dismissed the appellant's associated claim under Article  8.   The
      Immigration Judge was not satisfied that the evidence provided by  the
      appellant   was   sufficient   to   establish   that   it   would   be
      disproportionate to require the appellant to leave the United Kingdom,
      notwithstanding the presence of her husband in prison.

The facts

   9. In a statement provided by the appellant on 11 July 2005, prior to the
      hearing, the appellant stated that she met her husband  in  July  2002
      and the relationship started in the  following  month.   They  started
      living together in early 2003 and were married on  18  December  2003.
      On 12 February 2004, the Home Office provided the appellant  with  the
      right to reside in United Kingdom on the basis that she was married to
      a qualified person exercising treaty rights.   Some 9 months later, on
      4 October 2004, Mr R was arrested at Gatwick Airport for  the  offence
      for which he was subsequently sentenced to  imprisonment  on  9  March
      2005.  Bearing in mind the nature  of  the  offence,  the  Immigration
      Judge considered it likely that Mr R remained  in  custody  after  his
      arrest.  Accordingly, whatever work  Mr  R  was  doing  prior  to  his
      arrest, it ceased  on  4  October  2004.   Evidence  from  the  prison
      authorities reveals that his release date is  4  June  2009  although,
      were he to be successful for parole, he might be released as early  as
      4 April 2008.

Qualified person

  10. The 2006 Regulations define a qualified worker  and  the  rights  that
      attach to a qualified worker and his spouse:

                6. (1) In these Regulations,  "qualified  person"  means  a
           person who is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-

                 (b) a worker;

                 (2) A person who is no longer working shall not cease to be
                treated as a worker for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if-

                 (a) he is temporarily unable to work as the  result  of  an
                 illness or accident;

                 (b) he is in duly recorded involuntary  unemployment  after
                 having been employed in the United Kingdom,  provided  that
                 he  has  registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the   relevant
                 employment office and-

                       (i) he was employed for one year or more before
                       becoming unemployed;
                       (ii) he has been unemployed for no more than six
                       months; or
                       (iii) he can provide evidence that he is seeking
                       employment in the United Kingdom and has a genuine
                       chance of being engaged;

                 (c) he is involuntarily unemployed and has embarked on
                 vocational training; or

                 (d) he has  voluntarily  ceased  working  and  embarked  on
                 vocational  training  that  is  related  to  his   previous
                 employment.

           14.   (1) A qualified person is entitled to reside in the United
           Kingdom for so long as he remains a qualified person.
                 (2) A family member of a qualified person residing in  the
           United Kingdom under paragraph (1) or of an EEA national with  a
           permanent right of residence under regulation 15 is entitled  to
           reside in the United Kingdom for  so  long  as  he  remains  the
           family member of the qualified person or EEA national.

The relevance of past work when considering whether an  EEA  national  is  a
qualified person

  11. Although the Senior Immigration  Judge  at  the  first  stage  of  the
      reconsideration  hearing  indicated  that  it  would  be  relevant  to
      consider Mr R's economic activities in the United Kingdom prior to his
      being imprisoned, there is little material before us dealing with this
      aspect of the appeal.


  12. Three payslips have  been  provided  from  Berry  Recruitment  Limited
      dealing with Mr R's employment.  The weekly payslip dated 21 September
      2003 showed taxable pay to date of �2,377.50 and that his weekly wages
      were �212.50.  These pre-dated his marriage to the appellant.

  13. Mr O'Connor, however, did not seek to argue that his earnings prior to
      his imprisonment were material in establishing that, at  the  date  of
      the Secretary of State's decision on 16 May 2005 or thereafter,  Mr  R
      was or is a qualified person for the purposes of the Regulations.

  14. In our judgment,  this  concession  was  inevitable.   It  may  appear
      arguable that, where a person is detained for a  short  period  during
      which his job remains open to him to recommence on  release,  he  does
      not  cease  to  be  a  qualified  person  for  the  purposes  of   the
      Regulations.   His  situation  would  be  little  different  from  the
      situation that arises when a worker is absent, perhaps for an extended
      period, through illness.  In each of these examples, the  contract  of
      employment remains in place.

  15. The difficulty we see in equating  these  two  examples  is  that  the
      person unable to work as the result  of  an  illness  or  accident  is
      retained within the  definition  of  a  worker  by  express  statutory
      provision - see Regulation 6 (2) (a) above.   A  serving  prisoner  is
      not.  In any event, the same reasoning cannot  apply,  even  arguably,
      where the sentence of imprisonment is longer and where the contract of
      employment has terminated.

Whether a  person  serving  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  who  works  is  a
qualified person

  16. The issue before us as to whether Mr R  is  a  qualified  person  must
      depend upon the appellant establishing  he  is  a  worker  during  the
      course of his sentence.


  17. With this issue very much in mind, Mr R prepared a statement dated  30
      June 2006 in which he confirmed that he works in prison as a carpenter
      and his weekly pay varies  from  �1.50  to  �6.30.   In  addition,  Mr
      Augustine, the instructional officer, wrote from HMP The  Verne  on  4
      July 2006 confirming that Mr R is currently employed in the  carpentry
      industry where he assembles furniture.

  18. Mr O'Connor abstracted from the H. M. Prison Service website a passage
      about working in prison.  It describes such work in these terms:


           "Working in Prison
           Work can play a fundamental role in  providing  valuable  skills
           and qualifications that help prisoners get a job once  they  are
           released.  As part of the  induction  process,  each  prisoner's
           suitability and preference for work is assessed.
           Throughout their stay in  prison,  prisoners'  achievements  and
           needs are recorded and monitored  to  ensure  that,  as  far  as
           resources allow, each prisoner follows a constructive work plan.
            Educational and training needs are considered  and  many  allow
           prisoners  to  attain  recognised  qualifications,  for  example
           National Vocational Qualifications.


           Type of work available
           The type of work available varies in each  prison  depending  on
           the  availability  of  resources  and   security   and   control
           requirements.   Normally,  work  is  available   in   industrial
           workshops and/or land-based activity units.  Work undertaken  in
           these units is varied and can provide skills in trades such  as:
           textiles, engineering, woodwork, printing, data  entry,  plastic
           moulding, component assembly,  computer  aided  design,  desktop
           publishing and employment offering practical training  in  rural
           activities,  fresh  produce  production,   protected   cropping,
           amenity  horticulture  and   landscaping   leading   to   formal
           qualifications.
           Other work is available within the  prison,  such  as  catering,
           cleaning and general building and maintenance work.
           Pay
           Rates of pay vary depending on resources, the amount and type of
           work available at each prison.


  19. We accept that Mr  R  spends  part  of  his  time  whilst  in  custody
      assembling furniture for which he is paid between �1.50  and  �6.30  a
      week. Although there is no evidence as  to  his  hours  of  work,  the
      definition of a worker in the 2006 Regulations is  not  restricted  to
      full-time work.  Further, as part of the prison  regimen,  it  may  be
      that Mr R performs other work, cleaning and maintaining  the  building
      or other domestic work, although no evidence was  directed  to  us  on
      this issue.

European jurisprudence

  20.  In Lawrie-Blum [1987] 3 CMLR  389,  the  European  Court  of  Justice
      considered the term "worker" in  the  context  of  Article  8  of  the
      Treaty.  Since freedom of movement for workers constitutes one of  the
      fundamental  principles  of  the  Community,  the  expression  has   a
      Community meaning and is  not  defined  by  national  law.   Since  it
      defines the scope of a fundamental freedom, the Community  concept  of
      "worker" must be interpreted broadly.  In  accordance  with  objective
      criteria, employment must be considered by reference to the rights and
      duties of the worker, although the central feature  of  an  employment
      relationship is that, for a certain period of time, a person  performs
      services for and under the direction of another in return for which he
      receives remuneration.  Thus trainee teachers, if  they  provide  work
      for an employer for pay, even though under supervision and working  in
      preparation for a qualifying examination, fall within  the  definition
      of worker.  All that is required is that the activities should  be  in
      the  nature  of  work  performed  for  remuneration.   Further  it  is
      irrelevant that the work is of a non-economic nature,  such  as  state
      education or in public service.


  21. The decision in Lawrie-Blum followed the decision in Kempf [1986]  ECR
      1741 which itself drew support from earlier European jurisprudence  to
      the effect that an activity as an  employed  person  which  yields  an
      income lower than that which is considered as the minimum required for
      subsistence so that the person's income  has  to  be  supplemented  by
      other means, (perhaps state benefits or assistance  from  family),  is
      nevertheless a worker provided he pursues an activity as  an  employed
      person which is effective and genuine.  As part-time employment is not
      excluded from the field of application of  the  rules  on  freedom  of
      movement for workers, those rules cover only the pursuit of  effective
      and genuine activities, to the exclusion of activities on such a small-
      scale as to be regarded as only marginal and  ancillary.   Hence,  the
      European Court of Justice decided a  music  teacher  who  gave  twelve
      lessons a week was to be regarded as pursuing  effective  and  genuine
      work, if only because the national court decided that the work was not
      on such a small-scale  as  to  be  purely  a  marginal  and  ancillary
      activity.


  22. In Bettray [1989] ECJ 1621 the concepts developed in Kempf and Lawrie-
      Blum were applied.  As long as an effective and  genuine  activity  is
      pursued, the level of productivity, the source of the funds from which
      the remuneration is paid and the  nature  of  the  legal  relationship
      between the employee and the employer are of no consequence in  regard
      to whether or not a person is to be regarded as a worker.   Activities
      pursued under national legislation intended to provide  work  for  the
      purposes of maintaining, re-establishing or  developing  the  capacity
      for work of persons who, by reason of circumstances relating to  their
      situation, are unable to take up employment under normal circumstances
      cannot be regarded as an effective and genuine economic activity if it
      constitutes merely a means of rehabilitation or reintegration for  the
      persons concerned.  Accordingly, under social employment  law  in  the
      Netherlands, a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts at  which  those
      attending were afforded the opportunity to engage in paid  work  under
      conditions which corresponded as far as possible to  the  legal  rules
      and practices applicable to paid employment  under  normal  conditions
      were not "working as employed persons".   A  German  national  working
      there was not, therefore, entitled to a residence permit.  The jobs in
      question  were  reserved  for  persons  who,  by   reason   of   their
      circumstances, were unable to work in normal conditions.

Tribunal case law

  23. In RP (EEA Regs - worker - cessation) Italy [2006]  UKAIT  00025,  the
      Tribunal decided that a person  who  has  been  a  worker  within  the
      meaning of Community law does not cease  to  be  a  worker  simply  by
      virtue of falling unemployed, but he must be able to show that he  has
      been genuinely seeking work and  has  not  effectively  abandoned  the
      labour market.  Further, in assessing whether a person  has  satisfied
      the condition that he is or has remained a worker, the national  court
      must base its examination on objective criteria and assess as a  whole
      all the circumstances of the case relating to the nature of both  that
      person's activities whilst in the  Member  State  and  any  employment
      relationships at issue.


  24. We are not concerned here with Mr R's past employment  because  it  is
      accepted that this is immaterial for the purposes of deciding  whether
      he is now in effective work through the work he  performs  in  prison.
      The fact that Mr  R  rendered  himself  liable  to  imprisonment  also
      prevents him from genuinely seeking work in the community.  We are  in
      no doubt that he has effectively abandoned the ordinary labour market.
       Adopting the reasoning in RP Italy, we will have to consider  whether
      working in prison is a part of the labour market.

Working in prison

  25. There are clear differences between a part-time worker who is employed
      at market rates and a prisoner who works in prison, even if the prison
      work is not purely therapeutic.  It is accepted that a prisoner is not
      entitled to many of the benefits afforded in the field of  employment.
      He does not have the benefit of legislation  granting  him  employment
      protection or rights of  redundancy.   The  legislation  enacting  the
      minimum wage does not apply to  prison  work.   The  PAYE  scheme  and
      National Insurance contributions do not apply. As far as we know,  the
      remuneration is not taxable, even in the case of  a  serving  prisoner
      with outside income, such as a private pension.  This is sufficient to
      demonstrate that working in prison is of a very different character to
      work in the community.

  26. There  are  other  differences.    There  is  no  right  to  work  for
      remuneration and whether an  individual  is  permitted  to  work  will
      depend upon a variety of factors, including  security  considerations,
      and the resources available,  both  physical  and  financial,  in  any
      particular prison establishment.  A prisoner has no choice as  to  the
      place of imprisonment; accordingly, no means of choosing whether there
      are opportunities to work.  A prisoner is not able to compete for  his
      labour and his wages are not governed by market forces.   The  purpose
      of working in prison may be very different.  It may  involve  elements
      of rehabilitation, training or therapy and those elements may  have  a
      much more significant role in the prison environment than they  do  in
      the community.  Further, the provision of work  may  be  an  important
      element  in  maintaining  the  orderly   functioning   of   a   prison
      establishment, defusing the tensions that may arise when large numbers
      of prisoners have little to do.

  27. Mr O'Connor seeks to argue that Mr R is a  worker  because  assembling
      furniture can properly be regarded as work.  He receives  remuneration
      for it, albeit at a different level compared to similar  work  in  the
      community.  The work is productive work in that he produces  furniture
      which can either be sold or can be used in  the  public  sector.   The
      submission contains within it the implicit  concession  that  not  all
      those serving prison sentences are workers and,  therefore,  qualified
      persons for the purposes of the Regulations.

  28. The effect of his submission would be distinguish  between  those  who
      carry out productive work in the  sense  that  their  output  is  sold
      outside the  prison  for  profit  and  other  serving  prisoners,  for
      example:

                  i) those prisoners who work in prison carrying out unpaid
                     domestic duties;
                 ii) those prisoners who are unable to work  because  there
                     are not facilities to  do  so  within  the  prison  or
                     because security considerations act as a practical bar
                     upon work;
                iii) those prisoners who carry out non-productive work  for
                     therapeutic purposes;
                 iv) those prisoners who  carry  out  work  as  part  of  a
                     training or rehabilitation programme;
                  v) those prisoners incapable of work.

  29. It seems to us that it would be  invidious  to  draw  any  distinction
      between prisoners who fall within the definition of a qualified person
      because of their work and those that do not, all  the  more  so  as  a
      serving prisoner may fall into or out  of  the  category  without  any
      ability to control the  change.   His  status  as  a  worker  will  be
      dependent upon the actions of the prison authorities in selecting  his
      place of confinement and then in offering the opportunity for work  in
      the establishment selected.

  30. As the European jurisprudence makes clear, the  fundamental  principle
      of Community law on which Mr O'Connor relies in his submissions is the
      freedom of movement for workers.  This concept is singularly inapt  in
      the case of a person serving a prison sentence who has no  freedom  of
      movement at all.  A purposive approach towards interpreting  Community
      legislation would  not,  therefore,  include  a  prisoner  within  the
      fundamental principle of the scheme; rather  the  opposite,  it  would
      tend to exclude him because he is a person to whom a right of  freedom
      of movement has no practical meaning.  If he, as principal,  does  not
      stand to benefit from the fundamental purpose of Community law, it  is
      illogical that the vicarious benefits afforded to  family  members  of
      qualified persons should attach to them.

  31. If a European citizen serving a  sentence  of  imprisonment  will  not
      benefit from the Community right to  enjoy  freedom  of  movement  for
      workers, the only beneficiaries for a prisoner who works will  be  his
      family members who are thereby entitled to a right of residence.   For
      the reasons we have given, however, only some serving  prisoners  will
      be workers in the sense envisaged in the European  jurisprudence.   If
      such a distinction is to be properly drawn, the distinction will  only
      be felt by family members, only some of whom will be able to  continue
      as holders of a  residence  document.  Their  right  to  remain  will,
      therefore, be  dependent  upon  the  serendipitous  choice  of  prison
      establishment and the opportunities for work there.



Conclusion

  32. We do not consider that any serving prisoner is a worker  and  thereby
      able to fall within the definition of a  qualified  worker  under  the
      2006 Regulations.


  33. In our judgment, the concept of a worker involves a person  who  works
      in an ordinary commercial or public sector setting  which,  in  either
      situation, is influenced by  market  forces.   Whilst  work  in  state
      education or in public service is non-economic in  character  in  that
      the employer is not a commercial enterprise, the employee works in the
      economic working environment - the open market -  and  his  employment
      cannot be classed as non-economic, even though the work he does  might
      be.  It is this economic motivation which adds meaning to a  right  to
      enjoy freedom of movement for  workers.   In  our  view,  it  is  this
      concept that is identified in RP Italy when the Tribunal speaks  of  a
      worker being a person who has not  effectively  abandoned  the  labour
      market.

  34. That economic element is lacking in the prison  environment  where  it
      may be difficult to discern whether an economic motive exists at  all,
      even in the case of paid  work  if  the  work  also  has  therapeutic,
      training or rehabilitative functions or is there to maintain order.  A
      person serving a prison sentence has effectively and clearly abandoned
      the ordinary labour market.  Whilst working in prison has some of  the
      characteristics  of  normal  work,  (and  may   for   therapeutic   or
      rehabilitative   purposes   be    designed    to    replicate    those
      characteristics), it is not the labour market in any meaningful sense.
       If there is such a thing as an  internal  labour  market  within  the
      prison system, that suggests how far it is alienated from  the  labour
      market outside the prison walls.

  35. In our judgment, European  jurisprudence  dealing  with  work  in  the
      community and influenced by economic forces  can  have  little  direct
      bearing on work performed in prison.

  36. Our determination is, however, consistent with the decisions in Lawrie-
      Blum and Kempf which are to the effect that the work must be effective
      and genuine.  Prison entails the forcible removal of persons from  the
      community and the deprivation of their right to freedom, including the
      freedom to conduct economic activities.   Working  in  prison  is  not
      central to that purpose and it can therefore properly be classified as
      marginal and ancillary.


Article 8

  37. It was not argued before us that, if  the  Secretary  of  State  acted
      lawfully in revoking the residence document because Mr R ceased to  be
      a qualified person, the appellant's removal would nonetheless  violate
      her human rights under  the  ECHR.   It  is  not  suggested  that  the
      appellant is not permitted to visit her husband whilst he  is  serving
      his sentence.  Whilst the relationship between husband and wife during
      the husband's imprisonment is restricted, such restrictions arise from
      the very fact of imprisonment.  Whilst visiting may be  rendered  less
      convenient or more costly by reason of  the  appellant's  removal,  it
      will not be prevented.  The ECHR is not primarily concerned  with  the
      economic consequences that interference brings about.  If  the  effect
      of removal will render the continuation of family life more difficult,
      the principal  causative  action  is  not  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision to remove the appellant because she  is  not  entitled  to  a
      residence document but Mr R's criminal conduct.  The  purpose  of  the
      ECHR is not as a tool to mitigate the effects of his conduct.


  38. In reaching this conclusion, the parties were not able to assist us in
      whether facilities exist in the EEA for  European  citizens  to  serve
      their sentences in the country of their nationality,  rather  than  in
      the country of conviction.  If such facilities exist, we were not told
      what circumstances qualify a prisoner to be considered for transfer.





      DECISION

        1) The original Tribunal made a material error of law.
        2) The following decision is accordingly substituted:

           a. The appellant's appeal is  dismissed  under  the  Immigration
              (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006,
           b. The appellant's appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.
