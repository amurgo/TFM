For the Appellants:    Miss J Lowis (Counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge JDL Edwards, promulgated  on  25th  November  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Richmond on 14th November 2014.  In the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeals of  Muhammad  Amjad  Siddiqi,  Nadia  Amjad
    Siddiqi, Muhammad Ashar  Siddiqi,  Rameen  Amjad,  and  Muhammad  Azlan
    Siddiqi.  The Appellants applied for, and were granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are all citizens of Pakistan.  They comprise  a  family.
    The first and second Appellants are husband and wife respectively.  The
    remaining Appellants  are  their  children  aged  9,  8,  and  4  years
    respectively.  They appealed against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 12th March 2014, to refuse their application for leave to  remain
    in the UK.  The application was that of  the  principal  Appellant,  Mr
    Muhammad Amjad Siddiqi, to remain in the  UK  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant, under Rule 245CD of the  Immigration  Rules,  and  under  Rule
    391(e) and 391(j).

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge had regard to the fact that the Respondent Secretary of State
    had refused the application of Mr Siddiqi on the basis  that  he  could
    not meet the requirements of paragraph 245CD(a) and (b) in  respect  of
    his earnings and funds available to him.  Furthermore, he  had  made  a
    false declaration of the level  of  his  earnings  in  respect  of  his
    application set out at paragraph 3(b) (paragraph 4).  The judge went on
    to set out the  Immigration  Rules  with  specific  reference  to  Rule
    245CD(a) and (b) and noted that the Appellant was alleged not  to  have
    been able to claim the requisite 75 points (see paragraph 9).  The  law
    in relation to human rights was also set out (see paragraphs 14 to 16).
     The judge gave consideration to the Appellants setting up of companies
    through the British Education  Office  and  the  World  Plus  Ltd  (see
    paragraph 18), and noted that there had been a late submission  of  his
    tax return, for which the Appellant blamed their accountant.  The judge
    was not impressed by these excuses (see paragraph 19).

 4. The judge dismissed the appeal on the basis of two  essential  matters.
    First, he did not accept the criticism of the Respondent and  the  HMRC
    for only  asking  about  employment,  income  and  not  that  of  self-
    employment, because he took the view  that  the  following  proves  the
    latter, and that in any event, "the annual  tax  return  has  questions
    about both" (paragraph 26).  Second, he was not impressed by  the  fact
    that the income relied upon in the current  application  had  not  been
    disclosed to the HMRC at the date of the application as it should  have
    been (paragraph 27).  In taking all these  matters  into  account,  the
    judge said that the Appellant failed to comply with the wording of Rule
    322 and that there had been a false representation.

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the application of the  Appellant
    and his family for indefinite leave to remain as Tier 1 (Migrants)  was
    wrongly refused.  The judge erred in that he placed the burden of proof
    in relation to paragraph 322 on the Appellant when  it  ought  to  have
    been on the Respondent Secretary of State.  Further,  the  judge  could
    have dismissed the appeal on the basis that paragraph 245CD(b) was  not
    met.  However, he did not make an explicit  finding  in  this  respect.
    What the judge did was to simply say that the  Appellant,  Mr  Siddiqi,
    had not been able demonstrate the income claimed by  reference  to  the
    wording of paragraph 322 (but in this respect, the burden  lay  on  the
    Respondent rather than on the Appellant).  Finally, the judge  did  not
    give reasons for rejecting the  documentary  evidence  produced  by  Mr
    Siddiqi that he had indeed disclosed the foreign  income  in  his  2010
    application.  These were three reasons which made the  application  for
    permission arguable.

Submissions

 7. At the hearing before me on 2nd March 2015, Miss  Lowis,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, made the following  submissions.   First,  she
    emphasised that the Appellant had entered the UK on 24th June 2008 as a
    highly skilled migrant.  He had leave to remain until 26th March  2010.
    Before the expiry of his leave in February 2010 he made an  application
    for a Tier 1 (General) extension visa.  This was the 2010  application.
    The principal Appellant relied on earnings from work for  the  previous
    twelve months which exceeded �40,000.  The earnings were  derived  from
    income from two different sources in two different countries.   In  the
    UK the Appellant had World Plus Ltd.  In  Pakistan  he  had  a  British
    education of his (BEO).  The latter provided the bulk of his income  to
    the tune of over �35,000.  The Appellant supplied original payslips and
    he supplied an original bank statement.

 8. Second, the Appellant  could  qualify  under  paragraph  245CD  of  the
    Immigration Rules by showing that he stood to  be  awarded  45  points.
    These would be calculated by the award of 30 points for  the  principal
    Appellant's Bachelors degree together with 45 points for  his  previous
    earnings of �40,000.  He then stood to benefit from indefinite leave to
    remain.

 9. Third, the judgment focuses solely  on  paragraph  322  of  the  Rules.
    Judge Edwards wrongly  placed  the  onus  of  proof  on  the  principal
    Appellant to establish that he had made  false  representations.   This
    was contrary to the case law.

10. Fourth, the judge failed to give adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    documentary evidence in relation to the principal  Appellant's  income.
    At paragraph 25 of the judgment, the  judge  said  that,  "the  foreign
    income should have been identified clearly in the 2010 application  and
    was not".  However, Miss Lowis argued that the principal Appellant  had
    done precisely this.  In the principal Appellant's covering letter  and
    in the past  earnings  documentation  this  was  made  clear  as  these
    documents accompanied the 2010 application and were plainly before  the
    judge.  Accordingly, there had been an error of law.

11. For this part, Mr Whitwell submitted that the judge had not erred  with
    respect to placing the burden of  proof  on  the  Appellant.   This  is
    because the judge was plainly aware about the application of  paragraph
    245CD because he set it out in full at paragraph 9 of the determination
    at the outset.  It was only subsequently that he went on to  deal  with
    paragraph  322  on  the  basis  that  matters  had  not  been  properly
    represented by the Appellant.  At paragraph 24 the  judge  specifically
    then deals with the burden of proof.  At paragraph 27 the judge  states
    that the income relied on has not been disclosed to the HMRC.

12. After explaining that there had been less than full disclosure  to  the
    HMRC, the judge then states (at paragraph 28), that "taking  the  above
    matters together, I find that  it  has  not  been  established  to  the
    required standard that Mr Mubarik has had the income he claims to  have
    had".  The  judge  was  entitled  to  come  to  this  conclusion.   The
    Appellant did not, on what was a  points-based  application,  meet  the
    Rules at the date of the application.

13. Finally this left Article 8 of the ECHR.  Given that the judge did look
    at the documentary evidence (see paragraph  17),  and  given  that  the
    judge was of the view that matters had been above board from  the  HMRC
    (see paragraph 27), the judge was entitled to conclude that the balance
    of considerations did not fall in favour of the Appellant under Article
    8.

14. In reply Miss Lowis submitted that in his "Conclusions" the  judge  was
    not looking at paragraph 245CD(a) and (b).  He was looking at paragraph
    322.  He determined the appeal on the  basis  of  paragraph  322  only.
    Yet, the burden here lay on the Respondent.  It did not  lay  upon  the
    Appellant.

15. Second, paragraph 19 of Appendix A makes it clear  that  the  Appellant
    must provide at least two different documents,  and  the  Appellant  in
    this case had done exactly that, so  that  the  Appellant  did  succeed
    under paragraph 245CD(a) and (b).

16. Third, the judge did not make  clear  whether  findings  were  made  in
    relation to paragraph 245CD(a) and (b).  He relied solely on  paragraph
    322.  Yet, the effects of a reliance on paragraph  322  are  draconian.
    An Appellant who is subject to the  application  of  paragraph  322  is
    barred from re-entering the country for the next ten years.

Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

18. First, it is clear from Miss  Lowis'  admirably  clear,  succinct,  and
    measured submissions before me, that the Appellant did submit with  his
    2010 application a covering letter and a past earnings explanation.  In
    a  well  compiled  Skeleton  Argument,  Miss  Lowis  explains  how  the
    Appellant's documentary evidence included an explanatory letter sent by
    his new accountants, AS Accountants, explaining  the  reasons  for  the
    Appellant's late submission of tax returns (see pages 31 to 32  of  the
    Appellant's bundle).  In that letter, it is made clear that, in respect
    of the Appellant's 2009 to 2010 earnings, he had been  advised  by  his
    then tax advisor, Fradalit Associates, that his income from BEO did not
    need to be declared  in  the  UK  because,  under  HMRC  guidance,  the
    Appellant was considered to be resident, but not domiciled in  the  UK.
    The Appellant did not need to declare foreign income on  which  he  had
    already paid tax to the relevant  foreign  country.   When  in  January
    2014, the Appellant appointed AS Accountants as  his  new  accountants,
    they advised him that the Appellant was entitled to foreign tax  credit
    relief in respect of tax paid in Pakistan.  Even  so,  their  view  was
    that it was best for the Appellant to adopt a cautionary  approach  and
    to declare his income from BEO  voluntarily  to  the  HMRC.   This  the
    Appellant did do.   Quite  on  the  contrary,  therefore,  rather  than
    withhold  information,  the  Appellant  would  appear  to   have   been
    disclosing it in circumstances where he need not necessarily have  done
    so.

19. Second, and importantly in this respect, when the judge does  refer  to
    documentary  evidence,  it  is  clear  that  he  refers  only  to   the
    Respondent's written evidence, as is clear from  paragraph  17  of  the
    determination, which begins with the statement at "the  Respondent  had
    raised concerns that Mr Siddiqi has  not  shown  ...".   There  was  no
    reference here made to the Appellant's documentary evidence.  For these
    reasons, the determination is clearly flawed.

20. There is however, a third reason, which is no less important.  This  is
    the manner in which the burden of proof is placed upon  the  Appellant.
    Whereas Mr Whitwell is entirely correctly in saying that the judge does
    at the outset of the determination referred to paragraph  245CD(a)  and
    (b), the fact is  that  in  the  section  headed  "Conclusions",  which
    numbers five distinct paragraphs, from paragraph 24 onwards, the  judge
    is dealing only with paragraph 322.  This is clear  from  the  body  of
    this section which refers to the Appellant having withheld  information
    (see paragraphs 26 to 27), and ends with the  statement  (at  paragraph
    28) that, "having regard to the  wording  of  Rule  322,  such  is  not
    relevant, as a  consequence  the  appeals  must  fail".   There  is  no
    consideration in this section to paragraph 245CD(a) and (b).

21. As there is no consideration of this paragraph, the  statement  at  the
    beginning of this section, at paragraph 24, that "I remind myself  that
    the onus of proof in this case relates with the Appellants to the civil
    standard of a balance of probabilities", must be treated with a  degree
    of concern, because if the judge was considering  paragraph  322,  then
    the onus of proof lay on the Respondent, and not on the Appellant.

22. It was for the judge to determine that the Appellant  had  indeed  been
    guilty of deceit or wilful misrepresentation.  This is long established
    jurisprudence.  All the evidence seems to indicate that  the  Appellant
    acted otherwise.

23. Accordingly, the extent of the errors in this appeal are such  that,  I
    conclude that the Appellant has been denied of a fair hearing,  to  the
    extent that the matter must be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal
    to be determined by a judge other than  Judge  Edwards  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is  remitted
back to the First-tier Tribunal to be  determined  by  a  judge  other  than
Judge Edwards on a de novo basis.

No anonymity order is made.
