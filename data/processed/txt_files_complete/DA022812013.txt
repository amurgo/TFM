Representation:

For the Appellant:     -
For the Respondent:    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION and REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born in 1982.    He is  subject
    to a deportation order but he seeks to remain in this country on  human
    rights grounds.


 2. For reasons that are  not  entirely  clear  this  appeal  has  been  in
    Tribunal for over five years. The case history is as follows:


    6th November 2013  Respondent signs deportation order


    27th January 2014  Appeal lodged with First-tier Tribunal


    20th May 2015           First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray allows appeal,


                       purportedly to the limited extent that the Appellant
    be
                       granted discretionary leave until  care  proceedings
    in
                       respect of his son are resolved


    2nd June 2015           The Secretary of State applies  for  permission
    to appeal


    14th July 2015          Permission granted


    23rd September 2015     Upper Tribunal Judge Coker sets the decision of
    the First-
                        tier  Tribunal  aside  in  its  entirety,   finding
    fundamental
                       errors in the determination including (a) a  failure
    to apply
                       the relevant statutory framework  to  a  deportation
    (b) a
                       failure to make relevant findings (c) 'allowing' the
    appeal
                       on a basis not open to the Tribunal


    14th August 2017    Judge  Coker  makes  a  'request  for  information'
    pursuant
                       to the Protocol made between the  President  of  the
    Family
                       Division and the Senior President of Tribunals ('the
                       Protocol')


    30th November 2017 The matter  is  relisted  before  Judge  Coker.  The
    Appellant
                       does not  attend  because  he  is  back  in  prison,
    serving 30
                       months upon conviction for possession with intent to


                       supply Class A drugs. His  partner  Ms  KH  appears,
    along
                        with  two  supporting  witnesses,  who   each   give
      evidence.              Judge Coker adjourned the  proceedings  at  the
      request of
                       the Secretary of State, who was unaware that the
                       Appellant had fathered a second child, or that he was


                       now in a relationship with Ms KH.   The Secretary  of
      State
                       asked for time to consider that new evidence.


 3. As can be seen from this chronology there have been lengthy  delays  in
    the progress of this appeal; first in its initial  listing,  then  from
    September 2015 to the file being returned  to  Judge  Coker  in  August
    2017, and then between November 2017 and now. In  the  absence  of  any
    other explanation  it  may  be  that  these  delays  have  arisen  from
    administrative errors on the part of the Tribunal; if  that  is  so,  I
    apologise to the parties for that delay.


 4. The Appellant appeared before me in person, accompanied by his  partner
    KH. He explained that he has tried to get representation  in  the  past
    but he is unable to afford it. He did not see any  reasonable  prospect
    of being able to afford it in the future. In those circumstances  there
    was little option but to proceed with the hearing  with  the  Appellant
    being unrepresented. At the outset of the hearing I  explained  to  him
    the legal framework that I had to apply as follows:

              i) The Appellant has, he readily admits, committed a number of
                 serious  criminal  offences.  Between  2003  and  2013   he
                 committed 42 known offences in the United Kingdom resulting
                 in 21 convictions; these included  theft,  fraud,  offences
                 against the person, and in 2011 a conviction for possession
                 of a class A drug  with  intent  to  supply.  On  the  12th
                 September 2017 he received a  further  conviction  for  the
                 same offence.  The drug involved, on  both  occasions,  was
                 heroin.   In addition to this long history of offending the
                 Appellant has, again on his own admission, been  living  in
                 the United Kingdom illegally for some 20 years.  These  are
                 the reasons that the Secretary of  State  seeks  to  deport
                 him.


             ii) The law states that the deportation of the Appellant is  in
                 the 'public interest', ie it would be good for this country
                 if he is deported. He can only win this appeal  if  he  can
                 show that one of the 'exceptions' to that rule applies[1].


            iii) The Appellant has a partner, Ms KH. He has two children  in
                 the United Kingdom. His son by a former partner is  now  7.
                 I shall refer to this child as 'S'.  His daughter 'D', with
                 KH, is 2�.  His family is the  reason  that  the  Appellant
                 relies  on  in  his  appeal  to  show  that  there  is   an
                 'exception' in his case and that he should not be deported.
                 In order to show that the exception applies  the  Appellant
                 must show that it would be "unduly harsh" on his family  if
                 he were to be removed. As I explained at the hearing,  this
                 is a high test. It is not enough for the Appellant to show,
                 for instance, that his children would be  sad  if  he  were
                 deported, or that they would miss him. He  must  show  that
                 the consequences for them would be very severe, excessively
                 harsh or bleak.

             iv) If the Appellant cannot show that  this  exception  to  the
                 rule  applies,  he  must   demonstrate   that   there   are
                 exceptional circumstances that mean that his appeal  should
                 be allowed anyway. The  exceptional  circumstances  in  his
                 case might be that he has lived here a long time, has  lost
                 his ties  to  Pakistan,  and  the  fact  that  all  of  the
                 Appellant's criminal offending has arisen out of his  long-
                 term addiction to heroin.

 5. Once I had explained that legal framework I heard  oral  evidence  from
    the Appellant, whilst KH waited outside. Afterwards KH came  back  into
    court and gave evidence. Both witnesses  were  cross  examined  by  Mrs
    Aboni. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision,  which  I  now
    give.




    The Public Interest in Deportation


 6. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom, on his  own  evidence,  in
    approximately 1997.  There is no evidence of him having  had  leave  to
    enter, or to him having regularised his position  at  any  time,  until
    2013 when he claimed asylum in order to try and avoid deportation.


 7. The Appellant has, insofar as this Tribunal is  aware,  23  convictions
    relating to at least 43 offences.   The most serious of these  are  two
    convictions relating to the possession of drugs with intent to  supply.
    I have before me the sentencing remarks of Mrs Recorder  Kushner  dated
    the 2nd March 2011.   These show that on that date  the  Appellant  was
    sentenced to three periods of imprisonment for the supply  of  cannabis
    and diamorphine, to run  concurrently.  The  longest  sentence  was  12
    months.   This is what is called the 'index' offence. It is the  reason
    that  the  Home  Office  are  taking  deportation  action  against  the
    Appellant: where a sentence of at least 12 months is given, such action
    is automatic[2].

 8. The Appellant was notified of his liability to deportation on the  30th
    July 2013.  The Deportation Order was signed on the 6th November 2013.

 9. Since then he has continued to offend. At the hearing in November  2017
    KH attended and informed  Judge  Coker  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    convicted on the 12th September 2017 of two counts of  possession  with
    intent to supply Class A drugs. Although  Mrs  Aboni  had  no  evidence
    relating to the further conviction the Appellant himself confirmed that
    to be the case. He said that  he  had  been  sentenced  to  30  months'
    imprisonment.

10. Having had regard to the evidence I am satisfied that the Appellant  is
    liable to deportation. He is not British. He has committed a long  list
    of criminal offences at least two of which have resulted in a  sentence
    of 12 months or more being handed down. He is a  foreign  criminal  and
    the provisions at s32  of  the  Borders  Act  2007  must  therefore  be
    applied.



    The Human Rights Exceptions


11. As I note above, the Appellant has lived in this country a  long  time.
    He was a teenager when he  arrived.  The  papers  before  me  variously
    indicate that he may have been 14, 15 or 16 years old  on  arrival:   I
    note that the probation service refer to  him  having  dropped  out  of
    school at 14 because he was bored and as a result took no  GCSEs.    He
    has therefore lived here for more than half of his life, since today he
    is 36.  It seems that he  may  have  entered  as  a  visitor  and  then
    overstayed.   He states that he was sent here to live with  his  uncle.
    Having heard the Appellant's oral evidence I accept that he has, in his
    own mind, integrated into  this  country.  He  speaks  barely  accented
    English and I have no doubt that he regards this country as  his  home.
    He has however not had leave for most, if any, of the time that he  has
    spent here. In those circumstances he cannot succeed in showing that he
    should be allowed to remain on 'private life' grounds[3].


12. I consider first the Appellant's relationship with his partner, KH.   I
    have no doubt at all  that  this  is  a  qualifying  relationship.  The
    Appellant spoke of KH with genuine love, affection and  admiration.  He
    told me that KH is a "brilliant mum" and that she has been a  rock  for
    him.   Even before they  had  their  daughter  together  she  ended  up
    looking after his son from his earlier relationship, because the  boy's
    own mother was a heroin addict who wasn't able to cope. The  boy  S  is
    now in care and KH has made sure that he has  maintained  contact  with
    her daughter, D. She has regularly travelled to ensure that D and S can
    spend time together. She is committed  to  the  Appellant  and  to  his
    family.  KH herself has never  used  drugs  and  in  his  evidence  the
    Appellant made clear that he understands how much she has had to put up
    with, being with him.


13. The evidence about exactly how long KH  and  the  Appellant  have  been
    together was not entirely clear. I accept that  such  discrepancies  in
    the evidence can easily arise from the  passage  of  time  and  clouded
    memories. What is clear is that they have been together for at least  4
    years. Their daughter D was born in August 2016.  The Appellant and  KH
    lived together when KH was pregnant with D and until he was  sent  back
    to prison in September 2017. He was released in December  2018  and  he
    has lived with them since.

14. I have considered carefully the  impact  upon  KH  of  the  Appellant's
    deportation. I have no doubt that she loves  him  and  that  she  wants
    nothing more than for the two  of  them  to  bring  their  daughter  up
    together in a stable family unit.  I accept that he in turn  loves  her
    and is committed to her. The immediate consequence of  the  Appellant's
    deportation for KH is that she will be left to bring up D on  her  own.
    Being a single parent is challenging, no matter how  capable  a  parent
    you are. I note however the evidence of KH that her own mother supports
    her (she in fact attended the hearing in order to look after  D  whilst
    KH and the Appellant were in the hearing  room)  so  she  will  not  be
    entirely without assistance.  KH has already demonstrated her  strength
    of character in that she has coped whilst the Appellant was  on  prison
    and despite the difficult  circumstances  she  finds  herself  in,  has
    satisfied social services that she is a good parent.   I am accordingly
    satisfied that although the Appellant's deportation will in  the  short
    term be difficult and upsetting for KH, it cannot be said to be "unduly
    harsh".  Her future without the Appellant will not be "bleak".

15. I now turn to assess the position of the Appellant's children: his  son
    S who is 7, and his daughter D who is 2�.

16. The Appellant told me that when his son S was born he and  the  child's
    mother were together.  They were both using heroin at the time.  Social
    services were therefore involved from the outset:  he  was  taken  away
    from them almost as soon as he was born.  He was taken into  care,  but
    the Appellant and his then partner got  to  see  him  every  day  at  a
    contact centre.  After approximately one year S was allowed to come and
    live at home.  S's mother got some help and managed for a time to  stop
    using heroin.  The Appellant also entered rehabilitation at that  time,
    but as he puts it: "to be honest, it didn't work".

17. The Appellant's account of S's life thereafter was  somewhat  confused.
    The Appellant was in and out of prison for much of the child's life and
    was continuing to use drugs. A lot of the time he did not know what S's
    mother was doing. At one point, when S was a toddler, she showed up  at
    KH's door and asked her if she would look after him. KH agreed and  S's
    mother disappeared for about 6 months. KH looked after him  that  whole
    time even though he wasn't hers.   It was during a period of  detention
    that the Appellant discovered that S had been taken into care, and that
    the boy's mother is no longer "on the scene". As far as  the  Appellant
    is aware, S has not seen his  mother  since  2015  when  he  was  taken
    permanently into care.

18. The Appellant told me that in the periods that he has been free he  has
    made an effort to regularly see his son.  Even when he  was  living  in
    Plymouth and the child was with foster carers in  Leicester,  he  would
    travel every week to see him in a contact centre.  He has  not  however
    seen the boy since the end of 2017 when he was sent back to  jail.   He
    did not want his son to see him in prison.  He has not been allowed  to
    see him since his release, but he is currently being  assessed  and  is
    hopeful that contact  could  resume.   During  the  whole  period,  the
    Appellant has however spoken to S every week by telephone.   S has been
    with the same foster family since the end of 2015.  They live a  couple
    of miles away from where the Appellant and  KH  are  currently  living.
    The Appellant described S's foster mother as "a very nice  woman".   He
    said that S is very fond of her and that she treats him well.

19. In his live evidence the Appellant was realistic about the prospects of
    his son ever coming back to live with him.  He  acknowledged  that  the
    boy's current foster carers, whom the Appellant knows and  trusts,  are
    his parents now, and that it would be in his best interests  to  remain
    with them. That is not to say that  the  Appellant  has  abandoned  his
    relationship with his son.  He loves him very much and would like to go
    back to seeing him once a week.  The Appellant was also realistic about
    the extent to which S might be affected by his own  deportation.  Asked
    to comment on that he said: "I can't say - he knows I am his dad and he
    calls me, but I couldn't say how he would be affected".

20. I have no doubt that in the time that the Appellant has spent with  his
    son he has shown him love and kindness and that it would be sad  for  S
    if he did not get to see his father any more.   I am unable to take the
    evidence any further than that.  Social services have  determined  that
    the child's best interests  lie  in  his  permanent  foster  placement.
    Although the Appellant has  enjoyed  direct,  and  latterly  telephone,
    contact with his son it is clear that the boy will never live with  him
    again.  For the past 15 months, contact has been limited  to  a  weekly
    telephone call.  Mrs Aboni points out that this  could  continue  post-
    deportation.   There is no evidence before me to indicate that it would
    be unduly harsh on S if his father were to be deported.

21. The Appellant's little girl D was born  in  September  2015.   She  had
    lived with her mother KH since she was born.  At the time of her  birth
    the Appellant was also living in the family home up until the point  he
    was sent back to prison in September 2017.   She  therefore  spent  the
    first 13 months of her life living with her father and mother together.
     KH described the Appellant as  a  great  dad.   She  said  that  D  is
    extremely close  to  him.   Both  witnesses  confirmed  that  they  are
    currently being assessed by social services.  Both stressed  that  this
    is because  of  the  Appellant's  history  of  drug  use  and  criminal
    behaviour.  I accept that to be the case.  There is no indication  that
    KH herself has ever done anything which would warrant  social  services
    involvement in her family.  As  the  Appellant  admits,  their  current
    interest in D is purely because of his return to the family home.

22. Having heard the evidence of KH, I accept that when  the  Appellant  is
    with his daughter, he is a good father.  He enjoys playing with her and
    helps KH to look after her. I accept  the  Appellant's  point  that  it
    would be good for her to have a stable father figure as she  grows  up.
    I accept that as long as he is not using drugs, it is  in  the  child's
    best interests to have him in her life.  The reality is, however,  that
    this little girl has spent much  of  her  young  life  apart  from  her
    father.  He was sent to prison when she was  only  13  months  old  and
    remained there for over a year.  Although KH did take the child to  see
    the Appellant in prison, this was only at the  very  beginning  of  his
    sentence. After this he was moved to jail in Doncaster and it  was  too
    far for them to travel.  Also, he did not want her to see him in  jail.
    At the date of the hearing before me the Appellant has only  been  back
    in the family home a bare three months.   In those circumstances, I  am
    unable to find that it would be unduly harsh to expect D to  remain  in
    this country with her mother KH as her primary carer.   KH has been the
    child's constant.  She clearly provides well for her, and I accept  the
    Appellant's assessment that she is a "brilliant mum".


23. That KH has her daughter's best interests at heart  is  illustrated  by
    the efforts that  she  has  gone  to  to  ensure  that  D  maintains  a
    relationship with her brother S.  Once a fortnight KH takes D to  visit
    S and they play together in a soft play or Sure Start centre.  KH  told
    me that both children look forward to these trips and  that  they  love
    seeing each other.  She  also  told  me  that  she  would  continue  to
    facilitate these visits even if the Appellant were to be removed.

24. I am well aware that the Appellant's  deportation  is  very  likely  to
    result in a permanent interference with his relationships with both  of
    his children.  It is in my view very unlikely that  either  child  will
    ever come to visit him in Pakistan.  S is subject to a care order and I
    cannot see the circumstances in which social services  would  permit  a
    contact visit abroad. As for D, it is hard to see how KH  could  manage
    to make that journey.  She is dependent on benefits, and as she put  it
    herself, she would never be able to afford it.  If the Appellant is  to
    maintain a relationship with either his son or daughter that would have
    to be by telephone.  I accept that this is not ideal,  but  to  put  it
    bluntly, this is the consequence of the Appellant's criminal offending.
     D will in the short term miss her father, but there is nothing  before
    me to suggest that she would suffer any  significant  detriment  if  he
    were not to live with her in the long term.

25. Having considered all of this evidence I find that  the  Appellant  has
    not discharged the burden of proof to show that  it  would  be  "unduly
    harsh" for KH, or either of his children, if he were to be deported.





    Exceptional Factors


26. Extraordinary as it may be to some readers, given the matters  set  out
    above at [�6 to �10], I found the Appellant to be a  deeply  impressive
    witness.   He spoke with sincerity and great sadness about the path his
    life has taken. Sent to the United Kingdom as a  teenager  he  fell  in
    with the 'wrong crowd'. He started using drugs and drank heavily.   One
    thing led to another  and  before  he  knew  it  he  was  leading  what
    professionals in the field call a "chaotic lifestyle". He  was  by  his
    own estimation addicted to Class  A  drugs  for  well  over  10  years.
    Having had an opportunity to hear the  Appellant's  candid  and  moving
    evidence I have no reason to doubt that he greatly regrets taking  that
    path. It has cost him his health, liberty and relationships with family
    members. I accept that  the  Appellant  is  truly  remorseful  for  the
    criminal offences he has committed.


27. The Appellant's own evidence is supported by the  report  by  Leicester
    and Rutland Probation Service dated 31st July 2013, which sets out some
    of the history and context of the Appellant's offending. I need not set
    out all of the detail of that evidence here save to note that most,  if
    not all, relates to his drug use. He has a number  of  convictions  for
    theft, driven by his need to buy drugs.  He has a number of convictions
    for assaults and motoring convictions, all of which arose when  he  was
    under the influence of drugs.  He  has  a  number  of  convictions  for
    failure to comply with other sentences, failings arising from the  fact
    that he continued to use drugs.    He  also  has  convictions  for  the
    supply of both Class A and Class B narcotics, offences motivated by the
    Appellant's need to fund his habit.  The Appellant  has,  according  to
    the probation service, been a  long-term  habitual  user  of  cannabis,
    cocaine and heroin.  The report states that he started  using  Class  A
    drugs as a teenager, and that he became addicted to heroin after  being
    offered it in prison in approximately 2006.  The Appellant told me that
    it is the heroin that has been his downfall.


28. In his oral evidence the Appellant told me that he has not  used  drugs
    since he was sent to prison at in September  2017.   Staying  clean  is
    part of his licence conditions.  Since his release in December 2018  he
    has been tested for drugs twice and both tests were negative.  Although
    I have no independent evidence of that I am  prepared  to  accept  that
    this is the case. I  accept  that  the  Appellant  deeply  regrets  his
    involvement with drugs and that he would like very much to stay out  of
    prison.


29. I accept, and have given weight to, the fact that the Appellant has not
    lived in Pakistan since he was a young teenager.  The Appellant told me
    that his mother and father still live in the family home in Rawalpindi.
     Over the years he has had intermittent contact with them.  I note that
    the Appellant told  the  Home  Office,  in  response  to  the  proposed
    deportation action, that his family in Pakistan were unhappy about some
    of the choices he had  made.   Obviously  they  were  upset  about  his
    convictions  and  they  did  not  like  the  fact  that  he   had   had
    relationships with British women.  There  is  however  no  evidence  to
    suggest that they would not assist him  and  support  him  were  he  to
    return to their home.

30. I give full weight to the fact that addiction is an illness,  and  that
    heroin in particular is a cruel master.   I take into account the  fact
    that the Appellant started using Class A drugs as a teenager  and  that
    he may have been  particularly  vulnerable,  finding  himself  in  this
    country and dislocated from his family. I have a great deal of sympathy
    for the Appellant, and I note from her sentencing remarks that this was
    sympathy shared by Recorder Kushner  who  considered  imposing  only  a
    community penalty for the supply of Class A drugs because she  believed
    that the Appellant needed help.  That sympathy, and the fact  that  the
    Appellant does certainly need help staying  clean,  unfortunately  only
    get him so far.   The fact remains that the Appellant has been an adult
    for his entire criminal career. He  has  repeatedly  offended  and  has
    shown a blatant disregard not just for the law, but for the victims  of
    his crimes. Being burgled, for instance, is  a  distressing  and  nasty
    experience.  I must also take into account that the  Appellant  himself
    became involved in the supply of Class A drugs to others, thus fuelling
    criminality in the community and contributing to the  misery  of  those
    other addicts.

31. Although there are certainly compelling features of this case I  regret
    to say that they fall  well  short  of  the  exceptional  matters  that
    parliament had  in  mind  in  enacting  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   I cannot be satisfied that there are
    very compelling circumstances  over  and  above  the  impact  upon  the
    Appellant's family and for that reason I must dismiss the appeal.
