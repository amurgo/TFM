                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant by letter dated  24th  August  2015  requested  leave  to
    withdraw her appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which had dismissed her appeal in a determination promulgated  on  27th
    January 2015.  She was granted permission to appeal  that  decision  on
    18th March 2015.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having considered the request by the appellant I give consent  to
    her to withdraw her case.

 3. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
