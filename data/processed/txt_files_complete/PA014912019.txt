For the Appellant:     Mr Spurling, Counsel instructed by Barnes Harrild
                    and Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Iran born in 2001.  He arrived in  the
       United Kingdom on the 17th June 2017 when he was fifteen  years  old.
       He was in the company of his elder brother P who was then seventeen.

    2. Both boys claimed asylum on arrival. The substance  of  their  linked
       claims was that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in  Iran
       for reasons of their imputed political opinion. They  claim  to  have
       been acting as smugglers on the Iran-Iraq border, and to have come to
       the attention of the Iranian government, who  believe  them  to  have
       been  involved  in  transporting  banned  opposition  materials.  The
       Secretary of State accepted as credible the assertion that  the  boys
       were smugglers, but rejected the claim that they  faced  persecution.
       They were refused protection on the 31st January 2019.

    3. Both boys appealed.  Their linked cases came  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal (Judge Rai) on the 18th March 2019 when both  brothers  gave
       evidence. Over three months later, on the 27th June 2019, the  First-
       tier Tribunal promulgated a determination allowing the appeal of  the
       Appellant's brother P, but dismissing his case.   The  Appellant  now
       has permission to appeal against that decision, granted by First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Page on the 30th July 2019.

    4. Before I  turn  to  the  issues  in  the  appeal  before  me,  it  is
       appropriate that I mark the reasons the First-tier Tribunal gave  for
       allowing the appeal of P. Under the heading 'sur place activity'  the
       Tribunal records and accepts the evidence that since his  arrival  in
       the United Kingdom P has created a Facebook page onto  which  he  has
       posted "very bad things about the Iranian government'.  He  has  also
       participated  in   protests   against   the   regime,   including   a
       demonstration calling for more rights for women in Iran. Applying the
       guidance and findings in AB and Others (internet activity - state  of
       evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 257 (IAC), BA (demonstrators in Britain  -
       risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) and HB (Kurds)  Iran  CG
       [2018] UKUT 430 (IAC) the Tribunal accepted that applying  the  lower
       standard of proof, it is reasonably likely that upon return to Iran P
       faced a real risk of serious harm arising from his activities in  the
       United Kingdom.

    5. In respect of the historical claim, if I may put it  like  that,  the
       Judge made several findings in favour of the  brothers.  It  accepted
       that the boys had been  smugglers  on  the  Iran/Iraq  border  [�22].
       They were regularly shot at by officers of the Pasdaran  [�23].  This
       was terrifying but they continued the work  because  they  needed  to
       support their family.   The parties  are  in  agreement  about  these
       findings. I note in passing  that  although  not  referred  to,  this
       aspect of the Appellants'  case  was  entirely  consistent  with  the
       country  background  material.   See   for   instance   the   Special
       Rapporteur's report cited at paragraph 30 of HB:

           "80.  The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the
                alleged indiscriminate and blind use of lethal force towards
                Kurdish kulbaran (back carriers), which may be related to
                their ethnic affiliation. The kulbaran are Kurdish couriers
                who engage in smuggling commodities across the border. Due
                to the high rate of unemployment in Kurdistan provinces,
                this activity is generally the only way for them to provide
                for themselves and their family. In 2016, Iranian border
                security forces reportedly killed 51 kulbaran and injured 71
                others, which is about twice as much as the previous year."

    6. The parties diverge however, on the extent of the  positive  findings
       made thereafter. Mr Spurling submits that  the  Tribunal  accepted  a
       good deal more than that, specifically that the boys were followed by
       a stranger home to their village, and that the Pasdaran came  to  the
       family home. Mr Jarvis submits that in fact  the  findings  on  these
       matters are adverse to the brothers. I return to that dispute  below.
       In any event the Tribunal was not, in the final  analysis,  satisfied
       that either boy would be at risk in Iran today  because  of  anything
       they did or were suspected to have done as smugglers.  The appeal was
       dismissed on these 'historical' grounds.

    7. The Appellant now appeals on the grounds that in  so  concluding  the
       First-tier Tribunal erred in law in the following material respects:

             i) It Made Errors of Fact

                The determination records that neither brother was  actually
                involved in the smuggling of banned materials at �22:  "they
                were asked to carry propaganda material such  as  newspapers
                but always refused". The Appellant submits that this  is  an
                error of fact, since it is his account that he did  in  fact
                smuggle newspapers, albeit in ignorance of  their  contents.
                This is said to be material because  it  was  the  brothers'
                total lack of involvement which led the Tribunal  to  reject
                the claim of adverse attention from the security services as
                implausible.

            ii) Impermissibly high standard of proof

                The Tribunal accepted much of the  Appellants'  account  but
                not that they were wanted for smuggling propaganda  or  that
                they might come to the  adverse  attention  of  the  Iranian
                authorities today. It is submitted that it  was  perverse/an
                imposition of too high a standard of proof to conclude  that
                there was no risk to the Appellant.

           iii) Delay

                There was a three month delay in the  promulgation  of  this
                decision. The Appellant submits that this delay renders  the
                decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  unsafe:  reliance  is
                placed on the decision  in  Mario  (1998)  Imm  AR  281  and
                Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  RK  (Algeria)
                [2007] EWCA Civ 868.




       Discussion and Findings

    8. I am grateful for  the  realistic  and  helpful  way  in  which  both
       advocates approached their submissions.  Although not in  concert  on
       everything, they were in agreement about two matters. First, that  it
       was probably an error of law for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  have
       failed to weigh in its final reckoning on D  the  fact  that  it  had
       recognised P to have protection needs. Given what we know  about  the
       returns process in Iran, and the fact that these  boys  are  Kurdish,
       applying the 'hair-trigger' analysis in HB (Kurds), it was  no  doubt
       relevant to the risk assessment for this Appellant that  his  brother
       had been found to be posting "very  bad  things"  about  the  Iranian
       government online. Second, the parties agreed that my assessment must
       be a global one, since each of the grounds in effect depended on  the
       other.

    9. Those preliminary observations aside, I turn  to  the  decision.  The
       passages that are in issue are between �24 and �34. Mr Jarvis submits
       that the Tribunal here rejected the crucial elements of the  account.
       Mr Spurling submits that they were accepted. I find the truth of  the
       matter is somewhere in the middle.

   10. It is correct to say that paragraph 24 starts  with  the  proposition
       "the first appellant claims" (my emphasis), and that nowhere  in  the
       passages that follow do we find an unequivocal  finding  such  as  "I
       accept that the appellants were followed". Mr Jarvis  is  correct  to
       say  that  the  Tribunal  does  identify  what  it  perceives  to  be
       discrepancies in the account, for  instance  at  paragraph  28.  That
       said, I am unable to find any clear finding that the Appellants  were
       not followed, or that the Pasdaran did not  visit  the  family  home.
       What the Tribunal instead finds is that it rejects the interpretation
       given to those events by the Appellants:

           [at �31]  "they  have  given  a  credible  account  about  being
           smugglers However the implausibility in their account comes from
           the lack of a connection between their activities and  the  last
           shooting incident"

   11. It goes on at �32:

           "The first appellant has assumed that because  there  are  other
           people who do smuggle propaganda newspapers that he  might  have
           been suspected of that. He has never been stopped or searched by
           the authorities or even questioned about what he  is  smuggling.
           His name and details were never known to the authorities. At its
           highest, the first appellant has assumed because the man walking
           behind them was unknown to them that he must have  been  a  spy.
           None of them were stopped or even spoken to on  that  occasions,
           nor did the man proceed to search  their  house.  The  appellant
           said there were 6 of them and 1 of him and he  may  simply  have
           been gathering information so that they could  be  arrested  the
           following day. The following day there was no attempt to  arrest
           them, but they were shot at. Something which the appellant  says
           happens regularly in his statement. Without more than this  mere
           assertion, I cannot accept this even on the  lower  standard  of
           proof as evidence for the reason that  they  were  targeted  the
           following day"

   12. It will be observed that far from rejecting the  facts  as  asserted,
       it is implicit in this reasoning, in particular in the words  that  I
       have highlighted, that  the  Tribunal  appears  to  accept  that  the
       brothers were targeted the day after they observed  a  man  following
       them.

   13. The Tribunal goes on  at  �34  to  consider  the  evidence  that  the
       Pasdaran thereafter visited the family home. On  the  Tribunal's  own
       analysis this was of some importance, since the  incidents  in  which
       the brothers were shot  at  are  dismissed  as  occupational  hazard,
       rather than targeted persecution. It says this:

           "In relation to the  document  purported  to  be  given  to  the
           maternal uncle by the Iranian guards, the  first  appellant  [P]
           stated he did not see this document as he  had  fled  to  Amir's
           house. He was only told of the  contents  by  his  brother.  The
           second appellant [the Appellant  here]  also  did  not  see  the
           document being given to his maternal uncle, despite being in the
           house at the time they came. The document itself, nor is a  copy
           before me but the second appellant  stated  it  was  written  in
           Farsi and required his uncle to read it. He said in his  witness
           statement that he was not sure whether it was a  summons  or  an
           arrest warrant but in interview he said that it  was  an  arrest
           paper asking us to attend court. In cross examination the second
           appellant said that the document was an arrest warrant  for  the
           smuggling of goods, cigarettes alcohol and newspapers.  This  is
           inconsistent with the evidence of the first appellant  who  said
           in his witness statement that his uncle told him what the  paper
           said and that the authorities wanted to arrest him and  put  him
           in prison.  Given  these  inconsistencies  and  there  being  no
           evidence  they  were   identified,   I   do   not   accept   the
           uncorroborated evidence that there was an arrest  warrant  which
           if the appellants  were  told  about,  came  solely  from  their
           maternal uncle".

   14. Two points can be drawn from this passage. The first is that  neither
       of the young appellants before the First-tier Tribunal had the  first
       clue what was in the document given to their uncle by the Pasdaran. I
       interpolate that this is not at all surprising given their ages, lack
       of education or experience of the legal justice  system,  nor  indeed
       the fact that neither actually saw the document  itself.      Second,
       what the Tribunal does not do, in my view, is reject  the  contention
       that the Pasdaran did in fact visit the family home. Had it  rejected
       that evidence - in particular that of the  Appellant  before  me  who
       claimed to have been hiding in the house at the time - I  would  have
       expected that to be clearly articulated in the determination.

   15. My reading of the decision is that the First-tier Tribunal accepted -
       albeit it implicitly  -  that  the  Appellants  were  followed  by  a
       stranger to their remote mountain village and that the following  day
       they were shot at and the Pasdaran visited the  family  home  looking
       for them.

   16. That being so, what led the Tribunal to conclude that  they  had  not
       come to the adverse attention of the Iranian authorities as  claimed?
       The key reasoning, submits Mr  Spurling,  is  found  at  �31  of  the
       decision:

           "the implausibility in their account comes from the  lack  of  a
           connection  between  their  activities  and  the  last  shooting
           incident"

       And it is here that ground (i) becomes  relevant.  Whilst  his  elder
       brother P had denied  ever  knowingly  smuggling  Kurdish  separatist
       material, the Appellant's evidence had  been  that  he  had  in  fact
       carried newspapers, which he suspected to  be  political  in  nature:
       paragraph 3 of his witness statement dated 7th March 2019 refers.   I
       am satisfied that in its summary of the case at its  �22  the  First-
       tier Tribunal overlooked this evidence.     I  am  further  satisfied
       that given the  generally  positive  credibility  findings,  and  the
       country  background  evidence  indicating  that  Kurdish   propaganda
       materials are indeed smuggled into Iran from  Iraq,  it  is  evidence
       which should be accepted, applying the lower standard of proof.

   17. This then is what we are  left  with.  The  Appellant  is  a  Kurdish
       teenager who earned a living in Iran  by  carrying  contraband  goods
       over the  border  from  Iraq.  These  included  newspapers  which  he
       suspects were political in nature. From time to time he was  shot  at
       by Iranian security officials. In the Spring of 2017 this routine was
       interrupted by an incident in which the brothers - and other smuggler
       friends - observed a man that they did not know following them  along
       a path into their village.   The following day they were ambushed and
       shot at. The Appellant ran into the woods and hid before  making  his
       way back to his house. Once home  his  mother  observed  a  group  of
       Pasdaran approaching; she made the Appellant hide  whilst  his  uncle
       spoke with them.   The Appellant's uncle advised him and his  brother
       that the Pasdaran had left  some  official  documentation  indicating
       that they were wanted for questioning. The family  advised  the  boys
       that  they  should  leave  Iran  rather  than   answering   to   that
       summons/court document. The Appellant and his brother left  the  area
       and made their way to the United Kingdom. The Appellant's brother has
       since been found to have international protection  needs  because  of
       the political material that he has posted online.

   18. All of that was accepted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  although  it
       should be noted it was not satisfied that the Pasdaran  did  in  fact
       leave a document of some description. Even  if  it  could  be  safely
       assumed that the Appellant's uncle was deceiving  him  -  perhaps  to
       convey the urgency of the situation - the Appellant is still a  Kurd,
       who has smuggled banned political propaganda, and who  has  attracted
       the adverse attention of the security services. This is where  ground
       (ii) becomes relevant. Mr Spurling submitted that  those  bare  facts
       would be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof in  establishing
       a real risk of harm, and it was perverse for the First-tier  Tribunal
       to conclude otherwise.  Applying the guidance in HB and SSH  I  would
       have to agree, particularly when the fact that P is now deemed to  be
       at risk is factored in.

   19. It follows that I need not address ground (iii) which in fairness  Mr
       Spurling did not pursue before me.




       Decisions

   20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law  and
       it is set aside.

   21.  The decision in the appeal is remade  as  follows:  "the  appeal  is
       allowed on protection grounds".

   22. There is an order for anonymity.
