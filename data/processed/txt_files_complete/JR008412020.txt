                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -




    JUDGE PERKINS: The applicant seeks judicial review of the  respondent's
    decision on 25 November 2019, served on 2 December 2019,  upholding  on
    administration review a decision of the respondent on 18 September 2019
    refusing him entry clearance as an entrepreneur.


 2. He was given permission following  an  orally  renewed  application  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam who said:

         "While the applicant overstates the significance of  the  grant  of
         leave to his business partner and that the business was trading, it
         is arguable that the reasons given by the respondent  for  refusing
         the  application  are  irrational  in  the  light  of  the  further
         submissions made and the totality of the evidence".


 3. Judge McWilliam issued standard directions which provided, inter  alia,
    that the respondent served any Detailed Grounds of  Defence  within  35
    days of the directions being sent.  They were sent on 5 August 2020 and
    so any Detailed  Grounds  should  have  been  served  by  (I  think)  9
    September 2020.  Somewhat later, on 12 May 2021,  the  respondent  sent
    draft Detailed Grounds and applied for the time to be extended to admit
    the draft as the Detailed Grounds.  The chronology is a little obscure.
     The draft grounds are dated 17 May 2021.  The application is dated  12
    May 2021 and a covering letter is dated 20 May 2021.

 4. On 21 May 2021 I received from the applicant's Counsel,  Mr  Hawkin,  a
    "Detailed Response to Respondent's Grounds of Defence".  He opposed the
    application and I had to decide at the start  of  the  hearing  if  the
    respondent should be entitled to rely on the draft Detailed Grounds and
    if so on what terms.

 5. I ruled in favour of the respondent and gave orally my reasons  that  I
    substantially repeat below.

 6. I say immediately that this is not a  case  of  the  respondent  losing
    interest and then waking up  at  the  last  minute.   There  have  been
    discussions  between  the  parties  to  agree  an  outcome   in   these
    proceedings and I understand the respondent not rushing to spend  money
    on something that may not be needed.

 7. The respondent's covering letter  reminds  me,  appropriately,  of  the
    decisions in Mitchell v News Group Newspapers Limited [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    1537 and Denton v T H  White  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  906.   The  respondent
    distils  a  threefold  test  from  these,  asserting  that   I   should
    investigate first the seriousness and significance of the  default  and
    then, second, the reasons for the delay and then, third,  evaluate  all
    of the circumstances to deal justly with  the  application.   My  first
    concern is how the applicant is  disadvantaged  unfairly  if  I  extend
    time.

 8. In his Response, Mr Hawkin refers to correspondence from the respondent
    and the Tribunal dated 6 October 2020 where the respondent says "Should
    this matter proceed to a hearing  the  respondent  would  rely  on  the
    position as set out in the consent  order  sent  to  the  applicant  on
    20.4.2020" and said "In the event  the  applicant  does  not  agree  to
    settle, that the matter is struck out on  the  basis  of  the  attached
    consent order".  That "order" is, of course, a draft consent order;  no
    agreement was reached.

 9. The material part of the  draft  order  states:  "UPON  THE  RESPONDENT
    agreeing to reconsider the decision dated 25 November 2019  within  six
    weeks of this order being sealed, absent  special  circumstances  ...".
    The indication that the respondent would rely  "on  the  basis  of  the
    attached consent order" cannot be taken literally to mean only on  that
    order.  The respondent has not admitted any error.  She has  agreed  to
    reconsider but that is not any kind of admission of fault.  The  letter
    must mean that the respondent will seek to rely in part on the terms of
    the consent order not only  on  its  terms.   I  find  nothing  in  the
    Detailed Grounds that are at odds with the summary grounds.

10. In short, the Detailed Grounds set out better and clearly  points  that
    the applicant could anticipated and the applicant  has  had  sufficient
    time to consider them. Mr Hawkin failed to persuade me that  there  was
    any unfairness to the applicant in permitting the respondent to rely on
    the draft Detailed Grounds and I extended time to  admit  the  Detailed
    Grounds of defence.  There was no application for an adjournment.

11. There are some unusual features  in  this  case.   First  is  that  the
    decision before me was made on an application dated as long  ago  as  1
    February  2017.   The  application   was   refused.    There   was   an
    administrative review upholding that  decision.   Following  persistent
    further applications, including applications for  judicial  review,  by
    the applicant's solicitors there have been three further decisions each
    upheld on administrative review making a total of eight in all.  Whilst
    this is not wrong in  principle  and  none  of  the  applications  have
    involved excessive delay, it really is time that this  application  was
    determined one way or another.

12. Mr Hawkin constructed his case carefully through pleadings and skeleton
    arguments which I have  considered.   I  mean  them  no  disrespect  by
    summarising them as follows.  The applicant is a citizen of India  born
    in 1960.  He has worked as a banker and retired early.   He  claims  to
    have formed a plan to run a beauty parlour in the United Kingdom with a
    business partner, a Miss Seema Manchanda, who has relevant business and
    practical experience.  In outline,  it  was  their  intention  to  each
    invest the sum of �100,000 into the enterprise.  They formed a  limited
    company to facilitate that plan in which they were each held 50% of the
    shares and they produced  a  business  plan  and  similar  confirmatory
    documents.  The  applicant's  application  was  refused  and  has  been
    refused in its renewed forms.  A similar application  by  the  business
    partner succeeded and indeed the business has been established.

13. Mr Hawkin's submission, in outline, is that not only does the  decision
    seem unfair from a lay perspective but, more importantly, it  is  wrong
    in law when all the circumstances are considered.  In  particular,  the
    last refusal was in the face of accepted evidence that the business had
    been established and was succeeding.

14. Again in summary outline it was Mr Seirfert's position that  there  was
    no public law error, there was merely a  decision  that  the  applicant
    does not like.

15. I remind myself that I am not required to make a decision on the merits
    of the application for leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  and  how  I
    might  have  decided  such  an  application  is  of  little,  if   any,
    importance. I have to decide if the Secretary of State's  decision  was
    irrational or unlawful in any other way as the applicant contends  that
    it is.

16. The Immigration Rules have changed but  the  parties  agreed  that  the
    relevant Rules are set out in the application.  The Rules made  various
    requirements that the applicant has met and other requirements that the
    respondent says are not satisfied.

17. Paragraph 245DB(f) provides:

         "(f)     Where the applicant is being assessed  under  Table  4  of
             Appendix A, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  must  be  satisfied
             that:


             (i) the applicant genuinely intends and is able to  establish,
                    take over or become a director of one or more businesses
                    in the UK within the next six months;


             (ii)      the applicant genuinely intends to invest the  money
                    referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in the business  or
                    businesses referred to in (i);


             (iii)that the money referred to in Table 4 of  Appendix  A  is
                    genuinely available to the applicant,  and  will  remain
                    available to him until such time as it is spent for  the
                    purposes of his business or businesses;


             (iv)      if the applicant is relying on one or more  previous
                    investments  to  score  points,  they   have   genuinely
                    invested all or part of the investment funds required in
                    Table  4  of  Appendix  A  into  one  or  more   genuine
                    businesses in the UK;


             (v) that the applicant does not intend to take  employment  in
                    the  United  Kingdom  other  than  under  the  terms  of
                    paragraph 245DC".


18. The Immigration Rules at 245DB(h) provide:

         "(h)     In making the  assessment  in  (f),  the  Entry  Clearance
             Officer will assess the balance of  probabilities.  The  Entry
             Clearance Officer may take into account the following factors:


             (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;


             (ii)      the viability and credibility of the source  of  the
                    money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;


             (iii)     the viability and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
                    business plans and market  research  into  their  chosen
                    business sector;


             (iv)      the applicant's previous  educational  and  business
                    experience (or lack thereof);


             (v) the applicant's immigration history and previous  activity
                    in the UK; and


             (vi)      any other relevant information".


19. The Immigration Rules at 245DB(l) state:"

         (l)      If the Entry Clearance Officer is not satisfied  with  the
         genuineness of the application  in  relation  to  a  points-scoring
         requirement in Appendix A, those points will not be awarded".


20. Mr Hawkin's first contention is that the respondent's approach  to  the
    Rules is irrational.  The problem lies, he submitted, with the idea  of
    the "genuineness of the application" which phrase appears in the  Rules
    at 245DB(l) as indicated above.  Mr Hawkins submitted that this is  not
    a freestanding general requirement of "genuineness" but is  related  by
    the terms of the Rule very specifically  to  "the  genuineness  of  the
    application in relation to a points-scoring requirement".

21. The points-scoring requirements are identified in other parts of 245DB.
     Paragraph 245DB(h) prescribes how the Entry Clearance  Officer  should
    go about making the assessment under 245DB(f) and permits  a  range  of
    things to be considered including the viability and credibility of  the
    business plan and research and educational and business experience  and
    any  other  relevant  information.    However,   these   wide   ranging
    permissible considerations are in the  context  of  applying  245DB(f).
    Here the word "genuinely" appears again in  the  requirement  that  the
    applicant "genuinely intends" to become a  director  of  the  business,
    "genuinely intends" to invest  money,  that  the  money  "is  genuinely
    available" and, if relying on a previous investment that the  applicant
    has "genuinely invested" the required funds.

22. Mr Hawkin submitted that this is not a case where previous  investments
    of the kind set out in 245DB(f)(iv) or the intention to take employment
    under (v) have to be considered. He maintained that the most compelling
    indication of what the applicant  genuinely  intends  is  that  he  has
    become a director of a business, that he has invested �100,000  of  his
    own money in the business and therefore, Mr Hawkin submitted, satisfies
    the requirements about what is genuine.  There was, he  argued,  simply
    no  point  in  looking  at  other  sources  to  determine  whether  the
    application as a whole is genuine because that is not a  consideration.
    Usually a person applying for leave as an entrepreneur has not  started
    his business activity in  the  United  Kingdom  and  so,  for  example,
    answers to questions at interviews, could be very illuminating of  what
    he genuinely intended but  here  events  have  moved  faster  than  the
    respondent.  There is  no  room  to  doubt  that  the  requirements  of
    245DB(f) are satisfied because the criteria identified have been met.

23. I have reflected very hard on this argument  which  I  summarise  above
    from the papers and oral submissions. It is, at least  initially,  very
    attractive.  Mr Seirfert had considerable difficulty in outlining  what
    part of the Rule was not met.  The respondent has not helped herself by
    not relating the Entry Clearance Officer's  findings  conspicuously  to
    the requirements of the Rules.  What the respondent has done is to  ask
    if "on the balance of probabilities, you are a genuine entrepreneur, in
    line with Paragraph 245DB(f) of the  Immigration  Rules"  (this  phrase
    comes from the  administrative  review  decision  at  page  51  in  the
    bundle).  The respondent has not defined a  "genuine  entrepreneur"  in
    the decision. However the Rules that the  respondent  applied  set  out
    diverse ways in which the applicant has to be "genuine". It must follow
    that a "genuine entrepreneur" is somebody who  genuinely  intends  (for
    example) to take over a business, who genuinely intends to invest money
    and that the money is genuinely available.

24. Mr Hawkin relies on the fact that the Rules  provide  for  a  predicted
    event whereas the applicant is taking advantage of past events to  show
    that something  has  happened.   I  do  not  see  how  this  helps  the
    appellant.  The Rules contemplate an entrepreneur in the context of  an
    entry clearance application, as someone who is expected to do something
    rather than someone who already has done something and  by  relying  on
    things that have already happened save to the  extent  allowed  by  the
    Rules  the  applicant  has  put  himself   outside   the   meaning   of
    "entrepreneur" under the Rules.  The point is the Rules  are  there  to
    facilitate entrepreneurs entering the United Kingdom and  there  is  no
    obvious public interest in facilitating the entry of  somebody  who  is
    already running a business successfully.

25. However, a person is not a "genuine entrepreneur" if that  person  does
    not have a genuine intention to establish a business, invest money  and
    have money available until such time as it is spent.

26. I am satisfied that the respondent was entitled to  conclude  that  the
    applicant has not met the primary requirements of the Rules.

27. I accept that he has become a director.  There  is  an  extract  of  an
    Appointment of Director form in the bundle at B51 showing the applicant
    was appointed a director on 3 October 2016 which is  some  time  before
    the application began.  This perhaps illustrates the importance of  the
    predictive requirement of the  Rule.   The  minimal  obligations  on  a
    company director are not onerous and are not, of themselves, indicative
    of any particular ability or enthusiasm for  entrepreneurial  activity.
    The requirement in the  Rule  is  that  the  applicant  had  a  genuine
    intention to establish, take over or become a director of  a  business.
    The respondent was not satisfied that there was a genuine intention  on
    the part of the  applicant  to  establish  or  take  over  a  business.
    Similarly, although it seems beyond argument that a substantial sum  of
    money (�100,000 or something very close to it) has been funded via  the
    applicant's resources into the business it does not follow that  it  is
    intended as a genuine  investment  or  that  the  funding  will  remain
    available  until  such  time  as  it  is  spent.   The  respondent  was
    unimpressed with the applicant and gave reasons.  I  remind  myself  of
    the terms of the decision dated 25 November 2019.

28. It is accepted that the applicant had scored the necessary  points  for
    attributes, maintenance and language skills but not that the  applicant
    is "a genuine entrepreneur, with genuine intentions to invest  and  set
    up a business in the UK".  It is made perfectly plain that the decision
    was based on the answers given in interview and credibility assessed in
    accordance with 245DB(h)of the Rules.  The letter acknowledges that the
    business partner's  application  was  successful  but  continues  "your
    intentions to open and run a business in the UK were not  found  to  be
    credible".

29. The administrative review decision states (page 51 in the bundle):

         "I agree with the ECO that based on your answers in  the  interview
         and the documentation submitted in support of your application,  it
         is apparent that you have insufficient previous experience  in  the
         hospitality industry.  Upon review, I am also not satisfied that  a
         genuine entrepreneur would relocate to another country to  start  a
         business in a field unrelated to their previous experience as their
         primary reason  for  relocation.   Upon  review  it  is  considered
         reasonable for the ECO to conclude that you do  not  appear  to  be
         applying for leave to  enter  the  UK  for  wholly  entrepreneurial
         reasons, which undermines your credibility"


30. The decision maker found the responses at interview  about  setting  up
    the business in the United Kingdom to be "vague and generic".   Further
    opportunity was given in September 2019 but although the applicant  was
    able to quote from a business plan that someone else  had  prepared  he
    did not  demonstrate  a  sufficiently  thorough  understanding  of  the
    business to the satisfaction  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   The
    decision maker was aware that the applicant was not familiar  with  the
    beauty business and concluded he had not conducted adequate research.

31. It is a matter of fact that the applicant failed to remember  the  name
    of the accountant who is said to have advised him and his partner about
    establishing their business.  Whilst I can read  a  failure  like  that
    with a great deal of sympathy I cannot accept that the Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not entitled to draw adverse conclusions from the omission.
     It was indeed, in the words of the refusal reconsideration,  "a  vital
    document".

32.  Another  main  reason  for  refusing  the  application  concerned  the
    "structure of the ownership of the business".  This is a  reference  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer noting  that  the  applicant  had  said  in
    interview that "we are both having shares" developed to have  "we  will
    have equal access" and then  open  access  showing  that  the  business
    partner had 75% or more ownership of shares.   That  position  has  now
    changed in the records but the Entry Clearance Officer was entitled  to
    be unimpressed by a business where the records were so  different  from
    the aspiration of the applicant.

33. I note that the grounds for judicial review were drawn by  Mr  Barnabas
    Lams (not Mr Hawkin).

34. Assuming that it is right to look at the state  of  the  business  even
    though the Rules specifically provide for anticipating a  future  event
    the fact that the business has been established successfully is  not  a
    particularly compelling point.  What matters is the applicant's role as
    an entrepreneur.  Neither does it matter that sums have been  invested.
    It is not at all the same as saying that they are "genuinely available"
    and will remain available until such time as they are spent.  The Rules
    are looking at something different from the state of the business.

35. Returning to the grounds the next point taken is that  the  applicant's
    partner Miss Manchandra was given leave and it must:

         "Necessarily have been on the basis that not only was she a genuine
         entrepreneur but she was part of  a  genuine  entrepreneurial  team
         made up of her and the applicant, as that was  the  basis  for  her
         application".


36. That is right as far as it goes but there are two decisions  here  made
    by different  people  based  on  different  material  in  the  form  of
    different answers at interview.  There is nothing inherently irrational
    in different conclusions being reached after different procedures have,
    appropriately, been followed and  I  see  no  reason  at  all  why  the
    applicant should be found  "genuine"  because  his  partner  was  found
    "genuine".

37. Varying the location of the business  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  not
    something that impresses me either way per se.  The point is that there
    was a plan to establish the business in Islington and it has  now  been
    established in Chelsea.  The grounds complain that the decision did not
    recognise that the change of location was  a  consequence  in  part  of
    finding an ailing business in Chelsea that  could  be  obtained  at  an
    attractive price.  As is clear from the administrative review  decision
    (page 52 in the bundle) the respondent's concern was not so  much  with
    the change of location for the business premises  but  the  applicant's
    attitude to the  change.   There  may  be  good  business  reasons  for
    establishing the parlour in Chelsea rather than Islington but the Entry
    Clearance Officer's concern was "it is unclear  as  to  why  you  would
    choose a location close to several other competitors".  The applicant's
    answers suggested to the Entry Clearance Officer that the applicant was
    not familiar with the competition and added to  the  picture  that  the
    applicant was not a genuine entrepreneur.  This  finding  that  is  not
    made perverse by other strands of evidence that could have supported  a
    different conclusion.  The administrative review stated:

         "I am satisfied the lack  of  detailed  market  research  regarding
         competitors undermines your credibility as an entrepreneur".


38. The fourth point taken in Mr Hawkin's  skeleton  argument  is  entitled
    "The applicant's role in the business".  This, with respect, is  simply
    a reworking of earlier points and meets with the same response,  namely
    that the Entry Clearance Officer  took  a  different  view  and  unless
    perversity is established, and it is not, it is not unlawful.

39. The fifth point is headed "Competition" and all of the above applies.

40. Point 6 is headed "Business in the United Kingdom not India".   Clearly
    the respondent did doubt the  plan  because  the  applicant  chose  the
    United Kingdom rather than India.  Again, there are reasons to say that
    a different conclusion could  have  been  reached  but  that  does  not
    undermine the decision that was made and so does not achieve the result
    the applicant requires.

41. Paragraph 7 is entitled "Family in the United Kingdom".   There  it  is
    asserted that the fact the applicant has family in the  United  Kingdom
    cannot of itself undermine the credibility of the application which  is
    to be an entrepreneur and set up a business.  That is almost  certainly
    correct but the problem is that the applicant was, in the mind  of  the
    Entry Clearance  Officer,  unpersuasive  about  his  knowledge  of  the
    business and his plans to develop it.  That he might have had a  reason
    for  wanting  to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom  other  than  being   an
    entrepreneur was something the respondent was entitled to consider.   I
    cannot say that the  respondent  has  given  unlawful  weight  to  this
    lurking suspicion.  The problem is not that he has family in the United
    Kingdom.  The problem is he was unpersuasive when he was talking  about
    the business.

42. Point 8 is entitled "Company set up".  This, with respect, skirts round
    the problem.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  concern  was  that  the
    applicant talked  about  an  equal  share  in  the  business  when  the
    documentation suggested a 75% and 25% share in  the  business  and  the
    applicant could not explain the reason for that.  I do not  agree  that
    the "undisputed fact" that the  applicant  has  provided  half  of  the
    capital for a genuine and existing business determines the point.   The
    applicant appears to have provided half of the capital for  a  business
    but seemed ignorant of the details of the  ownership  of  the  business
    that he claimed he wanted to develop and was half his.

43. Point 9 is entitled "Knowledge of business plan and  research".  Again,
    it shows how the application might have been resolved differently.   It
    does point to answers that the applicant gave that the  respondent  did
    not mention or consider in detail in the refusal.   It  does  not  mean
    they were not read and does not mean that the  respondent's  conclusion
    based on the things that were said was not open to him in law.

44. The final heading "Overall" adds nothing.

45. Again, I remind myself that this is not an appeal.  I  have  considered
    the Detailed Grounds of defence and the Response to the Summary Grounds
    in the skeleton argument.  I do not find that they add anything to  the
    observations I have already made.

46. I have read Mr Hawkin's further submissions on remedies but  I  do  not
    find them relevant.  I do not accept there has been any error here.

47. I am aware the Secretary of State has  offered  to  look  at  the  case
    again.  That course is a matter for the Secretary of State and she  can
    adopt it for a  wide  variety  of  reasons.  It  is  certainly  not  an
    admission that there is any fault and I do not treat it as such.

48. I find that the case can really be reduced to a very short explanation.
     The applicant was interviewed and  although  he  claimed  considerable
    experience not much information was given.  Further, he was not able to
    talk in the kind of detail the Entry Clearance Officer  expected  about
    the reasons for the proposal.  He could not even remember the  name  of
    the accountant that had given advice and his  explanation  of  how  the
    business would be set up in terms of equal shares was not supported  by
    the documentation. This was adjusted at a later stage  but  the  damage
    had already been done.  The essential decision is not perverse provided
    that the respondent was entitled to look  at  the  genuineness  of  the
    application.  I spent considerable time looking at  the  Rules  at  the
    start of this judgment and I find that the requirement for  genuineness
    is in the rules and that the respondent was entitled to find  that  the
    applicant did not satisfy it.

49. In short, after reminding myself yet  again  that  I  am  dealing  with
    public law issues, not an appeal, I find no public law error  has  been
    established and I dismiss the application for judicial review.~0~~~~

                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE PERKINS


                               - - - - - - - -

Mr B Hawkin, Counsel instructed by Alcott Solicitors appeared on behalf of
the Applicant.

Mr B Seifert, Counsel instructed by the Government Legal Department
appeared on behalf of the Respondent.


                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

    JUDGE PERKINS: The applicant seeks judicial review of the  respondent's
    decision on 25 November 2019, served on 2 December 2019,  upholding  on
    administration review a decision of the respondent on 18 September 2019
    refusing him entry clearance as an entrepreneur.


 2. He was given permission following  an  orally  renewed  application  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam who said:

         "While the applicant overstates the significance of  the  grant  of
         leave to his business partner and that the business was trading, it
         is arguable that the reasons given by the respondent  for  refusing
         the  application  are  irrational  in  the  light  of  the  further
         submissions made and the totality of the evidence".


 3. Judge McWilliam issued standard directions which provided, inter  alia,
    that the respondent served any Detailed Grounds of  Defence  within  35
    days of the directions being sent.  They were sent on 5 August 2020 and
    so any Detailed  Grounds  should  have  been  served  by  (I  think)  9
    September 2020.  Somewhat later, on 12 May 2021,  the  respondent  sent
    draft Detailed Grounds and applied for the time to be extended to admit
    the draft as the Detailed Grounds.  The chronology is a little obscure.
     The draft grounds are dated 17 May 2021.  The application is dated  12
    May 2021 and a covering letter is dated 20 May 2021.

 4. On 21 May 2021 I received from the applicant's Counsel,  Mr  Hawkin,  a
    "Detailed Response to Respondent's Grounds of Defence".  He opposed the
    application and I had to decide at the start  of  the  hearing  if  the
    respondent should be entitled to rely on the draft Detailed Grounds and
    if so on what terms.

 5. I ruled in favour of the respondent and gave orally my reasons  that  I
    substantially repeat below.

 6. I say immediately that this is not a  case  of  the  respondent  losing
    interest and then waking up  at  the  last  minute.   There  have  been
    discussions  between  the  parties  to  agree  an  outcome   in   these
    proceedings and I understand the respondent not rushing to spend  money
    on something that may not be needed.

 7. The respondent's covering letter  reminds  me,  appropriately,  of  the
    decisions in Mitchell v News Group Newspapers Limited [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    1537 and Denton v T H  White  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  906.   The  respondent
    distils  a  threefold  test  from  these,  asserting  that   I   should
    investigate first the seriousness and significance of the  default  and
    then, second, the reasons for the delay and then, third,  evaluate  all
    of the circumstances to deal justly with  the  application.   My  first
    concern is how the applicant is  disadvantaged  unfairly  if  I  extend
    time.

 8. In his Response, Mr Hawkin refers to correspondence from the respondent
    and the Tribunal dated 6 October 2020 where the respondent says "Should
    this matter proceed to a hearing  the  respondent  would  rely  on  the
    position as set out in the consent  order  sent  to  the  applicant  on
    20.4.2020" and said "In the event  the  applicant  does  not  agree  to
    settle, that the matter is struck out on  the  basis  of  the  attached
    consent order".  That "order" is, of course, a draft consent order;  no
    agreement was reached.

 9. The material part of the  draft  order  states:  "UPON  THE  RESPONDENT
    agreeing to reconsider the decision dated 25 November 2019  within  six
    weeks of this order being sealed, absent  special  circumstances  ...".
    The indication that the respondent would rely  "on  the  basis  of  the
    attached consent order" cannot be taken literally to mean only on  that
    order.  The respondent has not admitted any error.  She has  agreed  to
    reconsider but that is not any kind of admission of fault.  The  letter
    must mean that the respondent will seek to rely in part on the terms of
    the consent order not only  on  its  terms.   I  find  nothing  in  the
    Detailed Grounds that are at odds with the summary grounds.

10. In short, the Detailed Grounds set out better and clearly  points  that
    the applicant could anticipated and the applicant  has  had  sufficient
    time to consider them. Mr Hawkin failed to persuade me that  there  was
    any unfairness to the applicant in permitting the respondent to rely on
    the draft Detailed Grounds and I extended time to  admit  the  Detailed
    Grounds of defence.  There was no application for an adjournment.

11. There are some unusual features  in  this  case.   First  is  that  the
    decision before me was made on an application dated as long  ago  as  1
    February  2017.   The  application   was   refused.    There   was   an
    administrative review upholding that  decision.   Following  persistent
    further applications, including applications for  judicial  review,  by
    the applicant's solicitors there have been three further decisions each
    upheld on administrative review making a total of eight in all.  Whilst
    this is not wrong in  principle  and  none  of  the  applications  have
    involved excessive delay, it really is time that this  application  was
    determined one way or another.

12. Mr Hawkin constructed his case carefully through pleadings and skeleton
    arguments which I have  considered.   I  mean  them  no  disrespect  by
    summarising them as follows.  The applicant is a citizen of India  born
    in 1960.  He has worked as a banker and retired early.   He  claims  to
    have formed a plan to run a beauty parlour in the United Kingdom with a
    business partner, a Miss Seema Manchanda, who has relevant business and
    practical experience.  In outline,  it  was  their  intention  to  each
    invest the sum of �100,000 into the enterprise.  They formed a  limited
    company to facilitate that plan in which they were each held 50% of the
    shares and they produced  a  business  plan  and  similar  confirmatory
    documents.  The  applicant's  application  was  refused  and  has  been
    refused in its renewed forms.  A similar application  by  the  business
    partner succeeded and indeed the business has been established.

13. Mr Hawkin's submission, in outline, is that not only does the  decision
    seem unfair from a lay perspective but, more importantly, it  is  wrong
    in law when all the circumstances are considered.  In  particular,  the
    last refusal was in the face of accepted evidence that the business had
    been established and was succeeding.

14. Again in summary outline it was Mr Seifert's position that there was no
    public law error, there was merely a decision that the  applicant  does
    not like.

15. I remind myself that I am not required to make a decision on the merits
    of the application for leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  and  how  I
    might  have  decided  such  an  application  is  of  little,  if   any,
    importance. I have to decide if the Secretary of State's  decision  was
    irrational or unlawful in any other way as the applicant contends  that
    it is.

16. The Immigration Rules have changed but  the  parties  agreed  that  the
    relevant Rules are set out in the application.  The Rules made  various
    requirements that the applicant has met and other requirements that the
    respondent says are not satisfied.

17. Paragraph 245DB(f) provides:

    "(f)   Where the applicant is being assessed under Table 4 of  Appendix
         A, the Entry Clearance Officer must be satisfied that:


         (i)      the applicant genuinely intends and is able to  establish,
                take over or become a director of one or more businesses  in
                the UK within the next six months;


         (ii)     the  applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
                referred to in Table 4 of Appendix  A  in  the  business  or
                businesses referred to in (i);


         (iii)    that the money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix        A
                is genuinely available to the  applicant,  and  will  remain
                available to him until such time as  it  is  spent  for  the
                purposes of his business or businesses;


         (iv)     if the applicant  is  relying  on  one  or  more  previous
                investments to score points, they  have  genuinely  invested
                all or part of the investment funds required in Table  4  of
                Appendix A into one or more genuine businesses in the UK;


         (v)      that the applicant does not intend to take  employment  in
                the United Kingdom other than under the terms  of  paragraph
                245DC".


18. The Immigration Rules at 245DB(h) provide:

    "(h)   In making the assessment in (f),  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
         will assess the  balance  of  probabilities.  The  Entry  Clearance
         Officer may take into account the following factors:


         (i)      the evidence the applicant has submitted;


         (ii)     the viability and credibility of the source of  the  money
                referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;


         (iii)    the viability and credibility of the applicant's  business
                plans and market research into their chosen business sector;


         (iv)      the  applicant's  previous   educational   and   business
                experience (or lack thereof);


         (v)      the applicant's immigration history and previous  activity
                in the UK; and


         (vi)     any other relevant information".


19. The Immigration Rules at 245DB(l) state:"

         (l)      If the Entry Clearance Officer is not satisfied  with  the
         genuineness of the application in  relation  to  a  points  scoring
         requirement in Appendix A, those points will not be awarded".


20. Mr Hawkin's first contention is that the respondent's approach  to  the
    Rules is irrational.  The problem lies, he submitted, with the idea  of
    the "genuineness of the application" which phrase appears in the  Rules
    at 245DB(l) as indicated above.  Mr Hawkins submitted that this is  not
    a freestanding general requirement of "genuineness" but is  related  by
    the terms of the Rule very specifically  to  "the  genuineness  of  the
    application in relation to a points-scoring requirement".

21. The points-scoring requirements are identified in other parts of 245DB.
     Paragraph 245DB(h) prescribes how the Entry Clearance  Officer  should
    go about making the assessment under 245DB(f) and permits  a  range  of
    things to be considered including the viability and credibility of  the
    business plan and research and educational and business experience  and
    any  other  relevant  information.    However,   these   wide   ranging
    permissible considerations are in the  context  of  applying  245DB(f).
    Here the word "genuinely" appears again in  the  requirement  that  the
    applicant "genuinely intends" to become a  director  of  the  business,
    "genuinely intends" to invest  money,  that  the  money  "is  genuinely
    available" and, if relying on a previous investment that the  applicant
    has "genuinely invested" the required funds.

22. Mr Hawkin submitted that this is not a case where previous  investments
    of the kind set out in 245DB(f)(iv) or the intention to take employment
    under (v) have to be considered. He maintained that the most compelling
    indication of what the applicant  genuinely  intends  is  that  he  has
    become a director of a business, that he has invested �100,000  of  his
    own money in the business and therefore, Mr Hawkin submitted, satisfies
    the requirements about what is genuine.  There was, he  argued,  simply
    no  point  in  looking  at  other  sources  to  determine  whether  the
    application as a whole is genuine because that is not a  consideration.
    Usually a person applying for leave as an entrepreneur has not  started
    his business activity in  the  United  Kingdom  and  so,  for  example,
    answers to questions at interviews, could be very illuminating of  what
    he genuinely intended but  here  events  have  moved  faster  than  the
    respondent.  There is  no  room  to  doubt  that  the  requirements  of
    245DB(f) are satisfied because the criteria identified have been met.

23. I have reflected very hard on this argument  which  I  summarise  above
    from the papers and oral submissions. It is, at least  initially,  very
    attractive.  Mr Seifert had considerable difficulty in  outlining  what
    part of the Rule was not met.  The respondent has not helped herself by
    not relating the Entry Clearance Officer's  findings  conspicuously  to
    the requirements of the Rules.  What the respondent has done is to  ask
    if "on the balance of probabilities, you are a genuine entrepreneur, in
    line with Paragraph 245DB(f) of the  Immigration  Rules"  (this  phrase
    comes from the  administrative  review  decision  at  page  51  in  the
    bundle).  The respondent has not defined a  "genuine  entrepreneur"  in
    the decision. However the Rules that the  respondent  applied  set  out
    diverse ways in which the applicant has to be "genuine". It must follow
    that a "genuine entrepreneur" is somebody who  genuinely  intends  (for
    example) to take over a business, who genuinely intends to invest money
    and that the money is genuinely available.

24. Mr Hawkin relies on the fact that the Rules  provide  for  a  predicted
    event whereas the applicant is taking advantage of past events to  show
    that something  has  happened.   I  do  not  see  how  this  helps  the
    appellant.  The Rules contemplate an entrepreneur in the context of  an
    entry clearance application, as someone who is expected to do something
    rather than someone who already has done something and  by  relying  on
    things that have already happened save to the  extent  allowed  by  the
    Rules  the  applicant  has  put  himself   outside   the   meaning   of
    "entrepreneur" under the Rules.  The point is the Rules  are  there  to
    facilitate entrepreneurs entering the United Kingdom and  there  is  no
    obvious public interest in facilitating the entry of  somebody  who  is
    already running a business successfully.

25. However, a person is not a "genuine entrepreneur" if that  person  does
    not have a genuine intention to establish a business, invest money  and
    have money available until such time as it is spent.

26. I am satisfied that the respondent was entitled to  conclude  that  the
    applicant has not met the primary requirements of the Rules.

27. I accept that he has become a director.  There  is  an  extract  of  an
    Appointment of Director form in the bundle at B51 showing the applicant
    was appointed a director on 3 October 2016 which is  some  time  before
    the application began.  This perhaps illustrates the importance of  the
    predictive requirement of the  Rule.   The  minimal  obligations  on  a
    company director are not onerous and are not, of themselves, indicative
    of any particular ability or enthusiasm for  entrepreneurial  activity.
    The requirement in the  Rule  is  that  the  applicant  had  a  genuine
    intention to establish, take over or become a director of  a  business.
    The respondent was not satisfied that there was a genuine intention  on
    the part of the  applicant  to  establish  or  take  over  a  business.
    Similarly, although it seems beyond argument that a substantial sum  of
    money (�100,000 or something very close to it) has been funded via  the
    applicant's resources into the business it does not follow that  it  is
    intended as a genuine  investment  or  that  the  funding  will  remain
    available  until  such  time  as  it  is  spent.   The  respondent  was
    unimpressed with the applicant and gave reasons.  I  remind  myself  of
    the terms of the decision dated 25 November 2019.

28. It is accepted that the applicant had scored the necessary  points  for
    attributes, maintenance and language skills but not that the  applicant
    is "a genuine entrepreneur, with genuine intentions to invest  and  set
    up a business in the UK".  It is made perfectly plain that the decision
    was based on the answers given in interview and credibility assessed in
    accordance with 245DB(h)of the Rules.  The letter acknowledges that the
    business partner's  application  was  successful  but  continues  "your
    intentions to open and run a business in the UK were not  found  to  be
    credible".

29. The administrative review decision states (page 51 in the bundle):

         "I agree with the ECO that based on your answers in  the  interview
         and the documentation submitted in support of your application,  it
         is apparent that you have insufficient previous experience  in  the
         hospitality industry.  Upon review, I am also not satisfied that  a
         genuine entrepreneur would relocate to another country to  start  a
         business in a field unrelated to their previous experience as their
         primary reason  for  relocation.   Upon  review  it  is  considered
         reasonable for the ECO to conclude that you do  not  appear  to  be
         applying for leave to  enter  the  UK  for  wholly  entrepreneurial
         reasons, which undermines your credibility"


30. The decision maker found the responses at interview  about  setting  up
    the business in the United Kingdom to be "vague and generic".   Further
    opportunity was given in September 2019 but although the applicant  was
    able to quote from a business plan that someone else  had  prepared  he
    did not  demonstrate  a  sufficiently  thorough  understanding  of  the
    business to the satisfaction  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   The
    decision maker was aware that the applicant was not familiar  with  the
    beauty business and concluded he had not conducted adequate research.

31. It is a matter of fact that the applicant failed to remember  the  name
    of the accountant who is said to have advised him and his partner about
    establishing their business.  Whilst I can read  a  failure  like  that
    with a great deal of sympathy I cannot accept that the Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not entitled to draw adverse conclusions from the omission.
     It was indeed, in the words of the refusal reconsideration,  "a  vital
    document".

32.  Another  main  reason  for  refusing  the  application  concerned  the
    "structure of the ownership of the business".  This is a  reference  to
    the Entry Clearance Officer noting  that  the  applicant  had  said  in
    interview that "we are both having shares" developed to have  "we  will
    have equal access" and then  open  access  showing  that  the  business
    partner had 75% or more ownership of shares.   That  position  has  now
    changed in the records but the Entry Clearance Officer was entitled  to
    be unimpressed by a business where the records were so  different  from
    the aspiration of the applicant.

33. I note that the grounds for judicial review were drawn by  Mr  Barnabas
    Lams (not Mr Hawkin).

34. Assuming that it is right to look at the state  of  the  business  even
    though the Rules specifically provide for anticipating a  future  event
    the fact that the business has been established successfully is  not  a
    particularly compelling point.  What matters is the applicant's role as
    an entrepreneur.  Neither does it matter that sums have been  invested.
    It is not at all the same as saying that they are "genuinely available"
    and will remain available until such time as they are spent.  The Rules
    are looking at something different from the state of the business.

35. Returning to the grounds the next point taken is that  the  applicant's
    partner Miss Manchandra was given leave and it must:

         "Necessarily have been on the basis that not only was she a genuine
         entrepreneur but she was part of  a  genuine  entrepreneurial  team
         made up of her and the applicant, as that was  the  basis  for  her
         application".


36. That is right as far as it goes but there are two decisions  here  made
    by different  people  based  on  different  material  in  the  form  of
    different answers at interview.  There is nothing inherently irrational
    in different conclusions being reached after different procedures have,
    appropriately, been followed and  I  see  no  reason  at  all  why  the
    applicant should be found  "genuine"  because  his  partner  was  found
    "genuine".

37. Varying the location of the business  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  not
    something that impresses me either way per se.  The point is that there
    was a plan to establish the business in Islington and it has  now  been
    established in Chelsea.  The grounds complain that the decision did not
    recognise that the change of location was  a  consequence  in  part  of
    finding an ailing business in Chelsea that  could  be  obtained  at  an
    attractive price.  As is clear from the administrative review  decision
    (page 52 in the bundle) the respondent's concern was not so  much  with
    the change of location for the business premises  but  the  applicant's
    attitude to the  change.   There  may  be  good  business  reasons  for
    establishing the parlour in Chelsea rather than Islington but the Entry
    Clearance Officer's concern was "it is unclear  as  to  why  you  would
    choose a location close to several other competitors".  The applicant's
    answers suggested to the Entry Clearance Officer that the applicant was
    not familiar with the competition and added to  the  picture  that  the
    applicant was not a genuine entrepreneur.  This  finding  that  is  not
    made perverse by other strands of evidence that could have supported  a
    different conclusion.  The administrative review stated:

         "I am satisfied the lack  of  detailed  market  research  regarding
         competitors undermines your credibility as an entrepreneur".


38. The fourth point taken in Mr Hawkin's  skeleton  argument  is  entitled
    "The applicant's role in the business".  This, with respect, is  simply
    a reworking of earlier points and meets with the same response,  namely
    that the Entry Clearance Officer  took  a  different  view  and  unless
    perversity is established, and it is not, it is not unlawful.

39. The fifth point is headed "Competition" and all of the above applies.

40. Point 6 is headed "Business in the United Kingdom not India".   Clearly
    the respondent did doubt the  plan  because  the  applicant  chose  the
    United Kingdom rather than India.  Again, there are reasons to say that
    a different conclusion could  have  been  reached  but  that  does  not
    undermine the decision that was made and so does not achieve the result
    the applicant requires.

41. Paragraph 7 is entitled "Family in the United Kingdom".   There  it  is
    asserted that the fact the applicant has family in the  United  Kingdom
    cannot of itself undermine the credibility of the application which  is
    to be an entrepreneur and set up a business.  That is almost  certainly
    correct but the problem is that the applicant was, in the mind  of  the
    Entry Clearance  Officer,  unpersuasive  about  his  knowledge  of  the
    business and his plans to develop it.  That he might have had a  reason
    for  wanting  to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom  other  than  being   an
    entrepreneur was something the respondent was entitled to consider.   I
    cannot say that the  respondent  has  given  unlawful  weight  to  this
    lurking suspicion.  The problem is not that he has family in the United
    Kingdom.  The problem is he was unpersuasive when he was talking  about
    the business.

42. Point 8 is entitled "Company set up".  This, with respect, skirts round
    the problem.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  concern  was  that  the
    applicant talked  about  an  equal  share  in  the  business  when  the
    documentation suggested a 75% and 25% share in  the  business  and  the
    applicant could not explain the reason for that.  I do not  agree  that
    the "undisputed fact" that the  applicant  has  provided  half  of  the
    capital for a genuine and existing business determines the point.   The
    applicant appears to have provided half of the capital for  a  business
    but seemed ignorant of the details of the  ownership  of  the  business
    that he claimed he wanted to develop and was half his.

43. Point 9 is entitled "Knowledge of business plan and  research".  Again,
    it shows how the application might have been resolved differently.   It
    does point to answers that the applicant gave that the  respondent  did
    not mention or consider in detail in the refusal.   It  does  not  mean
    they were not read and does not mean that the  respondent's  conclusion
    based on the things that were said was not open to him in law.

44. The final heading "Overall" adds nothing.

45. Again, I remind myself that this is not an appeal.  I  have  considered
    the Detailed Grounds of defence and the Response to the Summary Grounds
    in the skeleton argument.  I do not find that they add anything to  the
    observations I have already made.

46. I have read Mr Hawkin's further submissions on remedies but  I  do  not
    find them relevant.  I do not accept there has been any error here.

47. I am aware the Secretary of State has  offered  to  look  at  the  case
    again.  That course is a matter for the Secretary of State and she  can
    adopt it for a  wide  variety  of  reasons.  It  is  certainly  not  an
    admission that there is any fault and I do not treat it as such.

48. I find that the case can really be reduced to a very short explanation.
     The applicant was interviewed and  although  he  claimed  considerable
    experience not much information was given.  Further, he was not able to
    talk in the kind of detail the Entry Clearance Officer  expected  about
    the reasons for the proposal.  He could not even remember the  name  of
    the accountant that had given advice and his  explanation  of  how  the
    business would be set up in terms of equal shares was not supported  by
    the documentation. This was adjusted at a later stage  but  the  damage
    had already been done.  The essential decision is not perverse provided
    that the respondent was entitled to look  at  the  genuineness  of  the
    application.  I spent considerable time looking at  the  Rules  at  the
    start of this judgment and I find that the requirement for  genuineness
    is in the rules and that the respondent was entitled to find  that  the
    applicant did not satisfy it.

49. In short, after reminding myself yet  again  that  I  am  dealing  with
    public law issues, not an appeal, I find no public law error  has  been
    established and I dismiss the application for judicial review.~0~~~~
