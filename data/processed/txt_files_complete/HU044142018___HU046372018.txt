Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Salam, Salam & Co Solicitors Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Muhammad Naveed, was born on 23 March 1981 and is a male
    citizen of Pakistan.   By  directions  dated  4  December  2018,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Gleeson directed that the appeal HU/04414/2018 should be
    consolidated with  HU/04637/2018,  the  appeal  of  Mr  Naveed's  wife,
    Muneeba.  Mrs Naveed is the dependant of her husband  and  no  separate
    submissions had been made in  respect  of  Mrs  Naveed.   Although  Mrs
    Naveed's hearing was due to take place in the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    Bradford in December 2018, it appears that the  hearing  did  not  take
    place in the  light  of  Judge  Gleeson's  directions.   Judge  Gleeson
    directed that "these appeals be  linked  and  heard  together  and  the
    second appellant's appeal be treated as dependant on the outcome of the
    appeal of the principal appellant (Mr Naveed)."  Although I do not have
    confirmation that there was  no  hearing  in  Mrs  Naveed's  appeal  in
    December 2018 at Bradford, I confirm that I am, following the direction
    of  Judge  Gleeson  and  with  the  consent  of  both  parties,  hereby
    determining the appeals of both Mrs and Mr Naveed.

 2. I shall refer,  therefore,  to  Mr  Naveed  as  "the  appellant".   The
    appellant came to the United Kingdom as a student.  Shortly before  his
    last period of leave was due to expire in March  2016  he  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  Before  that
    application was  considered  and  determined  by  the  respondent,  the
    appellant varied his application to  make  a  SET(LR)  application  for
    indefinite leave  on  the  grounds  of  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence (paragraph 276B of HC 395).  That application was refused  by
    the respondent in a decision dated 26 January 2018.   The  refusal  was
    made under paragraph 322(5) of HC 395:

         (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain
         in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct  (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph  322(1C),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security;

 3. The refusal under paragraph 322(5) refers back to earlier  applications
    which had been successful in  2011  and  2013.   In  those  years,  the
    appellant's applications relied on self-employed income of respectively
    �38,000 and �41,000.  In the same periods, the appellant's declarations
    to HMRC had been �9,000 and �20,000.  The  discrepancies  had  come  to
    light only in 2016 at the time of or shortly before the appellant  made
    the application which is the subject of this appeal.   The  refusal  of
    the appellant's application reads as follows:

         "The delay of several years in correcting your declarations to HMRC
         shows that you  had  little  intention  of  correcting  the  errors
         promptly and as such have little respect for the United Kingdom tax
         laws.   The  Secretary  of  State  considers  that  it   would   be
         undesirable for you to remain in the United Kingdom  based  on  the
         fact that you have been deceitful or  dishonest  in  your  dealings
         with HMRC and/or UK Visas and Immigration  by  failing  to  declare
         your claimed PAYE and self-employed earnings to HMRC  at  the  time
         and/or by falsely representing  your  income  to  obtain  leave  to
         remain in the United Kingdom."

 4. Judge Pickup, who  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 31 August 2018 wrote at [7]: it follows

         "In short, the case for the  respondent  set  out  in  the  refusal
         decision is that either the appellant was being dishonest  to  UKBI
         in significantly inflating his true income  in  2011  and  2013  to
         ensure  he  qualified  for  the  necessary  points   in   the   PBS
         requirements, or he was dishonest by failing to  declare  his  true
         self-employed earnings to HMRC in 2011 and 2013.   Either  scenario
         reflects poorly on the appellant's character."

 5. The grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  lack  focus  and  are
    unnecessarily prolix. The grounds are helpfully summarised in the grant
    of permission by Judge Gibb:

         "The grounds which were in time complain that the judge  erred  in:
         (i) refusing to allow unreported cases to be cited,  not  following
         the Practice Direction; (ii) not  considering  Home  Office  Policy
         Guidance on the application  of  paragraph  32(5)  of  HC  395  (as
         amended); (iii) incorrectly applying the burden  of  proof  to  the
         appellant; (iv) his approach to the evidence as to  errors  of  the
         accountant and to the appellant's  oral  evidence;  (v)  giving  no
         weight to the fact the appellant voluntarily offered the amendments
         to HMRC; and (vi) treating the appellant's presence in  the  UK  as
         precarious when it had been leave and  in  a  category  leading  to
         settlement."

 6. Mr Salam,  who  appeared  for  the  appellant  before  both  Tribunals,
    challenged Judge Pickup's decision on the basis that the  Tribunal  had
    failed to give proper attention to unreported cases and, in particular,
    to the Home Office guidance published 11 January 2018 entitled  general
    grounds for refusal Section 4 and 5 considering leave to remain.

 7. Regarding the appellant's reliance upon unreported cases, Judge  Pickup
    deals with this issue at [11].  He  refused  the  application  to  cite
    unreported authorities.  He was not satisfied that the  Tribunal  would
    be materially assisted by the citation of  the  decisions  as  distinct
    from adoption in  argument  for  the  reasoning  to  be  found  in  the
    decision.  He correctly  noted  that  they  were  not  binding  on  the
    Tribunal.  He observed:

         "there was  no  particular  or  direct  link  between  any  of  the
         circumstances of these cases to this appellant  and  no  compelling
         reason why they  should  be  cited.   This  does  not  prevent  the
         appellant relying on the arguments  therein  and  having  read  the
         decisions I confirmed to Mr Salam that I was fully acquainted  with
         the submissions he wished to pursue on behalf of the appellant  and
         I have addressed those matters below."

 8. I find no error in the judge's approach.  He has applied  the  relevant
    Practice Direction.  He made no attempt to prevent Mr Salam relying  on
    the arguments which had been used in the unreported  cases  and,  as  I
    told Mr Salam at the initial hearing,  to  suggest  that  Judge  Pickup
    should have relied upon the outcome of  those  cases  is  inappropriate
    since the decisions were in no way binding upon him.

 9. As regards the guidance, Mr Salam submitted that the  appellant's  case
    did not involve criminality or threat to national security, war  crimes
    or travel bans.  Both parties agree that the appellant has not been the
    subject of a criminal prosecution.  Mr Salam submitted  that,  had  the
    judge followed the guidance, he would not have held that the  appellant
    had acted improperly in relation to his accounts  or  tax  affairs.   I
    disagree.  The guidance makes it clear that "the main  types  of  cases
    you need to consider ... are  those  involving  criminality  ...".  [my
    emphasis]. The list is not exhaustive.  As regards  the  absence  of  a
    prosecution, the next paragraph of the guidance makes  it  clear  that,
    "the person does not need to have been convicted of a criminal  offence
    for this provision to apply."

10. Helpful guidance in a reported case of the Upper Tribunal  is  provided
    in R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (Dishonesty, tax return paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT  00384
    (IAC).  The guidance provided in that case by Spencer J makes it  clear
    that where there has been a "significant difference between the  income
    claimed in a previous application for leave to remain  and  the  income
    declared to HMRC  the  Secretary  of  State  is  entitled  to  draw  an
    inference that the appellant has been deceitful or dishonest."  Neither
    party sought to suggest that the figures involved in the  instant  case
    were not "significant".  Headnote (iv)  of  the  guidance  provides  as
    follows:

         "(iv)    For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
         an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be the
         end of the matter, given that the accountant will  or  should  have
         asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to
         have signed the tax return. Furthermore  the  Applicant  will  have
         known of his or her earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within a  reasonable
         time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
         entitled to conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion  that
         there has been deceit or dishonesty."

11. Judge Pickup makes no reference to Khan because the  decision  was  not
    reported until after the First-tier Tribunal determination.  However, I
    find that Judge Pickup has, in essence, followed the guidance  provided
    by the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Salam submitted that  the  letter  from  the
    appellant's accountants (page 77 of  the  appellant's  bundle)  assumed
    responsibility for the errors which had  occurred.   The  letter  (from
    Sarmad & Co Chartered Certified Accountants) is  dated  20  July  2018.
    The relevant part of it reads as follows:

         "We further confirm that in reviewing [the appellant's] tax returns
         for the period ending 5 April 2011 and 5 April 2013 [the appellant]
         has identified some statistical errors  which  were  rectified  and
         resubmitted to HMRC.  We also confirm that HMRC  has  accepted  the
         resubmission and he [the appellant] is regularly paying his tax  by
         direct debit to HMRC."

12. I disagree that this letter should be read as  assuming  responsibility
    for the errors.  The judge's analysis is at [25]:

         "The evidence submitted by the appellant from his accountants  does
         not suggest that there was any error on their part  whatsoever  and
         does  not  satisfactorily  explain  the  matter  ...  what   'those
         statistical' errors are has never been adequately explained.   This
         is not a case of clerical or accounting error by the accountants."

13. The judge's findings in respect of the letter were plainly open to him.
     Indeed, it would be difficult to  impose  a  different  interpretation
    upon the contents of the letter.  Further, the appellant  took  several
    years to correct errors which should have been apparent  to  him  given
    that these were his own tax returns.  The facts in the appellant's case
    as found by the judge fall squarely into the guidance provided by  Khan
    at [iv].   The  appellant  did  not  take  reasonable  steps  within  a
    reasonable time to remedy  the  situation.   The  appellant  agreed  in
    evidence before Judge Pickup that

         "The accountant will have asked him to check and agree the  figures
         before completing the accounts and making the HMRC  submissions  of
         declared income.  [The appellant] said he  knew  that  it  was  his
         responsibility but claimed that he had  'just  overlooked  and  the
         accountant submitted the accounts to the Inland Revenue."

    Not surprisingly,  the  judge  found  that  evidence  to  be  "entirely
    unsatisfactory".  I find it was open to the  judge  to  find  that  the
    appellant "must have known full well that the figures submitted in 2011
    and 2013 were wildly inaccurate and a  misrepresentation  of  his  true
    income [30]".  The judge was satisfied that "[the  appellant]  was  not
    merely careless or incautious about his accounts and I am satisfied his
    attempt to blame  his  accountants  is  unsupportable  on  the  limited
    evidence provided."

14. The appellant's own evidence is not that the accountant made an  error,
    but the  appellant  himself  had  "just  overlooked"  very  substantial
    discrepancies in his tax  returns.   The  completion  of  accurate  tax
    returns was ultimately the responsibility of the appellant himself.  On
    the basis of that evidence, I am also satisfied that Judge  Pickup  was
    entitled to conclude that the Secretary of State had  proved  that  the
    appellant was not merely careless or cautious but had  intended  to  be
    dishonest.  In the absence of a criminal prosecution of  the  appellant
    is, for the reasons I have stated above, irrelevant.  Judge Pickup  was
    able to consider both the oral and the documentary evidence and to make
    comprehensive findings accordingly.  The  apportionment  of  weight  to
    various items of evidence was a matter for the judge.  He was  entitled
    to take account of the poor quality of the appellant's evidence and, in
    concluding that the appellant had been dishonest, he  was  entitled  to
    find that the appellant's entire case had been a fabrication.

15. As I have noted above, the grounds are not written in  a  helpful  way.
    Those which deal with the unreported cases, the apportionment of weight
    to various items of evidence and the ability  of  the  judge,  on  that
    evidence, to find that the appellant had been dishonest  I  have  dealt
    with above.  Mr Salam did not refer in his oral submissions to  [17-18]
    of the grounds of appeal which challenge the judge's findings that  the
    appellant and his wife had a "precarious"  immigration  status.   Given
    that they did not have indefinite leave to remain, that is  undoubtedly
    the case.

16. For the reasons I have given, the appeal should be dismissed.
