                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                       NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL

By e-mail received yesterday from Anjna Joshi  of  Debridge  Solicitors  the
Tribunal was informed that the Appellant was killed  in  a  widely  reported
incident on 27 June 2016.

The Tribunal takes no pleasure in the Appellant's death and  I  respectfully
offer my condolences to those who cared about him.

 The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  make  no  express
provision for the death of a party.  I  apologise  if  my  disposal  of  the
appeal seems insensitive or  clumsy.  I  make  this  ruling  under  my  case
management powers under Rule 5(1).

The appeal before me was an appeal against deportation. My decision  on  the
appeal could not have given any legal status  to  anyone  except,  arguably,
the Appellant. No-one has an interest in  these  proceedings  that  survives
death and there is no  point  in  deciding  an  appeal  that  will  make  no
difference to any person's status.

In the circumstances I find  that  the  appeal  is  withdrawn  by  force  of
circumstance and I direct that the  papers  are  marked  to  show  that  the
appeal is withdrawn.


|Signed                               |                                     |
|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 5 August 2016                  |
