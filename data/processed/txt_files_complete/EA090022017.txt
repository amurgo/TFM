                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Lisa Gibbs), sitting at Hatton Cross on 31 July, to  an
    EEA appeal by a citizen of Sierra Leone, born 1966. The  appellant  had
    married a French citizen on 29 January 2011, and on 23 May 2017 applied
    for a permanent residence card on that basis. On 27  October  this  was
    refused: the reason upheld by the judge was that the appellant had  not
    shown his (by then former) wife had remained a 'qualified person'  till
    the date of the decree absolute dissolving their marriage on  31  March
    2017.

 2. It was common ground however between Mr Cutting and Mr Bramble that

      a)      (as accepted all along) the appellant's  ex-wife  had  been  a
         'qualified person' as a worker for  the  whole  of  the  tax  years
         beginning in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014; so that

      b)       it  followed  that  she  had  become  entitled  to  permanent
         residence at the end of those five years, on 6 April 2015; and

      c)      so had the appellant, once he had been here and married to her
         for five years himself, on 29 January 2016, regardless  of  whether
         his ex-wife would still have been a 'qualified person' on the basis
         of her income; and

      d)      although the two of them had since been divorced,  that  right
         had come into existence on the date in question, and had  not  been
         affected by the dissolution of their marriage.

 3. The judge dealt with the case very shortly  (which  is  good,  in  case
    there should be any doubt about that) and clearly. Where she  seems  to
    have gone wrong is in  her  paragraph  10,  summarizing  Mr  Cuttings's
    argument as being that the appellant had 'got  there'  by  April  2015,
    when his reference had been to the ex-wife. It was indeed the ex-wife's
    status that had to be considered; but, for the reasons at 2, that could
    only have resulted in the appeal being allowed. For those reasons it is
    now allowed by consent.
