Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born on 21 September 1968. On
       12 October 2012 he applied for entry clearance  as  a  partner.  His
       appeal against the decision to refuse that application was dismissed
       by First-tier Tribunal Judge Roopnarine-Davies after a hearing on 20
       November 2013.

    2. The application for entry clearance was refused  with  reference  to
       the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") under Appendix  FM,  section  E-
       ECP, in particular in relation to the financial requirements because
       the appellant did not provide specified documents as set out in  the
       Rules.

    3. The First-tier judge found that the appellant had not  provided  the
       specified documents. Although she found that some of  the  sponsor's
       income had been established, it could not be established  the  basis
       on which the income was received. It was however,  accepted  by  the
       First-tier judge that the appellant and  his  wife  had  savings  of
       �18,000 but these were not savings at a sufficient level  under  the
       Rules because in the absence of satisfactory evidence of  income  of
       �18,600, savings of �62,500 needed to be shown.

    4. The grounds of appeal on which permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal  was  granted  contend  that  the  judge  failed  to   give
       appropriate consideration to  the  fact  that  the  sponsor  was  in
       receipt of disability living allowance ("DLA")  and  therefore  only
       needed to  show  adequate  maintenance.  Other  grounds  related  to
       suggested errors in the proportionality assessment under  Article  8
       of the ECHR. Those grounds were supplemented by a skeleton  argument
       at the hearing before me.

Submissions

    5. I heard initial submissions from Ms Isherwood. She submitted that it
       was for the first time at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal
       that the appellant's partner was said to be in receipt of DLA at the
       time of the decision. The appellant had said on the visa application
       form ("VAF") at question 3.1 (and 3.64) that the sponsor was not  in
       receipt of such a benefit. There was no reference to DLA in question
       4.12 concerning the receipt of any money from public funds. No  such
       evidence was submitted in advance of the Entry  Clearance  Manager's
       Review, or in the appellant's solicitors' letter  dated  15  October
       2012 in support of the application for entry clearance. It  was  not
       raised as an issue in  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal which contended that the appellant was  able  to  meet  the
       financial requirements.

    6. Mr Bandegani agreed that the issue was only raised  at  the  hearing
       but  contended  that  that  was  irrelevant.  The  First-tier  judge
       nevertheless had evidence which was relevant in terms of the date of
       decision. Under the Immigration Directorate's Instructions ("IDI's")
       the appellant only had to establish adequate maintenance.

    7. In relation to the contention that the judge should have taken  into
       account the fact that by the time of the hearing the  appellant  and
       the sponsor had a child and the sponsor  had  been  granted  British
       citizenship, Mr Bandegani contended that AS (Somalia) [2009] UKHL 32
       could be distinguished on the basis that the House of Lords did  not
       consider the duty under section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and
       Immigration Act 2009. In  addition,  the  appellant  in  the  appeal
       before me was in fact in the UK at the time of the hearing which, it
       was said, was another distinguishing feature.

    8. Ms Isherwood in reply submitted that notwithstanding that there  did
       appear to be evidence before the First-tier  judge  of  the  sponsor
       being in receipt of DLA, that was  not  sufficient  given  that  the
       judge was  not  satisfied  as  to  the  evidence  of  the  sponsor's
       outgoings.

    9. In relation to Article 8, AS (Somalia) did consider the question  of
       children coming to the UK. The judge was correct not  to  take  into
       account the British citizenship of the sponsor and their child.

   10. Mr Bandegani's further submissions  were  to  the  effect  that  the
       outcome of the appeal could have been different but for  the  errors
       of law. The judge did  not  reject  the  evidence  of  income,  only
       finding that there was a lack of clarity as to  the  source  of  the
       income. If there is doubt about the issue of maintenance the  matter
       needs to be looked at again.

My assessment

   11. The application for entry clearance  failed  on  the  issue  of  the
       appellant's ability to meet the financial requirements of the Rules.
       The minimum income levels as set out in Appendix FM do not apply  in
       the case of a person who is in receipt  of  DLA  (or  certain  other
       public funds). That is the effect of sections  E-ECP.3.1(c)  and  E-
       ECP.3.3. Where the applicant's partner is  in  receipt  of  DLA  the
       requirement under E-ECP.3.3.(b) is that the applicant:

              "must  provide...evidence  that  their  partner  is  able  to
              maintain and accommodate themselves, the  applicant  and  any
              dependants adequately in the UK without  recourse  to  public
              funds."

   12. The First-tier judge concluded that the appellant was  not  able  to
       meet the requirements of the Rules in terms of the level  of  funds,
       relying on  income  from  employment  or  self-employment,  for  the
       reasons explained above. However,  the  judge  referred  at  [4]  to
       evidence that the sponsor had stopped working in August 2013 and has
       been in receipt of DLA "since April 2013".

   13. There was no oral evidence at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and the hearing proceeded by way of submissions only. It is
       not clear therefore,  where  the  information  about  the  appellant
       having been in receipt of DLA since April  2013  came  from  but  it
       would seem to have  come  from  submissions.  The  grounds  and  the
       appellant's skeleton argument refer to two letters  in  relation  to
       DLA, having been handed to the judge at the hearing. There  are  two
       letters on the Tribunal file (and in the appellant's bundle),  dated
       24 February 2010 and 21 December 2012, addressed to the sponsor, the
       appellant's partner. The former refers to DLA to the sponsor from 22
       December 2008 to 21 December 2012. The latter refers to DLA  to  the
       sponsor from 21 December 2012 to 21 December 2014.

   14. The significance of the dates is  that  the  application  for  entry
       clearance was made on 12 October 2012 and the  decision  made  on  7
       January 2013. It would appear that the  judge  considered  that  the
       receipt of DLA could not have had any impact on the  appeal  because
       it was evidence that post-dated the decision, she  having  concluded
       that DLA was received from April 2013.

   15. Ms Isherwood did eventually concede that there was  evidence  before
       the First-tier judge which revealed that the sponsor was in  receipt
       of DLA at the date of the decision, albeit  that  the  ECO  was  not
       aware of that fact. The ECO was not aware of it because it  was  not
       brought to his/her attention.

   16. Whilst the judge was wrong in finding that the  appellant's  partner
       was receiving DLA only after the  date  of  decision,  that  is  not
       determinative of the  question  of  whether  she  erred  in  law  by
       assessing the financial requirements  in  relation  to  the  precise
       financial thresholds set out in the Rules, as opposed to in terms of
       adequate maintenance.

   17. It is as well to remember  the  findings  that  the  judge  made  in
       relation to the financial evidence  that  she  heard.  There  is  no
       challenge to the judge's findings in this respect. The findings  are
       set out at [6] and [7]. They are that the appellant had not provided
       the specified evidence in relation to his partner's self-employment,
       including "scant" evidence of ongoing self employment as required by
       paragraph 7(g) of Appendix FM-SE. She  found  that  the  absence  of
       audited  accounts  as   required   by   paragraph   7(h)   and   the
       "corresponding scrutiny associated with them undermines the veracity
       of  the  earnings."  Although  personal  bank  statements  had  been
       provided for May to October 2012 there had been  little  attempt  to
       show that the source of the deposits had been from the claimed trade
       of ladies fashion and that there was "scant" evidence of the  nature
       of the business. She concluded that little weight could be  attached
       to the unaudited accounts.

   18. At [7] the judge stated that  she  accepted  that  the  sponsor  had
       received �4,764 from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust between
       24 October 2011 and 24 January  2012  but  due  to  the  failure  to
       produce specified documents it was difficult  to  ascertain  whether
       those payments were from a job or other payments. The judge went  on
       to state that "There is a  consistent  lack  of  clarity  about  the
       various claims and little attempt to substantiate the claims to  the
       required standard", for example little  attempt  to  show  that  the
       sponsor worked for 10 years at an NHS Trust until made redundant  in
       2012, as had been claimed on the VAF. It was concluded that all that
       could be said, on  balance,  was  that  she  received  approximately
       �5,900 income for the tax years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The �18,000
       savings that they have was not a sum that met  the  requirements  of
       the Rules which required savings of �62,500 where the  evidence  did
       not show income of �18,600.

   19. It is also  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  basis  of  the
       application for entry clearance was  in  terms  of  the  appellant's
       income from employment and self-employment. It was  never  suggested
       in the application for entry clearance that the appellant  only  had
       to show adequate maintenance because his partner was in  receipt  of
       DLA. Neither was this raised in the grounds of appeal to the  First-
       tier Tribunal. Furthermore, it is clear from  the  determination  of
       the First-tier judge that the case was advanced before  her  on  the
       basis of income from employment and self-employment, rather than  in
       relation to adequate maintenance because of the receipt of DLA.  The
       judge made reference to evidence of DLA and it does appear that  the
       letters in relation to DLA that were produced at  the  hearing  were
       not referred to in  the  determination.  However,  the  DLA/adequate
       maintenance argument was nevertheless not advanced before her.

   20. I do not consider that the need only to  show  adequate  maintenance
       was a matter that was 'Robinson' obvious, particularly in the  light
       of the way the case was put. In these circumstances I do not  accept
       that it could be said that the judge erred in  law  in  not  dealing
       with an issue that was never advanced before her.

   21. Even if it could be said that the judge erred in law, it was not  an
       error of law that could have affected the outcome of the appeal.  It
       was accepted before me on behalf of the appellant that there  was  a
       requirement to provide specified evidence, even in cases  where  DLA
       is relied on and only adequate maintenance needs  to  be  shown.  Mr
       Bandegani was not in a position to make submissions to me as to what
       evidence the appellant would have needed to provide to make good the
       case in terms of adequate maintenance.

   22. Paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules provides  that  "adequate"  and
       "adequately"  in  relation  to  a  maintenance   and   accommodation
       requirement  means  that  after  income  tax,   national   insurance
       contributions and housing costs have been  deducted  there  must  be
       available to the family the level of income  that would be available
       to them if the  family  was  in  receipt  of  income  support.  This
       reflects what is in the IDI's relied on by the  appellant.  It  also
       reflects the decision of KA and  Others  (Adequacy  of  maintenance)
       Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065.

   23. Although it is said in the skeleton  argument  for  the  proceedings
       before me at [5] that the appellant provided evidence that  adequate
       maintenance could be met, there is no analysis of  the  evidence  or
       the basis on which it is said that the evidence supports  the  claim
       of  adequate  maintenance,  apart  from  the  statement   that   the
       appropriate income support yardstick is "around �70 per week".

   24. I have not been provided with precise information as to  the  income
       support rates. However, this is information in the public domain. At
       the date of decision, the rate for 2012/2013 for a couple  over  the
       age of 18 was �111.45. It may be, although again no information  was
       provided to me on the issue,  that  Ms  Wellington  the  appellant's
       partner,  may  be  entitled,  if  receiving  income  support,  to  a
       disability premium, given her receipt of DLA. The rate for a  couple
       at the relevant time was �43.25 although again, I was  not  provided
       with any information on the issue on behalf  of  the  appellant  and
       whether there would be any entitlements in  terms  of  a  disability
       premium was not the subject of any evidence or argument  before  me,
       notwithstanding  that  the  appellant  relies  on  the  hypothetical
       yardstick of income support.

   25. According to the letter from the  DWP  dated  21  December  2012  Ms
       Wellington was awarded DLA at  the  rate  of  �54.05  per  week  for
       mobility from 22 December 2012 until 21 December  2014,  and  �20.55
       per week for the same period. The  total  is  therefore  �74.60  per
       week.[1] In order to meet the income  support  level  the  appellant
       needs to show income of at least �111.45 with an  additional  �64.99
       for each of the sponsor's children who were under 18 at the date  of
       decision, with a family premium of �17.40. The total therefore would
       be �258.83. That is aside from any question of whether  that  figure
       would be increased by reason of any disability premium.  Unless  the
       appellant can rely on  some  other  source  of  income,  the  income
       support yardstick is not met in terms of income.

   26. As has been seen, the First-tier judge was not satisfied as  to  the
       evidence in relation to Ms Wellington's income. She  did  find  that
       �5,900 had been received for the tax years 2011/2012  and  2012/2013
       (see [7]) which appears to be a rough addition of �4,764 and �1,163.
       However, in fact only the �1,163 was anywhere close to the  date  of
       decision or application, having been received in  August  2012  (the
       application having been made on 12 October 2012). In any  case,  the
       judge also concluded that under the Rules this income could  not  be
       taken into account as the specified documents had not been provided.

   27. Again, although I was not referred  to  the  Rules  in  relation  to
       specified documents where adequate maintenance only is  required  to
       be shown, paragraphs 12 and 12A of Appendix FM-SE would seem  to  be
       relevant. A person only having to show adequate maintenance because,
       for example, the person is in receipt of DLA, the Rule requires much
       the same by way of documentary evidence as was found by  the  First-
       tier judge not to have been provided.

   28. Although the First-tier judge  found  that  the  appellant  and  his
       partner have savings of �18,000, paragraph 11 of Appendix  FM-SE  as
       it applied at the date of decision requires, in  summary,  that  the
       cash savings must have been held in an  account  for  at  least  six
       months prior to the date of application.  Paragraph  11  applies  in
       relation to savings by virtue of paragraph 12A(e).[2]  There  is  no
       analysis on behalf  of  the  appellant  in  terms  of  whether  this
       requirement is met. On my own assessment of the bank statements  (in
       the appellant's, his partner's or joint names)  in  the  appellant's
       and respondent's bundles, the six months requirement is not met. The
       level of savings that the appellant and his partner can rely  on  as
       helping to establish that the maintenance requirement is met has not
       been explained, either in terms of the period of time for which they
       have, jointly or severally, held savings or how long  those  savings
       would last.

   29. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the First-tier judge  erred  in
       law in her assessment of whether the appellant was able to meet  the
       financial requirements of the Rules.  Although  there  was  evidence
       before her that the appellant's partner was in receipt of  DLA,  the
       case was advanced on the basis that the appellant was able  to  meet
       the  relevant  requirements  through  his  partner's   income   from
       employment and self-employment. In any event, on the  basis  of  the
       evidence that was put before the First-tier judge, even if it  could
       not be said that there was an error of law in terms of  the  failure
       to assess the adequacy of maintenance, that is  not  an  error  that
       could have affected the outcome of the appeal on the evidence before
       her.

   30. In relation to Article 8 of the ECHR it is said that the judge erred
       in law by failing to take into account evidence that  the  appellant
       and his partner have a child, born on 13 November 2013, and that his
       partner was granted British citizenship in July  2013.  Both  events
       are said to have been "foreseeable" and thus the restriction on post-
       decision evidence  mandated  by  section  85A  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") did not prevent the
       judge from taking that evidence into account.

   31. This argument in  my  view  has  no  merit.  In  relation  to  their
       daughter, she was born 10 months after the  date  of  decision.  The
       child's birth  could  not  possibly  be  said  to  evidence  of  the
       circumstances "appertaining"  at  the  time  of  the  decision.  The
       argument as set  out  in  the  skeleton  argument  at  [11]  and  in
       submissions, to the effect that it is foreseeable that a married and
       committed couple could have a child in the first year of marriage is
       simply unsustainable. That presupposes  that  it  is  the  norm  and
       therefore foreseeable that such a  couple  would  want  to  start  a
       family in the first year of marriage, or at  all  for  that  matter.
       Furthermore, it presupposes that the couple are able to conceive  in
       that time. These are just the two most obvious reasons as to why the
       proposition of foreseability relied on has no merit.

   32. I take the same view in relation to the grant of citizenship  to  Ms
       Wellington, an event that took place six months after  the  date  of
       decision. A grant of citizenship does not automatically follow  from
       a grant of  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  still  less  within  any
       particular time period. No evidence was adduced which indicated that
       a grant of citizenship was to  be  made  and/or  that  it  would  be
       granted.

   33. Having rejected those arguments, it follows that the  contention  in
       relation to the financial requirements as  set  out  in  the  Rules,
       relying on the decision of Blake J in MM [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)
       has no foundation. That was a decision relating to  British  citizen
       and refugee sponsors.  At  the  date  of  decision  the  appellant's
       partner was not a British citizen and evidence in  relation  to  her
       citizenship could not be taken into account for the reasons  I  have
       given.

   34. Lastly, it was argued that the decision in AS (Somalia) [2009]  UKHL
       32 (which confirms that the limitation on evidence as to the date of
       decision in entry clearance  cases  applies  in  relation  to  human
       rights grounds) can be distinguished on the facts  of  this  appeal,
       although the  skeleton  argument  does  not  in  fact  refer  to  AS
       (Somalia). It is said that the  House  of  Lords  did  not  consider
       section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
       (because the Act had not been passed). However, I  cannot  see  that
       section 55 makes any difference in that the House of Lords concluded
       that section 85(5) of the 2002 Act was  not  incompatible  with  the
       European  Convention.  Section  55  would  not  have  altered   that
       conclusion. Their Lordships considered the 2002 Act in  the  context
       of cases that may involve children.

   35. It is also said that this appellant's case is different from the run-
       of-the-mill entry clearance case because the appellant was in the UK
       "at the relevant time", as it was put in submissions.  According  to
       the appellant's witness statement he arrived  on  26  January  2013,
       pursuant to a grant of entry clearance as a visitor. The refusal  of
       entry clearance decision (as a partner) was made on 7 January  2013.
       Be that as it may, the appellant is still in the UK and was  present
       at the hearing of the appeal before the Upper Tribunal. That  he  is
       in the UK is a relevant factor it is suggested. As I understood  the
       argument, it was suggested that there  is  no  practical  difference
       between his case and one in which  the  appellant  is  applying  for
       leave to remain from within the UK.

   36. I do not agree. Aside from anything else, the  appellant's  presence
       in the UK cannot affect the application of section 85(A) of the 2002
       Act in relation to what evidence can be taken into account.  In  the
       second place, the logical conclusion of  the  argument  is  that  an
       appellant would be able to circumvent the statute either by entering
       the country illegally, or by overstaying. As to the  latter,  it  is
       the case that this appellant is now an overstayer, as is  implicitly
       accepted in his witness statement at [2], regardless of  whether  or
       not his legal representatives have or  have  not  given  him  advice
       about that. It could not be said that the decision in AS allowed for
       a distinction to be made in cases similar to that of this  appellant
       where the  person  is  in  the  UK.  Their  Lordships  were  clearly
       considering the distinction in the 2002 Act between entry  clearance
       cases and those where an application was made from  within  the  UK,
       which do not attract the same restriction on  the  admissibility  of
       evidence.

   37. In summary, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law in the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal, or any that could have affected
       the outcome of the appeal.

Decision

   38. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making
       of an error on a point  of  law.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal to dismiss the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and  on
       human rights grounds stands.
