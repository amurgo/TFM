                           DECISION AND DIRECTION


 1. Further to the preliminary decision of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Jackson
    dated 13 January 2020, the parties have provided a signed consent order
    agreeing that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  a
    material error on a point of law and that it should be  set  aside  and
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking.

 2. The Tribunal therefore follows the disposal set out in the decision  of
    Judge Jackson, finds error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, sets it  aside  and  remits  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Hatton Cross) to be heard other than  before  Judge  Verghis.
    The findings of fact in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the First-tier  Tribunal
    are preserved.
