Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Khan - Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                      DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by Ms Florence Henewaa a citizen of Ghana  born  11th
    December 1983.  She appeals against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State made on 4th September 2013 to refuse to grant a residence card as
    the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and the appeal  was  heard
    by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Walters  who  allowed  it  under   the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and set  out  his
    reasons in a determination issued on 2nd April 2014.  The Secretary  of
    State sought to appeal  against  that  determination.   Permission  was
    granted and on 4th June 2014, having heard submissions,  I  found  that
    there was a material error of law in the determination of Judge Walters
    and I set it aside with no preserved findings of fact.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the  application  because  she  was  not
    satisfied that the Appellant and her partner Mr Duah are in  a  durable
    relationship.

 4. The Appellant had entered the UK on 16th June 2009 as  a  dependant  on
    her previous husband who was here as a student.  His name was Mr Ofori.
     She had a visa valid until  31st  August  2009  and  was  subsequently
    granted an extension of stay until 30th August 2011 by which  time  her
    relationship with Mr Ofori had broken  down  and  he  had  returned  to
    Ghana.  The marriage was dissolved on 4th April 2011.  She met Mr  Duah
    on 4th July 2011 in the UK and  they  undertook  a  Ghanaian  customary
    marriage by proxy on 14th February 2012.  Mr Duah is a citizen  of  the
    Netherlands and also of Ghana.

 5. The couple were interviewed by the Home Office on 8th August  2013  and
    in deciding to refuse the application the Secretary of State relied  on
    discrepancies in the answers given to the questions asked at interview.



 6. I have a statement from the Appellant which is  undated  in  which  she
    deals with the issues raised  by  the  Secretary  of  State  about  the
    responses given at the interview.  She states the following:

 7. She did have a customary marriage with Mr  Ofori  then  they  divorced.
    She describes how she  met  Mr  Duah.   Her  first  application  for  a
    residence card was refused.  Her solicitors advised her not  to  appeal
    that decision but to make a fresh application and she did this.  It  is
    the refusal of that application that is the  subject  of  this  appeal.
    She complains that the Home Office relied on internal checks  conducted
    by them but never produced any evidence of those checks to her  so  she
    had not been able to comment on them.  Discrepancies in the address  on
    the payslips of Mr Duah arose because he had not had a chance to notify
    his employers that he had changed his address.  Sometimes his  payslips
    were sent to her address and sometimes they were sent to his  workplace
    where he went to pick them up.  They bought rings after their customary
    marriage ceremony.  They were not  wedding  rings.   Mr  Duah  did  not
    understand the question as being about  wedding  rings.   She  disputes
    other answers that were founded on by the Home  Office,  saying    that
    some of the answers she gave were not right because  she  was  pregnant
    and feeling very stressed and had travelled a long way  late  at  night
    from Luton to Liverpool.  She does indeed give a very detailed response
    to the matters raised by the Secretary of State.  She says that the age
    gap between her and her husband is irrelevant.  They were  asked  about
    the colour of their bedding.   Her  partner  gave  the  colour  of  the
    bedding in the hotel in which they had stayed the night before and  she
    gave the colour of the bedding in their home.  Some  of  the  questions
    they had not understood properly.  Points were made  about  answers  to
    questions they gave about her employment.  They had nothing to lose  by
    not telling the truth about that.  Their answers  were  misinterpreted.
    Answers that she gave were omitted such as that at question 90 she  did
    say that she worked for Collinson House and this was not noted.

 8. With regard to DNA testing which had been  ordered  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal she says that Mr Duah had a previous experience where he found
    out, following DNA tests, that a child he  thought  was  his  was  not.
    They have evidence of this from Holland.  Mr Duah divorced  the  mother
    of the child.  He found the whole thing absolutely devastating.  He had
    spent fourteen years of his life believing he was the  father  of  this
    child and then found out he was not.  He is not  therefore  willing  to
    undertake a DNA test again.

 9. I have a statement from Mr Duah who also goes through the interview and
    deals with the various discrepancies raised  by  the  Home  Office,  in
    essence repeating what the Appellant  said  in  her  statement.  It  is
    indeed virtually the same statement, identical in its explanations  for
    the alleged discrepancies and gaps in their evidence.

10. I have bank statements and payslips.

11. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant  who  adopted  her  statement.
    She was tendered for cross-examination and told Mr Melvin that she  had
    met her husband in July 2011 by chance in Luton town  centre.   It  was
    about five months later that they  decided  to  get  married  and  they
    underwent a proxy marriage in Ghana.  She had married her first husband
    in Ghana but she had attended that wedding ceremony.  She and  Mr  Duah
    had no money to have a celebration of their wedding in the UK and  they
    did not exchange gifts.  There is no doubt in her mind that he  is  the
    father of her child.  Since they married he has  travelled  to  Holland
    and Ghana.  He has two children in Holland  aged  12  and  10  and  has
    visited them three times since their marriage.   He  is  divorced  from
    their mother with whom the children live.

12. I heard evidence from Mr Duah who also adopted his statement.

13. In cross-examination he confirmed that he has been working  in  the  UK
    since 2007 when he came here.  He works as a warehouse  assistant.   He
    became a citizen of the Netherlands in 1999 the year  he  was  divorced
    from his previous wife.  When he was asked how many children he had  in
    Holland he said he had one and when asked to explain this said that the
    child's mother is taking him to court saying that one child is not his.
     He sends money to them and visits them.  He said that due to financial
    difficulties he and the Appellant do not go out very much  and  do  not
    have money for birthday presents.  With regard to the DNA  testing  the
    child in Holland was born in 1997 and  he  has  looked  after  him  for
    fourteen years.  He would be devastated  if  the  same  thing  happened
    again and would be unable to cope with it.  At his previous hearing  he
    broke down in tears because he was asked about DNA.

14. In his submissions Mr Melvin said that there is  insufficient  evidence
    of a traditional proxy marriage in this case.  He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant does not meet the requirements of Regulations 7  or  8(5)  of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  The  emails
    that have been produced are not detailed  enough  to  substantiate  the
    marriage.  In any event there is no evidence that the  relationship  is
    durable.  They claim to have been together for  three  years  but  they
    know nothing of each other.  Mr Duah has money to go to Holland but not
    to buy the Appellant a birthday present.   He asked me  not  to  accept
    the explanation for not undergoing DNA testing.

15. Ms Khan sought to rely on her skeleton argument in  which  she  submits
    that the requirements of the EEA Regulations are met.   She  relied  on
    the decision TA and Others (Kareem explained) Ghana [2014]  UKUT  00316
    submitting that there is cogent evidence in the bundle which shows that
    efforts were made to contact the Dutch Embassy in London whose response
    was to refer the Appellant to the Dutch Civil Code  at  Section  10,  a
    copy of which is in the bundle.  This shows  that  marriages  conducted
    overseas are recognised under the Dutch Civil Code if the  place  where
    they  are  conducted  recognises  it.   Ghanaian  customary   marriages
    conducted by proxy are recognised in the UK so they would be recognised
    in Holland.  The marriage of the Appellant and the Sponsor is therefore
    valid.  The couple are in a genuine relationship.  The Appellant  moved
    in with her husband   at  his  address  in  Luton  in  September  2011.
    Evidence  that  they  cohabit  has  been  provided.   The  couple  have
    clarified the points raised by the Secretary of State arising from  the
    interview.  The inconsistencies identified are very small. They are not
    significant.  The marriage is not one of  convenience.   This  has  not
    been established.  The Appellant was seven months pregnant at the  date
    of interview and was  not  at  her  best.   This  was  not  taken  into
    consideration.

16. The couple have expressed their dissatisfaction with  the  conduct  and
    behaviour of the interviewing  officer.   Reliance  is  placed  on  the
    decision  Papajorgji (EEA spouse  -  marriage  of  convenience)  Greece
    [2012] 38.   In that case it was said that there is  no  burden  on  an
    applicant to prove that a marriage to an EEA national is not a marriage
    of convenience, and only where there was evidence justifying reasonable
    suspicion that the  marriage  was  entered  into  for  the  predominant
    purpose of  securing  residence  rights,  is  there  a  burden  on  the
    applicant to rebut it.  It is not proper in the Appellant's  case  that
    the Respondent relied on a small number of minor inconsistencies in the
    interview to suggest that the marriage is one of convenience.  Even  if
    the marriage is not accepted there is ample evidence to show that  they
    are in a  durable  relationship  and  thus  meet  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 8.

17. In oral submissions she said that the Home Office ought to have made  a
    home visit and that would have assisted with resolving the issue.



My findings

18. I have given very careful consideration to all the evidence put  before
    me in this case.

19. As far as the EEA Regulations are concerned the burden of proof  is  on
    the  Appellant  and  the  standard  of  proof  is  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

20. I accept that here is some evidence that the Appellant and Sponsor live
    together. There are utility bills,  bank statements  etc  addressed  to
    each of them individually at the same address and there is  a   Council
    Tax bill  in their joint names. I accept that the birth certificate  of
    the child shows the Sponsor as his father. I accept that the Sponsor is
    exercising Treaty Rights in the UK.

21. I do however  have serious concerns  about  the  relationship  and  the
    evidence of it. There  are  discrepancies  in  the  evidence  and  some
    elements of their account are arguably implausible, such  as  the  fact
    that the Appellant appears to know nothing about the Sponsor's previous
    relationship and the reasons expressed by both  of  them  in  identical
    terms for the fact that his children, who he visits in  Holland,   know
    nothing of the Appellant and she does not want to meet them.  I  accept
    that  some of the discrepancies in answers given at the  interview  are
    minor and indeed that people interpret questions in different ways  but
    looking at the accounts of the Appellant and Sponsor and  the  evidence
    in the round, serious questions arise about the  genuineness  of  their
    relationship. I do not accept the  submission  of   Ms  Khan  that  the
    inconsistencies in the responses given to the  questions  at  interview
    are minor to the extent that the Respondent had no grounds to justify a
    reasonable suspicion that the marriage is one of convenience.

22. The factors I take into account in reaching this conclusion are:

         i) The Appellant's relationship with her  first  husband  ended  in
         February 2011 and  they divorced in April 2011. She met the Sponsor
         in July 2011 and the day after they met he took her to his home,  a
         house  in  which  her  previous  husband,  an  EEA  national,   had
         apparently lived between December 2008 and August  2009,  the  time
         during which she had applied for leave to  enter   the  UK  as  his
         partner. The Appellant's explanation for apparently  being  unaware
         of this was that she had only come to the UK on 16th June 2009  and
         did not know where her previous husband lived between December 2008
         and August 2009. She gives a different address that  she  lived  at
         with him from June 2009 but it is inconceivable  that  if  she  was
         making an application  to come to the UK she would not  have  known
         her husband's address here. I do accept that the Respondent has not
         produced documentary evidence of this but I must  assume  that  the
         Respondent has a record of the Appellant's  previous  husband   and
         that that information would be available to the Respondent.

         ii) When the officer at  the  interview  asked  the  Appellant  and
         Sponsor about telephone contact they said that  that  they  do  not
         text each other and do not call often as  they  live  in  the  same
         house, but they both worked, were  presumably thus  apart  all  day
         and she was pregnant.  She said she could  not  remember  the  last
         time she phoned him or he  her. The interviewing officer then asked
         to see  their phones and noted that  the only calls  recorded  were
         one from the Appellant to her husband at  11.34  pm  on  the  night
         before the interview, the night they were staying  at  the  Premier
         Inn,  and one from the Sponsor to the Appellant at  8.00am  on  the
         day of the interview. The explanations were that the call the night
         before was just an accidental call to the Sponsor's number and  the
         one in the morning was the Sponsor calling the Appellant's phone to
         locate it because she could not find  it.   In  her  statement  her
         response to this is that it is perfectly possible for a  couple  to
         be in the same hotel and call each other  or  to  call  each  other
         accidentally. She also asks  why would she make that  call  if  she
         was not with him which does not make a lot of sense. I  would  also
         say that I find it odd that despite claiming to  phone  each  other
         only rarely each was able to recite the mobile number of the  other
         at the interview.

         iii) iv) Despite the fact that the  Sponsor  claims  to  have  sent
         �1000 to  Ghana  for  the  proxy  marriage  in  3  instalments  the
         Appellant appears to be unaware of this and said  he had only  sent
         the fee of �100.

         v) The Appellant said they did not have wedding rings.  She  has  a
         ring  but it is not a wedding ring. The Sponsor said they both have
         wedding rings - they went separately to buy them after they got the
         wedding documents. In the Appellant's response she said   that  the
         Sponsor  did not understand the question to be about wedding rings.
         This makes little sense as her husband' s response to the question,
         'Do you both have wedding rings? Was 'Yes,  we  both  have  wedding
         rings'. His explanation for not wearing the ring to  the  interview
         was that he was wearing a silver bracelet and the gold ring did not
         match.

         vi)The Sponsor refused to have a DNA test to establish that  he  is
         the father of the Appellant's child. The reason  given  is  that  a
         child of his first wife who he brought up for fourteen   years  was
         found following DNA testing not to be his and he was devastated. He
         could not bear to go through that again.  He  said  that  there  is
         evidence of this in the bundle that is in Dutch and that  it  would
         be  translated.  What  I  have  is  a  divorce   certificate.   The
         translation provided is of only one page out of two.  There  is  no
         evidence of the DNA results and nothing  from  the  mother  of  the
         child to confirm the  situation.  I  am  not  even  sure  how  many
         children he has had. I do not accept that in the circumstances that
         the application  for leave was refused the Sponsor would refuse  to
         have a DNA test done.

         vii) The Sponsor has not in my view been candid about his  previous
         relationships. I have tried to unravel the information and evidence
         before me but it has been very difficult and  I  cannot  understand
         why this element of the  evidence  was  not  properly  and  clearly
         presented.  The Sponsor  said at one point that he had two children
         aged 12 and 10, then that he had one. When it was put to  him  that
         he had said he had two, he then said that there is a  14  year  old
         who he thought was his but was found not to be  after  DNA  testing
         was done. The partly translated divorce  certificate  refers  to  a
         marriage in 1993, and a child born in 1997. It is  said  that  they
         have this child 'together' and  the  wife  is  named  as  Millicent
         Keerdijk.  He said in his recent statement he is divorced from  the
         mother of the two children he visits in Holland.   He  said  in  an
         earlier statement that  after he divorced Millicent in 1999 he  had
         a relationship with Dina Fei between 2003 and 2007  but  they  were
         not married. He then said at paragraph 23 of his  second  statement
         that the Appellant would not know anything about 'his  ex-wife  who
         is the mother of his children'. At paragraph 24 he  said  that  the
         children were only 9 and 10 at the time of the interview.  If  this
         is so the children's mother is presumably Dina Fei since they  must
         have been born around 2002-2004, more than three  years  after  his
         divorce from Millicent. In his interview he  responded  'no'  to  a
         question of whether he was married to Millicent.

         viii) Discrepant evidence was given  at  the  interview  about  who
         lives  in  the  same  house  as  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor.  The
         explanation of the Appellant for this was that she was stressed  by
         her pregnancy and the journey to Liverpool.

23. As I have already said there is evidence in this case of a relationship
    and indeed of cohabitation but I  have  had  reason  to  question  this
    evidence. In addition to the points raised  above  I  have  taken  into
    account the following factors.

24. There are several discrepancies in the interview answers  that  I  have
    been urged to treat as inconsequential. While some of these are minor I
    would note simply that the question about the bedding  was  very  clear
    and specific as was that about the number of the television sets in the
    house.

25. Mr Tarlow made much of the fact that the Appellants had not  celebrated
    their marriage and did not exchange  Christmas  or  birthday  presents.
    That of itself can be  given  limited  weight  but  the  fact  is  that
    according to the payslips provided the couple earned around  �2000  per
    month and yet said they had no  money  to  go  out  and  no  money  for
    presents. The sponsor said they have money problems  but  there  is  no
    evidence of that.  They  just  seemed  disinterested  in  the  idea  of
    celebrating their marriage or exchanging  gifts  and  surprised  to  be
    asked about it.   They said they had  no  common  interests  and  speak
    about each other and their child but the Appellant could not  name  any
    of her husband's workmates and had never met any  of  them.  They  have
    never gone on a trip. They never phone or text each  other  during  the
    day despite the pregnancy and now the existence of a child. They  could
    not mention a single thing they do or enjoy together.  They  appear  to
    have lived at several different addresses and despite having  moved  in
    together  in  December  2011  they  are  still     living   in   shared
    accommodation with their child. There is  no  sense  of  permanency  in
    their description of their relationship.

26. I formed the view in the course of  oral  evidence  that  there  was  a
    reluctance on the part of both the Appellant and the  Sponsor  to  give
    any details of their relationship. Everything they said was shrouded in
    vagueness and no picture of a married or shared life emerged. I find it
    very difficult to understand why they would both have mobile phones but
    never use them even when  both  were  working  and  the  Appellant  was
    pregnant. I question how if they rarely use them each knew the  other's
    number by heart and I question why the only two calls on the phone were
    recorded late the night before  and  early  on  the  morning  of  their
    interview when they claim to have been together in the Premier Inn.   I
    do not accept the explanations given for these calls especially in  the
    circumstances that the phones were rarely used.

27. I do not accept that this is a genuine relationship. I agree with First-
    tier Judge Walters that there  are issues arising from the  Dissolution
    of Marriage document  relating to the Appellant's previous marriage.  I
    do however make no finding on the validity of the  marriage  because  I
    conclude that it was a marriage of convenience,  undertaken  solely  to
    enable an application for leave to remain in the UK under EEA law.   In
    reaching this decision I take account of  the  Appellant's  immigration
    history and the couple's account of how they  met  and  embarked  on  a
    relationship. I take account of all the factors mentioned above.  I  do
    not  accept  that  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  are   in   a   durable
    relationship. I do accept that they have a relationship  of  sorts  and
    that the Appellant has a child. There is no evidence that  the  Sponsor
    is the father and while the  fact  that   his  name  is  on  the  birth
    certificate gives rise to a presumption that  he  is  the  father  that
    presumption is  outweighed by  the  lack  of  credible  evidence  of  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.   I do not accept that  what  they
    have is either a genuine marriage, a relationship akin to  marriage  or
    an enduring relationship.

28. Given my findings I find that Article 8 ECHR is not engaged.
