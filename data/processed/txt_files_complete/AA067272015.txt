                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everritt;   Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  and  reasons  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Landes promulgated on 28th September 2015 in which he
       allowed an appeal against a decision made by the Secretary of  State
       on 25th March 2015 to refuse an application made by Mr. Andrew Cafï¿½,
       in the form of representations, for leave to remain  in  the  UK  on
       Article 8 grounds.


    2. The appellant before me, is the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department and the respondent to this appeal, is  Mr.  Andrew  Cafe.
       However for ease of reference, in the  course  of  this  decision  I
       shall adopt the parties' status as  it  was  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.  I shall in this  decision,  refer  to  Mr.  Cafe  as  the
       appellant and the Secretary of State as the respondent.


    3. The appellant is a national of the Philippines.   The  background  to
       the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set out at paragraphs  [1]
       to [9]  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   At
       paragraphs [10] to [18] of her decision,  the  Judge  refers  to  the
       matters raised at the hearing before her.  The Judge's  findings  and
       reasons are to be found at paragraphs [23] to [71] of her decision.


    4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Baker
       on 14th October 2015.  The matter comes before me to consider whether
       or not the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes involved  the
       making of a material  error  of  law,  and  if  so,  to  re-make  the
       decision.


    5. The respondent  submits  that  the  in  allowing  the  appeal  under
       paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, the Judge
       made findings that are irrational to the extent that they amount  to
       a material error of law.  The  respondent  submits  that  the  Judge
       found at paragraph [59] that the appellant's  close  family  support
       him and therefore the couple would have some assistance re-adapting,
       or in the case of Mr Preston adapting, to life in  the  Philippines.
       The respondent  submits  that  the  Judge's  subsequent  finding  at
       paragraph  [60]  of  her  decision  that  there  are  insurmountable
       obstacles to family life continuing  in  the  Philippines,  was  not
       properly and rationally open, to the Judge on  the  evidence  before
       her.  The respondent submits that a finding that  the  situation  in
       the Philippines may be less favourable than in the UK cannot lead to
       the conclusion that there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
       life continuing outside the UK.  Similarly,  in  an  'inter-national
       marriage', it is inevitable that one partner  will  be  living  away
       from close family with whom they have a close relationship and  thus
       it is irrational for the Judge to have found that  the  difficulties
       that Mr Preston will face in leaving his mother and his siblings, to
       whom he is  very  close,  and  the  difficulties  he  is  likely  to
       experience in carrying on his career, can amount  to  insurmountable
       obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.


    6. Ms Everritt adopts  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  submits  that  at
       paragraph [60] of her decision, the Judge  does  not  give  adequate
       reasons for her finding that the 'insurmountable obstacles test'  is
       met by the appellant. She submits that whilst it  is  understandable
       that the appellant and his partner would not wish to  live  together
       in the Philippines, none of the  factors  relied  upon  by  the  the
       Appellant and his partner, are insurmountable.


    7. In reply, the appellant submits that both he and his  partner  would
       face considerable hardship in the Philippines because their marriage
       would not be recognised and that  in  itself  is  an  insurmountable
       obstacle to their living together outside the UK. He submits that he
       and his partner  would  have  to  live  discreetly  and  would  face
       discrimination.  The appellant  submits  that  the  Judge  carefully
       considered all  of  the  evidence,  and  accepted  the  considerable
       hardship that the appellant and his partner would face  if  excepted
       to live outside the UK.


 Discussion


    8. The issue for me to decide is whether or not the Judge  was  entitled
       to conclude that there are insurmountable obstacles to the  appellant
       and his partner continuing their relationship in the Philippines.


    9. In that respect I follow the guidance of the Court of Appeal in  R  &
       ors (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982.  The Court of Appeal held that
       a finding might only be set aside for error of law on the grounds  of
       perversity if it was irrational or  unreasonable  in  the  Wednesbury
       sense, or one that was wholly unsupported by the evidence.  A finding
       that  is  "perverse"  embraces  findings  that  are   irrational   or
       unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense, and findings of fact  that  are
       wholly unsupported by the evidence.  On appeal,  the  Upper  Tribunal
       should not overturn a judgment at first instance,  unless  it  really
       could not understand the original judge's thought process when he was
       making material findings. I apply that guidance to  my  consideration
       of the decision in this appeal.


   10. I have also had regard to the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set  aside)  [2013]  UKUT  00085  IAC
       where it was stated in the head note that:


           "Although there is a legal duty to give a brief  explanation  of
           the conclusions on the central issue  on  which  the  appeal  is
           determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the  decision
           as a whole makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted
           by the judge."


   11. It is useful to set out the requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  of
       Appendix FM insofar as it is material to this appeal.


           EX.1. This paragraph applies if


           ....


           (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
           a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in
           the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
           protection, and there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
           life with that partner continuing outside the UK.


           EX.2. For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
           obstacles" means the very significant difficulties  which  would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their
           family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner.


   12. The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in EX1 of the Rules has
       been described as significantly more demanding than a  mere  test  of
       whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to  continue  their
       family life outside of the UK. The phrase "used in the Rules"  is  to
       be interpreted in a sensible and practical way rather than an  overly
       literal way and in the decision of Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -
       correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640  it  was  held  that  the  term
       "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as  EX1  are   not
       obstacles which are impossible to surmount and that they concern  the
       practical possibilities of relocation (see MF (Article 8 - new Rules)
       Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393 and Izuazu (Article 8  -  new  Rules)  [2013]
       UKUT 45.


   13. At paragraphs [37] and [38] of her  decision,  the  Judge  refers  to
       paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM and at paragraphs [40] to [42],  the
       Judge sets out the evidence of Mr. Preston in particular.  The  Judge
       found the appellant's partner, Mr. Preston  to  be  a  very  credible
       witness on most points.  At paragraphs [48] to [58] of her  decision,
       the Judge carefully considers the objective evidence  and  background
       material that was before her concerning homosexual marriages  in  the
       Philippines.   At  paragraph  [60]  she   found   that   whilst   the
       discrimination does not appear to be very severe and the couple would
       in practice be able to live together in the Philippines,  they  would
       not be able to be officially recognized as a family as  there  is  no
       public recognition of their union.


   14. The Judge's findings at paragraph [60] have to be read as a whole. In
       my judgment, there can be a world of  difference,  depending  on  the
       particular case, between expecting a  foreign  national,  albeit  now
       settled here, to return with his family to his country, and as  here,
       expecting a British citizen who has lived here all of  his  life  and
       has an inalienable right of abode here, to live  and  work  and  find
       accommodation in a foreign country  or  forfeit  his  marriage.   The
       Judge found that upon the particular facts and circumstances  of  the
       appeal before her,  Mr.  Preston  would  not  be  recognised  as  the
       appellant's family member, he has  not  had  previous  experience  of
       society  in  the  Philippines,  he  would  be  likely  to   encounter
       discrimination and he would be leaving family to whom he is close  in
       the UK.


   15. In my judgment, the findings made by the Judge were all open  to  her
       on the evidence and when properly read, it cannot be  said  that  the
       findings and conclusions reached by the Judge at  paragraph  [60]  of
       her  decision  are  perverse,  irrational  or  unreasonable  in   the
       Wednesbury sense, or findings that were  wholly  unsupported  by  the
       evidence.


   16. As set out at paragraph [39] of the decision, it was accepted by  the
       Presenting Officer that at if the appellant met the  requirements  of
       EX.1, then he would succeed.   Having found that the requirements  of
       EX.1(b) were met there was no need for the  Judge  to  carry  out  an
       assessment of the Article 8 claim outwith the rules.


   17. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed and the decision  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal stands.
