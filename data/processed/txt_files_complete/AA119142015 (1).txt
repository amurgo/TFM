                           FINDING ON ERROR OF LAW


 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Rothwell, whose decision  was  promulgated  on  7  March
    2016.  In it, the  judge  found  that  the  claimant  was  at  risk  of
    persecution and allowed the appeal on asylum grounds.  In doing so  the
    judge considered GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG
    [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).

 2. I shall refer to the claimant as the appellant as he was in the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  The basis  of  the  claim  that  was  advanced  by  the
    appellant was that as a result of the stormy relationship with his wife
    and, as a result of his  entering  into  a  relationship  with  another
    woman, his wife, who has returned to Sri  Lanka,  is  of  a  vindictive
    nature and she has made a complaint to the Sri Lankan authorities  that
    the appellant was assisting the LTTE.  I shall refer to the claimant as
    the appellant as he was before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The wife's account is of course entirely untrue.  There is not a  shred
    of evidence that can properly be advanced against the appellant that he
    was assisting the LTTE.  Indeed, he is  a  Sinhalese  and  consequently
    there would be no obvious reason why he should be  wishing  to  support
    the LTTE, an organisation which seeks for the Tamils  in  Sri  Lanka  a
    Tamil homeland, and in the pursuit of that aim has, in the past at  any
    rate, committed acts of terrorism  against  the  Sinhalese  population.
    Consequently the  wife's  claim,  which  was  that  the  appellant  was
    involved in supporting the LTTE, does not obviously ring  true  nor  of
    course is there any evidence to support it.

 4. So the claim then  was  based  on  the  powers  of  persuasion  of  his
    vindictive wife, who would be able  to  manage  a  scheme  whereby  the
    police would persecute him.  The persecution was predicated on the fact
    that the police would accept the accusation of his  being  involved  in
    the LTTE; that the police would  then  be  able  to  put  forward  some
    evidence that might result in an examining Magistrate or  a  prosecutor
    putting it before the courts and that, once before the  court,  a  High
    Court Judge would find that the appellant  had  committed  these  acts.
    The judge does not  appear  to  have  taken  on  board  the  formidable
    difficulties of such a claim being  successfully  advanced  and/or  the
    material that might have to be placed  before  the  authorities  before
    this persecution might take place.

 5. The judge accepted the appellant's account without demur and based  the
    wife's  authority  on  the  fact  that,  at   paragraph   49   of   the
    determination, she accepts that the appellant's family have links  with
    the government as her brother is a government doctor.   Pausing  there,
    that does not seem to me to suggest that the appellant's wife  has  the
    influence which it is alleged she wields.  It is also said that one  of
    her relatives works for a politician.  There again, that does not  seem
    to me to draw the link that, as a result of his or her  working  for  a
    politician,  not  simply  the  police,  not  simply   the   prosecuting
    authorities, not simply the courts, not simply a jury (if  there  is  a
    jury trial) but the government  itself  would  operate  at  his  wife's
    direction against the appellant, all based on the fact that one of  her
    relatives works for a politician.

 6. It shows, in my judgment, a level of  naivety  in  the  decision-making
    process.  It also fails to take into account that the appellant is able
    to instruct solicitors and that the solicitors  are  able  to  instruct
    Counsel.  The appellant, therefore, if the  matter  goes  to  a  trial,
    would be able to dismiss without any difficulty a claim which would not
    be supported by any evidence as far as  we  can  tell  apart  from  the
    comments made by his vindictive wife.

 7. So the basis  upon  which  the  judge  appears  to  have  reached  this
    conclusion is that she accepted that the brother  and  her  mother  had
    been accused along with the appellant of this involvement but it is not
    said that they had been subjected to persecution.  It is said that they
    have been arrested but then they were released after a few days.   That
    is not sufficient to amount to persecution.

 8. So all in all the judge's findings, whether  one  looks  upon  them  as
    being improperly  reasoned  or  naï¿½ve  or  perverse,  together  make  a
    determination which simply does not hold any water.  Nor  could  it  be
    said that the judge's reliance on GJ assists the case.   It  is  to  be
    remembered that in paragraph 2  of  GJ  in  the  italicised  words  the
    Tribunal said:

         "(2) The focus of the Sri Lankan government's concern  has  changed
             since the civil war ended in May 2009.  The LTTE in Sri  Lanka
             itself is a spent force  and  there  have  been  no  terrorist
             incidents since the end of the civil war.

         (3)  The  government's  present  objective  is  to  identify  Tamil
             activists in the Diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism
             and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state ... Its  focus
             is on preventing both the  resurgence  of  the  LTTE  and  the
             revival of the civil war."

 9. Now, even taken  at  its  highest  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the
    appellant's case falls within the guidance of GJ.  Nevertheless, it was
    a case which was relied upon extensively by the judge in paragraphs 54,
    55, 57 and 58 in the reasoning provided by the judge and without making
    the essential point that this was a Sinhalese appellant.

10. There are one or two other matters which I think  are  significant.   I
    have already mentioned that the claim that the appellant's wife  had  a
    great deal of influence is not supported by anything that the appellant
    says apart from the links with a brother and a relative working  for  a
    politician.  The judge also said, I note, in paragraph 46 that  one  of
    the reasons that the appellant and his partner could not return to  Sri
    Lanka (and one could see, the judge said, that  it  was  of  evidential
    significance) was that the appellant and his partner had  not  returned
    to Sri Lanka and that was because there are obviously  real  issues  in
    their return.

11. It does not seem to me that the fact that the  husband  and  wife  have
    remained in the United Kingdom  can  be  used  as  evidence  that  they
    obviously would have returned had they not had a risk on return.  There
    could be a number of reasons why somebody who has decided not to return
    to his own country but prefers to remain in the United Kingdom does  so
    and it may not necessarily be because they are at risk.

12. So in those circumstances I am satisfied that the judge made  a  flawed
    decision and that the matter will have to be remade.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal discloses a material  error  on
a point of law and I set it aside.
The decision must be re-made.  None of the findings of fact are preserved.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
