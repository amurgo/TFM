                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant identifies himself as a citizen of Sudan.   His  date  of
    birth is recorded as 1 January 1975.

 2. He claims that the authorities detained and ill-treated him in 2003 and
    in 2008, and that he was at risk due to  suspicion  of  supporting  the
    Equality and Justice Movement,  membership  of  the  Berti  tribe,  and
    pressure to act as an informer.

 3. By determination promulgated on 9 September  2016,  FtT  Judge  Handley
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of
    his claim.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the UT  on  grounds  which
    may be summarised thus:







      Ground 1. Error in relation to expert report:

      2.  The FtT finds at [40] expert's comments on demeanour of  appellant
      of little value ... no reasons, or inadequate reasons, given ...

      3.  The FtT finds  at  [40]  that  the  appellant  may  have  acquired
      information about the Berti ... prior to interview ... to enhance  his
      claim ... speculation to support a negative finding.

      4.  No reasons, or inadequate reasons, for refuting the expert's  view
      that  the  appellant  had  given  "quite  a  good  amount  of   useful
      information" to the respondent which supports  his  claimed  ethnicity
      ...

      5. Failure to make a finding on expert's view at [95] - [100]  of  his
      report, supporting the appellant's position  on  the  origins  of  the
      Berti.

       6.  Error in light of case law:  expert  report  not  to  be  lightly
      rejected and heavy reliance to be placed on view of experts.

      Ground 2 Mibanga point.

       7.  Error by reaching conclusion before surveying all  the  evidence;
      assessment of report after reaching negative credibility findings.

      Ground 3.

      8.  Failure to make findings on 2 independent sources  in  appellant's
      bundle which demonstrate that  appellant  gave  correct  name  of  the
      current Berti king at his asylum interview.

      9. No finding on expert's view of this matter  at  [101]  -  [105]  of
      report.

      10. Failure to take account of all relevant evidence.

 5. At the hearing Mr Winter sought to argue additional grounds:

      1.  Failure to take  account  of  items  in  the  appellant's  bundle,
      supporting his claim to  be  Berti;  separatim,  no  checks  on  those
      documents by respondent, per PJ (Sri Lanka) [2015] 1 WLR 1322.

      2.  No reasons or examples for finding  at  [28]  evidence  vague  and
      inconsistent.

      3.  Error at [30] and [34] in that release  from  detention  does  not
      equate with lack of interest.

      4.  Failure to take account of at [30] and [34] of Q/A 31  and  52  of
      interview.  Appellant  had  said  he  was  released  on  condition  of
      providing information.

      5.  Inconsistency in findings at [31] that appellant  not  in  danger,
      yet unlikely to return as life at risk

      6.  Finding at [32] not supported by evidence.

 6. The expert report is by Peter Verney, prepared 8 August 2016,  item  1,
    appellant's supplementary bundle in the FtT.

 7. The evidence said to have been overlooked  but  not  specified  in  the
    original grounds comprises items 2  and  3  of  the  appellants'  first
    bundle in the FtT, copy statements and translations by a  village  head
    and a school head.  These are also the items referred to at [1] of  the
    additional grounds.  The "originals" were identified in course  of  the
    hearing and are within the file.

 8. Mr Matthews acknowledged that there was some force  in  the  submission
    that the judge failed to deal with  significant  parts  of  the  expert
    report going to the analysis of the  appellant's  state  of  knowledge,
    including [96] - [102] and [104] - [105], although  he  drew  attention
    also to the degree of balance and caution expressed in the  conclusions
    at [299] - [302].  He accepted that the judge made an  error  of  fact,
    finding it adverse that the appellant did not say at interview that  he
    had been asked to inform, when the appellant  at  two  points  did  say
    that.  He also acknowledged that the judge failed to deal with the  two
    items of evidence referred to above.

 9. I am satisfied  that  the  further  grounds,  which  overlap  with  the
    original, should be considered; and that while the original grounds  on
    their own might not rise above disagreement on  the  facts,  the  three
    main points which have emerged above together amount to error  of  law:
    failure to deal adequately with the expert report;  misapprehension  of
    the appellant's account as given at interview;  and  omission  to  deal
    with two items of evidence.

10. I record the view which I expressed incidentally about the  latter  two
    items: they are not of  a  nature  to  trigger  an  obligation  on  the
    respondent to seek to verify them  at  source  (and  I  note  that  the
    appellant had not previously requested the respondent to do so).

11. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

12. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

13. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
