For the Respondent: Mr Lister - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Gladstone determined on the papers on 5th March 2013 in which
        he dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal of an Entry
        Clearance Officer (ECO) to allow her to enter  the  United  Kingdom
        for the purposes of a family visit.


     2. The date of decision is the 8th July 2012 and the  reason  the  ECO
        refused the application was because it was not felt  the  appellant
        had demonstrated she met the requirements of paragraphs 41 (i)  and
        (ii) of the Immigration Rules.


     3. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted on  the
        10th May 2013 by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  on  the  basis
        Judge Gladstone should have acceded  to  a  request  made  on  17th
        December 2012 for the case to be determined at an oral  hearing  to
        enable the sponsor who is in the United Kingdom to  give  evidence,
        on payment of the relevant difference in the fee  between  an  oral
        and paper hearing.



Discussion



     4. The First-tier Tribunal (Immigration & Asylum Chamber)  Fees  Order
        2011 sets out the rules for charging fees.  The Tribunal  Procedure
        (Amendment) (No.2) Rules 2011 make consequent changes to the Asylum
        & Immigration (Procedure) Rules 2005.  A fee is payable in  respect
        of an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal where the appeal relates to
        an immigration or asylum matter and the decision against which  the
        appeal is made was taken on or after the coming into force  of  the
        Fees Order (Article 3(1) of the Fees Order).


     5. Article 3(2) denotes  the  fee  payable  which  is  �80  where  the
        appellant consents to the appeal being determined without a hearing
        and �140 where the appellant does not consent to the  appeal  being
        determined without a hearing.  If  the  appellant  withdraws  their
        consent to the appeal  being  determined  without  a  hearing,  the
        difference of �60 will become payable  on  the  withdrawal  of  the
        consent, unless the Tribunal decides that the appeal can be  justly
        determined without a hearing, in which case the  fee  remains  �80.
        If an appellant consents to the appeal being determined  without  a
        hearing and pays the lower fee but the Tribunal then  decides  that
        an oral hearing is required,  either  at  the  instigation  of  the
        respondent or on its own initiative, then the appellant will not be
        liable to pay the higher fee.  Where the  appellant  has  paid  the
        higher fee but the appeal is  determined  without  a  hearing,  the
        appellant is then entitled to a refund of  the  difference  between
        the two fees (Article 9(1)).  A fee is payable in respect  of  each
        appellant in terms of Article 3(2) of the Fees Order.


     6. As far as the Tribunal  is  concerned  the  only  question  at  the
        commencement of proceedings is  whether  the  Lord  Chancellor  has
        issued a certificate of  fee  satisfaction  under  Article  8.   In
        effect an appeal will not be processed for determination,  with  or
        without a hearing, without a certificate of  fee  satisfaction.  In
        further guidance from the President it has  been  stated  that  the
        collection of, deferral from, or exemption from fees  is  a  matter
        for the Lord Chancellor as Secretary  of  State  for  Justice.   In
        other words it  is  an  administrative  function,  not  a  judicial
        function.  No judge should adjourn, strike out or dismiss an appeal
        because a fee has not been collected. However, no appeal should  be
        considered unless a certificate of fee satisfaction has been issued
        on behalf of the Lord Chancellor and the appeal  has  been  through
        the case creation process resulting  in  (i)  the  creating  of  an
        appeal file with a unique appeal number (prefixed by  AA,  DA,  IA,
        OA, etc); and (ii) the  listing  of  the  appeal  by  the  Tribunal
        (either as a paper case or for oral  hearing).   The  filing  of  a
        notice of appeal does not mean that there is a valid appeal.   Rule
        9  (as  amended)  allows  for  an   appeal   to   be   struck   out
        administratively if no certificate of fee satisfaction is issued.


     7. In this appeal the appellant lodged her notice  of  appeal  against
        the decision of the ECO in which she stated  that  she  wanted  the
        appeal to be decided on the papers. The form IAFT-2  explains  that
        an appeal on the papers means the appeal will  be  decided  on  the
        information provided on the appeal form  and  any  other  documents
        submitted  as  evidence.   The   appeal   was   received   at   the
        Administrative Support Centre on 31st July  2012.  On  13th  August
        2012 a member of staff wrote to the appellant advising her that the
        appeal had been received without payment of a fee.  The  notice  of
        requirement to pay a fee contains the following endorsements:


              " You have not requested an oral hearing and you must now pay
   �80.00 in           order for your appeal to proceed.  This payment must
   be made to the               tribunal no later than Monday, 24 September
   2012. Failure to pay the fee              will result in the tribunal
   taking no further action on your appeal".


     8. There is on the file a further part of the AFT-2 confirming again
        that the appellant wanted the matter to be dealt with on the
        papers. This form contains the following statement "You should tick
        the 'paper hearing' box if no one will attend and you want to have
        your case determined on the papers provided. You will need to pay
        the appropriate fee for a paper hearing". Along the left-hand side
        of that form the following text "(Note) the court fee will be
        deposited soon after receiving the notice of this honourable court"
        has been added by hand. The sponsor confirmed in court that she
        wrote that note on the form and paid the �80.00 as evidenced by the
        indication that the Lord Chancellor's certificate of fee
        satisfaction was issued on 13th August 2012 .


     9. On 2nd October 2012 the appellant was sent notice of pending appeal
        confirming that the appeal had been lodged and a copy was sent to
        the UK-based sponsor on the same date. On 7th December 2012 the
        appellant was sent form IA 35 advising her that as she had
        indicated she wanted the appeal to be decided on the papers,
        without a hearing, any written evidence and submissions had to be
        received by 4th February 2013.  The appeal was according allocated
        to Judge Gladstone to be determined on the papers.


    10. Whilst it is clear that the status of an appeal can be changed from
        paper to oral there is no evidence such a request was made in
        advance and the correct fee paid prior to Judge Gladstone's
        consideration of the evidence. The grounds on which permission to
        appeal to the Upper Tribunal is sought acknowledges that only �80
        was paid, which is that charged for a paper hearing, and that the
        appellant indicated she only required a paper hearing on her IAFT-
        2. The grounds go on to state that according to the current facts
        and circumstances the appellant's sponsor/daughter is liable to be
        asked to appear for an oral hearing to clear up the facts of the
        incident/case and it is proper that the sponsor be asked to appear
        before the court for an oral hearing with the appellant confirming
        she will deposit the remaining court fee required for an oral
        hearing.


    11. I find there is no procedural error sufficient to amount to a
        material error of law in relation to the Judge determining the
        appeal on the papers. It is clear that the appellant asked for the
        matter to be determined on the basis of the written evidence and
        this is the fee that was charged and that which she paid. She had
        the opportunity to request an oral hearing if she wanted the
        sponsor to attend to give oral evidence but did not.


    12. Judge Gladstone was not satisfied the appellant had provided an
        adequate explanation of her circumstances in Pakistan, an issue she
        was put to proof of in the refusal notice. The reasons for this are
        set out in the determination at paragraphs 29 to 31. Having
        reviewed the evidence the findings made are within the range of
        permissible findings available to the Judge and no material error
        of law has been proved.


    13. The Judge was aware of the compassionate circumstances behind the
        proposed visit [26] but the ECO was not satisfied the appellant
        will leave the United Kingdom within the period of one month that
        she refers to in the visa application form. It was not accepted
        that she would comply with the requirements of paragraph 41 (i) or
        (ii), i.e. that she was a genuine visitor or that she would leave
        the United Kingdom within the period stated by her.


    14. The Upper Tribunal has received a letter from a Social Worker
        employed by Nottingham County Council dated 9th July 2013 referring
        to the sponsor's domestic circumstances, which includes incidents
        of domestic violence. The Social Worker has been assigned to ensure
        the needs of the sponsor's five children are met. They are now
        subject to a Child Protection Plan. The letter states "Mrs Khan
        anticipates that her mother will stay for a period up to a maximum
        of six months, if possible and she will reside at Mrs Khans address
        at ......".  On the face of it this casts doubt upon the stated
        intention of the appellant to only remain for one month. If so the
        finding of the Judge that in light of the failure of the appellant
        to prove her circumstances in Pakistan, and the evidence relating
        to her actual intentions, she had not shown she intended to leave
        the UK at the end of the stated period is a finding in accordance
        with the evidence. This matter was discussed with Mrs Khan who
        indicated that the content of the letter did not properly represent
        her position as indicated to the social worker although it was
        clear that it is likely her mother would remain for longer then one
        month, if not for the full six months of the visa.


    15. The appellant's husband applied at the same time but also had his
        application refused, although his involved a paragraph 320 (7A)
        refusal, against which he did not appeal.  The  same issue was also
        raised regarding the failure to adduce sufficient evidence relating
        to his own financial circumstances in his refusal.


    16. I find no material error proved although the evidence does support
        the claim that this is an application based upon the wish of the
        family to provide support to their daughter in the United Kingdom
        who was experiencing domestic violence with its negative impact
        upon her and her children. Mrs Khan was advised in court of the
        outcome of the appeal and the fact her mother could make a fresh
        application if she wished to do so. She was advised that in any
        such application evidence regarding the family's financial
        circumstances in Pakistan must be provided and it must clearly
        state the maximum period of any proposed visit. If she wishes to
        stay for four months she should say so. Mrs Khan was advised of the
        changes that have been made regarding rights of appeal against a
        refusal of a family visitor applications although on the facts of
        this case there may be the possibility of an appeal on human rights
        grounds, especially if adequately supported by the social worker. I
        do not find any element of deceit or dishonesty in Mrs Khan it is
        just that her mother did not prove that what she was alleging was
        true which led to the refusal in its current terms.


Decision

    17. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.




   Anonymity.


    18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


          I make no such order.
