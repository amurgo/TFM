                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 19th  of  December  1993.
    She appeals against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Grant sitting at Hatton Cross on 27th of February 2017 to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated  30th  of
    October 2014. That decision was to refuse to issue a residence card  as
    the spouse of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  pursuant  to
    Regulation 7 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

 2. The Appellant married Mr Euklidson de Carvalho, a Portuguese  national,
    ("the Sponsor") on 17th of December 2013.  On  27th  of  May  2014  the
    Appellant applied for a residence card on the basis  of  this  marriage
    the refusal of which has given rise to  the  present  proceedings.  The
    Respondent refused the application because she was not  satisfied  that
    the Appellant and the Sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting marriage
    and was not satisfied that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights.

The Proceedings

 3. The Appellant's appeal was allowed at first instance by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Keith sitting at Hatton Cross on  20th  of  October
    2015. He was satisfied that the marriage was  genuine.  The  Respondent
    appealed that decision arguing that the second reason for  the  refusal
    had not been dealt with at first instance, that the Respondent was  not
    satisfied that the Sponsor was exercising treaty  rights.  The  Sponsor
    had claimed that he was working for an employment  agency  called  Apex
    Recruitment but the Respondent stated she had attempted to confirm this
    employment through Internet searches and telephone calls but was unable
    to verify that the Sponsor's employment was genuine and subsisting.

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein sitting at Field House on  1st  of  June
    2016 found it self-evident that Judge Keith had materially erred in law
    because he  had  failed  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  the  Sponsor's
    employment. The finding that the marriage of the Appellant and  Sponsor
    was genuine was preserved but Judge Goldstein remitted the  balance  of
    the appeal back to the First-tier to be reheard. At the hearing  before
    Judge Goldstein the Presenting Officer  indicated  that  if  there  was
    further evidence that the Appellant now wished to tender to demonstrate
    that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights it would  be  helpful  if
    such evidence could be forwarded to the Presenting Officer  before  the
    remitted hearing date so that it might be considered  with  possibly  a
    recommendation that a residence card be issued, depending of course  on
    the contents of any such further evidence.

The Decision at First Instance

 5. As a result of the Upper Tribunal's decision  the  matter  came  before
    Judge Grant on 27th of February 2017. The Appellant was not  called  to
    give evidence but the Sponsor did give evidence. Although the Appellant
    had been invited to supply further evidence before a remitted  hearing,
    it appears from [4]  of  Judge  Grant's  decision  that  an  incomplete
    supplementary bundle was only faxed or attempted to  be  faxed  by  the
    Appellant's representatives the day before the  hearing.  It  does  not
    appear that any such bundle was received by the Tribunal as  the  Judge
    had to be lent the bundle of the Appellant's solicitor.

 6. This bundle contained nine payslips issued to the Sponsor by a  company
    called Den Security Group Limited ("Den Security") covering the  period
    31st of May 2016 to 31st of January 2017. The Sponsor  argued  that  he
    could prove he was a qualified person exercising treaty rights  because
    he had evidence to show his salary being paid directly  into  his  bank
    account by this employer. He had provided his recent payslips and  bank
    statements  to  support  the  claim.  The  Sponsor  had  supplied   the
    Respondent with an Apex Recruitment Agency employment  contract  and  a
    copy of a payslip issued by Apex for 2nd of May 2014  and  9th  of  May
    2014. There were bank statements issued to the Sponsor by Barclays bank
    which covered a 6-month period between August and January  2017.  There
    were credits shown from Den Security of �500 on 31st of August, 30th of
    September, 30th of October, 30th of November and 30th  of  December  of
    2016 and 31st of January 2017.

 7. The Judge noted that the late submission of  the  supplementary  bundle
    had given the Respondent no opportunity to verify the nine payslips and
    copy bank statements. There was no doubt, the Judge recorded  at  [16],
    that the bank statements showed credits from Den Security in the sum of
    �500 per month  but  the  payslips  of  themselves  were  not  credible
    evidence that the Sponsor was working. At [17] the Judge observed  that
    all the payslips were for an identical sum of money.  The  Sponsor  had
    indicated that he received the minimum wage of �7.20 p per hour and his
    income was always �500 per month. This meant that he was working  69.44
    hours per month which was precisely 16 hours per week. Yet the  Sponsor
    had claimed in oral evidence that he worked for 17 or  even  17�  hours
    per week on average. If he genuinely worked for 17 hours per  week  for
    Den Security then his take home pay would necessarily be more than  the
    precisely round figure of �500 per month shown on the payslips.

 8. �500 was clearly not sufficient to live on, it would not even pay  rent
    for a month in London. The Sponsor was receiving large additional  sums
    each month to meet his living expenses but the origin  of  those  funds
    had not been properly explained to the  Judge.  The  Sponsor  might  be
    working and not declaring his income for tax but if that were the  case
    such income could not be relied upon for the purposes  of  establishing
    qualifying status under the 2006 Regulations. The Judge  did  not  find
    the Sponsor to be a credible witness and drew an adverse inference from
    the late disclosure of the evidence which had given the  Respondent  no
    opportunity to verify it.

 9. If the Sponsor genuinely did work for Den Security the solution was for
    the Appellant to make a fresh application to  the  Respondent  properly
    supported with cogent evidence which could  then  be  verified  by  the
    Respondent. It had been found that the marriage was  genuine.  Assuming
    the Sponsor was a qualified person there would be no  difficulty  about
    the issue of a residence card to the Appellant. The Judge dismissed the
    appeal.

The Onward Appeal

10. The Appellant appealed against this decision arguing that  the  finding
    that the  Sponsor  was  not  exercising  treaty  rights  could  not  be
    sustained since it had not been made in line with the Court of  Justice
    of the European Union decision of Levin  (1982)  53/8.  This  case  had
    given guidance on the definition of what  constituted  work.  Part-time
    work counted  as  employment  provided  it  was  genuine  and  gave  an
    effective means for a person to earn a living even if it needed  to  be
    supplemented from public funds. Further, the grounds argued, there were
    contradictory findings in the determination. On the one hand the  Judge
    accepted that the Sponsor was receiving �500 per  month  on  the  other
    hand she found the payslips were not credible evidence. The  Judge  had
    also found that it may well be that the Sponsor was working.

11. The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Hollingworth  on  20th  of  September
    2017. He refused permission finding that the Judge had made credibility
    findings open to her in the light of which the outcome was  inevitable.
    The Judge specifically addressed the issue in question  whether  treaty
    rights were being exercised.

12. The Appellant renewed her application for permission to appeal  on  the
    same basis as before. Upper Tribunal Judge Alan granted  permission  to
    appeal on 19 December 2017 briefly stating that it  was  arguable  that
    the Judge's findings were not clear  and  the  grounds  raised  matters
    which indicated arguable errors of law in the Judge's decision.

13. The Respondent replied to the grant of permission by letter dated  17th
    of January 2018. Although the Appellant was aware that the  only  issue
    in the case was whether the Sponsor was  in  employment  she  had  only
    submitted banks  statements  and  payslips  with  no  other  supporting
    evidence of the  claimed  employment.  The  Judge  had  given  adequate
    reasons for doubting the credibility of the payslips. It  was  open  to
    the Judge to find that although the Sponsor was  in  receipt  of  funds
    from Den Security he had not established that he was genuinely employed
    by them.

The Hearing Before Me

14. At the hearing before me to establish  whether  there  was  a  material
    error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision it was submitted  on
    the Appellant's behalf that there had been clear  evidence  before  the
    Judge that the Sponsor was receiving  income  from  Den  Security.  The
    Judge had made no reference to Regulation 6  of  the  2006  Regulations
    when finding the Sponsor was not exercising treaty rights. Regulation 6
    defined a qualified person. The Judge's  concerns  about  the  payslips
    were insufficient to find the Sponsor was not exercising treaty rights.
    There was no definition in the  Regulations  of  what  a  payslip  must
    contain. The important point was there was evidence of employment.

15. In reply, the Presenting Officer indicated that the  crucial  paragraph
    in the determination was [17], see paragraph 7 above. There had been no
    challenge by the Appellant to the findings the Judge had made  at  that
    paragraph when calculating how many hours  per  week  the  Sponsor  was
    working compared to what  his  oral  evidence  had  been  that  he  was
    working. The sums did not add up as a result the Judge could not  place
    weight on the payslips. The bank statements were equally  not  credible
    since although they showed money going in they did not establish  where
    that money was coming from, it might be that  he  was  working  without
    paying tax. The Appellant's challenge  to  the  determination  did  not
    touch on [17]. If this had been a self-employment case and the accounts
    submitted were not credible the Appellant would not have discharged the
    burden of proof. It was not so much the documents were false but rather
    that the figures within them were  not  credible.  There  had  been  no
    allegation of forgery as such.

16. The Judge could only make findings on the evidence before her. She  was
    unimpressed with the Sponsor's  evidence.  If  the  payslips  were  not
    reliable the Sponsor could  not  establish  employment.  Another  Judge
    might have reached a different conclusion but [17]  was  difficult  for
    the Appellant to overcome as there was no challenge to it.

17. In conclusion the Appellant's solicitor relied on the  case  of  Levin.
    Part-time work counted  as  employment  provided  it  was  genuine  and
    effective. There was oral evidence from the Sponsor confirming that  he
    worked for Den Security. That could not be ignored. The only issue  was
    a calculation of a payslip. That was not sufficient to outweigh all the
    other evidence. The narrative on the bank statement said that the money
    going into the bank account was coming from Den Security.

Findings

18. The issue I have to decide is whether the Judge made a  material  error
    of law in this decision such that her determination be  set  aside  and
    the decision remade. If she did not then her decision would stand. What
    the Sponsor had to demonstrate in  this  appeal  was  that  he  was  in
    employment. I accept that if the Sponsor could show he was genuinely in
    employment receiving  �500  per  month  from  an  employer  that  would
    probably be sufficient to  demonstrate  he  was  a  worker  within  the
    meaning of Regulation 6. Although there is case law on the issue of how
    much work has to  be  performed  to  satisfy  the  Regulations,  it  is
    established that the level of work must not be marginal. 16 hours  work
    per week earning �500 per month would not be so marginal that it  could
    be disregarded.

19. The question the Judge had to answer was: could the Sponsor established
    that he was genuinely working for at least 16 hours  per  week  earning
    �500 per month? The Judge had suspicions  that  the  Sponsor  might  be
    receiving income from elsewhere but that  was  not  declared  in  these
    proceedings and therefore she had to proceed on the  basis  that  there
    was no other claimed employment. As she correctly pointed out if  there
    was any further employment which was evading  tax  that  would  not  be
    sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Regulations   however
    substantial it was.

20. The problem for the Appellant in this case was that  the  evidence  put
    forward to demonstrate the Sponsor was working did not, in the view  of
    the Judge, establish that. The Appellant had been given fair notice  by
    the Respondent at the hearing before Judge Goldstein that if  she  were
    to submit further evidence showing the Sponsor's  employment  then  the
    application would be reconsidered and might very  well  result  in  the
    issue of a residence card. Unfortunately, that very strong hint was not
    taken up by the Appellant.

21. Instead in rather chaotic scenes the Appellant submitted an  incomplete
    bundle of documents on the morning of the hearing  before  Judge  Grant
    which as the Judge demonstrated left  unanswered  many  questions.  The
    bundle referred to a completely new employer Den Security  (not  Apex).
    According to the letter from that company in the Appellant's bundle the
    Sponsor was said to have been employed by Den  Security  since  January
    2015. I pause to  note  here  that  a  further  employer's  letter  was
    contained in the bundle prepared for the hearing before me. That bundle
    is not relevant for the purposes of establishing an error of law in the
    original determination. The second letter indicated the  sponsor  began
    his employment with Den Security in May 2016 and was still working  for
    them as at January 2018.

22. If it was the case that employment began in January 2015 (or  even  May
    2016 for that matter) the Sponsor was working for Den Security group at
    the time of the hearing before Judge Goldstein. That makes it even more
    inexplicable that the indication given by the Presenting Officer at the
    hearing before Judge Goldstein was not  taken  up.  From  January  2015
    alternatively  May  2016  the  Sponsor  would  have  been  accumulating
    evidence on the Appellant's case of his employment  with  Den  Security
    which could and should have been given to the Respondent in good  time.
    That that was not done of itself undermined the weight  that  could  be
    given by the Judge to the payslips when they finally emerged on the day
    of the hearing at first instance. This was the Appellant's appeal,  she
    had been told what she needed to do to succeed but she had not done it.



23. The documents that were produced to Judge Grant  were  contradicted  by
    the  Sponsor's  own  evidence.  The  Judge  had  made  a  very  careful
    calculation at [17] of  her  determination  which,  as  the  Presenting
    Officer pointed out, was not challenged. If the payslips  were  genuine
    the Sponsor was working 16 hours per week. If he was working  16  hours
    per week every single week such that his monthly  pay  was  always  the
    same, he would reasonably be expected to know that he  was  working  16
    hours per week. As his working week never varied he would know it  very
    well.  Unfortunately  for  the  Appellant,   the   Sponsor's   evidence
    conflicted with the payslips and he told the Judge he was working 17 or
    even 17 � hours. That strongly suggested a very poor knowledge of  what
    the payslips contained and thus what the Sponsor's case  on  employment
    was meant to be.

24. In those circumstances the Judge's suspicions about the  payslips  were
    aroused. It was correct that the Sponsor had produced  bank  statements
    showing he received a regular  payment  of  �500  per  month  from  Den
    Security. If, however he could not show that that  money  was  received
    from employment it was meaningless for the purposes of the  application
    for a residence card. The Sponsor had to link the payments received  in
    his bank account with genuine employment. This he did not do. There was
    a considerable amount of supporting  evidence  which  could  have  been
    produced if the employment was to be  relied  upon,  for  example  HMRC
    documentation. This was not produced to Judge Grant.

25. As I have indicated, the Appellant prepared a further  bundle  in  time
    for the hearing before me but as the hearing I was  conducting  was  to
    establish material error of law or otherwise, that documentation  could
    not be relied upon since it  was  all  post  hearing  evidence.  Having
    briefly perused the documentation it does raise a number  of  questions
    which do not need to be answered or put to the Sponsor  at  this  stage
    but in the event  that  the  Appellant  decides  to  submit  a  further
    application to the Respondent it would be open to the Appellant to deal
    with those questions which arise from a brief reading of the bundle.

26. By way of example, the payslips produced  to  Judge  Grant  showed  the
    Sponsor's payroll number with Den Security as being 1027  but  the  P60
    produced for year ending April 2015 showed his payroll number  is  254.
    Letters from Den Security  give  two  different  start  dates  for  the
    employer one suggests he began work in January  2015  another  that  he
    began work in May 2016. At least  three  different  addresses  for  Den
    Security appear on the paperwork. These are matters which no doubt  can
    be addressed by the Appellant in the event  she  decides  to  submit  a
    further application to the Respondent.

27. For present purposes I have to consider whether there  was  a  material
    error of law in Judge Grant's  decision.  On  the  basis  of  the  very
    limited and unsatisfactory evidence before her, she was quite  entitled
    to place no weight  on  the  payslips  submitted  as  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's  employment.  In  the  absence  of  cogent  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's employment she could not find that he was  exercising  treaty
    rights. I do not find there was  any  material  error  of  law  in  the
    Judge's decision. As Judge Grant pointed out the Appellant's remedy  is
    to submit a further application properly supported. That is matter  for
    the Appellant. In the meantime, I dismiss her onward appeal against the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I make no anonymity order as there
    is no public policy reason for so doing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal
