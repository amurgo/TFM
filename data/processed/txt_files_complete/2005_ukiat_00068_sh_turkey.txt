Mr F Omere (counsel instructed by Irving & Co) for the appellant
Miss A Gill for the respondent

                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Miss JM Braybrook),
   sitting at Taylor House on 19 May 2004, dismissing an asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a Kurdish citizen of Turkey. Permission to  appeal  was
   given on  the  basis  that  there  might  have  been  an  appearance  of
   unfairness in the way the adjudicator conducted the hearing:  there  was
   no presenting officer, and she asked a number of questions for  herself.
   The grant of permission left it open to  the  claimant  to  argue  other
   points; but it was made without reference to CA [2004]  EWCA  Civ  1165,
   and in the light  of  that  decision  we  shall  have  to  consider  for
   ourselves whether anything else in the case does raise any point of law.

2. We have to say that this was not a case where the Home  Office  (who  do
   not appear to have given  any  explanation  for  it)  should  ever  have
   allowed themselves to go unrepresented: it had been heard  once  already
   by another adjudicator, and  sent  back  for  a  fresh  hearing  by  the
   Tribunal, because he  had  not  dealt  with  all  the  issues,  and  had
   misdirected himself on one of them. This time it appears, as we  pointed
   out at the hearing, to have been deliberately listed in accordance  with
   the  sensible  policy  of  the  regional  adjudicator,  before  a   very
   experienced colleague (first appointed in 1993 or before,  according  to
   the records), in the  hope  that  this  would  now  result  in  a  final
   decision. The Home Office ought to have been ready to play their part in
   this process.

3. Conduct of hearing The grounds of appeal refer to the familiar  decision
   in Surendran (21679): as the reference number  shows,  that  dates  from
   before the Tribunal adopted its last-but-two manner of citation in 2000,
   following which the guidelines contained  in  it  were  adopted  in  MNM
   [00/TH/02423]. Surendran has since been reconsidered and the  guidelines
   substantially re-interpreted in WN [2004] UKIAT 00213 (by Ouseley P  and
   a legal panel). Counsel who  appeared  before  the  adjudicator  (Mr  NS
   Ahluwalia) cannot be blamed for not referring to WN, as, though the case
   was heard on 16 April 2004, the decision did not come out till 4 August.
   We shall return to this point; but, while  WN  is  in  the  form  of  an
   extended gloss on Surendran, we see no reason to look beyond  WN  itself
   for the principles we should adopt in a case of this kind. It  was  not,
   at least in the copy we have, formally "starred", as Surendran had been;
   but it was clearly a deeply-considered decision of a Presidential  legal
   panel, and  intended  to  be  followed  by  all  adjudicators,  and  all
   divisions of the Tribunal.

4. In summary, they are these: Arabic numbers show  the  paragraphs  of  WN
   from which they are derived, Roman  ones  the  numbering  given  by  the
   Tribunal to the principles set out (referring back, in the case  of  IV-
   VII, to the guidelines in Surendran), and italics direct quotations.

     25. I  Credence should not be given to  allegations  not  supported  by
         evidence.
     28. II       It is not necessary for a fair hearing that every point of
         concern which an Adjudicator has be put expressly to a party, where
         credibility is plainly at issue. As we have said elsewhere, it is a
         matter of judgment whether to omit to do so is unfair or whether to
         do so risks appearing to be unfair as a form of  cross-examination.
         On balance, the Adjudicator's major points of  concern  are  better
         put, especially if they are not obvious. The  questions  should  be
         focussed but open, not leading, expressed  in  a  neutral  way  and
         manner, and not at too great a length or in too great a number.
    29. III      The [Surendran] guidelines are  guidelines  and  guidance;
        they are not rules of law. They are not a  strait-jacket.  They  do
        not represent black and white answers to all the  situations,  many
        and varied as they are, which arise before an Adjudicator where the
        Home Office Presenting Officer is not present.
    30. The real test to be applied, however, is whether  the  hearing  was
        fair or unfair and whether a fair-minded and  independent  observer
        would  conclude  that  there  was  a  real  possibility  that   the
        Adjudicator was biased. ... compliance  with  the  guidelines  will
        make it very difficult, if not impossible, for an Appellant to show
        that the Adjudicator acted, or could properly be  thought  to  have
        acted, unfairly. If they are not complied with, it plainly  assists
        an argument as to actual or apparent  unfairness.  But  it  is  not
        conclusive as to it at all.
    31. The obligation is on the Appellant  to  deal  with  obvious  points
        which relate to his credibility without necessarily being asked  to
        comment on them by the Adjudicator.
    32. IV ... it is clearly not inappropriate for the issue of concern [on
        credibility] to be raised in questions by the Adjudicator.  It  may
        be more useful for the Adjudicator to put those questions  than  to
        ask  the  representative  to  do  so.  This  can  all  be  seen  as
        "clarification", for that emphasises that the task is  not  one  of
        cross-examination, and is subject to  the  caveats  as  to  timing,
        manner, length and content which we deal with later.
    33.  V   The  adjudicator  should  be  all  the  more  ready  to  raise
        credibility points not  covered  in  the  refusal  letter,  as  the
        claimant may not be aware he is under challenge on them.
    34. This is especially the case with new material, first raised  before
        the adjudicator.
    35. VI Adjudicators are not confined to questioning on the Secretary of
        State's material.
    36. VII      If obvious points are not dealt with, the Adjudicator  can
        deal with them in his determination, and  it  is  generally  better
        that he should do so having given the Appellant a chance to  answer
        them.
    37. The risk of cross-examining or appearing to  cross-examine  can  be
        avoided by an  Adjudicator  in  the  manner,  style  or  length  of
        questions, which he asks. Generally,  questions  other  than  those
        designed to clarify what was said or intended to be said are better
        left until after the conclusion  of  the  evidence  where  no  Home
        Office Presenting Officer is present and after re-examination where
        a Home Office  Presenting  Officer  is  present  [there  follows  a
        reference to K [2004] UKIAT 00061, with which we are not  concerned
        here, except to note that the law on this point  had  already  been
        developing: see 7 below].
    38. Questions should not be asked in a hostile tone. They should not be
        leading questions which suggest the answer which  is  desired,  nor
        should they disguise what is the point of concern so as  to  appear
        like a trap or the closing of the net. They should  be  open  ended
        questions, neutrally phrased. They can be persisted in, in order to
        obtain an answer; but they should not be persisted in   for  longer
        than is necessary for the Adjudicator to be clear that the question
        was understood, or to establish why it was not being  answered,  or
        to pursue so far as necessary the detail underlying vague  answers.
        ... The Adjudicator can properly put, without it becoming a  cross-
        examination, questions which trouble him or inferences from answers
        given which he might wish to  draw  adversely  to  a  party.  These
        questions should not be disproportionate in length to the  evidence
        given as to  the  complexity  of  the  case,  and,  we  repeat,  an
        Adjudicator should be careful to avoid developing his own theory of
        the case.
    39. While there is a tension between fairness in  raising  points  that
        need to be  dealt  with,  and  fairness  in  not  appearing  to  be
        partisan,
    40.  this  should  be  resolved  by  recognizing  that,  while  obvious
        credibility points do not need to be put, it is generally better to
        raise those which may be important, but not obvious, which  may  be
        done by appropriate direct questioning.

5. Turning back to the present case, there is no  lack  of  evidence  about
   what happened before the adjudicator.  Mr  Ahluwalia  has  supplied,  in
   accordance with the directions of the vice-president who gave permission
   to appeal, a statement of truth with his notes of hearing  attached:  we
   have  the  original  handwritten  copy,  and  what  purports  to  be   a
   typewritten transcript of the relevant parts, though as we shall see  it
   is not quite that. We also have the adjudicator's own  comments  on  the
   grounds  of  appeal:  unfortunately  she  was  not  supplied   with   Mr
   Ahluwalia's  note,  but  it  does  not  seem  from  her  own  record  of
   proceedings that there is any  substantial  difference  of  recollection
   about the number and kind of questions she asked.

6. The transcript consists only in the  questions  asked  by  (and  answers
   given to) the adjudicator at the proper time for inquiries  directed  to
   more than mere clarification, which in this case was at  the  conclusion
   of the evidence in chief: see WN � 37 above. There is  no  complaint  in
   the grounds of appeal against the relatively few questions asked in  the
   course of evidence in chief; and in fact they are specifically  referred
   to in the grounds at  �  2  as  "questions  clarifying  the  appellant's
   evidence". There is however one point to which we need to turn before we
   come to those questions which are complained of.

7. At the beginning of Mr Ahluwalia's  note  there  appears  the  following
   "Prelim. Surendran". The exchange to which  this  relates,  clearly  not
   part of the evidence, does not appear in  the  adjudicator's  record  of
   proceedings, but she does deal with it in her comments, as follows:

   [Mr Ahluwalia] mentioned the Surendran guidelines at the outset  of  the
   hearing. I mentioned to him that, following  recent  guidance  from  the
   Tribunal, a more flexible approach was developing at hearings where  the
   Secretary of State was not represented. It was no longer  a  requirement
   that the  adjudicator  should  put  questions  through  Counsel  to  the
   appellant. Counsel appeared to be unaware of any change in approach.  He
   stated that Surendran was a starred decision and that any departure from
   the Surendran guidelines would be a matter that would be raised  in  any
   subsequent appeal. Rather  than  further  discussion  on  the  point,  I
   indicated that I would wait and see if any points needed  clarifying  or
   expanding after Counsel had examined in chief.

8. As we have noted (see WN � 37 again), the law on  this  point  had  been
   developing, and the very experienced  adjudicator  was  better  informed
   about the way it was going than Mr Ahluwalia. We have  already  made  it
   clear that we do not, and could  not  criticize  Mr  Ahluwalia  for  not
   foreseeing the decision in WN; but it is  perhaps  unfortunate  that  he
   should have adopted, at the outset of the hearing, the rather  combative
   approach to the point revealed in the adjudicator's comments.  It  reads
   as if he were anticipating  conflict,  and  preparing  his  ground.  The
   adjudicator on the other hand does not seem to have made anything of the
   exchange at the time, but sensibly suggested that they should move on to
   the evidence.

9. There is one other general point which we need to deal with in the light
   of that exchange. There  is  a  complaint  in  the  grounds  of  appeal,
   supported by a standard annotation {"[TONE] ") at the relevant points in
   the transcript, about the manner in  which  the  adjudicator  asked  her
   questions at the end of the evidence in chief. Mr  Omere  understandably
   placed considerable reliance on that; indeed at one point  he  indicated
   that he did not consider his case could  succeed  without  the  evidence
   about the adjudicator's tone. Our view, as  we  made  clear,  was  that,
   while it was something of which we were bound to take  account,  in  the
   absence of any audio-recording (not provided for in proceedings of  this
   kind), it would  inevitably   be  hard  for  us  to  form  an  objective
   independent view of it; whereas we were well able to take such  a  view,
   as we clearly needed to, on the questions themselves.

10. What however we also made clear to Mr Omere was that  we  were  entirely
   prepared to accept that Mr Ahluwalia had felt a genuine subjective sense
   of grievance at the adjudicator's tone. That is something for us to take
   into account; but, as was made clear in WN � 30, the test  is  not  what
   the parties or their advocates thought of what went on, but  "whether  a
   fair-minded and independent observer would conclude  that  there  was  a
   real possibility that the Adjudicator was biased". In this  context  the
   point we have noted at 7 - 8 is of considerable relevance. It is hard to
   blame counsel, trying to do his best for his  client,  for  insufficient
   professional detachment; but we have to say that Mr Ahluwalia's approach
   to the question of the Surendran guidelines does  suggest  that  he  may
   have been over-sensitive to any interventions  by  the  adjudicator.  We
   have to take account of that in dealing with  what  he  felt  about  her
   tone; and we propose to concentrate on the questions she actually asked.

11. Before we turn from how the adjudicator put her questions  to  what  she
   asked, the first passage to which Mr Omere referred us was at Q27-28  of
   the transcript of the adjudicator's questions:

|27.|You refer to    |Meetings                                  |
|   |HADEP. What did |                                          |
|   |you actually do |                                          |
|   |for HADEP?      |                                          |
|   |[TONE]          |                                          |
|28.|[Adjudicator    |Interpreter interrupts. Please would you  |
|   |interrupts]     |allow me to finish interpreting first     |
|   |Where?          |before I forget the answer he gave me.    |
|   |                |[This interruption appears as follows in  |
|   |                |the handwritten note "let me finish first |
|   |                |before I forget answer": while nothing at |
|   |                |all turns on that, and indeed we have no  |
|   |                |doubt the interpreter expressed himself as|
|   |                |politely as in the transcript, that would |
|   |                |have been better in verbatim form, subject|
|   |                |to abbreviations and punctuation being    |
|   |                |supplied.]                                |
|   |                |We went to the homes of people, to get    |
|   |                |people's support, attended meetings in    |
|   |                |cafes, asking people to vote for HADEP and|
|   |                |support the party.                        |


   Mr Omere's point on this was that the interpreter  having  to  interrupt
   the adjudicator, after she had interrupted him,  showed  what  we  might
   describe as an unacceptably brusque manner on her part.

12. We disagree. As we pointed out to Mr Omere, the result  of  the  process
   had been that the evidence which the claimant wished to  give  had  come
   out. As most people who  have  been  involved  in  adjudicator  hearings
   (which includes two of us) cannot fail to  be  aware,  it  is  sometimes
   difficult either to judge when an interpreted answer has come to an end,
   or when what has come  out  so  far  is  addressing  the  point  of  the
   question. It is the  responsibility  of  the  adjudicator  to  keep  the
   process on track, while  making  sure  that  the  claimant  has  a  full
   opportunity to say whatever is of any real  relevance.  The  interpreter
   equally has a responsibility to ensure that his half  of  that  task  is
   performed; and in this case both of them carried out their  r�les,  with
   the result that the claimant's full relevant answer was recorded.

13. Turning to the contents of the questions, Mr Omere's first point was  on
   this exchange:

|15 |Were you able to satisfy  |I did tell them that I was at my|
|   |them that you were not    |shop [and that] I was not       |
|   |involved? You were not    |involved. They made inquiries   |
|   |charged? [TONE]           |and detained me for 6 days.     |
|16 |They didn't believe you   |Yes. They detained me for 6     |
|   |were involved? [TONE]     |days. [When they] realized that |
|   |                          |I was not going to say anything |
|   |                          |and I denied it, they released  |
|   |                          |me.                             |
|17 |This was a false          |Yes                             |
|   |accusation, wasn't it?    |                                |
|   |[TONE]                    |                                |


   Mr Omere's point was that  this  line  of  questioning  was  too  cross-
   examinatory, and in the case of Q17, not even necessary.

14. While those questions taken in isolation  may  seem  to  lay  themselves
   open to that kind of comment, we have to look at them  in  context,  and
   (as Miss Gill reminded us) at the fairness of the hearing  as  a  whole.
   What these questions were directed to was how it had come to pass  that,
   after not being detained  at  all  between  1992-2000  (despite  regular
   police visits to his house and shop), the claimant should suddenly  have
   found himself taken away by them in that year,  on  suspicion  of  being
   involved in some incident (unidentified at this  point,  but  apparently
   involving the burning of  a  police  car);  but  then  released  without
   charge. To spell it out, there was  an  apparent  contradiction  in  the
   claimant's evidence that regular  police  interest  during  those  eight
   years had not resulted in his being detained; but an incident which they
   had been unable (presumably for lack of evidence) to pursue in the  face
   of his denial, had resulted in his being detained for  as  long  as  six
   days.

15. In our view, this was a point with which the claimant and  Mr  Ahluwalia
   needed to deal. It was not so obvious that the adjudicator could  simply
   sit back and take it up either with counsel, or for the  first  time  in
   her decision; but it was of quite some importance, as anyone experienced
   in the factual issues arising in cases of this kind would have realized.
   That this was what was in her mind is clearly  shown  by  the  following
   question, of whose importance Mr Omere did not seem to be aware:

|18 |Why were there not any      |I don't know how their mind   |
|   |similar accusations made by |works. They were raiding my   |
|   |them between 1992 and 2000? |house and shop, but I don't   |
|   |                            |know why.                     |


   That prepared the way for the points the adjudicator made at � 20 of her
   decision, which formed an important part of her findings. In  our  view,
   she might reasonably have  been  criticized  for  not  bringing  to  the
   claimant's attention, with some quite pointed questions at 15  -17,  the
   apparent discrepancy between what had not  happened  between  1992-2000,
   and what did happen in the latter year. He may not  have  been  able  to
   resolve that to her satisfaction; but he was  entitled  to  be  given  a
   chance to try.


16. The next exchange on which Mr Omere relied was at  Qs  20-21:  again  we
   need to set it in context.

|19 |In your SEF, you say   |That was when I was in the village.|
|   |they were suspicious of|They accused me of supplying them  |
|   |clothes being supplied |with clothes when I had the shop as|
|   |[by you to the PKK]?   |well.                              |
|20 |When you were taken in,|[They suspected me] of supplying   |
|   |you were questioned    |them [the PKK] with clothes because|
|   |about the police       |I was selling clothes in my shop.  |

|   |                       |a retailer. I had some names of    |
|   |                       |wholesalers. They took those names |
|   |                       |as well.                           |

   Mr Omere's objection to this was that it was  not  necessary  to  elicit
   this evidence (the car having already been mentioned); so the  questions
   were unacceptably cross-examinatory, especially in the phrasing of 21.

17. Q 20 in the adjudicator's record of proceedings  reads  "Jan  2000  just
   ask about police vehicle?", Q21 "April 2001  -  specific  incident  they
   asked u about?, and Q22 "In Jan 2000 did they ask u about PKK?" We  have
   no doubt  the  adjudicator  did  draw  those  dates  to  the  claimant's
   attention in her questions, though neither Mr Ahluwalia in  writing  his
   note, nor Mr Omere in addressing us appears to have been aware of  their
   importance. As the adjudicator points out in  her  comments,  the  claim
   about the police car had appeared for the first time in the evidence  in
   chief before her.

18.  It  follows  that  the  adjudicator  needed  to  draw  the   claimant's
   attention, in Qs 18-20 and 22, to the question of whether that claim was
   to be taken as superseding what he had said in his statement of evidence
   form (see � 28 at C8) about being detained in January 2000 on  suspicion
   of supplying the PKK with clothing; or  whether  the  car  incident  had
   formed an additional ground of suspicion. Q21, contrary to the  form  in
   which  it  appears  in  Mr  Ahluwalia's  note   (clearly   counsel   had
   misunderstood its purpose) was not a dogged cross-examinatory pursuit of
   the question raised in 18-20, but represented the adjudicator drawing  a
   distinction between that occasion and the next.

19. We should be the first to recognize the difficulty of  appreciating  the
   importance of individual factual points in a case of this kind, where  a
   claimant's account may have appeared in several different forms  by  the
   time of the adjudicator hearing; but we have to  say  that  the  problem
   which occurred over this passage is a vivid illustration of the  dangers
   of seeing unacceptable cross-examination everywhere, rather than looking
   for what point the adjudicator may actually be seeking to establish, and
   why.

20. Mr Omere's next point was on this:

|25 |In January 2000, they |I was accused of helping the PKK,  |
|   |didn't ask you about  |and accused of supporting the PKK, |
|   |the PKK? [TONE]       |by providing them with clothes.    |


   That, he said in effect, offended against  the  prohibition  on  leading
   questions at � 38 of WN. If one only considers the form of it,  that  is
   of course right; and, whatever was the object of the question, it  might
   have been just as well achieved in the form in which the adjudicator put
   it in her own record of proceedings "In Jan 2000 did they  ask  u  about
   PKK?". The adjudicator kept a remarkably full contemporaneous record  of
   her own questions, and the answers to them, bearing in mind that she may
   have been writing as she spoke; but that process is always easier  where
   an interpreter is involved, and we think she probably did  put  it  that
   way.

21. Even if we were wrong about that (because - contrary to our  view  -  we
   should need to be satisfied that there was no reasonable likelihood that
   it was not put in the way contended for by  Mr  Ahluwalia,  or  for  any
   other reason), we need to look,  not  just  at  the  form,  but  at  the
   context. Mr Ahluwalia's version has two intermediate  questions  on  the
   same  point  between  Q22  (see  above)  and  this  one,   whereas   the
   adjudicator's record of proceedings goes straight from one to the other.



22. This had been the adjudicator's record of Q22 and the answer to it:

| |April 2001 -      |Detained me, interrogated me for 2 days.  |
| |specific incident |This time asked me about PKK, PKK support,|
| |they asked u      |HADEP. We suspect u also have some        |
| |about?            |info[rmation]  about this organ[ization]  |


   The questions recorded by Mr Ahluwalia as Qs 23-24 (which we accept were
   asked as set out) and the answers to them appear to relate to this April
   2001 incident. Clearly what was on the adjudicator's mind,  however,  as
   it had been during Qs 18-20 and 22, was  what  had  passed  between  the
   claimant and the police in January 2000.  What  was  happening  at  Q25,
   whichever way it was put, was not her relentlessly  cross-examining  him
   about that, but trying to make sure that he understood  the  distinction
   being drawn about what they had asked him about in 2000  and  2001,  and
   that he was clear about what had happened in 2000. In the light  of  WN,
   we see nothing wrong with that whatsoever.

23. After the point already dealt with on Q28, Mr Omere's next  one  was  on
   this:

|30 |You didn't     |I distributed their leaflets, I visited   |
|   |actually do    |houses one by one. I used to go to their  |
|   |anything else  |homes as a guest, so as not to draw       |
|   |for HADEP?     |attention - although HADEP was a legal    |
|   |[TONE]         |party, I had to be cautious - and talk to |
|   |               |people to get them to support us.         |


   Mr  Omere  said  that  was  unacceptable  cross-examination,  since  the
   claimant had already mentioned what he did do for HADEP in his statement
   of evidence form (see � 24 at C7).

24. The adjudicator recorded this question simply  as  "HADEP  activities?",
   and, given the  volume  of  material  before  her,  she  may  well  have
   forgotten what it was that the  claimant  had  said  he  did  for  them.
   Whichever form the question was asked in, we do  not  think  the  "fair-
   minded and independent observer" of WN would have  seen  anything  wrong
   with it, unless the tone really had been hostile. Another two  questions
   followed (three in the adjudicator's record of proceedings):

|31 |How would you |HADEP - [although its [sic] regarded as a  |
|   |describe the  |Kurdish[ party], [it does] not [just]      |
|   |aims of HADEP?|represent Kurds. It represents all members |
|   |[TONE]        |of all groups for equal rights and         |
|   |              |opportunities in the country, without      |
|   |              |taking into account their race, religion,  |
|   |              |etc.                                       |
|32 |How does it   |DEHAP is a continuation. When HADEP was    |
|   |differ from   |closed down, DEHAP was established as a    |
|   |DEHAP?        |continuation. HADEP was closed down in     |
|   |              |2003.                                      |


25. It was only at this point that Mr Ahluwalia intervened,  recording  what
   he and the adjudicator said as follows:

| |Objection from counsel. Concerned |Adjudicator [unhappy with|
| |by the tone, number and nature of |counsel's intervention]  |
| |the questions. I am concerned that|"I am just trying to get |
| |you have entered into the are[n]a.|at the truth".           |


   Grave exception was taken to this in the grounds of appeal, not only  on
   the basis that [� 5 d)] "It is not the function of  the  adjudicator  to
   adopt an inquisitorial role"; but, specifically, at � 6 c), as follows:

   The adjudicator erred  in  applying  the  wrong  standard  of  proof  in
   assessing the answers to the questions. It is submitted that in  stating
   that 'I am just trying to get to the truth' implies [sic] that a  higher
   standard  of  proof  was  being  used  when  assessing  the  appellant's
   evidence.

26. We shall have something more to say about that in due course; but  these
   were the adjudicator's comments in reply: she accepted  that  she  might
   well have used those words, but

   This had nothing to do with  the  burden  of  proof.  It  was  merely  a
   statement of fact. I had to make findings  on  credibility  and  on  the
   facts. Unfortunately, Counsel appeared determined to believe that asking
   any questions at all on a topic was an indication that I  had  prejudged
   the issue and did not believe the appellant's case (see for example  his
   first question in re-examination ...)

   That reads, in Mr Ahluwalia's handwritten note (the transcript does  not
   go on to the re-examination): "Adjudicator putting to you that it is not
   credible that not detained between 1992 - 2000". The  claimant  gave  an
   answer in line with his previous evidence; but, not to our surprize, the
   adjudicator found it necessary to intervene herself after that:  to  our
   considerable surprize, Mr Ahluwalia did not  see  fit  to  record  this,
   though we have no doubt it was said.

   I have asked questions about this because IAT mentioned this is an  area
   which  had  been  incorrectly   assessed   by   1st   adjudicator.   Not
   stating/concluding he is not credible.



27. The first Tribunal (see 2) had said this (at � 7):

   ... regrettably the Adjudicator failed to take full account ... [of] the
   Appellant's claim that he had indeed suffered specific problems with the
   authorities during the eight year period to which  the  Adjudicator  had
   referred, including the fact that his house and his shop in  Antep  were
   raided on many occasions ...

   While  this  is  perhaps  a  slightly  different  point  from  the   one
   concentrated on by Miss Braybrook, we do not see how she can  be  blamed
   for turning her attention (and directing the claimant's) to  what  might
   be described as the central paradox of his case: why  was  it  that  the
   authorities chose to detain him in 2000, when they had not done so since
   1992, and he had been leading the same kind of life ever since?

28. Finally Mr Omere took exception to this:

|40 |You[r] village was 32 - 40% |Kurds do have problems. Some  |
|   |Kurdish. Didn't they also   |have more or worse problems   |
|   |have problems?              |that [than] others.           |


   He said this was an unnecessary question:  perhaps  it  was,  since  the
   claimant was not putting forward a  case  based  on  suffering  problems
   merely as a result of being a  Kurd,  but  on  his  individual  history.
   However we do not see how it could be said to  amount  to  objectionable
   cross-examination.

29. It is now time for us to give our views on this part of  the  claimant's
   case. The point about standard of proof in the grounds  of  appeal  (see
   26) we regard as wholly unarguable. The adjudicator correctly stated the
   'real risk' test (see Kacaj [01/TH/00632] and approved on this point  by
   the Court of Appeal) at � 9, and applied it at � 22.  There  is  nothing
   whatever to show that she did not do what she said she was doing.

30. In our view, it is a strange reflection on the  ways  of  thinking  that
   have been allowed to grow up around a judicial system that it should  be
   possible for counsel seriously to criticize an adjudicator for trying to
   get at the truth. To do Mr Omere  justice,  this  was  not  a  point  he
   pursued with any great enthusiasm: as he had to accept in the course  of
   argument, the adjudicator could not possibly have  been  criticized  for
   saying that she was trying to get at what was reasonably  likely  to  be
   true; but, as he sensibly also accepted, the use of such  an  artificial
   formula would have made no difference to the nature of the inquiries the
   adjudicator was actually pursuing, which is what we have to consider.

31. Mr Omere made a general point about  the  number  of  the  adjudicator's
   questions. Besides lengthy statements and interviews, the claimant's own
   case in evidence in chief had taken up (leaving  out  the  adjudicator's
   clarification  questions)  a  full  three  pages   of   Mr   Ahluwalia's
   handwritten note. The series of questions complained of had taken in all
   just under five pages. This may seem a great deal; but the  question  in
   terms of WN (� 38) is whether it was disproportionate to the length  and
   complexity of the case. Bearing in mind that there was  plenty  more  to
   the claimant's case than simply the evidence  in  chief,  and  that  the
   adjudicator was not approaching it completely afresh, but (in  our  view
   rightly) trying to make  sure  she  covered  the  ground  on  which  the
   previous Tribunal had remitted the case to her,  we  do  not  think  the
   length of her questions can be said to be so disproportionate as to show
   an error of law on her part.

32. There was only one general point made  by  Miss  Gill  (apart  from  the
   valid one - see 14 - about considering the fairness of the hearing as  a
   whole) which calls for comment. That is her suggestion that the claimant
   ought to have made a complaint, through his solicitors,  before  raising
   the ones he did in his grounds of appeal. We  have  to  say  we  do  not
   regard this as arguable. While there may well be points which  ought  to
   be raised at once, because they represent problems which  can  be  cured
   before an adjudicator's decision goes  out  in  its  final  form,  these
   complaints were not an example of that kind.

33. These complaints dealt with the adjudicator's general  approach  to  the
   case, and were quite properly (though we shall have more  to  say  about
   that) raised with her by Mr Ahluwalia at the hearing.  Clearly  he  went
   away with a sense of grievance: as his statement shows, he reported  his
   view of what had happened to his instructing  solicitors.  If  they  had
   written on those lines to the regional adjudicator,  we  have  no  doubt
   that they would have been met by the entirely proper reply that the case
   was before Miss Braybrook for decision, and it was not for the  regional
   adjudicator to interfere in her consideration of it. In our  view  there
   can be no possible objection to the  complaints  being  raised  for  the
   first time in writing in the grounds of appeal.

34. We can now turn to the merits of the  individual  complaints,  which  we
   have reviewed as we went.  To  summarize  our  views  on  the  areas  of
   complaint:

|our       |adjudicator'|our views                             |
|paragraphs|s questions |                                      |
|11 - 12   |27 - 28     |intervention by interpreter neither   |
|          |            |showed any preceding unfairness by    |
|          |            |adjudicator, nor had any unfair       |
|          |            |consequence                           |
|13 - 15   |15 - 18     |questioning by adjudicator about      |
|          |            |detention in 2000 (after none since   |
|          |            |1992) raised legitimate area of       |
|          |            |concern, in manner acceptable in      |
|          |            |context                               |
|16 - 19   |19 - 22     |questioning by adjudicator designed to|
|          |            |draw distinction between events of    |
|          |            |2000 and 2001, and did not amount to  |
|          |            |unacceptable cross-examination on the |
|          |            |former                                |
|20 - 22   |22 - 25     |(see 16 - 19)                         |
|23 - 27   |30 - 32     |questioning by adjudicator about      |
|          |            |claimant's HADEP activities not       |
|          |            |strictly necessary, but not           |
|          |            |objectionable; comment about search   |
|          |            |for truth not objectionable           |
|28        |40          |questioning by adjudicator about      |
|          |            |experiences of Kurds in claimant's    |
|          |            |village not necessary, but not        |
|          |            |objectionable                         |


35. As  will  now  be  clear,  we  do  not  see  anything  objectionable  in
   themselves in the adjudicator's questions or  comments  which  were  the
   subject of complaint. We do have to say that a number of  the  questions
   tended to give hostage to fortune by their form,  which  in  some  cases
   appeared rather cross-examinatory. However,  for  the  reasons  we  have
   given, we have no doubt that they were not intended in that  spirit.  On
   the other hand, they were clearly perceived in that way by Mr Ahluwalia:
   we accept that he was acting in good faith in pursuing his complaints in
   the way he did. However, his impression of the adjudicator's conduct  of
   the hearing is only of any importance so far as it might  indicate  that
   of the  hypothetical  "fair-minded  and  independent  observer"  at  the
   hearing.

36. We repeat that the Home Office never ought to have put  the  adjudicator
   in the position, in a case which was not simple in the first place,  and
   which had already been remitted once by the Tribunal, of having  herself
   to take such a large part in the necessary inquiry into the facts. It is
   now clear from WN that, subject to the words of caution set  out  there,
   an adjudicator may in such cases have a duty, as well as a right to take
   such a part  in  these  circumstances.  These  are  not  ordinary  civil
   proceedings, where rules would normally provide for  an  absent  party's
   case to fail  in  default  of  appearance.  There  is  a  strong  public
   interest, both that well-founded claims should succeed, and that  others
   should be dismissed. We regard it as clear beyond argument that the duty
   of  'most  anxious  consideration',  referred  to  in  so  many  of  the
   authorities, is one owed to the public, as well as to the claimant.

37. Bearing in mind  that  the  adjudicator  was  engaged  in  a  legitimate
   process of inquiry, would the hypothetical "fair-minded and  independent
   observer" have regarded the way she carried it out as unfair as a whole?
   We have to put ourselves in the position, so far  as  we  can,  of  this
   mythical person so well-known to the law; no doubt he (or she) is now as
   ethnically-mixed as the real-life complement of the Clapham  omnibus  on
   which he was supposed to travel. What he is not, however, is engaged  on
   one side in the way to the extent that Mr Ahluwalia clearly  was,  quite
   legitimately in principle, if not  entirely  advisably  in  the  way  he
   approached his  task.  From  the  material  (Fordham's  Judicial  Review
   Handbook, 4th ed. � 61.3.8) with which we were supplied by Mr Omere, the
   "fair-minded and independent observer" is "neither complacent nor unduly
   suspicious" (Reza v. GMC  [1991]  2  AC  182;  and  "familiar  with  the
   detailed history of the proceedings and with the way in which  cases  of
   this kind are tried" (Berg v. IML London Ltd [2002] 1 WLR 3271).

38. We have to say that Mr Ahluwalia's opening remarks  to  the  adjudicator
   about Surendran (see 7 - 8) in our view  show  him  as  seriously  over-
   sensitive to the possibility  of  apparent  bias  on  the  part  of  the
   adjudicator, in a way which WN has revealed as over-stated. He chose  to
   anticipate that possibility before the adjudicator had said anything  to
   indicate such an attitude, and we have no doubt that his approach to the
   case was coloured by the rather combative position he had already  taken
   up. We do  not  think  the  hypothetical  "fair-minded  and  independent
   observer"  would  have  shared  his  impression  of  the  tone  of   the
   adjudicator's questioning: it will have been noted that  he  managed  to
   inject this impression into what, even in his own version, was not  only
   a neutral, but a perfectly neutrally-expressed question about  the  aims
   of HADEP (see 24, Q31).

39. It was only  after  another  similarly  unobjectionable  question  about
   DEHAP that Mr Ahluwalia chose to intervene.  As  we  have  already  made
   clear, he was quite right to take up any grievance  he  thought  he  had
   there and then; but the only  objectively  justifiable  reason  for  his
   doing  so  at  that  point  could  have  been  that  the   adjudicator's
   questioning had somehow crossed the line of the permissible in terms  of
   length. For the reasons given at 31, we do not think it had.

40. As the adjudicator points out, Mr  Ahluwalia's  first  question  in  re-
   examination (see 26) makes it clear that he  had  misunderstood  her  as
   having already taken up a position on the claimant's  credibility.  That
   he realized himself he had gone too far in this  may  be  shown  by  his
   omission from his own note of the rather mild  reproof  the  adjudicator
   then administered, more  in  the  way  of  a  statement  of  her  actual
   position, and the way she saw her task, especially in the light  of  the
   previous Tribunal decision. That impression is  confirmed  by  what  the
   adjudicator says at the end of her comments:

   At the conclusion of his submissions, Counsel expressed  the  hope  that
   his confrontational style during the hearing  would  not  prejudice  his
   client.

41. We do not think for one moment that Mr  Ahluwalia's  style  of  advocacy
   did prejudice the claimant in the mind of the  adjudicator;  but  we  do
   think it shows him as a very much less than objective  observer  of  the
   proceedings before her. On all the material before us, we take the  view
   that the adjudicator's impression of Mr Ahluwalia's attitude, set out in
   her comments already quoted at 26, was entirely justified. It is a  pity
   that it has led to so  much  time  being  spent  on  how  the  case  was
   conducted, rather than on its merits; but the complaints made about that
   have had to be fully investigated. For the  reasons  given,  we  do  not
   consider them made out.

42. Merits  Turning finally to this part of the case, Mr Omere's only  point
   on it was that the adjudicator had not taken account of the approach now
   laid down for cases of this kind (Turkish Kurds, in case that has by now
   been forgotten) by the Tribunal in IK Turkey CG [2004] UKIAT  00312.  As
   of course Mr Omere acknowledged, the decision in IK 04-312  did  not  go
   out till 2 December 2004, long after the adjudicator heard  the  present
   case. While  it  may  certainly  amount  to  an  error  of  law  for  an
   adjudicator not to take account of a 'country guidance' decision already
   in the public domain, of which she is obliged to take  judicial  notice,
   we do not think it can possibly amount to such an error for her  not  to
   anticipate one still over five months into the future, even when her own
   went out on 23 June (signed by her on the 8th).

43. Mr Omere did not seem to have appreciated the distinction that needs  to
   be drawn between decisions  declaratory  of  the  common  law,  or  even
   authoritatively interpreting statutory material already in force on  the
   one hand; and on the other those described by the Court of Appeal in  ??
   [2002] EWCA Civ 539 as embodying "the  somewhat  exotic  doctrine  of  a
   factual precedent". These have been recognized  (not  least  in  Shirazi
   [2003] EWCA Civ 1562) as essential to the Tribunal's performance of  its
   r�le; but that does  not  mean  that  they  should  be  regarded  as  an
   authoritative statement of the  factual  situation  in  the  country  in
   question, not only as it was at the date of the hearing, but as  it  had
   been at all material times.

44. As we made clear, Mr Omere could only show an error of law on  the  part
   of the adjudicator in her assessment of the background evidence if  that
   showed a mistake of fact within the extended definition in E & R  [2003]
   EWCA Civ 49. The only point he put forward as doing so (set out  in  the
   grounds of appeal at � 13) referred to a Swiss  report,  quoted  in  the
   April 2004 version of the CIPU report. This version was  made  available
   to the adjudicator, and she set out the  relevant  part  of  the  report
   (Swiss Organization for Refugees, June 2003), at  �  27,  and  gave  her
   views on it as follows:

   '... Despite the absence of entries in the central  information  system,
   the individual concerned might be listed on one of the other information
   systems. This must certainly be assumed in the case of  individuals  who
   have already been taken into custody by the police, gendarmerie or  some
   other branch of  the  security  service  in  the  past'.  There  was  no
   indication of the basis for these conclusions and  nothing  to  indicate
   that the  source  was  more  reliable  than  the  information  from  the
   department.'

45. Mr Omere could only  succeed  on  this  point  on  the  basis  that  the
   decision in IK 04-312 showed, as set out in E&R at � 66,  that  each  of
   the following factors affected the adjudicator's decision  [the  lay-out
   below is ours, but the words are the Court of Appeal's]:

    1. There must have been a mistake as to an existing  fact,  including  a
       mistake as to the availability of evidence on a particular matter.
    2. The fact or evidence must have been "established", in the sense  that
       it was uncontentious and objectively verifiable.
    3. The appellant (or his advisers) must not have  been  responsible  for
       the mistake.
    4. The mistake must have played a material  (not  necessarily  decisive)
       part in the Tribunal's reasoning.

46. If the adjudicator's conclusions, set out at 44, involved a  mistake  in
   the sense of 1-2 above, then it was capable of  being  a  material  one,
   because her final paragraph on the asylum claim begins as follows:

   30.       I concluded that the appellant's detentions in 1990  and  1992
       would not be recorded on the GBTS system.

   The importance of that finding is that, strange as it may seem to  those
   unfamiliar with these cases, there was a serious  argument  on  risk  on
   return, even though the adjudicator had disbelieved the claimant on  the
   events in January 2000 onwards, which he said had made him leave Turkey,
   and on a basis we have upheld. What is now said on his behalf  is  that,
   even though the rather ancient history of 1990-92 had  not  led  to  any
   further detentions for him while he remained in Turkey till 2001, yet it
   might have done so on his return there in 2004.

47. The background evidence relied on by the Home Office  shows  (and  there
   is no controversy about this) that the GBTS  (the  "central  information
   system" of the  Swiss  report)  is  the  system  consulted  by  security
   personnel at the point of return (usually Istanbul airport); and that it
   contains no details of (in Turkish legal terms) "detentions" (periods in
   informal custody, such as this claimant  complained  of),  but  only  of
   "arrests" (by order of a court). The importance of the Swiss report  was
   that it suggested that  such  security  personnel  might  consult  other
   records, which might show up "detentions". Again, if taking  a  contrary
   view did involve a "mistake" on the adjudicator's part, then it was  not
   one for which the claimant was responsible,  because  Mr  Ahluwalia  had
   referred her to the treatment of it in the April 2004 CIPU report.

48. What we  now  have  to  decide  is  whether  that  view  did  involve  a
   "mistake", in the very limited E&R sense. The only  basis  on  which  Mr
   Omere could contend that it did is on  IK  04-312,  where  the  Tribunal
   (Batiste & Perkins VPP, with a legal member) went  at  length  into  the
   question of what records were available at the  point  of  return.  They
   said specifically at � 32:

   We also see no good reason to dispute the clarification from the Turkish
   authorities that this [list of what was available on it]  must  be  read
   subject to the previously unappreciated  distinction  between  "arrests"
   and "detentions".

49. The considered view of the Tribunal  in  IK  04-312,  having  heard  and
   considered a large volume of evidence, was this (at � 87):

   ... the evidence before us  does  not  suggest  in  our  view  that  any
   additional  information  system  will  be  directly  available  at   the
   [airport] police station beyond the GBTS and the border control records.
   We consider however that if unresolved doubts  remain  from  questioning
   the returnee it is reasonably likely that further enquiries will be made
   as appropriate in the circumstances and any new information arising as a
   result will be assessed on its merits.

   While it is right that we should set out the proviso  ("...however  ..."
   ), we  repeat  that  the  Swiss  evidence  was  made  available  to  and
   considered by the adjudicator; so only if she assessed it in a way which
   was uncontentiously and objectively verifiably wrong would her  decision
   on the point amount to a mistake within E&R.

50. What the  Tribunal  were  to  say  (see  above),  not  only  about  that
   evidence, but about a very great deal more on the same point  shows  not
   only that the adjudicator was not wrong in that way, but that she was in
   fact right, so far as the GBTS was concerned.  There  is  no  suggestion
   that border control records are  of  any  relevance  in  this  case.  It
   follows that the claimant's challenge to the merits of the adjudicator's
   decision cannot succeed either.
