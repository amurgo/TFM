For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Brazil who was born on 29  October  1983.
    She entered the United Kingdom on 12 June 2008  with  her  husband,  an
    Italian citizen, and was granted six months' leave as a  visitor.   She
    subsequently made an application for a residence  card  as  the  family
    member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003 as amended) (the  "EEA
    Regulations").  On 8 May 2009 the appellant was issued with a residence
    card valid until 8 May 2014.

 2. On 3 May 2014, the  appellant  made  an  application  for  a  permanent
    residence card as the family  member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK.  She relied  upon  reg  15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.  Her claim was that she had been resident  in  the  UK  in
    accordance with the EEA Regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five
    years.  Although she and her husband had separated  in  December  2012,
    she claimed that for a five year period between 12  June  2008  and  12
    June 2013 he had been exercising treaty rights as a worker  in  the  UK
    and that, therefore, as his family member she had, for that  period  of
    time, a right to reside under the reg 14(2)  despite  their  separation
    (see Diatta v Land Berlin (C267/83) [1985] ECR 567 and PM (EEA - spouse
    -"residing with") Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC)).

 3. On 16 June 2014, the Secretary of State refused her application  for  a
    permanent residence card.

The Appeal

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 3 November 2014, Judge Harries dismissed the appellant's
    appeal.  She was not satisfied, on the evidence, that the appellant had
    established that her  separated  husband  had  been  exercising  treaty
    rights for a five year period and so, as a consequence, she had  failed
    to establish that she had resided in the UK in accordance with the  reg
    14(2) for a continuous period of five  years  to  acquire  a  right  of
    permanent residence under reg 15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a
    number of grounds.

 6. First, the judge had failed  properly  to  consider  all  the  evidence
    including the documentary evidence and also the oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant which (it  was  claimed)  established  that  the  appellant's
    separated husband had, in fact, been working for  a  five  year  period
    between June 2008 and June 2013 such that the appellant had established
    her permanent right of residence.

 7. Secondly, it was argued that the Tribunal had erred in law  by  failing
    to make, or consider making, a direction  that  the  respondent  should
    exercise her power under s.40 of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  to  seek
    necessary information concerning  the  employment  of  the  appellant's
    separated husband from HM Revenue & Customs or from the employer of the
    appellant's former husband.

 8. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but, on renewal, on 27 April 2015 the  Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ  Lindsley)
    granted permission on all grounds.

 9. On 7 May 2015, the Secretary of State filed a response  under  Rule  24
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision on the basis that the judge  had
    properly considered all the evidence and that it  was  not  appropriate
    for the judge to issue a direction to the respondent  to  exercise  her
    power under s.40 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

10. Thus, the appeal came before us.

The Submissions

11. Before us, Mr Joseph, who represented the appellant, essentially relied
    upon the grounds of appeal.  He submitted that the judge had  erred  in
    law by failing properly to consider the documentary evidence submitted.
     He submitted that  the  judge  had  been  wrong  in  para  19  of  her
    determination to state that there were no contracts  of  employment  in
    respect of the appellant's husband.  He submitted that there were  such
    documents in the extensive bundle of documents submitted for the First-
    tier Tribunal hearing.  Further, Mr Joseph submitted that the judge had
    been wrong in para 20 to state that there was "no  supporting  evidence
    by way of documents" to show that  the  appellant's  husband  had  been
    employed beyond December 2012.  Mr Joseph directed us to a letter dated
    29 April 2014 from HM Revenue & Customs which sets out  the  employment
    details (including employee pay and tax) for  the  tax  years  2008-09,
    2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14.  He submitted  that  it
    was clear for the tax year ending 5 April  2013  that  the  appellant's
    husband had earned �28,056 and that  this  was  commensurate  with  his
    employment for the full tax year including the period January  2013  to
    April 2013.

12. Secondly, Mr Joseph acknowledged that there was no documentary evidence
    supporting the employment of the appellant's  husband  beyond  5  April
    2013 before the First-tier Judge but,  he  submitted,  the  appellant's
    oral evidence was that she had been told by a friend in May  2014  that
    her husband  continued  to  work  in  the  same  place  (which  on  the
    documentary evidence would be for a company run by Mr J M Freeth called
    Thamesdown Recycling).  Mr Joseph submitted that the judge had erred in
    law by failing to make  any  finding  in  respect  of  the  appellant's
    evidence which, if the judge accepted it, when added to the documentary
    evidence supporting her former husband's employment to  4  April  2013,
    resulted in a continuous period of employment up to at  least  12  June
    2013 which would be sufficient for the  appellant  to  succeed  in  her
    appeal.

13. When we raised with Mr Joseph the ground relying upon s.40  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007, he indicated that he would only rely on  that  ground
    if we did not accept the error identified in his submissions as to  the
    judge's  assessment  of  the  documentary  and  oral  evidence.   As  a
    consequence, we proceeded to hear  submissions  from  Mr  Richards,  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, in respect of the judge's  assessment
    of the evidence and, as will be clear shortly, given the view  we  took
    at the hearing, it  was  unnecessary  to  consider  any  submission  in
    respect of s.40 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

14. Mr Richards, who represented the Secretary of State, accepted that  the
    judge was wrong to state in  para  20  that  there  was  no  supporting
    evidence for the employment of the appellant's former  husband  between
    January and April 2013.  However,  he  submitted  that  error  was  not
    material as it did not, in itself, establish continuous  employment  by
    him for the requisite five  years  under  the  EEA  Regulations.   That
    required evidence up to at least June 2013.

15. As regards the appellant's oral evidence, Mr  Richards  submitted  that
    the appellant had no personal knowledge of her husband's employment but
    had merely been told by a friend.  The appellant had no direct  contact
    with her husband; it was merely what she believed to be the position as
    regards his continuing employment.

16. Mr Richards submitted that the judge had not erred in law by failing to
    take into account all the evidence and, on the basis  of  it,  reach  a
    sustainable  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not  established   the
    requisite five years' employment by her husband between June  2008  and
    June 2013.

Error of Law

17. The applicable law in the EEA  Regulations  is  not  contentious.   The
    appellant claimed a permanent right  of  residence  by  virtue  of  reg
    15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations on the basis that she  had  resided  in
    the UK as a

         "family member of an EEA national ... who has resided in the United
         Kingdom with the EEA national in accordance with these  Regulations
         for a continuous period of five years ...".

18. In order to  establish  that  residence  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations, in effect, under reg 14(2) the appellant  is  required  to
    establish that she resided in  the  UK  as  the  "family  member  of  a
    qualified person in the UK", namely that her husband was a "worker" for
    the purposes of EU law.  Given the appellant's case, she  was  required
    to establish that he was a "worker" for the period 12 June 2008  to  12
    June 2013.  The fact they were  separated  for  some  of  the  time  is
    irrelevant (see, Diatta and PM).

19. Judge Harries dealt with the documentary evidence  at  paras  18-20  as
    follows:

         "18. The appellant gave details of her spouse's employment  in  the
             United Kingdom on her application form for periods  from  10th
             July 2008 to 5th September 2008; from 27th July 2009  to  23rd
             August 2009; from 3rd October 2008 to 6th April 2010; from 8th
             September 2008 to 19th August 2011 and from 19th  August  2011
             to  the  date  of  application,  namely  3rd  May  2014.   The
             appellant has submitted a  bundle  of  documents  including  a
             schedule of earnings provided by H M Revenue & Customs for the
             appellant's spouse showing earnings for the  tax  years  2009,
             2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

         19.  I accept that there is evidence that the  appellant's  husband
             had taxable income in the years shown on H M Revenue & Customs
             documents but this does not  show  continuity  of  employment.
             The appellant submitted several packs of various documents for
             the years from 2008 to 2013 at the hearing.   These  documents
             included numerous payslips for the appellant and  her  husband
             and contracts of employment for  the  appellant.   There  are,
             however,  no  contracts  of  employment  for  the  appellant's
             husband.

         20.  I have  examined  each  payslip  submitted  and  there  are  a
             substantial number to show monthly income for the  appellant's
             husband for 4 years from 2009 to 2012  inclusive.   There  is,
             however, no evidence of employment or income before June  2008
             and there is only one payslip for 2013,  that  being  for  the
             month of January 2013.  Thereafter the appellant accepts  that
             she cannot access the necessary evidence in the light  of  her
             estrangement  from  her  husband.   There  is  accordingly  no
             supporting evidence by way of documents to show the  appellant
             to be correct in her  belief  that  her  husband's  employment
             continued beyond December 2012 and is current".

20. Mr Richards accepted that the HM Revenue  &  Customs  letter  dated  29
    April 2014 (at pages 68-69) did show that the appellant's  husband  had
    been employed until the end of the tax year 5 April  2013  and  so  the
    judge was wrong to state at the end  of  para  20  that  there  was  no
    supporting evidence to show his employment beyond  December  2012.   We
    agree that the judge was in error in that respect.  We do not  set  out
    in detail the letter of  29  April  2014  but,  for  this  purpose,  it
    suffices to  say  that  it  clearly  supports  the  employment  of  the
    appellant's husband up to 5 April 2013.

21. At para 20, the judge appears to accept that  the  appellant's  husband
    was employed from June 2008.  That is partially supported by the  entry
    in the Revenue letter for the tax year 2008-09 to the  extent  that  it
    identifies an employment with "Field  Commercial  Recruitment  Limited"
    ending on 5 September 2008 prior to the appellant's husband  moving  on
    to employment from 8 September 2008 with "Storm  Recruitment  Limited".
    However, as Mr Joseph submitted to us, the bundle of  documents  before
    the judge included pay slips issued by  "Field  Commercial  Recruitment
    Limited", the earliest of which is dated "20.06.08" in respect  of  the
    appellant's husband showing gross pay of �346.50 for the previous  week
    but, in addition, showing "gross pay  to  date"  of  �456.75".   It  is
    clear, therefore, that the appellant's husband was receiving income for
    work through "Field Commercial Recruitment Limited" prior to  the  week
    of 13-20 June 2008.

22. The judge does not specifically refer to this  pay  slip  but,  in  our
    judgment, it  clearly  supports  what  she  says  in  para  20  of  her
    determination that, in effect, the evidence relating to the  employment
    and income of the appellant's husband exists in the documents from June
    2008, in fact, from a date entirely  consistent  with  the  appellant's
    case that her husband worked from 12 June 2008.

23. Of course, the documentary evidence did  not  support  the  appellant's
    claim that her husband was employed beyond  5  April  2013.   Her  oral
    evidence was, however, that she had been told by a friend in  May  2014
    that at that date (and therefore in the relevant period April 2013-June
    2013), her husband continued to work  for  Mr  Freeth.   The  appellant
    provided no supporting documentation.  As will  become  clear  shortly,
    that documentation has subsequently been submitted to the Tribunal.

24. In his submissions, Mr Richards  accepted  that  an  individual's  oral
    evidence (if accepted by a judge) could be sufficient to "plug the gap"
    left by documentary evidence.  We agree.  Here, however, the judge made
    no finding in relation to the appellant's evidence that  she  had  been
    told in May 2014 by a friend that her separated  husband  continued  to
    work for Mr Freeth.

25. Mr Richards placed considerable weight on the fact that  the  appellant
    had no personal knowledge of this but only, in the words of the  judge,
    "believes" that her husband lives and works in the same place.  In  our
    judgment, that the appellant's evidence was, in  effect,  hearsay  only
    went to the weight which the judge could, in the  context  of  all  the
    evidence, give to that evidence.  It did not  absolve  the  judge  from
    making a finding whether or not she accepted the  appellant's  evidence
    and, if she did, whether  it  was  sufficient  to  establish  that  her
    separated husband had been working in the UK beyond 4 April  2013.   We
    acknowledge that the judge was not  bound  to  accept  the  appellant's
    evidence but, we do note, that the judge does not at any point  in  her
    determination call into question the  appellant's  credibility.   There
    would, even if the appellant's evidence were accepted, remain the issue
    of what weight to give to it since it was  hearsay.   However,  in  the
    absence of any finding it is not possible to say what  view  the  judge
    took, or would take, of that evidence.  That, in our judgment, amounted
    to an error of law in reaching her adverse findings.

26. Although Mr Joseph placed some reliance upon the judge failing to  note
    that  the  documents  did  contain  contracts  of  employment  for  the
    appellant's husband, and there clearly was such  a  contract  effective
    from 8 August 2011 in relation to his employment by Mr  Freeth,  we  do
    not consider that this adds anything to the appellant's case  that  the
    judge erred in law.  In our judgment, the judge clearly erred  in  law;
    first in failing properly to take into account the  evidence  from  the
    Revenue as to the employment of the appellant's husband up to  5  April
    2013; and secondly, in failing to make any finding in relation  to  the
    appellant's evidence which was capable of  establishing,  if  accepted,
    that her husband continued  to  be  employed  after  that  date  for  a
    sufficient period to complete the  five  years'  continuous  employment
    upon which the appellant relied for her permanent right of residence.

27. For those reasons, the judge's  decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of an error of  law.   Her  adverse  factual
    finding cannot stand and we set the decision aside.

28. In the light of that decision, which we announced at  the  end  of  the
    submissions, we heard no submissions in relation  to  s.40  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

Re-making the Decision

29. Mr Richards accepted that there  was  now  evidence  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal  that  the  appellant's  separated  husband  continued  to  be
    employed by Mr Freeth for the tax year ending 5 April 2014.  At pages 9-
    10 of the bundle a letter from the Revenue dated 29 January  2015  sets
    out that the appellant's husband was employed by Mr Freeth during  that
    tax year with a gross pay of �25,843.  In our judgment,  that  evidence
    clearly establishes on a balance of probabilities that the  appellant's
    separated husband continued to work in the UK from 5 April 2013  until,
    at least, 5 April 2014.

30. Mr Richards did not seek to submit that the appellant's  appeal  should
    not, therefore, now succeed on its merits.

31. In our judgment, he was correct to do so.  The documentary evidence, in
    particular the evidence of employment and income set  out  now  in  the
    Revenue's letter for 29 January 2015 (together with the pay  slips,  in
    particular the pay slip relating to employment in June 2008), establish
    on a balance  of  probabilities  that  the  appellant's  now  separated
    husband was a "worker" for the period 12 June  2008  to  12  June  2013
    relied upon by the appellant to establish that she has been resident in
    the UK in accordance with the EEA Regulations for a  continuous  period
    of five years as a family member of an EEA national  exercising  treaty
    rights.

32. Mr Richards did not suggest that there were any relevant breaks in  the
    continuity of the employment of the appellant's  husband.   Nothing  in
    the evidence leads us to doubt  that  the  appellant's  husband  was  a
    "worker" under EU law either because he was actually working or  was  a
    jobseeker or was seeking work "between jobs".

33. For these reasons, we are satisfied on a balance of probabilities  that
    the appellant has established a permanent right of residence under  reg
    15(1)(b) as a family member of an EEA national who has resided  in  the
    UK for a continuous period of five years in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations.

Decision

34. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of law.  We set  the
    decision aside.

35. We remake the decision allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision refusing to  issue  a  permanent  residence  card
    under the EEA Regulations.

                                                                      Signed

We have allowed the appeal and to the extent that a fee has been paid or  is
payable, we make a fee award of any fee  which  has  been  paid  or  may  be
