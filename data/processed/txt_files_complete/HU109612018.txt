For the Appellant:     Mrs M Cleghorn, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Uzbekistan.

 2. She initially entered the United Kingdom as a visitor and on 4 December
    2017 applied for a variation of her leave to remain as  the  spouse  of
    the Sponsor, a British citizen. That application was refused on  8  May
    2018 and the Appellant appealed  on  Article  8  grounds  against  that
    decision.

 3. Her appeal was initially heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J  M
    Holmes who, in a decision promulgated on 28  November  2018,  dismissed
    it.

 4. The Appellant sought permission to appeal against that decision. It was
    initially refused but a renewed application to the Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted on 28 February 2019 by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rimington.  Her
    reasons for so granting were: -

         "It is unnecessary to hold an oral hearing of the  application  for
         permission to appeal because I consider that  it  can  properly  be
         dealt with on the papers.


         Despite a carefully reasoned decision,  it  is  arguable  that  the
         interests of the British citizen children and  the  application  of
         Section 117(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
         have not been fully explored when considering removal to the UAE or
         Uzbekistan.


         Permission is granted on all grounds."

 5. Thus, the appeal came before me today.


 6. At the outset Mrs Petterson informed me that Respondent's position  was
    that the Judge had materially erred and she invited me  to  remake  the
    decision by allowing the appeal. She referred me to the authority of JG
    (S117B (6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019]  UKUT  00072  (IAC)
    27.


 7. Perhaps not surprisingly Mrs Cleghorn did not seek to dissuade me  from
    this course.


 8. The brief facts are that the Appellant is a citizen of  Uzbekistan  who
    entered the United Kingdom  on  21  June  2017  as  a  visitor,  having
    declared an intention to visit the United Kingdom for 10 days to attend
    a family wedding. On 4 December 2017 she applied for a variation of her
    leave to remain as the spouse of the Sponsor, a British  citizen.  That
    application was refused on 8 May 2018. The Respondent's reason for  the
    refusal was that the Appellant had entered as a visitor, and  that  she
    should return to Uzbekistan to make an application for entry  clearance
    as a spouse. The Appellant appealed that decision on Article 8 grounds.


 9. The Respondent's case was that the position is that the  Appellant  had
    demonstrated no good reason why she should not be expected to leave the
    United Kingdom and seek entry clearance as a spouse in the  usual  way.
    The Appellant's case was, in the First-tier Tribunal, also advanced  by
    Mrs Cleghorn. She argued that albeit a British citizen child is  not  a
    "trump card", nevertheless  since  the  Appellant's  two  children  are
    British citizens, it is disproportionate given their  ages,  to  expect
    the Appellant to leave the United Kingdom to make  an  entry  clearance
    application, because to do so would separate her from them.  The  "best
    interests" of both children required that they should  both  live  with
    both of their parents, without any interruption, and thus the Appellant
    should be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom indefinitely.


10. At paragraph 27 of JG an Upper Tribunal Presidential Panel found:-

         "27. We do not consider that paragraphs 18 and 19 of  KO  (Nigeria)
         mandate or even lend support to  the  respondent's  interpretation.
         In those paragraphs, the point being made by Lord Carnwath  and  by
         the judges in the cases he cited is  merely  that,  in  determining
         whether it would be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom, one must have regard to the fact that one  or  both
         of the child's parents will no longer be  in  the  United  Kingdom,
         because they  will  have  been  removed  by  the  respondent  under
         immigration powers.  That, we find, is  the  extent  of  the  "real
         world" envisaged by Lord Carnwath."

11. After consideration of the jurisprudence in KO (Nigeria) & Ors  v  SSHD
    [2018] UKSC 53 and the guidance given at various times by the Secretary
    of State to its caseworkers, the Upper Tribunal concluded at  paragraph
    39 that section S.117B(6) when properly construed could  result  in  "a
    person with  parental  responsibility  who  could  not  invoke  section
    117B(6) may, nevertheless,  succeed  in  a  human  rights  appeal".  At
    paragraph 41 the Upper Tribunal stated:-

         "41.  We  accept  that  this  interpretation  may  result   in   an
         underserving individual or family remaining in the United  Kingdom.
         However, the fact that Parliament  has  mandated  such  an  outcome
         merely means that, in such cases, Parliament has decided to be more
         generous than is strictly required by the Human  Rights  Act  1998.
         It can be regarded as a necessary consequence of the aim of Part 5A
         of imposing greater consistency in decision-making in this area  by
         courts and tribunals.  The fact that section 117B(6)  has  such  an
         aim was expressly recognised by Elias LJ  at  paragraph  44  of  MA
         (Pakistan)."

12. The Appellant's eldest child was born on 29 October 2011 in  Uzbekistan
    and the youngest child was born on 22  September  2017  in  the  United
    Kingdom. Thus, the Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 21 June 2017
    when about six months pregnant. It is not in dispute that  family  life
    exists between the Appellant, her husband and the children.


13. The decision under appeal interferes with the right to family  life  of
    the Appellant, her husband and their children. I am satisfied that  the
    best interests of the children are to remain in the United Kingdom. The
    question is whether there are factors weighing against those  interests
    such as that it would not be unreasonable to  expect  the  children  to
    relocate with their mother, even if it were on a temporary basis.  That
    would of course separate them  from  their  father.  The  only  adverse
    criticism of the Appellant is that she arrived in  the  United  Kingdom
    initially as a visitor and then sought leave to remain as the spouse of
    her Sponsor and husband.


14. The children are British citizens and I find that it is in  their  best
    interest to remain in the United Kingdom. There are no factors weighing
    against those interests such that  it  would  not  be  unreasonable  to
    expect them to  relocate.  It  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    children to follow their mother  to  Uzbekistan  even  on  a  temporary
    basis.


15. Consequently, even assuming the children remain with their  mother  (or
    indeed their father too) as a family unit outside the United Kingdom it
    would be disproportionate to any legitimate public objective,  such  as
    the maintenance of proper immigration control, to require them to leave
    the United Kingdom. To put it in another way, the public interest  does
    not require the children's removal from the United Kingdom. The removal
    of the Appellant would not be proportionate in terms of  Article  8  of
    the European Convention: see paragraph 96 of JG.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside that decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid,  I  have
considered making a fee award and have decided to make a whole fee award  of
ï¿½140.00.
