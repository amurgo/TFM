For the Appellant:     Mr Jesurum, instructed by Alsters Kelley Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr Hussein, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Nigeria and  was  born  on  4  June
    1980. The other three appellants are his wife and two  minor  children.
    Their cases have been run in identical terms and for  the  purposes  of
    this determination I refer only to the first appellant.

 2. This is an appeal against the determination dated 27 June 2013 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Chohan which refused the family's appeal for  leave
    to remain as Tier 1 migrants and on Article 8 grounds.

Background

 3. The appellant came to the UK in 2005 as a student. He remained here  in
    that capacity until 30 April 2009. He studied accountancy. On the  11th
    2009 he was granted a further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant  under  the  Points  Based  System  (PBS).  He   obtained   his
    accountancy exams and was made an affiliate  member  of  the  ACCA.  He
    worked for St John Ambulance from October 2010  to  May  2012.  He  has
    worked for University Hospitals Coventry  and  Warwickshire  NHS  Trust
    from May 2012.

 4. The appellant's wife came to the UK in 2007 to  study  for  a  Master's
    degree in Business Administration at Coventry University. She  and  the
    appellant married on 19 December 2009. They have two children  born  in
    the UK on 12 August 2010 and 18 September 2012.  The  appellant's  wife
    has worked at Coventry University since August 2011.

 5. As indicated in their witness statements presented  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the appellant and his wife  are  professionals  in  permanent
    employment with a joint annual income of over ï¿½51,000. At the  time  of
    the decision they were planning to buy a house and looking in into  the
    various education options for their children. The appellant is a valued
    employee, his NHS Trust providing a letter dated 22 August 2013 stating
    that he is a "key individual" and that:

              "A great deal of time has been invested in  training  Rasheed,
              which if he was forced to leave his job, I  can  honestly  say
              would be a loss to this hospital."

 6.  On 3 November 2012 the appellant applied for further leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. On 30 January 2013 the respondent  wrote
    to the appellant requesting evidence of his registration with HMRC  and
    further evidence related to his self-employed earnings. On  6  February
    2013 the appellant replied, indicating that the further evidence sought
    was not available. The respondent then refused the  application  on  18
    February 2013 as  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245CA and paragraphs 19 (b) and 19SD (b) of Appendix A of  HC
    395 (the Immigration Rules).

 7. It was conceded before First-tier Tribunal that the appellant could not
    meet the Immigration Rules. An argument that the decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law as the  respondent  had  failed  to  apply  her
    evidential flexibility policy properly was dismissed. The appeal  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR was dismissed  as  it  was  not  found  that  the
    appellant  had  shown  that  the  decision  amounted  to  a  sufficient
    interference such that article 8 was  engaged  further,  the  principal
    often referred to as the second "Razgar" question.

Grounds of Appeal

 8. Permission to appeal was refused on the first ground which related to a
    "wider duty of fairness" and that matter was not pursued before me.

 9. I heard from Mr Jesurum and Mr  Hussein  on  the  second  ground  which
    challenged the decision of the first tribunal judge at  [20]  that  the
    interference with the appellant's private life was  not  sufficient  to
    engage Article 8 further.

10. It was my view that the First-tier Tribunal judge was clearly in  error
    in finding at [20] that the threshold for engaging  Article  8  further
    was not met. In AG (Eritrea) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 801, the  Court  of
    Appeal held that, while an interference with  private  or  family  life
    must be real, the threshold of engagement (the 'minimum level') is "not
    a specially high one." The appellant has been in the  UK  lawfully  for
    eight years, studying and working. His wife has been here  five  years,
    also studying and working. They married and had  their  children  here.
    Both have the substantial  ties  to  the  UK  through  their  work  and
    community to be expected from  a  professional  family.  Their  private
    lives are such that they must be found to meet the  low  threshold  for
    engaging Article 8 further.

11. I found that this matter amounted to an error on a point  of  law  such
    that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  second  Razgar
    question should be set aside and re-made.

12. I proceeded to do so. It will be clear for the reasons  set  out  above
    that I found that the decision interfered with the private life of this
    family sufficiently so as to engage Article 8 further.

13. The second and third Razgar questions not being in dispute, I proceeded
    to assess the proportionality of that interference. Mr Jesurum did  not
    seek to argue that family life played a significant part in this appeal
    as the family will return together.

14. I accept all of the matters set out in [3] to [5] above weigh in favour
    of the appellant and his family in the proportionality assessment.  The
    appellant and his  wife  have  impressive  educational  and  employment
    records. Their time in the UK, eight years for the  appellant  and  six
    years for his wife, has been lawful and productive.  The  appellant  is
    valued in his work place and his employer will have to invest time  and
    funds in any replacement in  order  for  them  to  be  as  valuable  an
    employee as the appellant. Their return to  Nigeria  will  entail  much
    upheaval and expense as they re-establish themselves there after a long
    period living abroad. There was little evidence  on  the  point  but  I
    accept   that   their   employment   opportunities   and    educational
    opportunities for their children may  be  less  there  but,  given  the
    professional backgrounds of the appellant and his wife, it did not seem
    to me that there could be a great difference.

15. It remains the case that the appellant and his wife have lived  by  far
    the majority of their lives in Nigeria and have significant ties  there
    that will assist them, after the  initial  period  of  readjusting,  to
    resume private lives of the same substance as they have in the UK. They
    came as students and have completed the studies for  which  they  came.
    They have only ever had limited leave.  Their  immigration  status  has
    never been such that they had a legitimate expectation of  settling  in
    the UK permanently.

16. Case law from Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007]  UKHL  11  onwards
    has consistently stated that it will be only a minority  of  case  that
    can succeed under Article 8 where the Immigration Rules are not met. In
    Huang this was expressed  in  terms  of  the  interference  leading  to
    "sufficiently serious" circumstances for those concerned.

17. It is not my view that the difficulties set out at [14] that arise from
    the decision  bring  this  family  within  the  "sufficiently  serious"
    category even when all the positive factors in [13] are  weighed  fully
    in their favour. The need for an effective immigration system  and  the
    concomitant economic interests of the country outweigh the interference
    with their private life arising from the decision.

18. Mr Jesurum sought to argue that the decision  was  disproportionate  or
    unlawful as it went beyond the minimum level of  interference  required
    to serve the legitimate end of enforcing effective immigration  control
    and ensuring the  economic  well-being  of  the  country  thereby.  The
    detriment to the public good here was very limited. It was merely  that
    the appellant was not registered with HMRC as a  self-employed  person.
    The extremely small tax liability that arose once he had registered had
    been discharged. The immigration system could not be said  to  be  made
    more porous or less certain by this family being allowed to remain.  As
    I understood his argument, the lesser and correct level of interference
    necessary to achieve the legitimate aim would be allow the appeal.

19. With respect to Mr Jesurum, whose energy and legal acuity were  obvious
    from his submissions, this appeared to me to be a "near miss"  argument
    although expressed in different language.  The weight to  be  given  to
    the public interest side of the balance does not decrease or fall to be
    assessed differently because the failure to meet the Immigration  Rules
    is minor; Miah v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261 applies, see paragraphs  [22]
    and [23] in particular. Being allowed to remain under Article 8 of  the
    ECHR when they  do  not  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  and  where  the
    circumstances of the family will not  be  "sufficiently  serious"  does
    undermine an effective immigration system. The logic  of  Mr  Jesurum's
    argument is that anyone who complies with immigration control  and  the
    laws of the UK during a period of leave would be entitled to  say  that
    they should win their case under Article 8 if  they  do  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules by a small amount. That cannot be correct. There must
    be something  more,  namely  "sufficiently  serious"  circumstances  to
    justify a person remaining where the Immigration Rules are not met.

20. It was therefore my decision  that  the  respondent's  decision  was  a
    proportionate interference with the family and  private  lives  of  the
    appellant and his family. I therefore refused the Article 8 appeal.

Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  on  Article  8  of  the  ECHR
    contains an error on a point of law and is set aside.

22. I remake the Article 8 appeal as refused.
