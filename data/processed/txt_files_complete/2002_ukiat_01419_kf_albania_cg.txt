                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr D Bazini (counsel instructed by Howells) for the appellant
Mr M Pichamuthu for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  G  Dearden),
   sitting at East Retford on 26 October, dismissing  an  asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of Albania, from refusal of leave to enter  on
   12 June 2001: a certificate  by  the  respondent  was  withdrawn  by  the
   presenting officer. Leave was given in general terms.


2. This was another case about blood-feuds in Albania: we drew the  parties'
   attention to our decision in Skenderaj [01/BH/0026], and Mr  Bazini  drew
   the distinction that in this case the appellant claimed to have tried  to
   enlist police protection; but, he said, the  adjudicator  had  not  dealt
   with that. Mr Bazini suggested that a fresh hearing  should  be  directed
   without further ado; but this was a considered decision by an experienced
   adjudicator, and we should regard summary disposal of that kind as  quite
   wrong. We are not  enthusiasts  for  page-counting;  but,  leaving  aside
   preliminary matters (which occupy �� 1-11, and might well have been taken
   more shortly), this adjudicator spent seven  full  pages  discussing  the
   merits of the case, and his decision is entitled  to  more  respect  than
   that.
3. The appellant's case was that in 1990 his father had killed  two  men  of
   the Gegaj family in the course of a land dispute in their  home  area  of
   northern Albania. Soon after this had led to his father's  death  at  the
   hands of Gjevolin Gegaj, who fled to Italy. At that  time  the  appellant
   was on military service:  when  he  finished  his  time  and  came  home,
   Gjevolin Gegaj was still in Italy, and the rest  of  the  clan  were  not
   interested in pursuing the blood-feud; but in 1997 Gjevolin returned  and
   stirred them up to the extent that they gave the appellant  three  months
   to leave town. The appellant went to stay with a friend  in  Sarand�,  in
   the south ("in hiding", according  to  Mr  Bazini;  but  helping  on  the
   friend's market stall, according to the evidence he himself gave  to  the
   adjudicator: see � 21). He  remained there till December 1999,  when  the
   friend decided to leave Albania. The appellant did so too,  crossing  the
   border to Greece, where he stayed till the police sent him back again  at
   the end of January 2000. He did not claim asylum in Greece, as  Albanians
   were unpopular there. On return to Albania he went to the port  of  Vlor�
   (Valona), where in only three days the  money  he  had  earnt  in  Greece
   secured his passage to Italy. However he did not claim asylum there, this
   time for fear of the long arm of the Gegajs, but came on  by  clandestine
   means to this country, where he arrived and claimed asylum on 2 March.

4. The adjudicator did not believe that:

   a) the appellant would have come home from military service, as the  only
      surviving man in his family, at a time when the Gegajs were  one  down
      in the blood-feud; or
   b) Gjevolin would have come back there from Italy in  1997  to  face  the
      police for killing the appellant's father; or
   c) the Gegajs would have been so benevolent as then to let him have three
      months to leave; or
   d) it would be unduly harsh to expect the appellant to return to  Sarand�
      now; or
   e) he would have failed to claim asylum in Italy if genuinely in fear.


5. Mr Bazini's point on a) and b) was that the climate of  public  order  in
   Albania had changed between 1990, when Gjevolin had to flee  the  country
   for killing the appellant's father, and 1997, when he was able to  return
   with impunity. For this he relied on an article in the 'Christian Science
   Monitor' of 7 August 1997:

   Once suppressed and nearly extinguished by the Communists, the Kanun -  a
   code of law that has guided life in much of northern Albania  for  nearly
   half a millennium - is back, with a  vengeance.  Albania's  descent  into
   turmoil has fuelled its revival. Once relegated to the north, blood feuds
   have reportedly erupted in the  capital, Tirana, and in the south.

   Then we were referred to V97/06837,  an  apparently  routinely  anonymous
   decision from 1998 of the  Australian  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  (Mr  BF
   Kissane): this appears to be a  single-member  first  instance  appellate
   body, like an adjudicator here. The decision recites evidence, apparently
   emanating from a Albanian human rights body, about 9,000  men  and  3,000
   boys being kept "in imprisonment" [obviously a  dramatic  way  of  saying
   "indoors at home"] by their families for fear of feuds [which as in  most
   such societies are not pursued by or against women].  There  is  said  to
   have been a sharp deterioration in Albania's  human  rights  record  "...
   around the time of the state of emergency from March 2 until July 24 [the
   year is not given, but appears to  be  1997],  reflecting  the  country's
   general breakdown of governmental authority and civil society." We  think
   this ground of challenge is made out: if  counsel  (not  Mr  Bazini)  who
   appeared before the adjudicator had properly drawn his attention to  this
   evidence, we do not think he would have made points a) and b) in the  way
   he did.

6. So far as c) is concerned,  three  months'  notice  to  leave  does  seem
   unusually benevolent in the context of a blood-feud. Mr  Bazini  was  not
   able to refer us to any independent evidence of such a practice; but  the
   appellant did make the point at Q37/A8 of his interview that in his  case
   it had been a compromise brokered by the elders.  That  possibility  does
   not seem to have been considered by the adjudicator: in our view  it  may
   be a reasonable one. The importance of  this  point  may  relate  to  the
   possibility or otherwise of internal flight, rather than the  credibility
   of the appellant's account of events in his home town (which curiously he
   never seems to have been asked to name: Mr Bazini told us it  was  Dedaj,
   in Puke district).

7. The other credibility point is e): the appellant's  own  explanation  for
   not claiming there was at Q63/B13-14

   I had many reasons not to claim asylum in Italy but main reason  is  that
   person I was in conflict with [Gjevolin] lived and he had all the  papers
   in Italy so Italy for me was  like  Albania.  Also  he  had  friends  and
   relatives living there so I wasn't safe.


   Again that was not considered by the adjudicator. Mr Bazini  referred  us
   to the evidence in the 'Christian Science Monitor' (same issue)  about  a
   named Albanian claiming to have prevented over 300  murders  since  1991,
   including, significantly, 20 abroad. He pointed  out  the  appellant  was
   likely to find himself living among  fellow-Albanians  if  he  stayed  in
   Italy: although the appellant did pass through Italy on his way here,  it
   may have been a fairly rapid transit.. This is a credibility point, so it
   depends on the appellant's own ("subjective") view of  his  prospects  in
   Italy. On that basis only, we are prepared to assume it may just about be
   a reasonable one, even though the blood-feud  had  been  settled  by  the
   elders on the basis that the appellant left town. [Not making a claim  in
   Greece, where he had successfully worked for a couple  of  months,  might
   have been a better point against the appellant; but it was  not  one  the
   adjudicator made]. It follows that we do not see any  serious  reason  on
   the adjudicator's findings, in the light  of  the  further  evidence  put
   before us, to doubt the appellant's credibility as to  what  happened  in
   his home town.


8. The evidence as to how far local protection against the  consequences  of
   that might have been available is sketchy. The  furthest  Mr  Bazini  was
   able to take it was by referring us  to  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal
   (Rapinet VP and a mixed panel) in Bregu [01/TH/02286]. They  accepted  (�
   14) that the appellant was not likely to get  effective  protection  from
   the police; though they made clear at � 15  that  this  depended  on  the
   particular circumstances of that case. It is not in any case  a  question
   of any great continuing interest whether this appellant  might  have  got
   effective protection from his local police in 1997: we  are  prepared  to
   accept in his favour that he might not,  in  the  particularly  turbulent
   circumstances of that year. He did not claim to have  made  any  specific
   approach to them then, though he said at his interview (Q33/B9) that  the
   problem was common knowledge to everyone, including the  police.  Whether
   the appellant would get effective protection from the police in his  home
   town now is not something on which the adjudicator found it necessary  to
   come to a conclusion: the finding he did make (� 44) on the interest  the
   police were likely to have taken in 1997 is bedevilled by the failure  of
   counsel before him (see � 5, above) to point out, as Mr Bazini did to us,
   the difference in public order conditions between that year and 1990.

9. While it might be possible for us to decide in general terms  whether  or
   not  police  protection  is  now  available  in   Albania   against   the
   consequences of blood-feuds, they are by their nature local; so to uphold
   the adjudicator's decision on the situation in the appellant's home  town
   would  require  investigation  of  his  particular  circumstances  there,
   probably on the basis of any oral evidence he  was  able  to  give  about
   them. That is not an exercize for us; so we  turn  to  the  findings  the
   adjudicator did make on the possibility of internal flight. He  took  the
   view that there was no reason why it should be unduly harsh to expect the
   appellant to return to Sarand�: if his  friend  were  still  there,  that
   would be unquestionably right, given that he stayed with him quite safely
   from 1997-99, and occupied a particularly prominent role  on  the  market
   stall.

10. Mr Bazini's point however is that the appellant's situation  in  Sarand�
   would be entirely different in the absence of his friend.  That  was  not
   something the adjudicator took into account,  though  the  appellant  had
   mentioned the friend's departure at Q44/B10. We asked Mr Bazini to  refer
   us to any evidence that blood-feuds operated on  anything  other  than  a
   local basis. Referring to  the  UNHCR  paper  of  "1999-March  2000",  he
   pointed to the  evidence  (bundle  p  26,  citing  the  'New  York  Times
   Magazine') of the kanun blood-feud code having spread from the north over
   the whole of Albania since 1997: an unnamed Albanian  law  professor  was
   quoted as saying that "escaping from blood feuds by moving to other parts
   of the country does not necessarily guarantee security". There is further
   evidence  ('Christian  Science  Monitor',  same  issue)  of   blood-feuds
   reportedly erupting in the south.

11. All that evidence, apart from the professor's reported  comments,  deals
   with blood-feuds originating in the south. The particular feature of  the
   present case is that the appellant was given three months  to  leave  his
   home area in the north, by a  settlement  agreed  or  imposed  under  the
   auspices of the elders. While the appellant would not have  his  friend's
   home to go to in Sarand� as he did before, he is a single man of 30, and,
   in view of the two years he spent working on a market  stall  there  (not
   something at the forefront of Mr Bazini's submissions), is unlikely to be
   wholly without local contacts. It is  quite  clear  that,  following  the
   elders' settlement (the traditional nature of the kanun is emphasized  in
   all the  evidence  put  before  us  by  Mr  Bazini)  there  was  no  real
   ("objective") risk for the appellant if he complied  with  its  terms  by
   leaving his home town. Nobody pursued him over the blood-feud in  Sarand�
   between 1997 and the end of 1999; and we see no reason why anyone  should
   do so now: there is certainly no other reason why  it  should  be  unduly
   harsh to expect a single man of his age and good health  to  seek  refuge
   there amongst his fellowcountrymen, rather than here.
