                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of comprehension, the parties are referred to by their  status
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid allowing the Appellant's appeal against
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  dated  13th  November  2014
    notifying the Appellant of the refusal of his application for leave  to
    enter as the spouse of a settled  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  That decision was appealed under Section 82 of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision  on  2nd  November
    2015.

 4.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen.  The grounds
    upon which permission to  appeal  was  granted  may  be  summarised  as
    follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred  in  law  in  failing  to  give
         adequate reasons for his decision.

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in law in failing to apply  any
         of the relevant Immigration Rules.

    iii) It is arguable that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  mistaking  the
         findings of the previous appeal.



Error of Law

 5. I indicated at the close of submissions my view that there was an error
    of law in the First-tier Tribunal's determination.  My reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.

 6. In respect of Ground 1 it is plain to me that the judge  did  not  give
    adequate reasons for his  determination.   The  determination  reflects
    that the judge is bound to consider the Immigration Rules  under  which
    the application was made.  However, at  paragraphs  9  through  to  17,
    there does not appear one reference  let  alone  consideration  to  the
    relevant Immigration Rules  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    Consequently Ground 2 is also made out because there is  a  failure  to
    apply the relevant Immigration Rule in the judge's  determination.   In
    respect of Ground 3 however I indicated that there was no error of law.
     I was assisted by  Mr  Waheed  for  the  Appellant  who  produced  the
    determination  which  Judge  Majid  is  accused  of  misstating.   That
    determination was also before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  it  is  a
    determination of Judge Dennis promulgated on 24th February  2014  which
    indeed mentions at paragraph 5 (seen at  page  57  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal  which  I  have  referred  to  in
    reaching my decision) that the judge found the Sponsor to be frank  and
    enthused about her marriage and that she met the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  However the Sponsor accepted that at  the  date  of
    the previous decision made by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  29th
    November 2012 the Sponsor was only earning �12,285  per  annum.   Given
    that this material appeared in the First-tier  Tribunal's  bundle,  the
    drafter of the grounds of appeal might  not  have  been  aware  of  it,
    however  it  would  be  wise  to  double-check  before  levelling  such
    accusations at any judge of the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In light of the above assessment, I found that there was  an  error  of
    law in the determination such that  the  determination  should  be  set
    aside.

 8. Given my findings that there was a material error of law, I was invited
    by both parties to go on and remake the appeal myself given  that  only
    one Immigration Rule was in issue and given that no  further  evidence,
    oral or documentary, would be required from the Sponsor, the  Appellant
    or the Respondent.  I accepted that invitation and so I move now to  my
    consideration in remaking the decision.



Remaking the Decision

 9.  In  remaking  the  decision,  I  must   consider   the   circumstances
    appertaining at the date of the  refusal  decision.   The  standard  of
    proof is to the civil standard and that of a  balance  of  probability.
    It is for a party that makes any assertion to discharge the  burden  of
    proof in establishing their  assertion.   I  have  considered  all  the
    evidence in the appeal,  including  the  Appellant's  and  Respondent's
    bundles.  I heard helpful submissions from both parties which  are  set
    out in full in my Record of Proceedings.

10. Both Mr Mills and Mr Waheed agreed that, following the Entry  Clearance
    Manager's review dated 12th March 2015, the sole  remaining  issue  was
    whether the Appellant had satisfied Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2(c) which
    provides that the following must be provided:

         "Personal bank statements, corresponding to the same  period(s)  as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly."

11.  The  references  to  paragraph  2(a)  are  made  in  relation  to  the
    requirement that an applicant submit payslips covering a period of  six
    months prior to the date of application if the person has been employed
    by their current employer for  at  least  six  months.   There  was  no
    dispute between the parties  that  the  Appellant  met  paragraph  2(a)
    concerning the payslips. The sole remaining dispute, if it  could  even
    be called that given the pragmatism of  both  representatives,  was  in
    relation to paragraph 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE.

12. In relation to paragraph 2(c) Mr Mills submitted that the  only  reason
    remaining why the  decision  was  maintained  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager (ECM) was that the Sponsor's bank statement  showed  a  deposit
    from her employer on 30th December 2013 in the sum of �2,011.   However
    that deposit did not correspond with the monthly payslips for that same
    period of �350.40 per month.  Mr Waheed drew to my attention  that  the
    ECM had conceded that  the  criticism  made  originally  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's refusal, namely that  the  second  employer,  Fresh
    Fish, Meat & Poultry Limited had  not  evidenced  any  payment  in  the
    Sponsor's  bank  statement,  was  incorrect  given  the  abovementioned
    deposit.

13. After looking at the consideration by the ECM  against  paragraph  2(c)
    and then against the Appellant's evidence (see pages 83 to  84  of  the
    Appellant's bundle where the payslips appear and pages 102  to  103  of
    the bundle where the July to December 2013 bank statements appear);  Mr
    Mills submitted that the reason for maintaining refusal was one that he
    relied on solely for the sake of formality and did not intend to  press
    before me.

14. Considering the abovementioned evidence that was drawn to my  attention
    by both parties in the Appellant's bundle and looking at paragraph 2(c)
    against the deposit of �2,011, I find that the personal bank statements
    which correspond to the same period of payslips do show that the salary
    was paid into an account in the name of  the  Sponsor  as  required  by
    paragraph 2(c).

15. I note for  the  sake  of  completeness  and  find  that  there  is  no
    requirement  in  the  Immigration  Rules  that   the   bank   statement
    demonstrates individual deposits that corresponded  with  each  payslip
    but solely that the bank  statements  should  correspond  to  the  same
    period of time as that which the payslips reflected and show  that  the
    salary has been paid into an account.  In short, it does not matter how
    the salary has been paid into the account as  long  as  the  salary  is
    there.

16. As further submitted by Mr Mills, and as I accept, there is  no  reason
    to doubt the explanation given by the Sponsor in her witness  statement
    concerning the payment and her flexible salary receipt arrangement with
    her second employer (Fresh Fish, Meat & Poultry Limited).  Consequently
    I find that the sole remaining basis  of  refusal  under  Appendix  FM-
    SE(2)(c) is met and the Appellant's appeal therefore succeeds.

17. For the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision and  remake  the
    decision allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.




Decision

18. I allow the Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance.



Anonymity

No anonymity direction is made.




Fee Award

The First-tier Tribunal made a fee award for the whole fee in favour of  the
Appellant.  I am minded to make the same award myself given that  the  ECM's
reason for maintaining refusal given that  the  salary  was  paid  into  the
account and the refusal therefore did  not  truly  reflect  the  requirement
under Appendix FM-SE (2)(c).
