Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Slatter, Counsel instructed by JKR Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Microsoft Teams (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be
determined in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and
neither party expressed any concern, with the process.


                            DECISION AND REASONS



Background

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 8 May 1980, who has
      been in the UK since 2009.

   2. In 2014, whilst in the UK with leave as a Tier 4 student, the
      appellant was served with a removal notice. He was informed that
      Educational Testing Service (ETS) had identified an anomaly with his
      speaking test taken on 21 August 2012 at Queensway College; that the
      scores from the test were cancelled; that the respondent had concluded
      that the certificate from ETS was obtained fraudulently; and that he
      was liable to removal under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum
      Act 1999.

   3. Following protracted judicial review proceedings, and further
      submissions made by the appellant, the respondent made a decision on
      19 February 2020 ("the respondent's decision") refusing the
      appellant's human rights claim which generated a right of appeal to
      the First-tier Tribunal.

   4. The respondent's decision considered whether the appellant was
      entitled to a grant of leave under paragraph 276ADE(1). The respondent
      stated that the application fell for refusal on grounds of suitability
      under paragraph 276ADE(1)(i) because section S-LTR.1.6 (and also S-
      LTR2.2(a)) was applicable. No reason was given for applying S-
      LTR2.2(a). The reason it was said that S-LTR.1.6 applied was that the
      respondent was satisfied that the appellant had fraudulently obtained
      a certificate in respect of an ETS test taken on 21 August 2012 by use
      of a proxy test taker. The respondent's decision states that because
      of this the appellant's scores for tests taken on 21 August 2012 and
      23 August 2012 had been cancelled. The respondent stated that she was
      satisfied that deception was used when, in an application on 27 August
      2013 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 student, the certificates for
      these tests were submitted to the respondent.

   5. The respondent also stated that the requirements of sub-paragraphs
      (iii) to (vi) of paragraph 276ADE(1) were not met and there were not
      exceptional circumstances that would render refusal of leave a breach
      of article 8 ECHR.

   6. The appellant appealed against this decision to the First-tier
      Tribunal where his appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
      Beg ("the judge"). In a decision promulgated on 3 February 2021 the
      judge dismissed the appeal. The appellant is now appealing against
      this decision.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

   7. The judge directed herself, at paragraph 22 of the decision, that,
      with respect to the burden of proof, there is a three stage process:
      first, the burden is on the respondent to adduce evidence to raise the
      issue of fraud; second, it then falls to the appellant to raise an
      innocent explanation which satisfies the minimum level of
      plausibility; and third, if that burden is discharged, it falls to the
      respondent to establish on the balance of probabilities that the
      explanation is to be rejected.

   8. The judge found that the respondent had discharged the initial
      evidential burden. She then turned to consider the appellant's
      "innocent explanation". The judge found the appellant to not be a
      credible witness. The following reasons were given for finding him to
      not be credible:

     a. The appellant stated that he did not make enquiries as to whether
        there were locations closer to his home to take the test and chose
        Queensway College because it was recommended by a friend whose
        younger brother took a test there. In paragraph 25, the judge found
        damaging to the appellant's credibility that (a) he did not make
        enquiries about other potential colleges, in particular to see if
        there was one closer to where he lived; and (b) he did not speak to
        his friends brother who took the test at Queensway to see if his
        test had also been cancelled.

     b. In paragraph 26 of the decision, the judge found it damaging to the
        appellant's credibility that he waited a week after discovering his
        test had been cancelled to visit Queensway College to ascertain
        what had happened (his telephone call, made after two or three
        days, not having been answered).

     c. In paragraph 27 the judge found damaging to the appellant's
        credibility (a) that he did not express shock or alarm at having
        been accused of deception; and (b) that he did not contact ETS to
        question why his test result was cancelled. The judge stated that
        it was reasonable to expect him to do this even if, as the
        appellant claimed, he was depressed and his grandfather in
        Bangladesh was in hospital.

     d. In paragraph 28 the judge found damaging to the appellant's
        credibility that he did not contact solicitors until six - eight
        weeks after being notified that his test had been cancelled.

     e. The judge also found, in paragraph 28, that the appellant's
        evidence about preparing for the English-language test was vague as
        he did not refer to any specific material that he used or to the
        length of time he prepared and studied for the test. The judge also
        found that his evidence about the classroom where the test took
        place was vague.

   9. The judge concluded at paragraph 29, having given the reasons
      summarised above, that the appellant's explanation was "implausible."

  10. In paragraphs 30-32 the judge summarised recent reports about ETS
      allegations of cheating by the National Audit Office, the All-Party
      Parliamentary Group (APPG) and the House of Commons Committee of
      Public Accounts.

  11. In paragraphs 32-35 the judge considered a report (Project Fa�ade-
      criminal enquiry into abuse of the TOEIC) about fraud at Queensway
      College. Amongst other things, this report stated that 70% of tests
      taken between 20 March 2012 and 5 February 2014 at Queensway College
      were found to be invalid. Based on this report, the judge found that
      there was cogent evidence of fraud being perpetrated at Queensway
      College.

  12. The judge concluded that the appellant committed fraud in respect of
      the test taken on 21 August 2012. The judge stated that no test result
      was submitted by the respondent in respect of the test taken on 23
      August 2012 and therefore he did not make a finding of deception in
      respect of that test. In paragraph 39 the judge stated that the
      appellant did not meet the suitability requirements under the
      immigration rules in respect of paragraphs 276B and 276ADE.

  13. The judge then considered article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration
      Rules. The judge found that the appellant would not face obstacles
      integrating in Bangladesh and that his partner (and her son), who are
      of Bangladeshi heritage, could accompany him if they wished to do so.

The grounds of appeal

  14. Ground 1: Not adjourning the appeal. The grounds submit that both
      parties sought an adjournment pending the Upper Tribunal's decisions
      in RK and DK but this was refused without explanation at the hearing
      (and the application was not even mentioned in the decision). The
      grounds argue that this was erroneous because (a) RK and DK would give
      guidance on the weight to give to the APPG and other reports; (b) it
      was unfair to not adjourn pending RK and DK and (c) the judge was
      required to give reasons for not acceding to the (joint) application.

  15. Ground 2: Applying the wrong suitability test. Relying on the recent
      decision of the Upper Tribunal in Mahmood (paras. S-LTR.1.6. & S-
      LTR.4.2.; Scope) [2020] UKUT 00376 (IAC), the grounds submit that the
      judge failed to address the appellant's argument that the respondent
      should not have relied upon S-LTR1.6 when finding that the suitability
      requirements were not met.

  16. Ground 3: Flawed credibility assessment. The grounds take issue with
      various aspects of the credibility assessment. It is argued that (a)
      the judge did not adequately (or at all) consider the appellant's
      detailed witness statement which gave a comprehensive account that
      showed why he did not engage in fraud; (b) the judge imposed his own
      view of credibility without having regard to differences in culture;
      (c) the judge failed to have regard to the consistency of the
      appellant's evidence; (d) the judge drew an adverse inference from the
      appellant waiting a week to visit the college after finding out he had
      been accused of cheating without the concern being put to the
      appellant; (e) the judge did not take into account the appellant's
      evidence that he did not know how to challenge ETS; and (f) the judge
      did not explain why he found the appellant's evidence to be vague or
      why more detail about how he studied for a test (which he found very
      easy) would be expected when over eight years had elapsed since the
      test.

Analysis

  17. I reserved my decision after hearing submissions from Mr Clarke and Mr
      Slatter on the three grounds summarised above. Having carefully
      considered these submissions alongside the evidence that was before
      the First-tier Tribunal, I have reached the conclusion, for the
      reasons set out below, that the judge materially erred by failing to
      adequately explain the basis upon which she concluded that the
      appellant had given an implausible account of taking the English
      language test on 21 August 2012. As I have allowed the appeal on this
      basis, I do not need to consider grounds 1 and 2.

  18. With respect to ground 3, Mr Slatter reiterated the points made in the
      grounds.

  19. Mr Clarke argued that the judge's assessment of the appellant's
      plausibility must be considered in the context of the judge having
      directed herself accurately to the legal issues to be determined
      (including the three stage shifting burden of proof) and of having
      considered all of the material evidence. He submitted that the judge
      correctly recognised that the respondent had discharged the initial
      evidential burden and that it fell to the appellant to give an
      innocent explanation. He argued that the judge considered the evidence
      in the round and was entitled to place weight on the vagueness of the
      evidence given by the appellant. He also made the point that the judge
      was plainly entitled to place significant weight on the respondent's
      Project Fa�ade report on Queensway College which identified that 70%
      of tests taken between 20 March 2012 and 5 February 2014 were found to
      be invalid. Mr Clarke maintained that the evidence strongly pointed to
      the appellant having engaged in fraud, as found by the judge. Mr
      Clarke also emphasised that I should be slow to overturn findings of
      fact and allow perversity/irrationality challenges to a decision.

  20. There are, as noted by Mr Clarke, numerous Court of Appeal case
      reminding judges to exercise restraint when examining reasons given by
      First-tier Tribunal judges. It is also well established - and in
      considering this case I have kept at the forefront of my mind - that
      caution must be exercised before interfering with findings of fact as
      well as inferences drawn from facts. See Lowe v The Secretary of State
      for the Home Department [2021] EWCA Civ 62. I have also kept in mind
      that "perversity" represents a very high hurdle. For a finding of fact
      to be perverse it must be a finding that, on any legitimate view, was
      not open to the judge. In other words, it must be wholly unsupported
      by the evidence.

  21. It is also the case that even if some reasons given by a judge for
      finding an appellant not credible do not withstand scrutiny the
      overall conclusion should stand if there are adequate reasons to
      support it. As stated in HK v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1037:

           "Where a fact-finding tribunal has decided  to  reject  evidence
           for a number of reasons,  the  mere  fact  that  some  of  those
           reasons do not bear  analysis  is  not,  of  itself,  enough  to
           justify an appellate court setting the decision aside. In such a
           case, the appellate court has to decide whether it would be just
           to  let  the  tribunal's  decision  stand.  That  question  will
           normally be answered by considering whether one can be tolerably
           confident that the tribunal's decision would have been the  same
           on the basis of the reasons which have survived its scrutiny."

  22. The judge gave several reasons for not believing the appellant. I
      consider each in turn, recognising the restraint/caution that I must
      exercise but also noting that this does not mean the judge's reasoning
      can escape any scrutiny.

     a. Reason 1 (paragraph 25): The appellant relied on a friend's
        recommendation to take the test at Queensway College (where his
        friend's younger brother had taken a test) without making his own
        enquiries about other potential colleges, particularly those
        located close to him. Queensway College is located close to where
        the appellant lived and was easily accessible by public transport
        (as set out in paragraph 25 of the appellant's witness statement).
        There was no reason for the appellant to search for a test centre
        closer to his home. I therefore do not accept that it was open to
        the judge to find it damaging to the appellant's credibility that
        he did not search for a test centre closer to his home.

     b. Reason 2 (paragraph 25). The appellant did not contact his friend's
        younger brother to ask him whether his test results has also been
        cancelled. It is not obvious why this is damaging to the
        appellant's credibility but I do not consider it to reach the
        threshold of irrationality. The appellant's evidence was that he
        was extremely upset by the allegation of fraud and it might be
        expected that he would reach out to a person he knew took a test at
        the same centre to see if they had had a comparable experience. The
        judge was therefore entitled to consider this as a factor
        undermining the appellant's account.

     c. Reason 3. The appellant waited a week before attending Queensway
        College to investigate why he had been accused of fraud (paragraph
        26). I do not accept that there is a rational basis to treat this
        as damaging to the appellant's credibility. The appellant's
        evidence on this point, which it appears the judge accepted, is
        that a few days after receiving the removal notice in 2014 he tried
        to contact the test centre by phone and a few days thereafter
        (which was about a week after receiving the notice) he went in
        person to the centre where he spoke to someone in security who told
        him that the centre was now closed. This is not a significant
        delay: within a week of receiving the notice the appellant
        telephoned the centre and visited the site. It was not, in my view,
        rational to find that he delayed visiting the centre at all, and
        certainly not that he delayed doing so to an extent that it was
        damaging to his credibility.

     d. Reason 4. The appellant never expressed in his evidence shock or
        alarm at being accused of deception (paragraph 27). I do not accept
        that this conclusion was open to the judge because in his witness
        statement the appellant stated (in paragraph 41 of the statement)
        that he was "shocked, disappointed and offended" by the accusation
        that he cheated.

     e. Reason 5. The appellant gave no credible explanation as to why he
        did not contact ETS, and why he did not contact solicitors until 6-
        8 weeks, after he received the notice (paragraphs 27 and 28). The
        judge was, in my view, entitled to take this into account. The
        appellant claimed that he was depressed but there was no medical
        evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to support the contention
        that he was suffering from a depression that would impact his
        ability to take steps to uncover why he had been accused of
        cheating. Given the appellant's evidence as to how devastating the
        accusation was, it was open to the judge to find the appellant's
        account was undermined by his inaction.

     f. Reason 6. The appellant's oral evidence was vague about how he
        prepared for the test and the classroom where the test took place.
        The judge noted in the decision that the appellant stated that he
        used "a couple of books" and looked online to prepare for the test
        and that the test took place in a medium sized room where he sat 3
        metres from the next person. Whilst it is not clear to me how these
        answers are vague, it is not for me to replace my impression with
        that of the judge, who had the benefit of hearing oral evidence. I
        am not persuaded that the judge's findings about the vagueness of
        the appellant's evidence should be disturbed.

  23. Although several of the judge's reasons for finding the appellant's
      account implausible survive scrutiny and are sustainable - including
      that the appellant's oral evidence was in parts vague (a point
      highlighted by Mr Clarke) -  several other reasons, which appear to
      have been given significant weight by the judge, are not sustainable.
      I am not confident that the judge would have reached the same
      conclusion about the appellant's plausibility if she had only based
      her assessment on the reasons which have survived scrutiny. I
      therefore find that the decision cannot stand due to the
      unsustainability of the rationale for finding the appellant's account
      implausible.

  24. As the appeal will need to be considered afresh with no findings
      preserved, having regard to paragraph 7.2(b) of the Practice
      Statements of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier
      Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, I have decided that the appeal should be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of
law.

The decision is set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be
made afresh by a different judge.
