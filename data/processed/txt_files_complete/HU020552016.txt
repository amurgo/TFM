                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Jones made following a hearing at Bradford on 7th August 2017.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 28th December  1992.   He
    applied for entry clearance to settle in the UK as  a  spouse  but  was
    refused on 4th December 2015.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the financial requirements of the Rules were met.

 3. The Immigration Judge found in favour of the claimant.

 4. The Secretary of State then sought permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that  the  judge  had  found  that  the  claimant  met  the   financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules but it was clear  from  paragraph
    17 that the sponsor only  had  an  income  of  �6,857  and  savings  of
    �30,133.  Since the claimant was relying upon a mixture of earnings and
    savings he was required to demonstrate �45,357.50 in savings  which  he
    was unable to do.

 5. The determination is not very clear.  However it is quite apparent that
    the evidence before the judge,  and  accepted  by  him,  was  that  the
    sponsor was  in  receipt  of  carer's  allowance.   Accordingly,  under
    paragraph E-ECP.3.3(v) the claimant only had to show that  his  partner
    was able to maintain and accommodate him adequately in the  UK  without
    recourse to public funds, and he did not have  to  meet  the  level  of
    earnings and savings referred to in the grounds.

 6. Mr Tan said that the author of the grounds probably had  not  seen  the
    determination.  He was not challenging the judge's conclusion that  the
    claimant could be adequately maintained and accommodated in the  UK  on
    the basis of his sponsor's income and her savings.

Notice of Decision

The  original  judge  did  not  err  in  law.   His  decision  stands.   The
claimant's appeal against the  refusal  to  grant  him  entry  clearance  is
allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
