For the Appellant:     Miss B Hashmi, Solicitor, M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  born  on  5  April  1982  who
    appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  a  decision  of   the
    respondent, dated 6  February  2018,  to  refuse  his  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain.  In a decision  promulgated  on  10  August
    2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Watson dismissed the appellant's
    appeal on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant first entered the UK on 18 February  2007  with  a  valid
    student visa.  He applied for subsequent visas both as a student and as
    a Tier 1 skilled migrant and obtained further leave to remain until  26
    February 2016.  On that date he applied as a Tier 1 skilled migrant but
    his application was refused on 9 August 2016.  The appellant  requested
    an administrative review of the decision which  was  maintained  on  14
    October 2016.  On 1 November 2016 the appellant applied for  indefinite
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant.  That application was rejected  on
    17 February 2017.  On 22  February  2017  the  appellant  submitted  an
    application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  long
    residency (ten years).  Although the respondent's decision stated  that
    the appellant had only accrued nine years and eight  months  of  lawful
    stay, opening representations on behalf of the  respondent  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal conceded that the decision letter had  applied  the
    new Immigration Rule paragraph 39E whereas the Rule  in  force  at  the
    relevant date allowed a 28 day grace period.  Therefore the part of the
    refusal based on failure to submit within fourteen days was an error.

 3. It was agreed by the parties before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant submitted an application for indefinite leave to remain as  a
    Tier 1 Migrant within the 28 day period and  his  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom therefore remained lawful up until 17 February  2017  at  which
    point the appellant had accrued nine years and 364 days'  lawful  stay.
    The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found for the  appellant  on  this
    basis and found that on the balance of probabilities the appellant  had
    sent emails to the respondent  as  he  had  claimed  and  that  it  was
    disproportionate of the respondent to rely on the  reason  for  refusal
    and the fact that the appellant had only nine years  and  364  days  as
    opposed to ten years. The judge found that he most  likely  would  have
    had the requisite time if the correct responses and appointment for the
    biometric data appointment had been sent to him.

 4. However, the appellant's application was also refused on the basis that
    the appellant did not meet the suitability criteria contained  in  Rule
    276B(ii)(c) with respect to his "personal history, including character,
    conduct, associations and employment record".  The  respondent  further
    refused the appellant's  application  under  the  general  grounds  for
    refusal,  paragraph  322(5).  This  was  based  on   the   respondent's
    conclusion that the appellant had gained a clear advantage  by  falsely
    declaring his income to the Home Office for the period 2012/2013  which
    enabled him to obtain his visa and/or falsely declaring his  income  to
    HMRC which enabled him to evade tax.  The First-tier Tribunal concluded
    in relation to the tax history that the appellant had  not  shown  that
    his submission of the 2012/2013 tax return was an  innocent  error  and
    found that the appellant had acted dishonestly.  The Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal went on to consider  the  situation  of  the  appellant's
    family but found that the decision to refuse  leave  was  proportionate
    notwithstanding that the appellant had a qualifying child in  terms  as
    set in of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

Grounds of Appeal

 5. The appellant appeals with permission on the grounds that:-

      1) The judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the  fact  that
         the appellant's eldest child is a qualifying child for the purposes
         of Section 117B;

      2) in failing to make a proper assessment of the best interests of the
         appellant's three children;

      3) in failing to consider  material  matters;/making  a  contradictory
         finding;

      4) in failing to provide the correct standard of burden  of  proof  in
         relation to paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

Error of Law Hearing

 6. Miss Hashmi on the day submitted her skeleton argument.  She submitted,
    relying on paragraph (g) of the grounds for permission, that the  judge
    had misdirected herself in relation to  the  allegation  of  dishonesty
    against the appellant.  Miss Hashmi relied on paragraphs 24 and  25  of
    the appellant's witness statement before the First-tier Tribunal  where
    the appellant stated that he believed that he had  made  a  mistake  as
    follows:-

         "24. I can confirm that the correct my earnings (sic) for  the  tax
             year ending April 2013 were �9,850 from my self-employment and
             my earnings from PAYE employment were �25,547.00.   I  believe
             the figure of �27,425.00 for PAYE employment  earnings  was  a
             mistake.  I am not sure why the HMRC have stated that I earned
             �21,123.00 from  PAYE  as  my  P60  end  of  year  certificate
             confirms that I earned �25,574.00 from PAYE employment.

              ...

         25.  In respect of the initial income from self-employment of  zero
             pounds  this  was  an  innocent  error.    I   instructed   an
             accountant,   namely   Heartlands   Accountants   -   Business
             Consultants/tax advisers to prepare my accounts for  the  year
             ending April 2013.   I  paid  the  accountant  to  prepare  my
             accounts and then I decided to do  my  own  tax  return  as  I
             thought it was simple and easy.  I tried to do  this  on  line
             but I was struggling to understand the right  figures  because
             of a lack of accounting knowledge, so I asked my accountant to
             complete it for me as a favour.  My accountant  agreed  to  do
             this favour for me.  I presumed  that  he  has  filed  my  tax
             return in accordance with the repaired accounts.   I  did  not
             follow up  on  this  as  he  was  previously  reliable  as  my
             accountant and I took his word for it."

 7. Miss Hashmi submitted that the appellant was trying  to  say  that  the
    accountant had prepared his accounts, which he had paid for him to  do,
    but not his tax return and that the judge had erred at [23] in  finding
    it completely implausible  that  a  professional  accountant  whom  the
    appellant had paid to prepare the accounts  would  make  such  a  basic
    error as putting in a figure of nil for self-employment tax return when
    he had compiled the  self-employment  accounts  himself.   Miss  Hashmi
    submitted that the appellant never claimed  that  the  accountant  made
    this error whereas he said he did his own tax return.  In addition, the
    appellant had volunteered the amendment to the respondent.  Miss Hashmi
    submitted at length that the respondent had not discharged  the  burden
    and has not produced any documentary evidence, for example tax  returns
    and therefore had not discharged the burden to show  dishonesty.   Miss
    Hashmi further submitted that paragraph 322(5) of the  general  grounds
    for refusal contains a discretion and that  the  judge's  consideration
    did not fall within  the  policy  guidance.   She  submitted  that  the
    appellant was not  deceitful.   Miss  Hashmi  relied  on  the  case  of
    Muhandiramge (Section S-LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT 675 (IAC) in  relation  to
    the legal and evidential burden applying in a dishonesty  case.   Where
    dishonesty is alleged the evidential burden  is  on  the  Secretary  of
    State to provide sufficient evidence and if this burden  is  discharged
    the burden then  reverts  to  the  appellant  to  provide  an  innocent
    explanation; if this is provided the burden reverts to the Secretary of
    State to establish why the innocent explanation is to be rejected.

 8. Miss Hashmi submitted that there were no cogent reasons provided by the
    respondent to  say  why  the  appellant  had  been  deceitful  and  the
    respondent had failed to discharge the burden.  Miss Hashmi  reiterated
    that the judge had midisrected herself at paragraph  23.   Miss  Hashmi
    referred me to page 18 of  the  appellant's  bundle,  the  respondent's
    refusal letter and relied also on page 67  of  the  appellant's  bundle
    which shows the appellant's P60 which shows an income of  �25,547.10  .
    The respondent had erred in this figure and the judge erred in  finding
    that it was not an innocent mistake.

 9. Although Miss Hashmi reiterated that the appellant had done his own tax
    return and referred me to  paragraph  25  of  the  appellant's  witness
    statement, as I indicated, (and as  quoted  above)  paragraph  25  also
    concludes that the appellant then asked his accountant to complete  his
    tax return for him as a favour (and the judge  records  this  at  [22])
    which contradicted Miss Hashmi's repeated assertions that the appellant
    did his own tax return.  Miss Hashmi submitted again that the appellant
    also made a mistake in that he earned �25,547.10 -  shown  by  his  P60
    (which the judge  records  at  [21])  but  he  put  in  the  figure  of
    �21,000.00.

10. In respect of the best interests argument, relying on paragraph  ground
    3(b) of the permission grounds, although the judge made mention of  the
    children, Miss Hashmi submitted she erred and  did  not  consider  them
    properly and that the case law including MA (Pakistan) and  Others  (on
    the application of  Upper  Tribunal)  Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705  demanded a  different  approach  and  Miss  Hashmi
    relied on paragraph 46 of MA (Pakistan)  submitting that there were  no
    strong reasons for refusing leave and this was not  considered  by  the
    judge.   Although  the  judge  considered  education   this   was   not
    sufficient.  She submitted there were  no  reasons  given  why  it  was
    reasonable for the family to return apart from  education  and  it  was
    submitted that she had failed to consider best interests.  She  further
    submitted there is nothing to show that the judge  had  considered  how
    the family would relocate in Pakistan although she did not pursue  this
    ground as it was not in the  grounds  for  permission  to  appeal.   In
    respect of paragraph (d) of the  grounds  for  permission  Miss  Hashmi
    submitted that  there  were  no  cogent  reasons  for  not  considering
    paragraph 117B which she submitted that the judge had not done  despite
    the fact that the judge mentioned Section 117B at [24].

11. Mr Whitwell submitted that the judge's findings at [23] were clear  and
    adequate findings that the appellant had been dishonest.   It  was  his
    submission that at page 8 of the appellant's bundle,  paragraph  25  of
    the appellant's witness statement, supported the Secretary  of  State's
    case as it clearly states that the appellant asked  his  accountant  to
    complete his tax return for him.  Therefore, there was no error in  the
    judge's findings which were adequate that the judge found it completely
    implausible the professional accountant would make such a basic error.

12. Mr Whitwell submitted that the judge set out the background of the case
    including the Tier 1 applications which is recited at page  18  of  the
    Reasons for Refusal letter.  The judge then comes back to this issue at
    [23] including where the judge made a number of clear, and Mr  Whitwell
    submitted, adequate findings including  that  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant was very alive to immigration issues.  The judge weighed  the
    evidence before him and reached adequate findings and in Mr  Whitwell's
    submission the appellant was trying to  reargue  what  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It was his further submission that the judge  had
    adequately addressed the burden and standard of proof  in  relation  to
    dishonesty in [23].

13.  Mr  Whitwell  submitted  this  case  comes  down  to  a  question   of
    reasonableness.  At [24] the judge  properly  notes  that  there  is  a
    qualifying  child  and  that  this  is  the  "strongest  argument"  the
    appellant has.  He submitted that the determination had to be read as a
    whole.  At [28] having looked at all the factors the judge  found  that
    whilst considering the best interests of the eldest child,  it  was  in
    the public interest to refuse the appeal.  It was his  submission  that
    the best interest findings were set out at paragraph [25].

14. Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  KO  [2018]  UKSC  53  confirms  that  an
    assessment of the child's best interests must be done in the real world
    and he submitted that the judge did exactly this and concluded that  it
    was not unreasonable for the children to  leave.   At  [25]  the  judge
    noted that the eldest child A was not  old  enough  to  have  a  strong
    private life of her own.  The second factor was that the child and  all
    the family are citizens of Pakistan and factor  three  was  that  there
    were no vulnerability issues and  she  had  no  learning  difficulties.
    Factor four was the judge's findings that the appellant will be exposed
    to the main language of Pakistan at home and can be expected  to  learn
    it without undue harsh and delay.  Factor five was that the  qualifying
    child will have access to education in Pakistan and the judge took into
    account that she no longer had difficulties and has an excellent school
    report.

15. The factors in Section 117B were  taken  into  consideration  at  [27].
    This contradicted the submission of Miss Hashmi that the judge had  not
    considered Section 117B when  the  judge  considered  the  factors  and
    weighed them in favour of the  appellant  but  noted  that  there  were
    neutral factors including that the appellant owns a property, is  self-
    sufficient and can  speak  English.   In  respect  of  KO  Mr  Whitwell
    submitted that decision-makers would have  to  take  into  account  the
    relevant IDIs and that it is usually reasonable to leave  when  parents
    were leaving.  The appellant's dishonesty had not  been  factored  into
    the best interests' assessment.  Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  it  was
    clear that the judge's findings were that it was in the best  interests
    of the children to live with their parents in Pakistan and he  did  not
    need specifically to include this sentence as it was implicit from  the
    findings.  In respect of Miss Hashmi's submission  that  there  was  no
    specific findings about life in Pakistan, Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that
    was not necessary to make findings in such detail and it was ultimately
    whether it was reasonable for the family  to  return  and  it  was  the
    judge's conclusions that it was.  He submitted that there  was  nothing
    further needed in  this  case.   Mr  Whitwell  noted  that  in  KO  the
    appellants NS who were Cambridge College of Learning appellants,  where
    one of the children had been in the UK for more  than  ten  years,  had
    their appeal ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court.

16. Miss Hashmi in reply submitted that this was not a similar case to  the
    Cambridge College of Learning case.   She  again  reiterated  that  the
    respondent had not discharged the burden of proof in  relation  to  the
    allegation of dishonesty and made a  presumption  on  the  respondent's
    side in relation to the amended tax returns where the  HMRC  had  given
    the appellant the opportunity to amend the tax return  the  matter  was
    finished and the HMRC did not proceed with the issue.  This was a  case
    where the appellant had discharged the burden of providing an  innocent
    explanation including volunteering the information to the respondent.

Error of Law Discussion and Conclusions

17. For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that any error of  law
    is disclosed in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Grounds 3 and 4

18. The thrust of Miss Hashmi's first  argument  was  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal misdirected itself in relation to the burden of proof and  the
    general grounds of refusal in paragraph 322(5).  I note  that  although
    permission was not specifically granted on this ground neither  was  it
    excluded.  I therefore have considered it arguable  however  I  am  not
    satisfied it was made out.

19. It is not fatal that the judge made no specific reference to  paragraph
    322(5) whereas  the  judge  had  considered  paragraph  276B(ii)(c)  in
    relation to character and conduct.  The judge noted at  [6]  that  this
    was  similar  to  the  general  grounds  of  refusal.   This  was   not
    specifically pursued at the error of law hearing and is not made out.

20. I accept it was set out in the skeleton argument which was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and which the judge obviously had in mind that  the
    burden is on the respondent if there is an allegation of fraud to prove
    it on the balance of probabilities,  as  recently  highlighted  by  the
    Upper Tribunal (see R(on the application of Khan) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322(5)
    [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC)).

21. The judge noted at [15]  the  appellant's  tax  returns  and  that  the
    appellant had to correct his tax return for the year to 5 April 2013 as
    the figures were incorrect and that this was discovered when doing  the
    2014/15 accounts in 2016 and that this error was due  to  the  previous
    accountant and discovered by Dinson & Co (and I note that there was  no
    specific challenge in the grounds for permission or by Miss  Hashmi  to
    the judge's findings that the error was due to the  previous accountant
    and not to the appellant as Miss Hashmi was attempting to suggest).

22. At [16] the  judge  set  out  the  details  of  the  letter  from  HMRC
    responding to requests for information and the  judge  noted  that  the
    appellant's income for the years 2013/2014,  2014/2015,  2015/2016  and
    2016/2017 was considerably less than that which had  been  claimed  for
    the tax year 2012/2013 which was the year when an income from  employed
    work of �27,000 was claimed together with self-employed income and this
    led to the award of a Tier 1 visa valid from 26 February 2013.   Again,
    no error has been argued or is disclosed in respect of those  findings.



23. At [17] the judge notes a letter from  Akhter's  Accountants  and  that
    they had not prepared the previous erroneous accounts.  The judge noted
    that the name of the accountant writing the letter was not Dinson &  Co
    as claimed in the form requesting further information which  the  judge
    notes at [15].  The judge goes on to note the accounts for the year  31
    December 2012 and at [19] notes the letter dated 25 May  2016  to  HMRC
    stating that the appellant had submitted an amended tax return.  It was
    the judge's findings, at [19] that this shows that  the  appellant  was
    fully cognisant of HMRC matters and was again referring  to  a  mistake
    which he claimed his present  accountant  pointed  out  to  him.   This
    clearly was relevant to the judge's  ultimate  finding  of  dishonesty.
    The judge went on to set  out  the  appellant's  tax  paid  and  income
    summaries.

24. At [22] the judge considered the appellant's  oral  evidence  which  is
    similar to what was said and was relied on heavily by Miss  Hashmi,  at
    paragraph 25 of the appellant's First-tier Tribunal witness  statement,
    that he had started to fill in his 2012/2013 tax return  and  had  some
    difficulties so asked his accountant to fill it in as  a  favour.   The
    judge records that the accountant did it as a favour without payment as
    the accountant had already compiled the accounts for him.  The accounts
    were made up to 21 December 2012 and are not based on tax year figures.
     This accountant had just filed the one return which was erroneous.

25. Having considered all of these matters, the judge went on to  make  his
    key findings at [23].  Although I accept he did not specifically record
    the shifting burden of proof, it was clear that he had this in mind  in
    setting out, prior to his findings at 23, all the evidence  before  him
    including of the offending tax return.   It  is  evident,  reading  the
    decision as a whole, that this was sufficient to discharge the  initial
    burden and that the judge was not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    provided an innocent explanation.

26. The grounds of appeal and Miss Hashmi's expansion on those grounds  are
    largely an attempt to  re-argue  the  original  appeal  and  amount  to
    nothing more than a disagreement.  The judge gave adequate reasons  for
    not finding the appellant to be credible and I take into  consideration
    that the judge had the  benefit  of  hearing  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant and  reached  findings  that  were  available  to  the  judge
    including that, despite subsequently correcting the  error  with  HMRC,
    the appellant had gained a clear advantage  for  himself  and  that  he
    obtained leave based on higher earnings as  a  Tier  1  Migrant  for  a
    period of three years; that the appellant's  income  in  that  year  in
    which the grant of his visa  was  based  was  claimed  as  considerably
    higher than that recorded at the time by HMRC; and that the figures and
    the online records also differ greatly from that in the  original  HMRC
    recordings.  The judge carried out a meticulous  consideration  of  the
    evidence and reached findings which were open to her including that the
    judge was of the view that the appellant was very alive to  immigration
    issues and had applied for new visas at the last possible moment on all
    occasions.  There is nothing irrational in those  findings.   The  fact
    that the judge did not specifically state that discretion should not be
    exercised in the appellant's favour is not fatal and  was  implicit  in
    the judge's findings that the appellant had acted  dishonestly  and  as
    such was not of the 'character and conduct required'.

27. The respondent's own guidance states that a person  does  not  need  to
    have been convicted of a criminal offence and when deciding whether  to
    refuse under paragraph 322(5) which the respondent did, the  key  thing
    to consider is if there is reliable evidence to  support  the  decision
    that the person's behaviour calls into question their character  and/or
    conduct and/or their association to the extent that it  is  undesirable
    to allow them to enter or remain in the UK.  It  is  evident  that  the
    judge was satisfied that there was  no  error  in  the  respondent  not
    exercising  the  discretion  inherent  in  paragraph  322(5)   in   the
    appellant's favour given the judge's findings that  the  appellant  had
    gained a "clear advantage" for himself and had  acted  dishonestly  and
    was not of the character or conduct required.

28. In addition, the fact that the judge recorded the appellant's leave  as
    expiring in 2016, whereas it had been agreed, at [4], that his stay  in
    the UK remained lawful up until 17 February 2017,  is  not  a  material
    error and Miss Hashmi was right not to  pursue  this  ground.   Nothing
    turns on this and indeed it is on the face of it factually  correct  in
    that the appellant's grant of leave may  have  technically  expired  at
    that date but the judge had accepted that given the further  submission
    the appellant had  effectively  had  been  lawfully  in  the  UK  until
    February 2017.

29. There was no error of law identified in grounds 3 or 4.

Grounds 1 and 2

30. In respect of the  appellant's  children  and  the  judge's  Article  8
    findings, permission was granted largely  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    arguable that there  was  no  assessment  for  best  interests  of  the
    children in particular the qualifying child and arguably that the judge
    did not have regard to significant weight to attach to the fact a child
    has been present in the United Kingdom.

31. A fair reading of the First-tier Tribunal's decision indicates that the
    judge had in mind the importance of  the  qualifying  child,  including
    that the judge set out the relevant provisions at [24] of Section  117B
    including that the public interest does not require the  removal  of  a
    person who has a genuine parental relationship with a qualifying  child
    that it would not be reasonable for that child to leave the UK.

32. At [25] the judge carried out the best  interests'  assessment  finding
    that her best interests were bound  up  by  that  of  her  parents  and
    siblings.  There is nothing irrational about that  finding  given  that
    the qualifying child was only 7.  It is not the  case  that  the  judge
    dismissing the child's life outside  the  home,  but  rather  that  her
    interests remain bound up with those of her parents  and  siblings  and
    that she did not have a  strong  private  life  of  her  own.   It  was
    implicit in the judge's findings, including at [25], that the judge was
    satisfied that the children's  best  interests  were  in  returning  to
    Pakistan with their  parents.   I  do  not  agree  with  Miss  Hashmi's
    assessment that this consisted only of considering that the child could
    access education.  In addition the judge  considered  that  the  family
    were all citizens  of  Pakistan,  that  the  qualifying  child  had  no
    learning difficulties, that she had an excellent school report and  she
    was not vulnerable and in the  judge's  findings  that  she  spoke  the
    relevant languages or could achieve a degree of fluency  without  undue
    hardship and delay and that the family could all move without harm.

33. I am satisfied that the judge did  conduct  a  proper  best  interests'
    assessment.  In addition, although it was argued at  paragraph  (c)  of
    the grounds for permission that the judge had failed  to  consider  the
    entire family including the appellant's  wife  and  remaining  children
    aged 5 and 1, it is evident that the judge made available  findings  in
    relation to the whole family including that the family could move  back
    to Pakistan without harm and that they would move as a unit.  The judge
    had in mind the best interests  of  all  the  children  and  there  was
    nothing before me to suggest that there was  anything  that  the  judge
    missed in respect of the best interests of the younger children or that
    there was anything missed in the judge's balancing exercise in  respect
    of the family as  a  whole  including  the  wife  who  was  necessarily
    included in the judge's consideration of the "family".

34. The grounds relied on MT and ET (child's best interests) Nigeria [2018]
    UKUT 88 (IAC).  The judge had addressed this issue in his findings that
    this was a child who was just 7  and  although  she  had  an  excellent
    school report and the judge considered  her  education,  her  life  was
    "bound up" with the parents and siblings.  It was not suggested  before
    me, and there was no evidence that might have supported such a finding,
    that the best interests of the child in this case are commensurate with
    those considered in MT and ET.

35. I have considered the recent guidance from  the  Supreme  Court  in  KO
    (above):

    "10.  The  President  also  cited  (paragraph  16)  relevant   guidance
    contained in the Immigration Directorate  Instruction  ("IDI")  of  the
    Home Office entitled "Family Life (as a partner or parent) and  Private
    Life: Ten Year Routes", published in August  2015,  extracts  of  which
    were appended to the judgment (Appendix 2).  They  included  a  section
    headed "Would it be unreasonable to expect  a  non-British  citizen  to
    leave the UK?",  under  which  were  set  out  a  number  of  "relevant
    considerations" such as risk to the child's health, family ties in  the
    UK and likelihood of integration into life in another country and:

                  "b.  Whether the child would be leaving the UK with  their
                      parent(s).

                  It is generally the case that it  is  in  a  child's  best
                  interests to remain with their parent(s).  Unless  special
                  factors apply, it will generally be reasonable to expect a
                  child to leave the UK with their  parent(s),  particularly
                  if the parent(s) have no right living in the UK."

             There was no reference in  the  list  to  the  criminality  or
             immigration record of parents as a relevant factor.

         11.  The most recent version of the IDI (22 February 2018) no doubt
             taking account of Court of  Appeal  decisions  which  I  shall
             refer below, includes  an  additional  paragraph,  which  more
             closely reflects the Secretary of State's submissions  in  the
             present case:

                  "The consideration of the child's best interests must  not
                  be affected by the conduct or immigration history  of  the
                  parent(s) or primary carer, but these will be relevant  in
                  the  assessment  of  the  public  interest,  including  in
                  maintaining effective immigration  control;  whether  this
                  outweighs the child's best interests; and whether  in  the
                  round, it is reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the
                  UK" (Family Migration: Appendix FM Section  1.0b.   Family
                  Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life;  Ten  Year
                  Routes, p 76)."

         ......

         16.  It is natural to  begin  with  the  first  in  time,  that  is
             paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).  This paragraph is directed solely to
             the position of the child.  Unlike its predecessor  DP5/96  it
             contains  no  requirement  to  consider  the  criminality   or
             misconduct  of  a  parent  as  a  balancing  factor.   It   is
             impossible  in  my  view  to  read  it  as  importing  such  a
             requirement by implication.

         17.  As has been seen, Section 117B(6) incorporated  the  substance
             of the Rule without material change,  but  this  time  in  the
             context of the right of the parent to remain.  I  would  infer
             that it was intended to have the same effect.    The  question
             again is what is "reasonable" for the child.  As Elias LJ said
             in  MA  (Pakistan)  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
             Chamber) [2016] EWCA Civ 705, [2016] 1 WLR 5093, paragraph 36,
             there is nothing in the subsection to import  a  reference  to
             the conduct of the parent.  Section 117B sets out a number  of
             factors relating to those seeking leave to  enter  or  remain,
             but criminality is not one of those.  Subsection 117B(6) is on
             its face free-standing, the only qualification being that  the
             person relying on it is not liable to deportation.   The  list
             of relevant factors set out in the IDI guidance (paragraph  10
             above) seems to me wholly appropriate and sound in law, in the
             context of Section 117B(6) as of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).

         18.  On the other hand, as the IDI guidance acknowledges, it  seems
             to me inevitably relevant in both contexts to  consider  where
             the parents, apart from the relevant provision,  are  expected
             to be, since it will normally be reasonable for the  child  to
             be with them.  To that extent the record of  the  parents  may
             become indirectly material, if it leads to  their  ceasing  to
             have a right to remain here and having to leave.  It  is  only
             if, even on that hypothesis, it would not  be  reasonable  for
             the child to leave that the provision may give the  parents  a
             right to remain.  The point was well expressed by Lord Boyd in
             SA (Bangladesh v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department)
             [2017] SLT 1245:

                  "22. In my opinion before one embarks on an assessment  of
                      whether it is reasonable to expect the child to leave
                      the UK one has to address the  question,  'Why  would
                      the child be expected to leave the  United  Kingdom?'
                      In a case such as this there can only be one  answer:
                      'because the parents have no right to remain  in  the
                      UK'.  To approach the question any other  way  strips
                      away  the  context  in  which   the   assessment   of
                      reasonableness is being made ..."

         19.  He noted [paragraph 21] that Lewison LJ  had  made  a  similar
             point in considering the "best interests" of children  in  the
             context  of  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship   and
             Immigration Act 2009 in EV (Philippines) v Secretary of  State
             for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874, paragraph 58:

                  "58. In my judgment therefore the assessment of  the  best
                      interests of the children must be made on  the  basis
                      that the facts are as they are in the real world.  If
                      one parent has no right  to  remain,  but  the  other
                      parent does that  is  the  background  against  which
                      assessment is conducted.  If neither parent  has  the
                      right to remain, then that is the background  against
                      which the assessment is conducted.  Thus the ultimate
                      question will be: is  it  reasonable  to  expect  the
                      child to follow the parent with no right to remain to
                      the country of origin?"

             To the extent Elias LJ may  have  suggested  otherwise  in  MA
             (Pakistan) paragraph 40, I would respectfully disagree.  There
             is nothing in the section to suggest that "reasonableness"  is
             to be considered otherwise in than in the real world in  which
             the children find themselves."

36. Therefore, the relevant question is where the parents can  be  expected
    to be and the situation of the child must be considered on the basis of
    the facts "as they are  in  the  real  world".   That  in  my  view  is
    precisely what the judge in this case has  done.   In  considering,  at
    [28], that the appellant had been dishonest the judge  was  considering
    the appellant's conduct relevant in so far as it meant that the parents
    had to leave the country (see paragraph 51 of KO).  It is not the case,
    reading the determination as a whole, that the judge  has  imported  an
    incorrect test.  Rather this is a case where the appellant  must  leave
    because he has been dishonest and neither the appellant  nor  his  wife
    have a right to  remain.   The  judge  considered  the  facts  in  this
    context.  The judge made  best  interest  findings  and  found  it  was
    reasonable for the children to follow their parents to Pakistan for the
    reasons the judge gave including at [25].

37. No errors of law are disclosed in grounds 1 or 2.  The decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error of law and shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
