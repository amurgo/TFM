Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr Chohan (Solicitor)
For  the  Respondent:    Miss  Brocklesby-Weller  (Home  Office   Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. It is the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Beach dated the 9th March 2015, which  was  promulgated
      on the 11th March 2015.


   2. The First-Tier Tribunal Judge had dismissed the  Appellant's  appealed
      against  the  Respondent's  decision  dated  the  17th  February  2014
      refusing to issue him with a residence card  as  the  extended  family
      member of an EEA national  exercising  Treaty  Rights  in  the  United
      Kingdom.


   3. Although First-Tier Tribunal Judge Beach accepted that  the  Appellant
      and his sponsor were now living together in  the  United  Kingdom  and
      that he was dependent upon  his  sponsor  now  whilst  in  the  United
      Kingdom, she did not accept that the Appellant had been dependent upon
      the sponsor previously whilst the Appellant was living in Pakistan, or
      that they had  previously  been  members  of  the  same  household  in
      Pakistan. She found that the sponsor  was  funding  the  Appellant  in
      order that he could come to the United Kingdom to study,  rather  than
      the Appellant being dependent upon him financially  in  Pakistan.  She
      therefore dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.



   4. The Appellant has now sought to appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal, and permission to appeal was granted by First-Tier  Tribunal
      Judge Andrew on the 5th May 2015. In the reasons for her decision, she
      stated that:



      "2. I am satisfied  that  it  is  arguable  that  the  judge  did  not
      adequately evaluate the evidence before her  and  did  not  apply  the
      facts to the guidance in the case of  Dauhoo  (EEA  Regulations-Reg  8
      (2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (IAC).

   5. In the Grounds of Appeal it is argued  that  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      Judge overlooked relevant evidence that had been submitted in the form
      of money transfer receipts dated the 22nd December 2009, the 5th April
      2010, the 9th April 2010 and the 3rd May 2010 which it  is  said  were
      submitted with the initial application to the Respondent, the NIB bank
      statement of the Appellant in Pakistan showing  money  transfers  from
      the EEA sponsor on the 22nd December 2009, the 5th April 2010, the 9th
      April 2010 and the 3rd May 2010, a utility bill dated  the  30th  July
      2009 which it is said showed cohabitation  at  the  same  address  for
      almost 3 months, the meter reading been dated the 30th July 2009  with
      the connection being dated the 10th May 2009, and  birth  certificates
      with what are said to be common addresses at the bottom of each of the
      birth certificates, which again it is argued proves membership of  the
      same household.


   6. It is further argued that the Judge failed to adequately evaluate  the
      evidence before her, in terms of  the  financial  transfers  and  that
      although the Respondent in its initial refusal letter dated  the  17th
      February 2014 had said that the Appellant already had enough money  in
      his bank account not to be dependent upon the EEA sponsor, before  the
      financial transfers had taken place. Enough evidence, it  was  argued,
      had been submitted for the Respondent and for the First-Tier  Tribunal
      Judge to find that in fact those funds were sent by  the  EEA  sponsor
      either for the Tier 4 application for funding the Appellant's  studies
      or for his personal expenses or for family maintenance. It  is  argued
      that the Judge only considered two transactions of �2450 and �6480  at
      [13] of the decision and failed to consider  a  third  transaction  of
      �6435 in the EEA sponsor's Barclay's bank account at page  25  of  the
      Appellant's bundle which was entitled "UK Tuition Visa".



   7. It is further argued that the �2450  was  actually  sent  by  the  EEA
      sponsor  to  the  Appellant's  NIB  bank  account  for   his   "family
      maintenance" on the 1st December 2009 which is  said  to  explain  the
      balance in the Appellant's NIB  bank  account  at  the  start  of  the
      statement and that the transaction clearly indicated that it  was  for
      "family maintenance". It  is  further  said  that  the  Appellant  had
      mentioned in his witness statement  that  the  EEA  sponsor  not  only
      financially supported him personally, but his entire family  and  that
      the Judge had mistaken this  transaction  as  being  for  the  Tier  4
      application rather than for family maintenance.


   8. It is further argued  that  the  reasoning  given  by  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge in respect of her findings that the sponsor was  simply
      funding the Appellant's  studies  rather  than  maintaining  him  were
      inadequate or insufficient and that the Judge has imposed  too  higher
      test. It is argued that the appropriate test is whether, as  a  matter
      of fact, the EEA national provides  material  support  to  the  family
      member in order to meet the family member's  essential  needs.  It  is
      further  argued  that  the  fact  that  the  sponsor  is  funding  the
      Appellant's  studies  also  showed  that   the   Appellant   satisfied
      Regulation 8 (2) (A) of the EEA Regulations and that  education  is  a
      fundamental human right and is essential for the exercise of all other
      human rights.


Submissions

   9. In his submissions on behalf of the Appellant Mr  Chohan  adopted  and
      relied upon the Grounds of Appeal. He argued that the Judge had failed
      to take account of the money transfer receipts and the Appellant's NIB
      bank  account  showing  payments  into  that  bank  account.  I  asked
      specifically whether or not the Judge  had  actually  seen  the  money
      transfer receipts, as within the Grounds of Appeal, it was stated that
      these had not been included within the Appellant's  bundle,  and  they
      were not contained within either the Appellant's or  the  Respondent's
      bundle in the file before me. He told me  that  these  documents  have
      been sent to the Home Office, but could provide no  confirmation  that
      in fact they were contained within the  documentation  that  had  been
      submitted to the First-Tier Tribunal Judge. However,  he  argued  that
      the Judge had failed to  take  account  of  the  Appellants  NIB  bank
      account, which he argued showed further payments  being  made  to  the
      Appellant  over  and  above  the  transfers  from  the  EEA  sponsor's
      Barclay's bank account.


  10. Mr Chohan argued  that  the  Judge  failed  to  take  account  of  the
      Appellant's evidence that he and his family have been maintained for a
      long period of time by the EEA  sponsor,  running  into  a  number  of
      years, not just for a short period and that the  first  transfer  from
      the EEA sponsor's bank account have been able  specifically  as  being
      for maintenance, rather than for the Appellant's  studies.  He  argued
      that the decision reached by the First-Tier Tribunal Judge was not the
      only decision open to her on the  evidence  and  that  she  failed  to
      properly assess the evidence and failed to take  account  of  material
      evidence which was before her.



  11. He further argued that the utility bill that had been  submitted  from
      2009 was both in the names of the Appellant and the EEA  sponsor,  but
      he considered in this regard that the EEA sponsor had  actually  moved
      to the UK in August 2008, prior to the date of the  utility  bill.  He
      further argued that the birth certificates did have the  same  address
      on them for the Appellant and the EEA sponsor and the Judge had failed
      to take account of this.



  12. In her submissions on behalf of the  Respondent  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller
      argued that the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  correctly  directed
      herself in respect of all of the evidence  before  her  and  that  the
      findings that she had made were open  to  her  on  the  evidence.  She
      argued that the money transfer slips were not  before  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge, not being in  the  Respondent's  nor  the  Appellant's
      bundle,  and  not  being  shown  on  the  PF1  document   within   the
      Respondent's bundle listing which documents  that  had  actually  been
      submitted and considered by the Respondent. She  argued  that  it  was
      open to the Judge to find that the transfer of money to the  Appellant
      was to fund his tertiary education in the UK,  rather  than  providing
      for his core needs in Pakistan. She further argued that there was  not
      clear evidence that any money transfer to the Appellant  was  for  his
      essential needs rather than for any luxury items  or  other  expenses.
      She argued that the bank accounts submitted and  statements  only  ran
      from December 2009, which was inconsistent with the Appellant's  claim
      that there had been a long period of dependency running into years.


  13. Ms Brocklesby-Weller argued that the historic birth  certificates  did
      not assist in improving membership of the same household in  Pakistan,
      and that the Judge had considered the sole utility bill but found that
      it was inadequate in proving cohabitation within  the  same  household
      and had given full reasons for her decision in that regard. She  asked
      me to dismiss the appeal.

My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality


  14. The original appeal hearing before the First-Tier  Tribunal  had  been
      listed on the 3rd October 2014, but had been adjourned as a result  of
      the EEA sponsor's wife being ill in Pakistan.  It  was  listed  to  be
      heard again on the 27th February 2015, but the Appellant  had  written
      to the Tribunal on the 20th November 2014 indicating  that  his  uncle
      would not be back from Pakistan  until  March  2015  but  rather  than
      asking for a further adjournment, he asked that the appeal be  decided
      on the papers submitted. The case  was  therefore  considered  on  the
      papers by First-Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew. This was despite the  fact
      that the Appellant himself would still have been in the United Kingdom
      and would have been able to give evidence at the  hearing,  should  he
      have chosen to do so. By asking for the appeal to be dealt with on the
      papers, the Appellant had thereby deprived himself of the  opportunity
      he would otherwise have had to answer any questions or deal  with  any
      concerns that First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  had  regarding  the
      evidence submitted. That was his choice and First-Tier Tribunal  Judge
      Andrew was in the position of having to simply consider whether or not
      the  requirements  of  Regulation  8  (2)  were  met  of  the  of  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  were  met  on  the  basis  of  the
      statements and documentary evidence submitted.


  15. I am not satisfied that in fact the money transfer  receipts  referred
      to in the Grounds of Appeal were actually before  First-Tier  Tribunal
      Judge Andrew. Such money transfer receipts were not  contained  within
      either the Appellant's or the Respondent's bundle, and in the  Grounds
      of Appeal it is stated specifically that they had  not  been  included
      within  the  Appellant's  bundle.  Further,  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  is
      correct in stating that they were not actually listed within  the  PF1
      document listing the documents considered by the Respondent in  making
      the original decision. I therefore do not consider that the First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge can be criticised in  failing  to  consider  the  money
      transfer receipts, when there  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  these
      documents were in fact before her when she made her decision.



  16. However, even if I  am  wrong  in  this  regard,  the  money  transfer
      receipts copies of which  were  attached  to  the  Grounds  of  Appeal
      seeking permission to appeal from the Upper  Tribunal  simply  reflect
      the payments into the Appellant's  NIB  bank  account,  as  the  money
      transfers were paid into that account and the money transfer  receipts
      themselves do not indicate the purpose of the transfer. Further, there
      are no transfers prior to the 21st December 2009.



  17. It is significant in this case that the Appellant had applied  on  the
      19th June 2010 for Entry Clearance as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  and
      that the EEA sponsor, Mr S Z  Khan  was,  it  is  agreed  between  the
      parties, funding those studies in the UK. Indeed  in  Mr  S  Z  Khan's
      statement  before  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge   Andrew,   he   stated
      specifically  at  [7]  that  he  had  sent  �6480  and  �6435  to  the
      Appellant's post office account on the 28th April 2010  and  the  12th
      May 2010 respectively.



  18. Although First-Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew has erred in failing to give
      adequate reasons at [13] for her finding that the two  payments  prior
      to the Appellant coming to the UK related to payments for his  Tier  4
      application, when the �2450 paid from the EEA sponsor's  bank  account
      to the Appellant's on the 1st  December  2009  was  actually  labelled
      "family maintenance", I do not consider that any error in this  regard
      is material, given that  one  transfer  shown  in  the  bank  accounts
      labelled "family maintenance" does not in fact establish the Appellant
      was financially dependent  upon  the  EEA  sponsor  whilst  living  in
      Pakistan, when set against the background of  a  claim  that  the  EEA
      sponsor had been financially supporting the Appellant and  his  family
      for many years. There are no payments prior to December 2009 shown  in
      the bank accounts statements, despite it being  argued  by  Mr  Chohan
      that in effect the EEA sponsor have been funding the Appellant and his
      family since the Appellant's father died when he was only 4 years old.
      This was not borne out in the documentary evidence  produced  for  the
      appeal before the First-Tier Tribunal Judge.


  19.  It is significant in this regard that in the  case  of  Moneke  (EEA-
      OFM's) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT  00341  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  found
      specifically that for the purposes of the  EEA  Regulations  financial
      dependency should be interpreted as  meaning  that  the  person  needs
      financial support from the EEA national for his or  her  in  order  to
      meet his or her essential needs. Without documentary evidence  of  any
      financial transfers prior to December 2009, one transfer stated to  be
      for "family maintenance" in December 2009 would not establish that  it
      was for the essential needs of the  Appellant,  and  would  have  been
      insufficient documentary evidence to prove this aspect of the claim in
      any event.


  20. On this basis it was open to the Judge to conclude that in  fact  this
      money was also to fund the Appellant's studies, although she  has  not
      clearly explained her reasoning, but as explained above such error was
      not material.

  21. Further, although First-Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew further did err  in
      failing to refer to the Appellant's NIB bank account statement,  which
      clearly was before her and the payments  from  Mr  Khan  therein,  the
      Appellant, although claiming long-term financial dependency on the EEA
      sponsor, has failed within  his  statement  to  actually  explain  the
      payments within his NIB account, nor was the purpose of such  payments
      adequately explained within Mr Khan's statement.  There  is  no  clear
      evidence as to why each of those individual payments  were  made,  and
      given that the two were made within close proximity of the Appellant's
      application to come to study in the UK, there  is  no  clear  evidence
      that in fact that money was paid  for  maintaining  the  Appellant  in
      Pakistan, rather than being linked to funding his  study  in  the  UK.
      With all payments from the Barclay's bank account  and  into  the  NIB
      account being within just a seven month period of the  application  to
      come to the UK to study, and no evidence of long-term prior dependency
      as claimed, it was perfectly open to the First-Tier Tribunal Judge  to
      make the findings that she did, that the  payments  to  the  Appellant
      were in respect of him coming to the UK to study, rather than  proving
      prior dependency in Pakistan.


  22. The above errors in First-Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew's  decision  were
      therefore not material, as there was insufficient evidence before her,
      in any event, to actually prove on the balance of  probabilities  that
      the Appellant was financially dependent upon the EEA sponsor  for  his
      essential needs, and the documentary evidence in that regard  did  not
      bear out the  claim  that  he  had  been  financially  supporting  the
      Appellant and his family for many years. It was perfectly open to  the
      Judge to find that on the evidence presented the  sponsor  was  simply
      funding the Appellant's studies in the UK.



  23. The sponsor funding the Appellant's studies in the UK does not  amount
      to material support for his essential needs whilst living in Pakistan.
      It therefore does not prove the prior dependency element, as any  such
      money transferred to him, even though he is at that  stage  living  in
      Pakistan, would be for his use whilst in the UK, rather  than  meeting
      his essential needs in Pakistan.



  24. First-Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew further at [14] did consider the  one
      utility bill in July 2009, despite the concretion in  the  Grounds  of
      Appeal, and did find that in itself is insufficient to show  that  the
      Appellant and sponsor had cohabited  and  been  members  of  the  same
      household in Pakistan. It has to be borne in mind in that regard  that
      it is said that the EEA sponsor actually moved to the UK in 2008,  and
      the fact that his name was therefore on a utility bill  in  July  2009
      does not actually in itself prove prior cohabitation prior to the  EEA
      sponsor coming to the UK. The Judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  find
      that there were no tenancy agreement or land deeds to show  that  this
      was the  sponsor's  home  address  and  that  there  was  very  little
      documentary evidence to show that the Appellant had  lived  there  and
      that there was insufficient documentary  evidence  to  show  that  the
      Appellant resided in the sponsor's home prior to  coming  to  the  UK.
      That was a finding that was perfectly open  to  her  on  the  evidence
      presented.



  25. In respect of the assertion that the Judge failed to take  account  of
      the birth certificates, although the Judge did not make  reference  to
      these, although there is an address given on  the  birth  certificates
      which is the  same  address  in  Lahore,  given  the  dates  on  these
      documents were produced by different dates, they do not actually  show
      actually show cohabitation between the EEA sponsor and the  Appellant.
      The First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  therefore  materially  err  in
      failing to refer to these documents.



  26. In respect of the assertion that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed
      to apply the facts  to  the  guidance  in  the  case  of  Dauhoo  (EEA
      Regulations-Regulation 8 (2)) [2012] UKUT 79, the Judge  did  consider
      the question of prior dependency, prior membership of that  household,
      present dependency and present membership of the household as separate
      questions. Given her findings that neither prior dependency nor  prior
      membership of the household had been established, although she did not
      specifically set out the 4 ways in  which  Regulation  8  (2)  of  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 could be met as set out within  the
      case of Dauhoo, given her findings that neither prior  dependency  nor
      prior joint membership of  a  household  have  been  established,  any
      failure on her part to set out the different ways in which  Regulation
      828 (2) could be satisfied for an  extended  family  member,  was  not
      material to the outcome of the case, as none of the four possibilities
      were in fact satisfied. The  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Andrew therefore does not disclose any material errors of Law  and  is
      maintained. The appeal is dismissed.
