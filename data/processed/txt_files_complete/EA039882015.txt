Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Bridock, Counsel, instructed by Visa Legal
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of India born on 1 December 1985.

 2. On 19 July 2012 he was granted a residence card as the extended family
    member of a Portuguese national on the basis of being in a durable
    relationship with her.

 3. On 8 December 2015 the appellant's family permit residence card was
    revoked and he was refused admission to the UK under Regulation 19 of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on the ground
    that he was not in a durable relationship with his claimed partner.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was
    heard by Judge Fowell. The judge dismissed the appeal, on the basis
    that although the appellant was in a durable relationship with his
    partner the First -tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the
    appeal.

 5. The reason the judge did not consider there to be jurisdiction was that
    he purported to follow the Upper Tribunal decision in Sala (EFMs: Right
    of Appeal: Albania) [2016].  However, the Court of Appeal has
    subsequently found, in a decision promulgated after Judge Fowell's
    decision, that Sala was wrongly decided: see Khan v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 6. Before me, Mr Jarvis, on behalf of the Secretary of State, accepted
    that the First-tier Tribunal had jurisdiction and that it was an error
    of law to find otherwise.

 7. Both parties were in agreement that the decision should be remade based
    on the factual findings of Judge Fowell, which were not in dispute.

 8. At paragraph 22 of his decision, Judge Fowell found that the appellant
    and his partner were in a genuine and durable relationship which has
    continued over a period of years. This being the case, there was no
    lawful basis to revoke the appellant's family permit residence card and
    refuse him admission to the UK under the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law
and is set aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
