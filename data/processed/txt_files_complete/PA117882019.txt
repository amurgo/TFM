For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer

This has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has  been  consented  to  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could  be
determined in a remote hearing. The documents that I was referred to are in
the bundles on the court file, the contents of which I have recorded. The
order made is described at the end of these reasons.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Palestine born on 11 April 1978. He
appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Raikes,
promulgated on 23 October 2020, dismissing his appeal against the refusal
of his protection claim on asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights
grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Resident First-tier Tribunal Judge
Zucker on 14 November 2020 for the following reasons: "As the grounds
recognise, the Upper Tribunal will be very slow to interfere with findings
of fact. However, just as the cumulative effect of inconsistencies can lead
to a claim not being accepted as credible, so too can the cumulative effect
of errors in the findings lead to an error of law. The grant of permission
should not be taken as an indication that there are errors in the findings.
That will be a matter for the Upper Tribunal, but the grounds are
arguable."

3.   Ms Everett conceded that, taken cumulatively, the grounds demonstrated
an error of law in the judge's credibility findings. It was agreed by the
parties that the decision should be set aside and the appeal remitted to
the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

4.   I find that the judge erred in law in dismissing the Appellant's
appeal and I set the decision aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-
tier Tribunal. None of the judge's findings are preserved.
