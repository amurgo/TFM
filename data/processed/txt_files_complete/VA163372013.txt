                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent but
    nonetheless for the purposes of this decision  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as they were termed before the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 29th June  1990  and  he
    appealed against the refusal of the Entry Clearance Officer  dated  8th
    July 2013 to grant him a visit visa. On 22nd October  2014  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge S  Taylor  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration rules.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent  and
    granted against the FTT Judge's decision by First Tier  Tribunal  Judge
    TRP Hollingworth on 5th December 2014.

 4. The issue centred on whether the  appellant  had  made  an  application
    prior to the commencement of Section 52 of the  Crime  and  Courts  Act
    2013 on 25th June 2013 which restricted the grounds of appeal to  human
    rights  or  race  relations  grounds.   The  judge  had  recorded   the
    application as being made on 26th June  2013  but  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

 5. At the hearing Mr Whitwell confirmed that he had received  confirmation
    from the Entry Clearance Officer stating that the appellant had  indeed
    made the application  on  24th  June  2013  and  indeed  had  paid  the
    requisite fee at the latest by  24th  June  2013  as  per  Kaur  (entry
    Clearance - date of application) [2013] UKUT 00381 (IAC).

 6. In the light of the above Mr Whitwell requested that there  be  consent
    for the matter to  be  withdrawn  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.

 7. Permission of the Upper Tribunal is required for a  party  to  withdraw
    its case. Having carefully considered the  facts  of  this  case  as  a
    whole, I give consent for such withdrawal.

 8. Accordingly with my consent and pursuant to Rules 17(2)  and  17(5)  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  this  appeal  is
    recorded as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is
    a Notice pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  to  inform  the  parties  that  the
    appellant's case is withdrawn.

 9. The effect of the respondent's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.



Signed:

Deputy Upper Tribunal Rimington
