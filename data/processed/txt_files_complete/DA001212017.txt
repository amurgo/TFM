Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:     Mr F. Farhat, of Gulbenkian Andonian, solicitors

                                  DECISION

   1. The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  has  been  granted
      permission to appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
      O'Rourke who, by a determination promulgated on 26 April 2017, allowed
      the appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State,  made  on  19
      December 2016 to make a deportation  order,  the  Secretary  of  State
      having concluded pursuant to Regulation 19(3)(b)  of  the  Immigration
      (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the regulations")  that  such  an  order  was
      justified on the grounds of public policy.


   2. That means, of course, that it is the Secretary of State that  is  the
      appellant before the Upper Tribunal. However, as it will be  necessary
      to reproduce extracts from the judgment  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge, it is convenient to refer in this judgment to  the  parties  as
      they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. The appellant is a citizen of Hungary, although he is also an Algerian
      national as his father is  an  Algerian  national.  His  parents  have
      returned to live in Algeria. The appellant claimed to have been living
      in the United Kingdom since 2004, although in the absence of  evidence
      to establish that, the respondent did not accept that to be true.  The
      appellant has accumulated criminal convictions. These were recorded by
      the judge as follows:
           i. 28 December 2006; theft from  the  person;  sentenced  to  28
              days' imprisonment, suspended for 2 years;
          ii. 26 September 2012; racially aggravated harassment; ï¿½100 fine;
         iii. 27 October 2016; possessing Class  A  drugs  with  intent  to
              supply; 16 months' imprisonment.
      However, it seems  that  may  not  be  an  altogether  accurate  list,
      because, according to the  respondent,  the  sentences  to  which  the
      appellant has been subject include a supervision requirement under the
      terms  of  a  Community  Order,  as  well  as  an  alcohol   treatment
      requirement. Unfortunately, the parties were unable to provide me with
      either a copy of the appellant's official antecedents nor  a  copy  of
      the sentencing remarks of  the  judge  who  imposed  the  most  recent
      sentence of imprisonment.
   4. As the respondent did not accept that the appellant had been  able  to
      establish that he had spent a continuous period of five  years  during
      which he had resided in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  the
      regulations, nor that he had lived continuously in the United  Kingdom
      for a continous period of ten years (counting back from  the  date  of
      the decision, that continuity having been broken by the last  sentence
      of imprisonment) the respondent concluded that the appellant  was  not
      entitled to  any  enhanced  level  of  protection  from  removal.  The
      respondent was satisfied  that  the  appellant  presented  a  genuine,
      present and sufficiently serious threat to  the  interests  of  public
      policy and security so that his deportation was justified:
           "In the absence of evidence that there has been any  improvement
           in your personal circumstances since your  conviction,  or  that
           you have successfully addressed the issues that prompted you  to
           offend, it is  considered  reasonable  to  conclude  that  there
           remains a risk of you re-offending and continuing to pose a risk
           of harm to the public...
           ...
           ... you claim to have arrived in the United Kingdom in 2004 aged
           17  years,  however  you  have  failed  to  provide  documentary
           evidence to support  this  claim.  You  have  not  provided  any
           evidence of exercising your treaty rights and evidence  to  show
           that you have been resident in the United Kingdom in  accordance
           with the 2006 Regulations for a continuous period of 5 years  or
           more...
           It  is  not  accepted  that  you  are  socially  and  culturally
           integrated in  the  United  Kingdom.  This  is  because  despite
           indicating that you have worked in the United Kingdom since  you
           arrived around 2004, you have provided no  documentary  evidence
           to substantiate this claim whatsoever, or  that  you  have  done
           anything constructive with your time here..."


   5. The judge allowed the appeal because he found that the  appellant  had
      resided in the United Kingdom for  at  least  ten  years  and  so  was
      entitled  to  the  highest  level  of  protection  provided   by   the
      regulation, so that the appellant could not be removed other  than  on
      imperative  grounds  of  public  security.  At  paragraph  13  of  his
      determination the judge said:


           "All that is required by regulation 21(4) for the  threshold  of
           "imperative" grounds for removal  to  be  reached  is  that  the
           person has "resided" in  the  UK  for  at  least  ten  years....
           Accordingly,  the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of   the
           regulation 21(4)(a) and therefore the grounds of public security
           relied upon by the respondent must  be  "imperative".  The  word
           "imperative"  must  bear   its   natural   meaning   "absolutely
           necessary; unavoidable.
           Does the appellant's  personal  conduct  represent  a  "genuine,
           present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of  the
           fundamental interests of  society"  (Reg  21(5)(c))?  I  do  not
           consider, cumulatively that his history of offending adds up  to
           such a threat. His first two offences were minor, dissimilar and
           six years apart and the sentencing  court  in  his  most  recent
           conviction clearly accepted his evidence that he  had  a  lesser
           role  in  the  offence,  acting  out  of  naievity  and  without
           involvement in the greater offence and  had  no  involvement  in
           other drugs related activities....
           Based on my conclusion that the appellant does not  represent  a
           genuine, present and sufficient threat to, in this case,  public
           security, there are, I find, no imperative grounds that make  it
           absolutely necessary or unavoidable that he be removed from  the
           UK."
   6. That reasoning discloses clear errors of law. The  continuity  of  the
      appellant's residence, counting back from  the  date  of  the  decsion
      under challenge in these  proceedings,  has  been  punctuated  by  the
      sentence of imprisonment imposed.  The  basis  upon  which  the  judge
      concluded  that  imperative  grounds  were  required  is  simply   not
      sustainable. Further, the respondent made clear in the decision letter
      that it was not accepted that the appellant had achieved a  continuous
      period of residence in accordance with the  regulations  of  at  least
      five years either, nor that he had established  integration  into  the
      United Kingdom. Despite  what  is  said  by  the  judge  at  paragraph
      12(iii), the evidence before the judge did not in fact  demonstrate  a
      continuous period of five years during which Treaty  rights  had  been
      exercised, and simple presence was not sufficient. As Mr Tufan pointed
      out in oral submissions, there is no evidence of any earnings for  the
      tax year 2009/2010. Therefore, the appellant was entitled only to  the
      basic level of protection and it was an error of law for the judge  to
      determine the appeal on the basis that he enjoyed an enhanced level of
      protection.


   7. However, the judge found also that the appellant did not  represent  a
      genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to  public  security.
      If that finding was sound and open to the judge for the reasons given,
      then the error in applying an enhanced level of protection may not  be
      a material one. I am, though, satisfied that the reasoning that led to
      the  conclusions  of  the  judge  is  founded   upon   an   inaccurate
      understanding of the facts and is simply not sustainable.


   8. At paragraph 5 of his judgment, the judge noted  that  the  respondent
      had issued a supplementary decision letter dated 20 January 2017.  The
      respondent did  not  accept  the  assertion  made  on  behalf  of  the
      appellant that he had learnt "a  valuable  lesson"  whilst  in  prison
      because he had provided no evidence of having  completed  successfully
      any relevant courses whilst in prison. The respondent explained why it
      was  not  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  completed  five  years'
      continuous residence in accordance with the  regulations  such  as  to
      give rise to entitlement of a permanent right of residence and  so  an
      enhanced, intermediate, level of protection such as to require serious
      grounds, nor ten years' continuous residence such as to give  rise  to
      the highest level of protect such as to require "imperative  grounds".
      The respondent observed that,  given  the  conviction  for  possession
      Class A drugs with intent to supply, and the absence  of  evidence  of
      successful  completion  of  rehabilitation  programmes,  taking   into
      account the appellant's previous record of offending he constituted  a
      continuing risk of reoffending such that his  deportation  would  have
      been justified whatever the claimed level of protection.


   9. The reasoning and findings of the judge are set out at paragraphs  12-
      13 of his judgment. The judge began by saying that apart from his most
      recent offence:
           "...  the  appellant's  past  offending   behaviour   has   been
           intermittent and at a low level, as indicated by  the  sentences
           he received: 28 days imprisonment suspended and a ï¿½100 fine..."
      That observation discloses a seriously flawed approach. A sentence  of
      imprisonment, even if suspended, can be imposed by the court  only  if
      the offence is considered to be  so  serious  that  only  a  custodial
      sentence can be justified. To categorise it as low level offending  is
      therefore to significantly understate the seriousness of the offending
      behaviour. Further, as I have observed above, the  information  before
      the judge indicated that, apart from  the  sentence  of  imprisonment,
      suspended for two years, the appellant had  been  made  subject  to  a
      community order with an alcohol treatment order. That appears  not  to
      have been taken into account by the judge at all.
  10. Next, the judge considered the offence of  possessing  Class  A  drugs
      with intent to supply. The judge said:
           "His latest offence is clearly at a different level. However, it
           is clear from the  sentence  he  received  (in  the  absence  of
           sentencing remarks) that the court accepted his account of being
           a peripheral figure in those events. His sentence was below  the
           "starting point" suggested in the guidance and it  was  accepted
           that his was a "lesser role" which is defined in the guidance as
           including "engaged by pressure... involvement through naivety...
           very little, if any, awareness or understanding of the scale  of
           the operation."
      Earlier in his judgment, the judge had recoded a  submission  advanced
      on behalf of the appellant that he appears to have accepted that:
           "... he was awarded a  sentence  below  the  18-month  "starting
           point" for such offences, for a lesser role..."
      If this is correct, which in the absence of sentencing remarks  it  is
      impossible to be confident about, then this would be, for the purposes
      of the applicable sentencing guideline, a Category 4 offence involving
      a small amount of Class A drugs. But as the appellant pleaded  guilty,
      he would be entitled to a discount of up to one third of the  sentence
      identified as a starting point so that a sentence of 16  months  would
      mean, if he entered that plea at the first opportunity, that  in  this
      case the judge took as his starting point not 18 months'  custody  but
      24 months. Again, if it is correct that the judge identified this as a
      Category 4 case, that would  mean  that  the  judge  must  have  found
      present aggravating factors such as to require the starting  point  to
      be raised. The First-tier Tribunal Judge appears  also  to  overlooked
      that the characteristics that justified placing  the  offence  into  a
      "lesser role" for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines  were  not
      limited to those to which he  referred  but  included  also  that  the
      appellant played a limited function under direction and that he had no
      influence on those above in a chain.
  11. The main difficulties with the decision under appeal are, though,  the
      incorrect assessment of the level of protection from  removal  enjoyed
      by the appellant and the misunderstanding by the judge of  the  nature
      and seriousness of the appellant's record of offending. It  is  not  a
      case where, but for those errors, the outcome was bound to be the same
      and therefore those are material errors of law  which  mean  that  the
      decision of the judge to allow the appeal cannot stand. The appeal  to
      the Upper Tribunal is allowed to the extent that the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge O'Rourke is set aside to be remade by a  different
      judge of that Tribunal. As the appellant was not produced from custody
      at the hearing before the Upper Tribunal he has had no opportunity  to
      give evidence  about  his  current  circumstances.  In  addition,  the
      sentencing remarks of the judge who imposed the sentence of 16 months'
      imprisonment should if possible be before the  Tribunal  as  should  a
      complete list of the appellant's record of offending.


      Summary of decision


  12. First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Rourke made a material error  of  law  and
      his decision to allow the appeal is set aside.


  13. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  determined
      afresh.
