Representation:
Appellant:    Mr A Caskie, of Counsel,  instructed  by  Latta  and  Company,
                    Solicitors
Respondent:   Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Office Home Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The background to this appeal is rehearsed in the decision of the Upper
    Tribunal giving permission to appeal,  dated  24  May  2015.   This  is
    appended hereto.

 2. Having  heard  the  arguments  of  both  parties'  representatives,  we
    pronounced our decision at the conclusion of the hearing. In short,  we
    allow the appeal on the basis that the decision of the FtT is  vitiated
    by three material errors of law.  These are  set  out  in  [3]  of  the
    attached permission decision. On balance, we consider that remittal for
    further hearing at first instance is appropriate.

 3. We observe that at the fresh hearing consideration should be  given  by
    the FtT to the assessment contained in the  impugned  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State dated 29 June 2010 that even if the Appellant's case
    were accepted, or established, at its conceivable zenith,  there  would
    be no basis for allowing his claim for asylum.

DECISION

 4. We decide as follows:

    (a)  The decision of the FtT is set aside.

    (b)  We remit the appeal to  a  differently  constituted  FtT  for  the
         purpose of fresh hearing and decision.

    (c)  Having regard to the  nature  of  the  errors  of  law  found,  we
         preserve none of the FtT's findings.

5.   Given the protracted history of this appeal,  expedition  is  obviously
    desirable and we exhort the FtT accordingly.

         Application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal

             Before The President, The Hon Mr Justice McCloskey




                             Notice of Decision

                                Baker Mawejje
                                                                  Appellant
                                      v


                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                  Respondent




      Having considered all documents lodged

[1]  This application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal by  the
      Appellant, a national of Uganda  aged  42  years  who  claimed  asylum
      unsuccessfully following arrival in the United Kingdom in  June  2010,
      has a chequered and rather protracted history, which I summarise thus:



      (a) By a decision dated 29 June 2010 the Respondent, the Secretary  of
           State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of State") refused
           the  Appellant's  application  and,  on  the  same  date,   made
           directions for his removal from the United Kingdom under section
           10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

        b)    By its decision promulgated on 03 November 2010,  the  First-
           tier Tribunal ("FtT") dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  against
           the Secretary of State's decision.  His case  was  that  in  the
           event of being repatriated to Uganda he  would  be  at  risk  of
           prosecution and death at the hands  of  the  UPDF  (the  Ugandan
           Army) and the CMI (a Ugandan military  intelligence  agency)  by
           reason of his first hand knowledge of a  military  atrocity  and
           the rape  of  his  first  wife  by  Ugandan  soldiers.  The  FtT
           dismissed his appeal on the twofold grounds that his  claim  was
           untruthful and not credible and, in any event, taking  his  case
           at its zenith, he would not be at  risk  of  persecution  having
           regard to the country guidance  decision  which  held  that  LRA
           members and supporters who renounce violence and surrender under
           the terms of the 2000 amnesty will not be at risk of persecution
           or prosecution by the authorities.


        c)    This was followed by an application for permission to  appeal
           to the Upper Tribunal.  From the document entitled  "Application
           for Permission to Appeal",  I  distil  two  grounds  of  appeal.
           First, the FtT's finding that the Appellant's wife was attacked,
           beaten and raped, but not in the circumstances asserted by  her,
           is unsustainable in law as it fails to engage with  the  medical
           evidence, specifically the  medical  opinion  that  one  of  the
           wife's scars was "diagnostic" of torture and, further,  involves
           the error of "compartmentalisation": Mtbanga - v -  SSHD  [2005]
           EWCA Civ 367.  Second, the decision in PM had no application  to
           the Appellant, as his case was that he is at risk of persecution
           by state agencies in consequence of having witnessed an  episode
           of rape, torture and  killing  perpetrated  by  the  UPDF  in  a
           Ugandan village in May 2004.

        d)    On 27 January  2011  the  Upper  Tribunal  refused  to  grant
           permission to appeal.   (This  decision,  inexplicably,  is  not
           included  amongst  the  papers   lodged   by   the   Appellant's
           solicitors.)

        e)    The latter decision was challenged  by  the  Appellant  by  a
           petition for judicial review, giving rise to a decision  of  the
           Court of Session (Outer House), dated 04  September  2012  (Lady
           Clark). The kernel of this decision  emerges  in  the  following
           passages:

                 "[21] ....  The Upper Tribunal  .........  notes  that  the
                       [FtT] refers to  the  medical  report  at  [61]  ....
                       [and] concludes that the immigration judge's negative
                       credibility [finding] appears to be amply reasoned. I
                       have difficulty with this conclusion  because  it  is
                       not clear whether the Upper Tribunal is referring  to
                       the credibility of the Petitioner  and/or  his  first
                       wife .....


                  [Furthermore] the Upper Tribunal has  mistakenly  recorded
                       that 'the Appellant has  suffered  mistreatment'  and
                       refers to the immigration judge reaching  conclusions
                       about the circumstances in which that  was  incurred.
                       It is also not clear from the decision of  the  Upper
                       Tribunal whether [it]  has  focused  on  the  reasons
                       given by the  immigration  judge  for  rejecting  the
                       credibility of the  Appellant's  first  wife  in  the
                       context of the medical evidence ....


                       There  is  no  analysis  of  the  reasoning  of   the
                       immigration judge ....

                 [22]  When I attempted that exercise, even  with  the  able
                       assistance of Counsel for the Respondent, I  came  to
                       the conclusion that the reasoning and findings of the
                       immigration judge are impossible to  understand  even
                       with prolonged detailed analysis ....


                  One should reasonably  expect  to  find  some  reasons  to
                       explain why the Petitioner's first wife is  found  to
                       be   lacking   in   credibility,   what    are    the
                       inconsistencies found between the two witnesses  (the
                       Petitioner and his first wife) and in  what  respects
                       they are considered to be important .....


                       I confess  a  complete  failure  to  understand.  The
                       immigration judge proves capable of  making  sweeping
                       criticisms  about  the  lack   of   credibility   but
                       unfortunately I am able to understand the  basis  for
                       that from the findings set out .....

                 [24]  ....  The medical report concludes that  [the  injury
                       on the inner thigh]  is  diagnostic  of  torture  and
                       there is also evidence to the effect that some of the
                       injuries are highly consistent with  the  account  of
                       the Petitioner's first wife ....


                 [25]   There  is  no  suggestion  in  this  case  that  the
                       Petitioner or his wife were cross examined on  behalf
                       of the Respondent on the basis  that  these  injuries
                       were caused by domestic violence or  by  some  random
                       arbitrary mob involved in ethnic violence.   This  is
                       the  competing  theory  however   accepted   by   the
                       immigration judge ....


                 [28]  I find [this] difficult to understand ....


                  What the immigration judge appears  to  conclude  is  that
                       because there are alternative explanations  (domestic
                       violence or random ethnic violence) .......  that  is
                       good reason to reject the Petitioner's  first  wife's
                       account of the circumstances.  I  cannot  follow  the
                       logic of such reasoning, particularly where there  is
                       no evidence relating  to  the  circumstances  of  the
                       present case that, for example, this may be a case of
                       domestic violence ....

                 [30]   ....   The  immigration  judge  then   reaches   her
                       conclusion ..... 'However, even  applying  the  lower
                       standard of proof, I do  not  believe  that  she  was
                       attacked in the circumstances  she  claims'.   I  can
                       only say that I am left bewildered by  this  analysis
                       ....


                 [34]  We have in this case  a  woman  who  the  immigration
                       judge accepts as a victim of  terrible  violence  and
                       rape.  The victim has described that and the  context
                       to  the  immigration  judge.   We  are  told  by  the
                       immigration judge that the  victim  is  found  to  be
                       incredible about the circumstances  In my opinion the
                       reasons given by the immigration  judge  are  plainly
                       inadequate and perverse .....


                  The immigration judge does not even address the  issue  of
                       the medical  evidence  about  torture  which  may  of
                       course have a  bearing  on  the  credibility  of  the
                       Petitioner's first wife ....


                  I have no hesitation in concluding that the Upper Tribunal
                       is plainly wrong and that their reasons for  refusing
                       an appeal do not survive scrutiny.   The  immigration
                       judge in this case, in my opinion,  has  fallen  into
                       serious error in her assessment of credibility of the
                       Petitioner's first wife and I  consider  that  should
                       have been obvious to the Upper Tribunal."

              [My emphasis.]

         Concluding, Lady Clark states:

                 "I .....  uphold the plea of the Petitioner and  grant  the
                 Petitioner permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal."


        f)    I interpose here the observation  that  although  Lady  Clark
           purported to grant permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
           this was constitutionally impermissible, as only the FtT or  the
           Upper Tribunal has capacity  to  make  such  order.   While  the
           papers do not disclose the full sequence of events in  the  wake
           of  the  first  decision  of  the  Court  of  Session   (another
           unacceptable omission), I  deduce  that  the  next  step  was  a
           further application to the  Upper  Tribunal  for  permission  to
           appeal.  Regrettably, neither this application nor  the  ensuing
           decision has been provided by the Appellant's  solicitors  -  to
           add to the developing  litany  of  errors  and  omissions  noted
           above.   It is possible, notwithstanding, to discover indirectly
           that the Vice-President made a decision refusing the application
           which contains the following passage:


                 "The judge examined the evidence of the Appellant  and  his
                 wife  and  concluded,  for  reasons  given  there  [viz  in
                 paragraphs 61 to 90] that she did not believe it, even when
                 applying  the  appropriate  standard  of  proof  in  asylum
                 matters.  Her conclusions do not show  any  error  of  law.
                 She was clearly and unarguably entitled to reach  them  for
                 the reasons she gave."


        g)    Sequentially, the next step was  a  further  judicial  review
           petition to the Court of Session.   This  criticises  the  Vice-
           President's refusal decision for failing to adopt  the  analysis
           and opinion of Lady Clark and, indeed, contends that the  latter
           was not even considered.




        h)    Next, the Court of Session having ruled  that  the  Appellant
           had overcome  the  applicable  threshold,  the  judicial  review
           application was conceded by the Advocate  General  for  Scotland
           and the decision of Vice-President Ockelton (his second  refusal
           decision) was "reduced" ie quashed or set aside, in consequence.
            This concession is recorded in a "minute".  It is based  on  an
           acknowledgement that the Vice-President had failed  to  consider
           the opinion of Lady Clark in making his second refusal decision.



[2]  In consequence of the last mentioned  step  detailed  above,  by  order
      dated 11 February 2015 Lord Boyd of the Court of Session (Inner House)
      remitted the Appellant's application for permission to appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal for reconsideration.

[3]  The application  for  permission  to  appeal  falls  to  be  determined
      according to the well established test of whether the determination of
      the FtT is arguably erroneous in law in a material manner.  I consider
      that this test is satisfied.  In my opinion, there are three  arguably
      material errors of law in the determination of the FtT:

      (i) The finding that the Appellant's spouse gave evidence  not  worthy
           of belief is inadequately reasoned: see MK  (Pakistan:  Duty  to
           Give Reasons) [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC), at [7] - [12] especially.



      (ii)    There is a  failure  to  engage  with  the  medical  evidence,
           adequately or at all.  Linked to this defect, there is a further
           associated failure to  make  a  clear  and  unequivocal  finding
           relating  to  the  spouse's  injuries  or,   alternatively,   an
           irrational and unreasoned finding in respect thereof at [92]: MK
            at [12].


      (iii)   The invocation of  and  reliance  upon  the  country  guidance
           decision  entails  a  misunderstanding  of  the  core   of   the
           Appellant's asylum claim and  a  consequential  misdirection  in
           law.

[4]  Permission to appeal is granted accordingly.

                                Directions

      (i)  The  Appellant's  solicitors  will  serve  on  the   Respondent's
           representative and file with the Upper Tribunal a  comprehensive
           appeal bundle - to include  the  materials  noted  above  to  be
           missing - within 21 days of the date of this order.

       ii) The Secretary of State's Rule 24 response will follow  within  a
           further 21 days.


      iii) Given the vintage of this case, the hearing  will  be  expedited
           and it will be listed before me in July 2015, on a  date  to  be
           notified.
