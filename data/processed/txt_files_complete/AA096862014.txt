          DECISION AND REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW


Introduction

   1. This is an appeal by the appellant. The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of
      Turkey and his date of birth is 20 April 1984. He is married  to  Elif
      Has (aka Kilinc) who is a British and Turkish  citizen.  Her  date  of
      birth is 14 August 1980. They married on 24 February 2012. Has had two
      children by a former marriage, Dilan and Damla  who  were  10  and  15
      years of age at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing

Immigration History
   2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in November 2009.  He  was
      cautioned and given form IS151A in October 2010. He applied for  leave
      to remain on the basis of private/family life but this was rejected by
      the respondent on 18 February 2014. On 30 June 2014 he  made  a  claim
      for International Protection (asylum)  on  the  basis  of  a  fear  of
      persecution in Turkey and leave to remain on the  basis  that  removal
      would breach his Article 8 rights. The respondent rejected that  claim
      on 29 October 2014, refusing to grant asylum under  paragraph  336  of
      the Immigration Rules (HC395) (as amended) ('the  Immigration  Rules')
      or leave to remain under Article 8.  The  appellant  appealed  against
      this decision to the First-tier Tribunal.


The First-tier Tribunal Judge's Decision

    3. The First-tier Tribunal, Judge Robinson ('the judge'), dismissed the
       appellant's appeal on the asylum, Article 3 and Article  8  grounds.
       The judge found that the appellant  had  not  demonstrated  a  well-
       founded  fear  of  persecution  or  that  there  was  a   reasonable
       likelihood that he was at risk of ill treatment if  he  were  to  be
       returned to Turkey. With regard to Article 8, the  judge  considered
       the case under the Immigration Rules but records  that  it  was  not
       argued that the appellant met the requirements of those  rules.  The
       judge therefore considered his claim under the  European  Convention
       on Human Rights outside of the Immigration Rules. He found that  the
       respondent's right to enforce  immigration  control  outweighed  the
       appellant's right to family life with his wife and her children.



Permission to Appeal

    4. The appellant applied to the First-tier Tribunal for  permission  to
       appeal on both asylum and article 8 grounds. Limited  permission  to
       appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  solely  on
       article 8 grounds. Judge Osborne was satisfied that the findings  of
       the First-tier Tribunal in relation to the appellant's asylum  claim
       were sustainable on the evidence  before  the  judge  and  that  the
       grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal  were  no   more   than   a
       disagreement with judge's findings. In relation  to  the  Article  8
       claim the judge granted permission to appeal  on the basis  that  it
       was arguable that the judge had made an  error of law in failing  to
       make a reasoned decision in relation to the best  interests  of  the
       children and  in  failing  to  consider  s117  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


Discussion

    5. At the hearing we heard submissions from Mr Young on behalf  of  the
       Appellant and Mr Tarlow  on  behalf  of  the  respondent.  Mr  Young
       submitted that the judge had erred by failing to  take  account  the
       case of ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 and the correct  approach
       to decision making when considering the best interests of  children.
       He argued that the judge had not addressed the best interests of the
       children and concentrated only on the appellant  and  his  wife.  Mr
       Young submitted that the matter should be adjourned if an  error  of
       law was found so that the Tribunal could be updated on  the  current
       position, and  they  needed  time  to  explore  evidence  from,  for
       example, a social worker. He did not have further  evidence  at  the
       hearing and the appellant was not in attendance.


    6. Mr Tarlow relied on the Rule 24 response. He accepted that there was
       no reference to ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4  in  the  reasons
       and decision but that taken as a whole the decision was  a  balanced
       determination and weighed the interests of the wife and children but
       took into account the appellant's poor immigration history  and  the
       need for effective immigration  control.   However,  the  judge  had
       found that the children's and wife's interests  were  outweighed  by
       those factors. With regard to re-making the decision, if a  material
       error of law was found, he submitted that there was  nothing  before
       the Tribunal to suggest that the facts had materially changed.

    7. Both representatives were asked to make submissions on section  117B
       (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ('the  2002
       Act'), in particular the meaning of 'parental relationship'. Without
       quoting any authority, Mr Young invited  the  Tribunal  to  consider
       that parental relationship can extend to a step-parent. He  referred
       us to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the appellant's wife's witness statement
       and submitted that parental relationship extends to a person who was
       a father figure to the two children.

Legal Framework

    8.  As a result of the amendments which came  into  force  on  28  July
       2014, inserted by section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014,  the  2002
       Act now requires the Tribunal to take certain factors  into  account
       when determining whether a decision made under the Immigration  Acts
       breaches respect for private and family life. The  decision  in  the
       instant case is a decision made  under  the  Immigration  Acts.  The
       relevant provisions provide:
         117A Application of this Part


         (1) This Part applies where a court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
         (a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and  family
         life under Article 8, and
         (b) as a result would be unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1998.
         (2) In considering the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
         (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
         ...
         (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).


         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.
         ...
         (4) Little weight should be given to-
         (a) a private life, or
         (b) a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner  that  is
         established by a person at a time when the person is in the  United
         Kingdom unlawfully.
         ...


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and
         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.



    9.  Article 8 of the ECHR states:
       (i)    Everyone has the right to respect for his private and  family
       life, his home and his correspondence.
       (ii)   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
       exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the  law
       and is necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
       national security, public safety or the economic well-being  of  the
       country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
       of health or morals,  or  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and
       freedoms of others.




Error of Law

   10.  The jurisdiction of this tribunal on an appeal from the  First-tier
       Tribunal is limited to points of law (s 11 of the Tribunals,  Courts
       and Enforcement Act 2007). Generally the  Upper  Tribunal  will  not
       interfere with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, if an  error
       of law is found, unless that decision is material to the outcome  of
       the appeal.


   11.  Having considered the grounds of appeal and the submissions of  the
       parties we find that the judge has made a material error of law.


   12. The judge failed to take into consideration section 117 of the  2002
       Act which is an error of law. We do not consider, however,  that  on
       its own this would necessarily have been a material error of law.


   13. The judge failed to consider sufficiently the best interests of  the
       children. The judge adopted the correct approach, as  enunciated  by
       the House of Lords  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27,  when  determining
       Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules.

   14.  However,  at  paragraph  62(2),  when   considering   whether   the
       interference would have consequences of such gravity as  potentially
       to engage Article 8, (although finding that Article 8  was  engaged)
       it is clear that the judge considered this only with regard  to  the
       appellant and his spouse. The judge accepted 'that the  consequences
       of removal would be significant for the appellant and his spouse.  I
       therefore answer this question in the affirmative.'  Having  reached
       the conclusion that Article 8 was engaged this would not itself be a
       material  error  of  law  but  demonstrates  that  the   judge   was
       considering primarily the effect of removal on the appellant and his
       wife.


   15. At paragraph 72 the judge found '...The children may have grown fond
       of the appellant but it is clear that their own father  is  involved
       with their care and  upbringing  and  even  if  the  appellant  were
       required to leave the United Kingdom the children  would  remain  in
       the shared care of their birth parents. In my view this would be  in
       their best interests'. This is the only analysis in the decision  of
       the interests of the children.  It is evident from the  comments  in
       paragraph 75 that in weighing the factors the judge  did  not  treat
       the interest of the children as a  primary  consideration  and  paid
       insufficient regard to their best interests ' ...It is important  to
       note that the family and private life enjoyed by the  appellant  and
       his wife has developed during the period when he  had  no  leave  to
       remain. I take the view that  little  weight  should  be  placed  on
       family and community ties in these circumstances'.



   16.  The judge was referred to the case of ZH (Tanzania) v  SSHD  [2011]
       UKSC 4 by the Appellant's representative. No reference[1] is made to
       that case or to the duty under s55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and
       Immigration Act 2009 to consider the best interests of the children.
       There is no evidence in the decision that when the  judge  undertook
       consideration of the  effect  of  the  appellant's  removal  on  the
       children  their  best  interests   were   treated   as   a   primary
       consideration.


   17.  Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  contained  a
       material error of law and is set aside but the findings of fact made
       by the judge stand for the reasons given below.


   18. Mr Young invited us to adjourn for a re-hearing for further evidence
       to be obtained and adduced, in the event that we decided that  there
       was a material error of law. He submitted that the  Tribunal  needed
       to be updated and they needed time to  explore  evidence  from,  for
       example, a social worker.  The  appellant  had  not  made  a  proper
       application pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
       Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  and  the  defendant  had  given  no   prior
       indication that this was his intention, Mr Young  did  not  indicate
       the relevance of any such evidence and no indication was given  that
       there had been a material change  in  the  circumstances  that  were
       before the First-tier Tribunal judge. We therefore refused to  admit
       new evidence and decided to make a  fresh  decision  preserving  the
       findings of the judge.




   Decision

   19.  The First-tier tribunal had to decide the  best  interests  of  the
       appellant's wife's  children  as  part  of  the  balancing  exercise
       required under Article 8.  In particular he had  to  decide  whether
       removal of the appellant would be proportionate having regard to the
       Respondent's obligations towards Dilan and Damla.


    Preserved Findings

   20. The findings of the judge in paragraphs 61 - 65 (the first of the  4
       questions posed in Razgar) are preserved. The findings of the  judge
       on the proportionality of the appellant's removal in respect of  his
       and his wife's Article 8 rights are preserved.  In this  regard  the
       judge made the following findings:


         67 I consider the family life in the context of his age, health and
         personal circumstances,  his  immigration  status  and  immigration
         history. I also take account of the  length  of  his  stay  in  the
         United Kingdom, his links with the community insofar  as  they  are
         known and the nature of his relationship with others.


         68 For the whole period of his stay in the  UK  the  appellant  has
         lived here unlawfully, i.e. without any valid leave. This is a very
         strong argument in favour of the  respondent  who  has  a  duty  to
         implement and enforce immigration laws.


         69 The appellant has submitted no letters of  support  from  family
         members or friends in the UK. This is an important omission because
         he claims to have several family members  in  the  UK  including  3
         siblings. He claims his wife would not be able to accompany him  to
         Turkey because her children  are  UK  nationals  and  have  regular
         staying contact with their father (his spouse's former partner).


         70 The appellant's health condition is not supported by any medical
         evidence, the appellant has received treatment privately in the  UK
         and  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  appropriate  medical
         treatment is not available in Turkey.


         71. It is claimed that the appellant's wife would be unable to join
         her husband in Turkey for several  reasons.  She  has  a  home  and
         employment in the UK, her children are UK nationals and are in full
         time education  here,  the  children  stay  with  their  father  at
         weekends and he would not permit them to be taken out of the UK.


         72.  I  accept  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect   the
         appellant's wife to live  in  Turkey  for  reasons  given  by  her.
         However it is apparent  from  the  facts  of  this  case  that  the
         appellant has never had leave to enter or remain in the UK and  the
         couple were aware of his circumstances when they entered into their
         relationship. The children may have grown fond of the appellant but
         it is clear that their own father is involved with their  care  and
         upbringing and even if the appellant were  required  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom the children would remain in the shred care of their
         birth parents. In my view this would be I their best interests.


         73 The appellant is an adult male who is now 30 years old who  came
         to the UK when he was 25. He has spent the majority of his life  in
         Turkey and his parents live there. His main language is Turkish and
         he speaks Kurdish. I take the view that he would be able to  access
         appropriate medical treatment and medication for his  condition  in
         Turkey. He appears to be fit to travel. He  has  not  acquired  nay
         property or assets in the UK.


         74 The appellant's wife may be  able  to  visit  the  appellant  in
         Turkey if her former husband agrees to look after the children  for
         longer than he does at present. It is not clear  what  the  contact
         arrangements are in the school holidays.  She  speaks  Turkish  and
         Kurdish and should have no  practical  difficulties  travelling  to
         Turkey.


         75, I have taken all known factors into account  and  have  weighed
         these against the respondent's duty to maintain  an  effective  and
         fair system of immigration control. It is important  to  note  that
         the family and private life enjoyed by the appellant and  his  wife
         has developed during the period when he had no leave to  remain.  I
         take the view that little weight should be  placed  on  family  and
         community ties in these circumstances.


         76. I have carefully considered the appellant's strong  connections
         with his country of origin. It appears to me that it would  not  be
         unreasonable to expect the appellant to return to Turkey  where  he
         has family connections  and  he  is  familiar  with  the  language,
         culture,  and  environment.  Objective  evidence  shows  that   the
         appellant would be able to access appropriate medical in any of the
         major cities.

         78 The appellant's poor immigration history is a strong argument in
         the respondent's favour. It is apparent  that  he  was  willing  to
         enter into marriage with a second cousin in order to obtain  status
         here. It is of concern that social services  had  to  intervene  to
         protect the young woman who was being offered for marriage.


         79 In summary I  find  that  the  respondent's  right  to  regulate
         immigration to the United Kingdom and her responsibility to enforce
         immigration laws fairly and effectively  outweigh  the  appellant's
         righty to family life with his wife and her children here.  I  find
         that the decisions were lawful under the immigration rules and that
         due regard was taken of all the circumstances known at the time  of
         the decision.  I  have  undertaken  the  balancing  exercise  under
         Article 8(2) on the basis of the circumstances known at the  appeal
         hearing.


   21. The findings and decision set out in the  above  passages  are  well
       reasoned and the decision is one that a  reasonable  Tribunal  judge
       could come to. We endorse those findings and the adopt the  decision
       adding, in addition, that the judge not only was entitled  to  'take
       the view that little weight should be placed on family and community
       ties in these circumstances' but was in fact required to  do  so  by
       virtue of s117B of the 2002 Act which requires  that  little  weight
       should be placed  upon  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying
       partner that is established while the applicant is unlawfully in the
       UK.  In R (on the application of Mahmood) v Secretary of  State  for
       the Home Department [2001] the court held, 'The state  has  a  right
       under international law to control the entry of  non-nationals  into
       its territory subject always to its treaty obligations.   Article  8
       does not impose on the state any general obligation to  respect  the
       choice of residence of a married couple'.




   The best interests of the children
   22. We commence  by  considering   s117B  (6)  of  the  2002  Act  which
       provides:
          In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and
         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.

   23.  If  this  provision  applies  the  public  interest  in   effective
       immigration control would not require the appellant's removal.   The
       appellant is not liable to deportation.   It  was  accepted  by  the
       judge that the children would not be able, and  therefore  it  would
       not be reasonable to expect them, to leave the  United  Kingdom.  On
       that basis the second limb of the provision is met. As set out above
       we invited submissions on the meaning of 'parental relationship'. Mr
       Young invited us to consider that this included a step-parent  or  a
       person treated as a father figure. The  children  have  two  natural
       parents both of whom are involved in their upbringing. The appellant
       has not adopted the children.

   24. There is no definition in the 2002 Act or in the Interpretation  Act
       1978. Applying the literal rule of statutory interpretation  to  the
       words, the natural or ordinary meaning of parental relationship  is,
       in our view, a person  who  has  the  rights,  duties,  powers,  and
       responsibilities that a parent of a child has.  The  appellant  does
       not have any parental rights or duties in respect of the children.


   25. We have considered, but have not gained much  assistance  from,  the
       Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights: Memorandum by
       the Home Office (October 2013) which set out in relation to s117B(6)
       at para 74. 'This is self-explanatory and  is  intended  to  broadly
       reflect case law. It provides that  certain  countervailing  factors
       will not justify removal in an immigration case (it does  not  apply
       to criminals or other non-conducive deportations)'

   26.  We  have  also  considered  paragraph  6  (Interpretation)  of  the
       Immigration Rules which provides:
         'a parent' includes
         a) The stepfather of a child whose father is dead...


   27. We consider that the definition in the  Immigration  Rules  supports
       the interpretation derived from applying the  natural  and  ordinary
       meaning of the words. We do not consider that  s117B(6)  applies  to
       the appellant as he does not have a parental relationship  with  the
       children within the meaning of the 2002  Act  in  the  strict  sense
       referred to above.


   28. We turn to consider the best interests of the children applying  the
       relevant principles. In ZH (Tanzania)  v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  4  the
       Supreme Court noted that  s  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
       Immigration Act 2009 was enacted to incorporate the UK's  obligation
       under article 3(1) United Nations Convention on the  Rights  of  the
       Child that, 'In all actions concerning children, whether  undertaken
       by public or private social welfare  institutions,  courts  of  law,
       administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests
       of the child shall be a primary consideration.'

   29. The court held:
         26 'This did not mean (as it  would  do  in  other  contexts)  that
         identifying  their  best  interests  would  lead  inexorably  to  a
         decision in conformity with  those  interests.  Provided  that  the
         Tribunal did not treat any other consideration as  inherently  more
         significant than the best  interests  of  the  children,  it  could
         conclude that the strength of the other  considerations  outweighed
         them. The important thing, therefore, is  to  consider  those  best
         interests first...'
         33.     'We now have a much greater understanding of the importance
         of these issues in assessing the overall well-being of  the  child.
         In making the proportionality assessment under article 8, the  best
         interests of the child must be a primary consideration. This  means
         that they must  be  considered  first.  They  can,  of  course,  be
         outweighed by the cumulative effect  of  other  considerations.  In
         this case, the  countervailing  considerations  were  the  need  to
         maintain firm  and  fair  immigration  control,  coupled  with  the
         mother's appalling immigration history and  the  precariousness  of
         her position when family life was created.  But,  as  the  Tribunal
         rightly pointed out, the children were not to be blamed for  that.'



   30.  In JO and Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517  (IAC)
       the Upper Tribunal reviewed  the  relevant  principles  and  correct
       approach. The Tribunal set out ta paragraph 9:


         'More detailed prescription of the correct approach to  section  55
         and its interaction with Article 8 ECHR has followed.  In   Zoumbas
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 3690, the
         Supreme Court recently considered the interplay  between  the  best
         interests of the child and Article 8 ECHR, rehearsing what might be
         termed a code devised by Lord Hodge comprising seven principles:
             (1)  The best interests of a child are an integral part of the
             proportionality assessment under Article 8 ECHR;
             (2)  In making that assessment, the best interests of a  child
             must be a primary consideration, although not always the  only
             primary consideration; and the child's best interests  do  not
             of themselves have the status of the paramount consideration;
             (3)  Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed
             by the cumulative effect of  other  considerations,  no  other
             consideration can be treated as inherently more significant;
             (4)  While different judges might approach the question of the
             best interests of a child in different ways, it  is  important
             to ask oneself the right questions in  an  orderly  manner  in
             order to avoid the risk that the best  interests  of  a  child
             might be undervalued when other important considerations  were
             in play;
             (5)  It is important  to  have  a  clear  idea  of  a  child's
             circumstances and of what  is  in  a  child's  best  interests
             before one asks oneself whether those interests are outweighed
             by the force of other considerations;
             (6)  To  that  end  there  is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
             examination of all relevant factors when the  interests  of  a
             child are involved in an Article 8 assessment; and
             (7)  A child must not be blamed for matters for  which  he  or
             she is not responsible, such as the conduct of a parent.'

   31. Applying the approach set out above we take into  consideration  the
       findings of the  judge,  the  appellant's  and  his  wife's  witness
       statement and the grounds for permission to appeal.  There  are  two
       children, Dilan  and  Damal  aged  15  and  10,  who  are  from  the
       appellant's wife's former marriage. They are both British Nationals.
       The appellant started living with the children as a family  when  he
       married their mother, Elif Has, on February 2012 nearly  3  �  years
       ago (para 13 of the decision). The  children's  father  is  involved
       with the care of the children. He has them at weekends picking  them
       up on  Fridays  and  returning  them  on  Sundays  (para  15).   The
       appellant's wife's evidence, as set out in  her  witness  statements
       (para 6) is that the children love the appellant and treat him as  a
       second father, he does lots of things with them and is  involved  in
       everything in  their  lives.  The  judge  found  that  it  would  be
       unreasonable to expect the children to accompany  their  mother  and
       step father to Turkey (para 65).  There was some discrepancy in  the
       evidence with regard to the extent of  appellant's  involvement.  At
       para 8 the judge records his oral evidence  as  'he  takes  them  to
       school and picks them up'. At paragraph 13 the judge  records   that
       the appellant's wife said in evidence in chief  that  the  appellant
       takes them to school whereas at paragraph 15  the  appellant's  wife
       said, in response to questions from the Tribunal, that  she  usually
       took them to school and that the appellant sometimes picks them  up.
       It is likely that this discrepancy  led  to  the  judge  noting,  in
       paragraph 44, that the appellant 'appeared to overstate the tasks he
       performed for them'.  Notwithstanding any  discrepancies  we  accept
       that the appellant is involved in the children's lives and that they
       have formed an emotional bond with him.


   32. In terms of  the  best  interests  of  the  children  this  involves
       safeguarding and promoting the welfare  of  the  children  including
       preventing impairment of their health or development.  In this  case
       the appellant has been  involved  in  the  children's  lives  for  a
       relatively short period of time. He is not a primary carer and  does
       not have parental responsibility. The children are not dependent  on
       the appellant.  They  spend  weekends  with  their  father.  If  the
       appellant were removed the children would still have both  of  their
       parents involved in their care and  upbringing.  What  effect  would
       removal of the appellant have on the children? The effect of removal
       on the children was stated to be that:
    . 'they would be very upset if he had to leave' (para 6  WS  appellant's
      wife)
    . 'It would  be  unreasonable  and  disproportionate  to  separate  [the
      appellant] from his wife and children who  had  become  used  to  him'
      (para 23 of the First-tier Tribunal decision)
    . 'the departing even  if  it  is  for  a  short  period  the  wife  and
      children's life would be disrupted.  The  children  would  clearly  be
      upset by this change' (grounds for permission to appeal).
    . If the appellant was forced to  return  to  Turkey  it  would  destroy
      family life (appellant's WS para 3j)


   33. We have considered section 117 of the 2002 Act. Although the  public
       interest is statutorily enshrined in s117B these factors are not the
       only  factors  to  be  considered  but  they  form  a  bedrock   for
       consideration. Sufficient weight must be accorded to the public need
       for maintenance of effective immigration.


   34. In MH (Pakistan) [2011] CSOH 143 it was held that  the  respondent's
       entitlement to take into account  an  appellant's  poor  immigration
       history, the precariousness of the position when a relationship  was
       entered into and the need to maintain immigration control  were  all
       confirmed in ZH (Tanzania).

   35. Weighing in favour of removal we consider that the appellant  has  a
       very poor immigration history. He entered the UK illegally  in  2009
       and has remained unlawfully since. He attempted  to  'sort  out  his
       status' (appellant's WS para 3g) by marrying his second cousin. That
       failed when Social Services intervened to prevent the  marriage.  He
       applied for leave to remain on the basis of private/family life  but
       this was rejected by the  respondent  on  18  February  2014.  In  a
       further attempt to remain in the UK he made an  unmeritorious  claim
       for asylum in June 2014 some 5 � years after entering the UK.


   36. He entered in to a relationship with his wife at a  time  that  they
       both must have known that he was in the UK unlawfully. Little weight
       is to be accorded to  the  relationship  with  his  wife  given  the
       circumstances it was formed in. However, this cannot be held against
       the children in assessing their interests as they have no  knowledge
       of his immigration status.

   37. In weighing those factors we do  not  weigh  lightly  the  emotional
       upset that would be  caused  to  the  children  by  the  appellant's
       removal. However, we do not consider that this will have a long term
       effect on their welfare. Their best interests will  continue  to  be
       met through their relationships with  their  natural  parents.  Some
       contact can be maintained if  the  appellant  were  removed  through
       letters, electronic communications, visits etc.

   38. Having weighed all the factors set out above the  cumulative  effect
       of the factors in favour of  removal  and  the  public  interest  in
       maintenance  of  effective  immigration   controls   outweighs   the
       interests of the children. We find that the  interference  with  the
       children's Article 8 rights is proportionate to that legitimate aim.
       We find that the interference with the appellant's  and  his  wife's
       Article 8 rights is proportionate to that aim for  the  reasons  set
       out above. We find that his removal would not be disproportionate.


   Conclusions
   39. There was a material error of law such  that  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


   40. We have decided to re-make the decision with the preserved findings.
       We dismiss the appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse to
       give the appellant leave to remain on the grounds  that  his  rights
       under article 8 would be infringed.

   41. We have considered whether any parties require the protection of  an
       anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously.
       Having considered all the  circumstances  and  evidence  we  do  not
       consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
   Notice of Decision
