                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal arises by way of relisting in  accordance  with  directions
    given by DUTJ French on 3rd November 2014, when he heard the appeal  of
    the Secretary of State (who will be referred to as  the  Respondent  as
    she was before the First-tier Tribunal) against  the  decision  of  FTJ
    Obhi, when she allowed the  appeal  of  Muhammad  Saqib  (who  will  be
    referred to as the Appellant as he was before the First-tier Tribunal).



 2. Muhammad Saqib had appealed against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State  to  refuse  to  vary  his  leave  in  the  capacity  of  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant and to remove him under Section 47 of  the  IANA
    2006.  His appeal was determined by Judge Obhi on  23rd  May  2014  and
    allowed.  The Secretary of State appealed that decision, and permission
    was granted by Judge Molloy on 17th June 2014.

 3. Judge Obhi made her findings at paragraphs 15 to 17  inclusive  of  her
    determination.  At paragraph 16, as DUTJ French makes clear, Judge Obhi
    commented that

         "The Appellant had in fact done little more than form the idea that
         running the business was what he wanted to do but he  had  not  yet
         taken steps by way of advertising or setting up a website  and  had
         clearly not yet received  any  interest  in  the  business".   (See
         paragraph 2 of Judge French's determination).

 4. At paragraph 17 Judge Obhi had stated that, "there has  to  be  genuine
    concern about whether the Appellant intends to set up his  business  or
    not, ...".  The judge  went  on  to  say  that,  "he  clearly  has  not
    undertaken sufficient research into the business that he intends to run
    nor has he tested the waters by putting out adverts or  trying  to  see
    what interest there would be.  He has based a lot of  research  on  the
    internet ...".

 5. What appears to have swayed the judge at that time was that,  "however,
    he comes from a background of a family that runs a  courier  business".
    This led the judge to conclude that,

         "The fact that he has taken the trouble to secure funding  for  the
         business is an indication that he will set it up.  I  also  do  not
         think that the financial institution would have agreed to lend  him
         a substantial sum unless it had some faith in  his  proposal  ...".
         (See paragraph 2 of Judge French's determination).

 6. Judge French went on to conclude that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    Judge  Obhi,  "clearly  had  substantial  misgivings   concerning   the
    Appellant's ability to  actually  set  up  this  business,  stating  at
    paragraph 15 that he had done little more than form the idea that  that
    was what he wanted to do".  Judge French then  went  on  to  say  that,
    "there had to be a genuine concern about whether the Appellant intended
    to set up his business or not".

 7. This is because, "the fact that the points  had  been  awarded  by  the
    Secretary of State did not in itself answer the question of whether the
    Appellant intended and was able to establish the  business  within  six
    months".  This was important because

         "Under the Rules  that  is  a  specific  requirement  at  paragraph
         244DD(h)(i) that there must be an intention to set up the  business
         within six months.  The judge failed to  make  a  finding  on  that
         issue.  Indeed, the fact that she went on to say that his  business
         plan required a lot more effort might be seen as an indication that
         he would not be in a position to be able to  set  up  the  business
         within six months.  The  issue  however  is  unclear  and  requires
         clarification" (paragraph 7).

 8. It was in these circumstances that the judge went on to say that  there
    would have to be a further hearing "at which  the  Appellant  may  give
    oral evidence" because Judge Obhi's findings were unclear "and arguably
    contradictory in certain respects" (paragraph 8).

 9. Judge French then gave directions that the matter was  to  be  relisted
    before the Upper Tribunal before the decision could be remade and  that
    both parties are to serve upon the Tribunal  and  upon  each  other  at
    least ten days  before  the  resumed  hearing  copies  of  any  further
    documents.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 10th April 2015 there was no attendance  by
    the Appellant.  Instead, the clerk, Mr  Bowen,  turned  up  to  say  at
    lunchtime that, before the hearing at 2 p.m., he had had  the  occasion
    to speak with a first cousin of the Appellant, who had turned up at the
    Tribunal to say that  the  Appellant  had  yesterday  been  taken  into
    hospital with serious chest pains to the heart, and he would not be  in
    a position to attend.  I indicated to Mr Bowen, the court  clerk,  that
    he must immediately take back the message to the alleged first  cousin,
    to explain to him that unless there was something in  writing  to  this
    effect, I would not entertain an application for an adjournment, for  a
    hearing of which due notice had been  given  in  a  timeous  and  clear
    fashion.  Mr Bowen took the message back.  However, the  alleged  first
    cousin was then nowhere to be seen in the vicinity of the courtroom.  I
    delayed beginning my hearings for the  afternoon.   At  2.15,  with  no
    other matter in the list for the afternoon, I began this  hearing,  and
    at 2.30 p.m. Mr Bowen undertook to return to the waiting room to see if
    the alleged first cousin was still there.  There was  no  trace  to  be
    found of him and so the hearing continued.

11. The Overriding Objective requires the Tribunal  to  deal  with  matters
    fairly and justly.  The parties are requires to assist the Tribunal  in
    achieving that objective.  There was no application for an  adjournment
    before me. Had it materialised I would have expected it to be backed up
    by proper medical evidence.

12. Mr Smart, in his submissions on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    referred to the 61 page bundle which was the new document  before  this
    Tribunal.   It  was  not  clear  who  had  sent  this.   There  was  no
    solicitors' covering letter attached to it.  On the other hand, it  was
    an identical bundle to the one that was before the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  Mr Smart submitted that it was well-known to the Appellant that
    there were issues upon which evidence was required, and  such  evidence
    could have been properly submitted to deal with the issues in question.
     It had not been submitted.

13. What was clear was that there was no proper business plan submitted  by
    the Appellant at all with respect to his  application.   There  was  no
    cost analysis.  At page 60 of the latest 61 page bundle,  there  was  a
    "business plan" and this referred  to  Cargo  Services  to  "lease  two
    Transit type vans".  At the end there was a reference to  a  multi-year
    profit and loss account.  At page 60 there was a list  of  depreciation
    on the vans of ï¿½500.  It was not clear why  there  was  this  reference
    because on page 54 the business plan refers to the first  objective  of
    the Appellant being to "lease two medium size Transit type vans", which
    meant  that  if  he  was  leasing  out  vans,  there  would  not  be  a
    depreciation on the vans included in the analysis.

14. The whole plan was "fanciful", in the words of Mr Smart.  It was  clear
    that there was no possibility of the Appellant being able to succeed in
    the business plan within six months of its submission.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, Mr Obhi, clearly had very  substantial  doubts  already
    (set out at paragraphs 15 to 17 of her determination),  where  she  had
    made it clear that the plan would "require a lot more effort",  and  it
    was clear that it was simply not a credible and feasible  plan.   Given
    that the Appellant had not furnished any evidence  today,  and  nothing
    from his  solicitors  had  been  forthcoming,  this  appeal  could  not
    succeed.

15. After the hearing ended, and at 3.10 p.m.,  Mr  Bowen  returned  to  my
    chambers room with a couple of documents, which he maintained had  been
    handed to him by the first cousin who had apparently returned  back  to
    the building with these documents later on in  the  afternoon.   First,
    there was a letter from Osmans (Solicitors), dated 9th April 2015,  and
    this stated that "we are instructed by our client that he was  admitted
    to hospital following severe chest pains.   Mr  Saqib  is  required  to
    undergo an Echo test as the chronic  pain  had  lasted  for  over  four
    hours.  His troponins were raised to 22".

16. Given what is said, however, and given the manner in which it is  said,
    it is surprising then to read the next paragraph which states,

         "Mr Saqib was discharged from hospital and a letter confirming this
         is attached.  However, since his discharge,  Mr  Saqib  experienced
         localised pain in his chest, which last night became fairly  severe
         following a bout of dizziness.  Mr Saqib has been advised  to  take
         complete bed rest until 15th April 2015".

    It is not at all clear what the medical basis for this advice  is  that
    he should have complete bed rest  until  15th  April  2015.   There  is
    certainly a "statement of fitness  for  work  for  social  security  or
    statutory sick pay" purposes, which refers to "chest  pain,  dizziness,
    advised rest", but the "comments" section is  left  incomplete  by  the
    relevant medical practitioner.  Very little is given by way  of  detail
    as to why the Appellant cannot attend this hearing.  The  document,  as
    it stands, is for a "statement of fitness for work".  The Appellant  is
    not coming to  work  in  coming  to  this  hearing  to  give  evidence.
    Nevertheless, Osmans Solicitors then continued  to  say  that,  "it  is
    clear to those instructed that Mr Saqib is not physically fit to attend
    the hearing scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. where his  evidence  would
    be crucial to the outcome of his case".  Osmans Solicitors then  go  on
    to say that, "in the light of the above  we  request  that  the  matter
    listed for hearing tomorrow be adjourned in the  interests  of  justice
    for at least three weeks".

17. What is much more plausible and credible, however, is the  letter  from
    University  Hospitals  Birmingham,  dated  5th  April  2015,  which  is
    addressed to Dr B. Ahmed, which refers to the diagnosis as "chest  pain
    ? related to supplement".  It is unclear why a hospital,  such  as  the
    University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust,  should  insert  a  question
    mark in relation to an alleged claim of "chest pain?".

18. In any event, nothing excuses or explains away the  fact  that  written
    evidence was  required  of  a  plausible  nature  confirming  that  the
    Appellant would be able to set up business  within  six  months.   This
    evidence is not before this Tribunal.  The  Appellant  himself  is  not
    before this Tribunal.  There is nothing in the latest medical evidence,
    which comes from the Newport  Medical  Group,  in  Birmingham,  and  is
    significantly 'unsigned' in the box made available for  the  doctor  in
    charge, that states that  this  Appellant  is  unable  to  attend  this
    hearing to give evidence.

19. The entire matter  is  deeply  suspicious  and,  I  conclude,  entirely
    contrived, to prevent the Tribunal considering the essential  issue  at
    hand, namely, that this was a business plan which  was  viable  to  the
    extent that it would have led to this Appellant being in a position  to
    set  up  his  business  within  six  months.   I  have  no  hesitation,
    accordingly, in dismissing this appeal.  I consider it to  be  entirely
    devoid of all merit.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision.
    I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is dismissed.

21. No anonymity order is made.
