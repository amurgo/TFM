 For the Appellant:    Mr A Vanas, legal representative, Visa Inn
 For the Respondent:   Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ Cockrill, promulgated  on
     3 August 2015.
























                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016





     Background


  2. The first appellant was granted limited  leave  to  enter  the  United
     Kingdom as a Tier 4 migrant from 11 April 2009 until 31 July 2010. His
     leave was extended as a student and a Tier 1 Post-study  Worker  until
     14 August 2014. The second appellant was granted leave  to  enter  the
     United Kingdom as a Tier 1 dependent partner until 14 August 2014.  On
     14 August 2014 the appellants sought further  leave  to  remain  under
     Tier 4 of the Rules. Their applications were refused  on  26  November
     2014 as the first appellant had not provided a valid  Confirmation  of
     Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and  the  second  appellant  was  refused
     further leave in line.


  3. In the grounds of appeal, it was said that  the  first  appellant  had
     tried his level best to submit a CAS without success and reference was
     made to the appellants' rights under Article  8  ECHR  on  account  of
     their private lives. Specifically, the appellants were  requesting  60
     days leave to find a new Tier 4 sponsor.

     The hearing before the FTTJ


  4. Neither appellant attended the hearing, which took place  on  10  July
     2015. The FTTJ had sight of a GP's letter dated  7  July  2015,  which
     stated that the first appellant had low back pain and had been advised
     to have complete bed  rest  for  two  weeks.  The  representative  who
     attended on the appellants' behalves was instructed only  to  seek  an
     adjournment.  The  FTTJ  refused  the  adjournment  request  and   the
     appellants'  representative  then  withdrew.  The  FTTJ  proceeded  to
     dismiss both appeals under the Immigration Rules owing to the  absence
     of a CAS.



      Error of law


    5. The grounds of appeal argue that the FTTJ failed to consider  Article
       8; that there were compelling circumstances; that the first appellant
       was a genuine  student;  that  the  appellants  had  integrated  with
       British society; that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to
       their integration in Bangladesh because the first appellant  had  not
       finished his degree, he had spent a significant amount  of  time  and
       money on his studies and the appellants  had  two  children  who  had
       recently been born in the United Kingdom.

    6. FTTJ Grimmett granted permission, finding there  to  be  an  arguable
       error of law for the FTTJ not to consider the appellants'  Article  8
       claim which was raised in their notices of appeal.

    7. The Secretary of State did not serve a Rule 24 response.










 The hearing


  8. Mr Vanas advised me that he had been instructed after  the  First-tier
     Tribunal  hearing.  He  complained  that  neither  of   the   previous
     representatives had served witness statements or any evidence from the
     appellants on the Tribunal.

  9. Mr Vanas further complained about the previous Tier 4 sponsor, BPP, at
     length and  referred  to  evidence,  which  he  recently  obtained  in
     relation to  how  unfairly  he  considered  the  first  appellant  was
     treated. He had sought this evidence on 27 December  2015,  over  five
     months after the hearing before the FTTJ. Ultimately, he conceded that
     none of this evidence was before the FTTJ  and  he  accepted  that  he
     could not say the FTTJ had erred in  refusing  the  appeal  under  the
     Rules on the basis that there was no CAS.  Mr Vanas also accepted that
     the grounds did not include a claim that  the  FTTJ  had  fallen  into
     procedural error in refusing to adjourn the appeals  and  he  made  no
     application to amend the grounds to include this matter.

 10. Mr Tufan emphasised that permission to appeal was granted on the basis
     of the failure of the FTTJ to consider Article 8, not in  relation  to
     the issue of the CAS or  whether  the  appellants  could  satisfy  the
     requirements of the Rules. The notice of appeal referred to Article  8
     but no particulars were provided.  While  a  judge  should  ordinarily
     address Article 8, it was clear from the evidence before the  FTTJ  in
     this case that human rights were  not  engaged.  Otherwise,  Mr  Tufan
     relied on paragraph 57 of Patel & Others v SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72  and
     urged me to note that the appellants had a clear remedy, in that  they
     could return to Bangladesh voluntarily and  obtain  a  new  CAS.  With
     regard to the appellant's children, he asked  me  to  note  that  this
     issue was not brought to the attention of the FTTJ.

 11. In response, Mr Vanas argued that the  appellants  did  not  have  the
     opportunity to have their case heard in the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He
     accepted that they had not mentioned the matter of their twins in  the
     notice of appeal.

Decision on Error of Law


 12. The only issue before me was whether the FTTJ erred in not making  any
     Article 8 findings. In appealing  the  refusal  of  further  leave  to
     remain,  the  appellants'  previous  representatives,  namely   Legend
     Solicitors, drafted grounds of appeal on their behalf.  Those  grounds
     amounted to 18 paragraphs, which ended with the statement; "Hence  the
     appellant is requesting for 60 days to find a  new  Tier  4  sponsor."
     While the grounds included reference  to  Article  8  ECHR,  only  the
     following was said, "Appellant has built up social ties in the UK;  he
     has also build up private life in the UK during his period  of  stay."
     No further particulars of this private life were provided.

 13. In Patel, the following was said; "The  opportunity  for  a  promising
     student to complete his course in this country, however  desirable  in
     general terms, is not in itself a right protected under article 8." In
     these circumstances, I find that had  the  FTTJ  considered  the  bare
     assertion made in the grounds of appeal, the Article 8 case would have
     been  dismissed  on  the  basis  that  Article  8  was  not   engaged.
     Accordingly, the FTTJ's failure




     to address the Article 8 grounds before him, while an error, is not  a
     material error of law.

 14. Visa  Inn  immigration  specialists  sent  a  bundle  of  material  by
     facsimile to the Upper Tribunal on 18  January  2016.  The  appellants
     have produced photocopied birth  certificates,  which  show  that  the
     second  appellant  gave  birth  to   twins   on   25   January   2014.
     Notwithstanding that these children were born around 18  months  prior
     to the hearing, this issue was never put to the FTTJ.

 15. I also note that the appellants made no application for their twins to
     have leave to remain in the United Kingdom; there is no mention of the
     twins in the Tier 4 applications and no mention of them in the grounds
     of appeal. The FTTJ cannot be criticised for not considering an issue,
     which was never before him. However even had the FTTJ  been  aware  of
     the existence of these children,  given  that  neither  appellant  has
     leave to remain in the United Kingdom, that the children  are  neither
     British nor settled here and that they would have been very  young  at
     the date of the hearing, even had the FTTJ considered the  appellants'
     family life with their children, he was bound to conclude  that  there
     would be no interference with that family life caused by  the  removal
     of the family of a whole to Bangladesh. It is of course  open  to  the
     appellants to make a human rights application should they wish  to  do
     so in which the best interests of their children can be considered  in
     detail.


Conclusion


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I uphold the decision of the FTTJ.


No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and I am aware of no reasons
for making such a direction now.
