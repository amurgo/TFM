Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms B Smith (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against a  decision  to  refuse  his  protection
    claim was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert ("the  judge")
    in a decision promulgated on 27th March 2017.  The judge accepted  that
    the appellant was the victim of assaults in 2009  and  2010  but  found
    that they did not reach the level of seriousness  required  to  warrant
    international protection.  He also found that the appellant would  have
    available a sufficiency of protection  in  India.   A  risk  assessment
    prepared by an expert instructed on the appellant's behalf did not have
    significant weight, nor did the concerns of  a  representative  of  the
    Shugden community with which the appellant is associated,  because  the
    report did not address the credibility of the appellant, in the judge's
    view.

2.   An application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  made  and  permission
    granted by an Upper Tribunal Judge, sitting as a Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, on 27th July 2017.  It was arguable that the  judge  did
    not fully engage with the evidence  of  the  expert  or  witnesses,  in
    relation to the appellant's claim to be at risk in India because of his
    prominent role in  the  Shugden  community.   In  a  rule  24  response
    prepared by the Secretary of State on 17th August 2017, the appeal  was
    opposed on the basis that it was open to the judge to conclude that the
    appellant did not need international protection.

Submissions on Error of Law

3.   Ms Smith relied on the written grounds.  The first and third  concerned
    a lack of reasoning regarding key aspects of the appeal.  The judge did
    engage with parts of the case, including a letter containing  a  threat
    against the appellant.  The judge recorded the evidence, at  paragraphs
    13 and 14 of the decision.  However, there were no findings made by the
    judge regarding whether this evidence was accepted or not.  This was  a
    serious factor which had been overlooked.  In this part of the case,  a
    witness referred to communication with the appellant before he came  to
    the United Kingdom and to the position of Tibetans  under  the  Central
    Tibetan Administration, in Dharamsala in India.  Her evidence that  the
    appellant might be prosecuted for possessing illegal documents relating
    to his birth was not assessed by the judge.

4.   In paragraphs 25 to 27 of the  decision,  the  judge  referred  to  the
    country evidence before the Tribunal.  Part of this  evidence  included
    the report from the expert, Professor Aguilar.  At paragraph  30  there
    was a brief finding by the judge that it did not have "any  significant
    weight" as it did not address the credibility  of  the  appellant.   At
    paragraph 28, however, the judge accepted  that  the  appellant  had  a
    prominent role in  the  Shugden  organisation.   It  was  difficult  to
    reconcile the two parts of the assessment as Professor Aguilar had been
    clear in his report that the  police  in  India  were  not  willing  to
    protect members of the Shugden community.  This  made  the  appellant's
    fianc�e's evidence all the more important because  she  referred  to  a
    threat made at a meeting in London.  Again, the judge  did  not  assess
    these aspects.  The evidence from the appellant's witness, his fianc�e,
    did not feature in the analysis from paragraph 28 onwards.   There  was
    no mention of the  fianc�e's  evidence  or  any  consideration  of  the
    consistency of that evidence with the threatening letter  sent  to  the
    appellant.

5.   Mr Walker relied upon the rule 24 response.  The judge  considered  the
    evidence, drawing out some  parts  of  the  expert's  evidence,  albeit
    briefly.  At paragraph 29 of the decision, he rejected the  claim  that
    the appellant received a threatening  letter  and  concluded  that  the
    document was produced to support the asylum  claim.   Though  paragraph
    30, containing the conclusion that the report  of  the  expert  had  no
    significant weight, was brief, it was clear that the  judge  considered
    the evidence.  It was perhaps unfortunate that the  judge  did  not  go
    into more detail but the Secretary of State's stance was  that  he  had
    done enough to reach a conclusion that the appeal fell to be dismissed.



Conclusion on Error of Law

6.   The decision is succinct, as one  might  expect  from  the  experienced
    judge who prepared it.  However, I accept Ms  Smith's  submission  that
    the findings at paragraphs 28 to 33 are a little too brief and  do  not
    show engagement with material parts of the evidence.

7.   First,  the  appellant  relied  upon  a  witness,  his  fianc�e,  whose
    evidence was summarised by the judge at paragraphs  13  and  14.   This
    evidence was, at first sight,  consistent  with  the  appellant's  core
    claim to be at risk on  return  and  to  have  received  a  threatening
    letter.  The evidence given by this witness  does  not  appear  in  the
    judge's reasoning or his overall assessment.  The  appellant's  fianc�e
    is mentioned in paragraph 28, but in the  context  of  the  appellant's
    answer in his asylum interview regarding his reason for coming  to  the
    United Kingdom.  The content of her evidence is not mentioned.

8.   So far as the country expert is concerned, the judge  reached  a  clear
    conclusion at  paragraph  30  that  this  evidence  did  not  have  any
    significant weight, at least  as  regards  risk  on  return  to  India.
    However, at paragraph 18 of Professor  Aguilar's  report,  there  is  a
    finding that  the  appellant  has  a  prominent  role  in  the  Shugden
    community, having acted as general secretary and as president  of  part
    of the community, amounting in all  to  "prominent  roles  within  this
    movement", in Professor Aguilar's view.  At paragraph 21  of  the  same
    report, Professor Aguilar concludes that the police in  India  are  not
    willing to protect members of the Shugden community  and  would  choose
    instead to rely on the authority of the Central Tibetan Administration.
     It is difficult to reconcile this part of the expert's report with the
    conclusion at paragraph 30 that the appellant would  have  available  a
    sufficiency of protection from the security forces in India.  The clear
    findings made by Professor Aguilar required analysis.

9.   In these circumstances, I conclude that the  failure  to  show  in  the
    decision that there has been full engagement with the evidence given by
    the appellant's witness and by the country expert amounts to a material
    error of law, such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

10.  In a brief discussions, Ms Smith said that there might be  a  need  for
    further country evidence and Mr Walker suggested that the proper  venue
    for remaking the decision is the First-tier Tribunal, given the  extent
    of the fact-finding required.  I agree.  The decision will be remade in
    the First-tier Tribunal, before a judge other than Judge Herbert.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  It will be remade  in
the First-tier Tribunal, before  a  judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Herbert.






Signed                                  Date 22 December 2017

ANONYMITY

The judge did not make an  anonymity  direction  or  order.   Neither  party
suggested that anonymity  was  required.   However,  this  is  a  protection
appeal.  In these circumstances, I make an order prohibiting the  disclosure
or publication of any matter  likely  to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify  the  appellant.   This  order  will  remain  in  force  until  the
conclusion of the proceedings or until it is set  aside  (or  varied)  by  a
court or Tribunal.
