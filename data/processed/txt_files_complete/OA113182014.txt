Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr R Ahmed, instructed by Immigration Advice Service
For the respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Nargis Mohammadi, date of birth 15.10.88, is  a  citizen
    of Afghanistan.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Carlin promulgated 1.5.15, dismissing on all grounds her appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 21.8.14,  to  refuse  her
    application for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  a  partner,
    pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard  the
    appeal on 27.3.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.7.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek granted permission to appeal.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I found such error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Carlin to be set aside and remade by allowing the appeal.

 6. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Kopieczek  considered  it
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made the assessment of  the
    genuineness of the relationship on the basis  of  personal  assumptions
    about what level of contact, etc., he would expect to see.

 7. Despite granting permission, Judge  Kopieczek  stated,  "the  appellant
    will have to counter the argument that the grounds in fact amount to no
    more than a disagreement with the judge's assessment of the  evidence."
    This was also the thrust of Mr Mills' submissions, reflecting the  Rule
    24 reply dated 15.9.15, which stated, "The grounds have  no  merit  and
    merely disagree with the adverse  outcome  of  the  appeal.  The  Judge
    considered all the evidence that was available to him  and  came  to  a
    conclusion open to him based on that evidence and the rules,  based  on
    the balance of probability and does not disclose any error."

 8. At �19 of the decision the judge relied on the fact that there had been
    only one visit by the sponsor to the appellant since their marriage and
    month together in  Afghanistan  in  2012  as  an  indication  that  the
    relationship was not genuine and subsisting.  The  judge  rejected  his
    explanation that he did not make more visits because he was afraid that
    he might lose his employment. The judge pointed out that  Mr  Mohammadi
    was in full-time employment  from  October  2013  and  would  have  had
    sufficient vacation time to make a visit. However, it is submitted that
    the judge failed to take into account the sponsor's  witness  statement
    at A1,  which  explained  the  delay  in  making  the  entry  clearance
    application was because of the need to meet the financial  requirements
    of Appendix FM. As a taxi driver he had to show 12 months earnings  and
    this would be difficult to accomplish if he spent time outside the  UK.
    I am not satisfied, however, that this demonstrates any error  of  law.
    The judge was entitled to take into account as part of  the  assessment
    of the evidence as a whole that there had been  only  one  visit  since
    2012.

 9. Although he had somewhat of an uphill struggle, I find  that  Mr  Ahmed
    very carefully demonstrate that the remaining grounds were more than  a
    mere disagreement with the outcome of the appeal. He first pointed  out
    all the factors that the judge found in favour of the appellant, as set
    out under the heading of 'Findings of Fact,' between �5 and �11 of  the
    decision, including that they had lived  together  after  marriage  and
    that the sponsor had returned to Afghanistan once since the marriage.

10. In particular, my attention was drawn to �10 the judge  stated,  "Since
    they were married, the appellant and Mr Mohammadi have kept in  contact
    by telephone. They generally speak over  the  telephone  two  or  three
    times per week." This was not a submission but a finding of fact.

11. Despite that finding, however, at �18 the judge took the view  that  if
    the relationship had  been  genuine  and  subsisting  he,  "would  have
    expected there to be more frequent  telephone  calls,"  and  concluded,
    "the appellant had not satisfied me  to  the  requisite  standard  that
    there had been the frequent contact by telephone that  I  would  expect
    between a married couple such as the appellant and Mr Mohammadi."

12. After detailing other evidence of contact, at �23 the judge stated that
    the contact between the appellant and the sponsor, "was what  might  be
    expected of reasonably close friends or relatives. It was not the  type
    of contact, given the nature and frequency, that might be  expected  of
    husband and wife."

13. Mr Mills sought to suggest that �10 was not a finding  of  fact  but  a
    summary of the appellant's submissions, but accepted that if it were  a
    finding of fact it would be difficult to justify the judge's conclusion
    on the issue of frequency of contact.

14. Whilst the judge was entitled and indeed required to make an assessment
    on the  evidence  as  to  whether  the  relationship  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, it appears that the judge adopted  a  highly  personal  and
    therefore subjective view or assumption as to how frequently a  married
    couple in such circumstances should speak by telephone  or  make  other
    contact. The judge does not explain why telephoning two or three  times
    a week was insufficient, or what  frequency,  in  his  view,  would  be
    sufficient to demonstrate a genuine and  subsisting  relationship,  and
    why. In this respect, I accept the submission  of  Mr  Ahmed  that  the
    judge's approach was misconceived and in  fact  inconsistent  with  the
    findings of fact. In the circumstances, I find the decision flawed  for
    error of law.

15. In remaking the decision, it requires nothing more than to refer to the
    findings of fact set out between �5 and �11 of the decision.  On  those
    findings alone, there is more than ample evidence to demonstrate on the
    balance  of  probabilities  that  this  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.
