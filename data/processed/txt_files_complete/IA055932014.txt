Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr D Adams, instructed by TW Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Victoria Omobolanle Hussain, date of birth 30.12.82,  is
    a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Lal promulgated on 1.8.14, who dismissed her appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 6.1.14,  to  refuse  her  application
    made on 16.10.12 for an EEA derivative residence card  entry  clearance
    pursuant to regulation 15A of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006,
    as amended.  The Judge heard the appeal on 30.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission to appeal on 19.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 29.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lal should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal is that the appellant lives  with
    her three children and Mr Gbeminija Ayeni, a British citizen,  and  the
    father of the appellant's child Queen  Comfort  Ayeni,  date  of  birth
    18.5.09, a British citizen by reason of her  father's  nationality.  In
    2012 the appellant changed her name from Evy  Sophie  Ayeni,  the  same
    surname as Mr  Ayeni.  For  an  offence  of  making  a  false  identity
    document, Mr Ayeni was sentenced to 42 months imprisonment on  8.11.11.
    Taking into account he served 221 days on remand prior to sentence,  he
    was released on licence on 21.8.12  and  continues  to  live  with  the
    appellant.

 7. The application was refused on two grounds: (a) that the appellant  has
    failed to demonstrate that the child would be unable to remain  in  the
    UK if the appellant were forced to leave; and (b)  that  the  appellant
    failed to prove that she is the child's primary carer.

 8. Judge Lal found that the appellant had failed to demonstrate  that  she
    was the child's primary carer as defined by the regulations. The  judge
    found that the family lived together as a family unit and rejected  the
    claim that he did nothing, noting that at the hearing  he  was  looking
    after the children. The judge considered but placed  little  weight  on
    the documents submitted in support of the contention that the appellant
    was the primary carer, noting that it would not be unusual for a school
    to have one parent as the primary contact. The appeal was dismissed.

 9. In essence, the grounds complain that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to give adequate consideration to the totality of the  evidence,
    including the school letter, the surgery letter,  and  other  documents
    purporting to confirm that the appellant is the primary  carer  of  the
    child. It is also submitted that the judge made no reference at all  to
    the probation service letter, dated 29.7.14, confirming details  of  Mr
    Ayeni's licence following release from custody. It  is  submitted  that
    the circumstances render Mr Ayeni an unsuitable person to be a  primary
    carer.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Page considered that, as  there
    is no reference to the probation service evidence in the determination,
    it is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error of law.



11. For the reasons set out herein, I find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not make an error of law and that there is no merit  in  this
    appeal.

12. The relevant provisions of the regulations are as follows:
          "15A.  Derivative right of residence
         (1) A person ("P") who is not entitled to reside in the United
         Kingdom as a result of any other provision of these Regulations and
         who satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5) of
         this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to reside in the
         United Kingdom for as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.
         (2) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
             (a) P is the primary carer of an EEA national ("the relevant
             EEA national"); and
             (b) the relevant EEA national-
                  (i)
                  is under the age of 18;
                  (ii)
                  is residing in the United Kingdom as a self-sufficient
                  person; and
                  (iii)
         would be unable to remain in the United Kingdom if P were required
         to leave.
         (3) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
             (a) P is the child of an EEA national ("the EEA national
             parent");
             (b) P resided in the United Kingdom at a time when the EEA
             national parent was residing in the United Kingdom as a
             worker; and
             (c) P is in education in the United Kingdom and was in
             education there at a time when the EEA national parent was in
             the United Kingdom.
         (4) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
             (a) P is the primary carer of a person meeting the criteria in
             paragraph (3) ("the relevant person"); and
             (b) the relevant person would be unable to continue to be
             educated in the United Kingdom if P were required to leave.
         (5) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
             (a) P is under the age of 18;
             (b) P's primary carer is entitled to a derivative right to
             reside in the United Kingdom by virtue of paragraph (2) or
             (4);
             (c) P does not have leave to enter, or remain in, the United
             Kingdom; and
             (d) requiring P to leave the United Kingdom would prevent P's
             primary carer from residing in the United Kingdom.
         (6) For the purpose of this regulation-
             (a) "education" excludes nursery education; and
             (b) "worker" does not include a jobseeker or a person who
             falls to be regarded as a worker by virtue of regulation 6(2).
         (7) P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if
             (a) P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person;
             and
             (b) P-
                  (i) is the person who has primary responsibility for that
                  person's care; or
                  (ii) shares equally the responsibility for that person's
                  care with one other person who is not entitled to reside
                  in the United Kingdom as a result of any other provision
                  of these Regulations and who does not have leave to enter
                  or remain.
         (8) P will not be regarded as having responsibility for a person's
         care for the purpose of paragraph (7) on the sole basis of a
         financial contribution towards that person's care.
         (9) A person who otherwise satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2),
         (3), (4) or (5) will not be entitled to a derivative right to
         reside in the United Kingdom where the Secretary of State has made
         a decision under regulation 19(3)(b), 20(1) or 20A(1)."

13. The appellant's case was that she was the primary  carer  and  that  Mr
    Ayeni did absolutely nothing when he came home from his part-time work.
    She relied on a letter from the school and one from her GP  surgery  as
    evidence that she and not Mr Ayeni is the primary carer. Neither letter
    demonstrates any such thing. The school record that  the  appellant  is
    the primary carer is not determinative. In any event, I note the school
    states that they have had no dealings with either parent.  The  surgery
    letter merely  states  that  they  have  no  record  showing  Mr  Ayeni
    accompanying the child on visits to the surgery. Another document  from
    the London Early Years Foundation has  no  relevance  as  it  is  dated
    28.5.12, several months before the application in October 2012.

14. In her statement dated 23.7.14 the appellant claims that  at  the  time
    she made her application Mr Ayeni was in prison. That is not  accurate.
    He was released on 21.8.12 and her application was  made  on  16.10.12,
    some two months later. Mr Adams seems to have been unaware of this when
    he submitted to me that he was in jail and could  not  look  after  the
    child. The truth was he had rejoined the family unit.

15. Having taken into account  the  documentary  evidence,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge made a finding of fact that the appellant and  Mr  Ayeni
    live together with the children as  a  family  unit  and  rejected  the
    submission that he made no  contribution.  In  the  circumstances,  the
    judge was not satisfied that the appellant is the primary carer of  the
    child. That was a conclusion to which the judge was entitled  to  come,
    and for which cogent reasons have been given. Mr Ayeni  was  an  exempt
    person under the regulations  and  thus  if  she  shares  the  parental
    responsibility equally with him, she is not the primary carer.

16. Although there is no reference in the determination to the letter  from
    the probation service, I fail to see how that would or could change the
    outcome of the determination. In addition to demonstrating that she  is
    the primary carer, the appellant also has to prove that the child would
    be unable to reside in the UK or another EEA state if she were required
    to leave.

17. The evidence produced to the First-tier Tribunal does not support that.
    Mr Ayeni is the father of the child and a British citizen.  Neither  he
    nor the child can be required to leave the UK. There  is  no  practical
    reason demonstrated in the evidence why he cannot look after the  child
    if the appellant is required to leave.

18. It is important to point out that this assessment does not require  the
    appellant to leave; it is merely an assessment as to whether she has  a
    derivative right of residence in the UK because she needs to be present
    to look after the child. That  Mr  Ayeni  may  be  subject  to  licence
    following his sentence, which in  any  event  is  now  likely  to  have
    expired, does not render him unable to look after the child. To  follow
    that logic all ex-felons would be unsuitable to  look  after  children.
    That cannot be right. I note from �5  of  the  determination  that  the
    appellant has also criminal convictions for identity offences.  On  the
    basis of Mr Adams' submission, she too would be unsuitable  to  be  the
    child's primary carer.

19. Mr Whitwell referred me to Hines v LB  Lambeth  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  660,
    where the Court of Appeal considered the issue of the  welfare  of  the
    child in relation to regulation 15A(4A(c). It stated that the  reviewer
    has to consider the welfare of the British citizen child and the extent
    to which the quality or standard of his life will be  impaired  if  the
    non-EU citizen is required to leave. It is said that to all intents and
    purposes this is answering the question as to whether the child  would,
    as a matter of practicality, be unable to remain in the UK if the  non-
    EU citizen were required to leave. It  was  suggested  that  placing  a
    child in foster care would so impair the life  of  the  child  that  it
    equated to being compelling to leave. Lord Justice Voss stated,  "I  do
    not, however, think that all things being equal the removal of a  child
    from the care  of  one  responsible  parent  to  the  care  of  another
    responsible parent would normally be expected to so seriously to impair
    his quality and standard of life that he would be effectively forced to
    leave the UK."

20. The regulations contain no requirement of suitability and there  is  no
    evidence that Mr Ayeni is unsuitable to look after a child, even though
    that is a term used in the Secretary of  State's  European  Operational
    Policy Team's guidance document dated 12.12.12. There reference is made
    by way of example of  unsuitability  to  child  protection  issues,  or
    because of a particular conviction would prevent the child being placed
    with him, or mental or physical disabilities  that  would  prevent  him
    from caring for the child. That he simply states he doesn't want to  is
    insufficient, neither are a lack of financial resources.

21. The appellant does not need to be present in the UK to enable the child
    to remain, or in the way  it  is  expressed  in  the  regulations,  the
    appellant has failed to demonstrate that the child would be  unable  to
    reside in the UK or in another EEA state if the appellant were required
    to leave. I find no evidence to suggest that Mr Ayeni would  not  be  a
    responsible parent. It is clear that he could look after the child  and
    clearly has demonstrated his support for the appellant by looking after
    the children  whilst  they  were  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
    hearing. The onus is on the appellant to demonstrate that  her  removal
    would effectively force the child to also leave to be able to  continue
    to be cared for. It is clear the appellant  failed  to  discharge  that
    burden.

22. In the circumstances, it is clear that the decision of the Secretary of
    State was correct and the judge was right to dismiss the appeal on  the
    evidence before her.

23. The grounds also alleged that the judge failed to  consider  article  8
    ECHR. However, article 8 does  not  arise,  as  there  was  no  removal
    decision. The status quo continues. As the refusal decision  explained,
    in the event of the Secretary of  State  taking  steps  to  remove  the
    appellant she will have a separate opportunity to make  representations
    at that stage. Mr Adams sought to rely on JM (Liberia) [2006] EWCA  Civ
    1402, to suggest that once it is raised the  Tribunal  is  required  to
    address  an  article  8  issue.  However,  that  case  turned  on   the
    interpretation of section 84(g) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, which provides as a ground of appeal that "removal  of
    the appellant from the United Kingdom in consequence of the immigration
    decision would breach the United  Kingdom's  obligations,"  (under  the
    Convention). Whilst there had been no removal decision  in  that  case,
    the refusal decision  stated  that  it  had  been  concluded  that  the
    appellant's removal was not  contrary  to  ECHR  obligations.  That  is
    plainly not the case here; there is no removal decision and  the  facts
    of JM are very different to the present case.

24. In the circumstances there was  no  error  of  law  in  not  addressing
    article 8 ECHR rights in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

25. In the circumstances, I find that if there was an error in  failing  to
    reference or take into account the letter from the  probation  service,
    it was not material to the determination. I also find that there was no
    disclosable error in relation to the judge's  findings  as  to  primary
    carer.  In  essence,  the  grounds  of  appeal  are  no  more  than   a
    disagreement with the judge's findings.

Conclusion & Decision

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the  appeal
remains dismissed.
