Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Pinder, Counsel instructed by Universe
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing on financial grounds his appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to grant him leave  to
    remain as a partner of a person present and settled here;  and  against
    the Secretary of State's concomitant decision to  make  directions  for
    his removal under Section 47 of the 2006 Act.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make  an  anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not  consider  the
    appellant requires  anonymity  with  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal. So I make no anonymity direction.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission

 2. On  10  August  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "It is arguable that the judge failed to consider the applicability
         of para  D(b)(ii)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  in  relation  to  the  bank
         statements  and  employer's  letter  which   were   required   (but
         apparently not submitted) as specified evidence of the  appellant's
         wife's earnings."

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, who was born on 21  July  1985.
    He entered the United Kingdom as a Tier 5 TW (CRE-Sport) Migrant on  14
    July 2013.  On 13 June 2014 his solicitors applied  on  his  behalf  to
    vary his leave to enter or remain as the partner of  a  person  present
    and settled here.  The application was refused on 1  August  2014.   He
    had indicated on his application form that his partner  was  earning  a
    gross annual salary of ï¿½22,060.  He had submitted her pay  slips  dated
    December 2013 to May 2014, a P60 dated April  2014  and  his  partner's
    bank statements for the period April 2014 to May 2014.  However he  had
    not submitted his partner's bank statements corresponding to  the  same
    period as the pay slips  or  an  employer's  letter.   So  he  had  not
    submitted all the evidence required to show that he met  the  financial
    requirements.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant's appeal came before Judge  Robinson  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 5  February  2016.   Ms  Pinder  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, and the Secretary of State was represented by a Home  Office
    Presenting Officer.   The  appellant  was  called  as  a  witness.   He
    insisted that he had provided all the required bank statements with the
    application.  He had obtained the employer's letter  around  June.   He
    would have been able to deal with any request for documents if  he  had
    been contacted before a decision had been made on his application.   In
    cross-examination it was pointed out to him that the employer's  letter
    made available for the hearing was dated 14 August  2014,  and  he  was
    asked to explain how he could have submitted it with  the  application,
    as it did not exist at the time.  He said he  could  not  remember  the
    date of the letter.

 5.  In  closing  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  respondent,  Ms   Ellis
    acknowledged that the  decision  maker  could  request  information  in
    certain circumstances.  In this  case  both  the  bank  statements  and
    employer's letter were missing; and it is apparent  from  the  evidence
    produced at the appeal hearing  that  the  employer's  letter  was  not
    obtained until after the refusal.

 6. Ms Pinder on behalf of the appellant submitted that the  only  document
    known to be missing was the employer's letter dated August 2014.

 7. In his subsequent decision, the judge set out  at  paragraph  [16]  the
    evidential flexibility provisions contained in paragraph D of  Appendix
    FM-SE.

 8. The judge went on to find that the appellant had  neither  supplied  an
    employer's letter with his application, nor his wife's bank statements.
     He also found at paragraph [18] that the employer's  letter  dated  14
    August 2014 did not include all  the  information  required  under  the
    Rules.  In particular, it did not state for how long she had been  paid
    the level of salary relied on in the application.  The judge  continued
    in paragraph [20]:

         "I  have  considered  whether  the  respondent  should  notify  the
         appellant the documentation was defective before the  decision  was
         made.  However it is apparent  that  more  than  one  document  was
         missing and the employer's letter was not in existence at the  time
         the decision was made.  This is not a case  where  a  document  had
         been omitted from the bundle sent to the Home Office  in  error  or
         where a copy  was  sent  instead  of  an  original  or  a  document
         submitted in  an  incorrect  format.   In  my  view  it  cannot  be
         maintained that it was not possible for an employer's letter to  be
         supplied with  the  application.   In  her  written  statement  the
         appellant's partner did not give any reasons suggesting why it  was
         impossible to obtain her employer's letter before 14 August  2014."



 9. The judge concluded in paragraph [21] that the  decision  made  by  the
    respondent on 1 August 2014 was in accordance with the law and that the
    decision maker correctly concluded that it is  not  a  case  where  the
    evidential flexibility provisions set out in the Rules required him  or
    her to give the applicant an opportunity to submit further documents.

10. The judge went on to dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules and
    on human rights grounds under Article 8 ECHR.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, the representatives were in agreement that, if the  appellant  had
    provided a valid employer's letter by the date of the appeal hearing in
    the First-tier Tribunal, his appeal could have been allowed  under  the
    Rules.  As this is not a PBS case, he was not debarred  from  producing
    specified documents after the date  of  decision,  including  specified
    documents that have only come into existence  after  the  date  of  the
    decision.

12. However  there  is  no  challenge  to  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    employer's letter of August 2014 is not compliant with the  Rules,  and
    so the sole issue is whether the caseworker assessing  the  application
    ought to have pointed out to the  appellant  that  specified  documents
    that  were  missing  from  his  application,  so  as  to  give  him  an
    opportunity to provide what was missing before a decision was made.

13. Ms Pinder submitted that the judge had erred in law in not finding that
    there had been  a  breach  of  the  evidential  flexibility  provisions
    contained in paragraph D.   She  directed  my  attention  to  paragraph
    D(b)(ii) which provides that if  the  applicant  has  not  submitted  a
    specified document, the decision maker may contact the applicant or his
    representative in writing or otherwise, and request the document(s)  or
    the correct version(s).   Although  the  Rule  refers  to  a  specified
    document in the singular, it does  not  mean,  she  submits,  that  the
    discretion is not engaged  if  more  than  one  specified  document  is
    missing.  This is apparent from the  caseworker  having  discretion  to
    request documents in the plural.

14. On behalf of the Secretary of State,  Mr  Wilding  submitted  that  the
    caseworker had  to  have  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  missing
    documents existed.  The  evidential  flexibility  provisions  are  only
    designed to correct  obvious  mistakes.   The  decision  maker  is  not
    required to speculate.

Discussion

15. I accept that the evidential flexibility provisions in paragraph  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE do not preclude a caseworker from requesting  more  than
    one specified document.  However the caseworker has to have  reasonable
    cause to believe that the specified documents (plural) that are missing
    from  the  application  have  been  omitted  accidently,  rather   than
    deliberately - because, for example, they do not exist.

16. If the only documents that were missing from the application  had  been
    the remainder of his wife's bank statements, the appellant would have a
    reasonable case that the caseworker dealing with his application  ought
    to  have  given  him  the  opportunity  to  provide  the  missing  bank
    statements.  But the employer's letter was also missing; and there  was
    nothing in the application to alert the caseworker to  the  possibility
    that this omission was accidental. On the contrary, the  fact  that  no
    such letter was listed amongst the documents which were being  provided
    tended to indicate (as was the fact) that such a letter did not  exist;
    and so its non-provision was entirely deliberate.

17. Accordingly, it was  open  to  Judge  Robinson  to  find  the  decision
    appealed against was in accordance with the law. It was open to him  to
    find that there had not been a breach  of  the  evidential  flexibility
    provisions in paragraph D, having regard to  his  primary  findings  of
    fact which are not challenged by way of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal:
    namely, that the employer's  letter  did  not  exist  at  the  date  of
    application (or at the date of decision); and the  appellant  had  also
    not provided most of the  required  bank  statements.  Giving  him  the
    opportunity to provide the remainder of the  bank  statements  was  not
    going to avail him, as his application  was  bound  to  be  refused  on
    account of the omission of an employer's letter.

Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.
