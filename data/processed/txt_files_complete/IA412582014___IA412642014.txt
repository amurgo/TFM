For the appellant:     Ms S Iqbal of counsel
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Belgium born on  16  October  1972.
    The second appellant,  who  is  the  first  appellant's  nephew,  is  a
    Pakistani national born on 2 July 1987. They appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal against the decisions of the respondent dated 28  August  2014
    to refuse to  issue  the  first  appellant  with  an  EEA  registration
    certificate and  to  refuse  to  issue  the  second  appellant  with  a
    residence card as a family member of an EEA national under regulation 6
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the '2006
    Regulations'). First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox dismissed that appellant's
    appeal. In a  decision  of  21  May  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bartlett granted the appellants  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. Thus the appeal came before me.

 3. The main issues in the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal  were
    whether the first appellant who is a Belgium national was  a  qualified
    person exercising his treaty rights in the United Kingdom  as  a  self-
    employed person pursuant to regulation 6 of the 2006 regulations.

 4. The issue in respect of the second appellant was whether he was  living
    with his sponsor in an EEA state as a worker  or  self-employed  person
    and was dependent  on  his  EEA  national  sponsor  as  required  under
    regulation 8 (2) (a) of the 2006 regulations and whether he has a basis
    to stay in the United Kingdom under the 2006 regulations.

 5. The appellant's grounds of appeal argue as follows. The Judge  accepted
    at paragraph 15 of  the  determination  that  the  first  appellant  is
    registered with HMRC for tax purposes. At paragraph 16 it  is  recorded
    that the first appellant had over �4000 from 18 March 2014  to  8  July
    2014 in a period of just over three months. The financial year ended on
    5 April 2014 and therefore part of this earning was counted towards the
    first appellant's earnings for the year ended  on  5  April  2014.  The
    first appellant's self-employed commission agent and his earnings  were
    received from different sources as opposed  to  an  employment  income.
    Therefore, in most cases the first appellant was paid in cash  and  the
    same was paid into his bank account as received.

 6. The first appellant has declared his earnings as  �5986  for  the  year
    ending  5  April  2014.  The  appellant  made  a   national   insurance
    contribution of �74.50 which is mandatory for self-employed persons  in
    the United Kingdom. The letter attached at page 103 of the  appellant's
    bundle is dated 4 October 2014 and hence it postdates the  application.
    This is because the first bill was received from HMRC and that the HMRC
    only sends such a bill  twice  a  year  and  no  regular  payments  are
    expected from a self-employed person as opposed to  those  who  are  in
    employment.

 7. The first appellant applied to register  with  HMRC  for  tax  purposes
    before starting  his  business  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  received
    confirmation in June 2014. After  various  telephone  requests  to  the
    HMRC, the first appellant received his first national insurance bill in
    October 2014. This bill was not available prior to the date of decision
    hence it postdates the application. Section 85 (4) of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allows the  Tribunal  to  consider  any
    evidence material is relevant to the issue in question and existing  at
    the time even after decision. The Judge has clearly erred in law by not
    accepting the appellant's evidence.

 8. In relation to the  Judge's  findings  at  paragraph  20  and  21,  the
    conclusion  is  against  the  essence  of  regulation  6  of  the  2006
    regulations. The Home Office guidance on EEA national qualified  person
    version 2.0 valid from 25 February 2015 explains how  an  EEA  national
    can qualify to be treated as "a qualified person". The first  appellant
    meets the test and has provided letters confirming the registration for
    tax and national insurance purposes with HMRC. He has provided  letters
    confirming registration for tax and national  insurance  purposes,  the
    accountants report, accountant's letter and  bank  statements.  In  the
    presence of these authentic documents, the appellant felt  he  did  not
    need to submit business invoices. There  is  no  legal  requirement  to
    submit invoices with his application. The Home Office guidance sets out
    the kind of evidence to show self-employment.

 9. At paragraph 23 of the determination, the Judge failed  to  assess  the
    appellants Article 8 rights. The  case  law  quoted  by  the  Judge  is
    inapplicable to the present case and nor does it  support  the  Judge's
    findings that no Article 8 rights arise in the present circumstances.

10. I find that there is no error of law in the determination of the First-
    tier Judge in relation to the application of the 2006 Regulations.  The
    Judge found that the appellant does not satisfy Regulation 9(2)(a)  and
    (b).  Nothing presented to me suggests that this  finding  was  legally
    erroneous.

11. I find that the first-tier Tribunal Judge did not materially err in law
    and gave adequate reasons for his finding that the first appellant  has
    not demonstrated that he is a  self-employed  person  and  therefore  a
    qualified person and is not exercising his EEA  treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom. The Judge also did not fall into error by finding  that
    the second appellant who is  dependent  on  the  status  of  the  first
    appellant does not, as a consequence, qualify for a residence card.

12. The Judge was entitled to conclude that there was no credible  evidence
    of the provenance for the �4000 deposited  into  the  appellant's  bank
    account and that this  money  had  been  generated  from  his  business
    activity in the United Kingdom. The Judge was entitled to not  rely  on
    the accountant's summary of the appellant's income and expenditure  for
    the period 1 October 2013 to 5 April 2014 and the accountants projected
    summary of the appellant's income and  expenditure  for  the  tax  year
    ending April 2015. The Judge found that the summary reports  were  very
    basic and stated at paragraph 18 "the first one stated after  deducting
    expenses such as "use of home"; motor and  travelling;  telephone;  and
    general expenses, the appellant's net  income  was  �5986".  The  Judge
    correctly noted that the appellant must have provided his  invoices  to
    the accountant for him to have prepared his report and found  that  the
    appellant had not given a reason for why he did not provide any of  the
    invoices to support his appeal.

13. I do not accept  the  appellant's  argument  that  there  is  no  legal
    requirement for him to provide invoices. The burden of proof is on  the
    appellant and it is for him to demonstrate that he is self-employed  in
    this country and invoices from clients would have gone a  long  way  in
    establishing his purported business activity in this country. The Judge
    found that the appellant has not provided any invoices  or  receipt  of
    letters from his clients to demonstrate self-employment. It is implicit
    in the determination that if the appellant was  self-employed  and  had
    clients, there must have been a paper trail which he  could  have  been
    provided as evidence of self-employment. These are proper  findings  by
    the Judge and cannot be faulted.

14. Although the Judge stated at paragraph 17 that the  evidence  postdates
    the decision he however did take it into account and stated  that  this
    evidence does not demonstrate that  the  appellant  is  making  regular
    national insurance contributions as  one  would  expect  from  a  self-
    employed person. The Judge allowed the evidence and considered  it  but
    attached little weight to the evidence which he was entitled to do.

15. In respect of the HMRC documents, the Judge found at paragraph 20  that
    registration with the HMRC does not in itself establish that  a  person
    is self-employed. He was entitled to find that the appellant failed  to
    provide evidence as to the source of the funds in his bank account  and
    therefore registration with HMRC in  itself  does  not  show  that  the
    appellant is self-employed in this country.

16. The Judge was entitled to find, on the evidence that the  appellant  is
    not a qualified person under paragraph 6 of the  2006  regulations  and
    therefore he is not entitled to  a  registration  certificate  and  the
    second appellant cannot qualify for a residence card.

17. I therefore uphold the first-tier Tribunal's determination as there  is
    no material error of law.

DECISION
