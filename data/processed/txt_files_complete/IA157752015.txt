Representation:
For the Appellant:           Ms Faryl, Counsel instructed by direct access

For the Respondent:    Mr G. Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan (dob  1st  February  1990)  who
    seeks leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.


 2. Although the Respondent accepts that the Appellant does enjoy  in  this
    country rights protected by Article 8 ECHR - private and family life  -
    she considers it would nevertheless  be  proportionate  to  refuse  the
    Appellant leave, because she believes that he was complicit in what has
    become known as the 'ETS fraud': it is the Respondent's  case  that  in
    2012 when the Appellant applied  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student he relied on an English Language test certificate that had been
    fraudulently procured with the use of a proxy in  his  spoken  language
    test.


    Anonymity Order

 3. There  is  no  reason  why  the  Appellant  should  have  his  identity
    protected. This case does however turn in large measure on the evidence
    of his minor stepdaughter. I am concerned that  identification  of  the
    Appellant could lead to identification of that  child  and  having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Case History and Matters in Issue

 4. The procedural history of this matter is as follows.


 5. On the 2nd March 2015 the Appellant made an application  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of his family life with his British partner DA  and
    her two British children, A and O.

 6. The application was rejected by way of letter dated the 8th April 2015.
    The reason for refusal was the ETS allegation,  which  meant  that  the
    Appellant failed  under  the  'suitability  requirements'  set  out  in
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Appellant exercised his right of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    and the matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Heynes,   sitting
    at Manchester. The appeal was dismissed in a determination  dated  25th
    April 2016.  In short summary the Judge found that  the  Appellant  had
    used a proxy, that the ETS allegation was made good and that  it  would
    therefore be proportionate to refuse  him  leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds.

 8. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   He
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  its  approach  to
    both the ETS fraud and Article 8.

 9. On the 20th  October  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Keene  granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on  limited  grounds.    He
    found no arguable error in the decision insofar as it  related  to  the
    ETS fraud, but he was prepared to grant permission on the grounds  that
    Judge Heynes had erred in his assessment of Article 8, inter alia for a
    failure to make findings on the 'best interests' of O, the  Appellant's
    stepdaughter.

10. The matter was  listed  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  before  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Hall on the 17th January 2017.   At the  outset  of  the
    hearing Ms Faryl, Counsel  for  the  Appellant,  made  a  renewed  oral
    application for permission to appeal on the 'ETS grounds'.  Judge  Hall
    refused to consider that application on the grounds that it was out  of
    time, finding that any renewed application should  have  been  made  in
    writing to the Upper Tribunal within 14 days of Judge Keene's  decision
    being sent.  Turning to the extant appeal before him Judge  Hall  found
    that Judge  Heynes  had  been  entitled  to  dismiss  the  appeal  with
    reference to the Immigration Rules (ie as Article 8 is expressed within
    those Rules). He found however that in its consideration of  Article  8
    'outwith the Rules' the Tribunal had  erred  in  failing  to  make  any
    findings on whether the Appellant had a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with his stepdaughter.   He  therefore  set  the  decision
    aside with a view to remaking it, and gave his reasons for so doing  in
    a written decision dated the 30th January 2017.

11. On the 3rd February 2017 Ms Faryl made an application in writing to the
    Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Keene (in refusing permission) and  Judge  Heynes  (in  dismissing  the
    appeal on ETS grounds).

12. That application was not dealt with by the Upper Tribunal; although  it
    was placed on the file it was not recorded as having been received  and
    due to administrative error is was not placed before a Judge.

13. The matter was relisted before Judge Hall on the  6th  July  2017,  who
    upon  being  advised  of   the   outstanding   application,   adjourned
    proceedings.

14. On the 10th  August  2017  the  application  was  placed  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge O'Connor, who was duty judge that day.   Judge  O'Connor
    noted that the decision of Judge Heynes no longer exists, since it  was
    set aside by Judge Hall on  the  30th  January  2017.   Judge  O'Connor
    concluded,  with  reference  to  s  12  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007, that it was impermissible for the Upper  Tribunal
    to grant permission  to  appeal  against  a  decision  that  no  longer
    existed.  Permission was therefore refused.  Judge O'Connor went on  to
    note however, citing the decision in Kizhakudan v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 566,  that once a  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside, and  a  decision  has  been
    taken to remake the decision in the Upper Tribunal, the Upper  Tribunal
    may determine the nature and scope of that remaking.    The  UT  has  a
    wide discretion in that regard.   It was not at all  clear  that  Judge
    Hall had appreciated the extent  of  his  discretion.   Judge  O'Connor
    directed that the matter be relisted before another  Tribunal  so  that
    consideration could be given to the scope of the remaking. In doing  so
    Judge O'Connor observed that the issue of the  'ETS  fraud'  could  not
    sensibly be divorced from the overall reasoning  on  Article  8,  given
    that it was the centrepiece of the Respondent's case.

15.  The matter was then listed before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Alis  on
    the 3rd October 2017. What happened that day is  not  altogether  clear
    but it would appear that the parties agreed by  consent  that  the  ETS
    issue should be re-opened so that the remaking Tribunal could  consider
    the entire case afresh.   The Respondent was that  day  represented  by
    Senior Presenting Officer Mr Bates, who  successfully  applied  for  an
    adjournment so that  the  Secretary  of  State  could  provide  further
    evidence relating to the ETS allegation.

16. So it was that when the matter came before me the matters in issue were

        a. Whether the Respondent has demonstrated that the  Appellant  did
           rely on a fraudulently obtained language test certificate;


        b. If that burden was not discharged whether  the  Appellant  could
           succeed with reference to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules;


        c. If he could not whether the refusal to  grant  him  leave  would
           nevertheless disproportionately interfere with protected Article
           8 rights in this country.

17. At the hearing I heard evidence first from the Appellant, then from his
    wife Ms DA, and finally, and very helpfully, from his  stepdaughter  O.
    I then heard submissions from the parties and I reserved my decision.


    Discussion and Findings


    ETS


18. I remind myself of the proper approach to the analysis  of  allegations
    of fraud of this nature, as set out in numerous decisions including  SM
    and Qadir (ETS- evidence- burden of proof) [2016] UKUT  229  (IAC)  and
    more recently in Ahsan and Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 2009.  It is for the Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  to  provide  some  evidence  of  wrongdoing,  of
    sufficient cogency to discharge the evidential burden of proof.  It  is
    then for the Appellant to respond to that evidence by providing his own
    explanation as to what took place. In the final analysis I  must  weigh
    the Secretary of State's evidence against  the  "innocent  explanation"
    provided by the Appellant, and reach my own decision  on  the  evidence
    presented.  The final, legal, burden lies on the Secretary of State and
    although the standard is the ordinary civil  standard,  she  must  meet
    that test with the production of evidence that can prove  her  case  at
    the higher end of the spectrum of the "balance of probabilities".


19. I find that in  this  case  the  evidential  burden  has  plainly  been
    discharged. The Respondent has produced the following  evidence,  which
    Ms Faryl accepts, in light of caselaw relating to the ETS  fraud,  must
    be taken to discharge the initial burden:

               . Statements of Rebecca Collins and Peter Millington
               . Expert Report of Professor Peter French
               . 'ETS look-up tool' detailing  the  date,  location  (Darwin
                 College) and  outcome  (invalid)  of  the  Appellant's  ETS
                 language test
               . 'ETS look-up tool' detailing the  summary  outcome  of  all
                 English language tests taken  on  the  11th  July  2012  at
                 Darwin College


20. The Appellant maintained before me that he took his own test.  He  said
    that he did not need to  use  a  proxy  because  he  speaks  very  good
    English.  He went to the test centre on the appointed day. He had  with
    him in his passport, and DVLA  provisional  licence  as  identification
    documents. They  stood  him  against  a  white  wall  to  get  a  clear
    photograph of him. There were 12-15 guys waiting.  They asked  the  men
    to come to the "quiet zone" where there were banks  of  computers.  The
    tests took 2 hours altogether, for the four components.  People  around
    him were speaking but he could not really hear what  they  were  saying
    because everyone had headphones on. The Appellant could not recall  the
    order in which the tests were taken but he recalled getting the results
    from the college some time later.  He had no  idea  of  the  allegation
    until he got the "amazing" letter from the Home Office  refusing  leave
    on human rights grounds.  He asked me to note, which  I  did,  that  he
    speaks exceptionally good English  (his  live  evidence  was  given  in
    fluent English with an obvious Lancashire/Manchester accent). This  was
    the Appellant's evidence before me.  In his statement drafted  for  the
    appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  however,  he  gave  markedly
    different evidence:


         "In August 2012, I applied to Darwin College to  study  Diploma  in
         Business Studies. As my  ESOL  result  from  City  and  Guilds  was
         pending by that time, I was advised by the college to book  English
         language test with Educational Testing Service (ETS) through  their
         test centre for quick results to avoid being overstayed as my leave
         was to expire on 11 August 2012. I took their advice and booked the
         test. On the day of the test the college advised me that I did  not
         need to take the spoken English test because I already  had  passed
         it in June 2012. My leave was extended until 20th December 2013.


         If I had known that the college will arrange a proxy to accommodate
         a few of candidates, I would not accept their advice at all because
         I could pass spoken English test very easily as I have had adequate
         knowledge and command of  English  language  which  is  established
         through my previous English language test results of 2012. However,
         I regret on this unintentional and innocent mistake and  submit  my
         absolute apology".


21. When asked to explain why in the statement  he  appeared  to  admit  to
    having not taken the test personally, the Appellant denied having given
    that statement. He pointed to the poor English in the statement  itself
    (and the comparable  grammatical  errors  in  the  'statement'  of  his
    British wife) and said that the statements had been drafted by his then
    solicitor. He had not checked it properly before he had signed it -  he
    had assumed that it would reflect what he had told the solicitor.


22. I have considered the Appellant's explanation for fact  that  ETS  have
    determined his speaking test result to be 'invalid'.    I  have  placed
    some weight on his ability to describe in some detail  the  process  at
    the test centre. I have borne in mind that insofar as his  relationship
    with his partner and stepdaughter are concerned,  I  found  him  to  be
    credible. I have borne in mind that he does indeed speak good  English,
    and that when his City & Guilds result  came  through,  he  had  indeed
    passed. I have held at the forefront of my mind the fact that  mistakes
    can happen, and that expert analysis has shown that in the case of  the
    ETS fraud this has included a small, but significant, number of  'false
    positives'.


23. Against those  matters  I  weigh  the  following.  The  'look-up  tool'
    specifically identifies the Appellant,  and  the  fact  that  the  test
    centre was Darwin College.   The ETS information shows that of  the  13
    tests taken at Darwin College on that day 1 was  deemed  "questionable"
    and the remaining 12, including this one, were deemed "invalid".   This
    is therefore a test  centre  where  a  very  high  rate  of  fraud  was
    detected.   I  note  that  the  Appellant  has  claimed  to  have  been
    photographed on the day of the test, and yet has  made  no  attempt  to
    recover that photograph, nor to obtain the recording of what he says is
    his voice: MA (ETS- TOIEC testing) [2016] UKUT  00450  (IAC).   I  must
    also place considerable weight on the fact that the Appellant has given
    plainly discrepant  evidence  on  this  matter.  I  accept  Ms  Faryl's
    submission that the witness statements were obviously  drafted  by  the
    same person, in poor and grammatically incorrect English. That does not
    change the fact that the Appellant signed  that  statement.  He  is  an
    intelligent man, whom as he stresses, has a good command of English.  I
    do not accept that he would have  signed  such  an  important  document
    without reading it.   I find that the more likely explanation  for  the
    discrepancy is that the Appellant decided to admit to having not  taken
    the test, and sought to place  the  blame  on  the  centre,  but  later
    changed his mind. As to his ability to speak English, it is  of  course
    the case that people chose to  use  proxies  for  many  reasons.  Those
    reasons include lack of confidence (admittedly unlikely in this  case),
    lack of time and commitment,  and  contempt  for  the  system.   Having
    considered all of that evidence I am satisfied that the legal burden on
    the Secretary of state has been discharged. I find  that  on  the  11th
    July 2012 the Appellant's English language speaking test was taken by a
    proxy, and that he must have known that to be the case  when  he  later
    relied on that certificate in order to extend his leave to remain.




    Article 8: Appendix FM


24. The parties were in agreement that I must begin my Article 8 assessment
    with reference to the Immigration Rules, since those Rules now  reflect
    parliament's view of where the balance should be  struck  in  terms  of
    what constitutes a family  life  and  when  it  will  be  generally  be
    disproportionate to expect someone to leave the UK.


25. The parties were also in agreement that if  the  Respondent  discharged
    the burden of proof in respect of the ETS allegation,  the  Appellant's
    claim 'under the rules' would necessarily fail, because the  Respondent
    has invoked the 'suitability' criteria at S-LTRP.1.6:


         S-LTR.1.6. The presence of the applicant in the UK is not conducive
         to the public good because  their  conduct  (including  convictions
         which do not fall within paragraphs S-LTR.1.3. to 1.5.), character,
         associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable to  allow  them
         to remain in the UK.


26. Although reliance on  this  provision  is  a  decision  susceptible  to
    challenge  in  this  Tribunal  (unlike  comparable  statutory  mandates
    applicable  to  foreign  criminals)  Ms  Faryl  did  not  contest   its
    application here. The Appellant  cannot  therefore  succeed  under  the
    Rules.




    Article 8


    The Evidence


27. The Respondent accepts that Appendix FM is not a  'complete  code'  and
    that the United Kingdom's obligations under the ECHR  leave  scope  for
    consideration of its  articles  outwith  that  framework.  She  further
    accepts that it  would  be  possible,  albeit  extremely  unusual,  for
    someone who has failed under 'suitability' criteria such as  S-LTRP.1.6
    to nevertheless succeed on Article 8 grounds.  It  would  be  extremely
    unusual because the weight to be attached to the  public  interest  (in
    refusing leave) would in these circumstances be very great  indeed.  It
    is considerably  greater  than  the  public  interest  in  removing  an
    overstayer simpliciter, and would  be  approaching  the  weight  to  be
    attached to deporting a foreign criminal. Whilst the Appellant has  not
    been convicted of a crime, and the charge against him was not proven to
    the criminal standard,   the fact remains that fraud  is  a  crime.  In
    this context it is a crime that was deliberately designed to  undermine
    the system of immigration control that exists not just for the  benefit
    of citizens of this country, but of migrants who seek to study,  visit,
    work and live here.  I bear that in mind throughout my consideration of
    Article 8.


28. I had the benefit of hearing extensive evidence from DA, and  from  her
    daughter O who is only 12 years old. I also heard  from  the  Appellant
    himself. I had regard to their  written  evidence,  and  to  supporting
    material in the bundle. I found DA and O to  be  intelligent,  informed
    and wholly credible women. They spoke openly, and  at  times  movingly,
    about the situation  that  they  have  found  themselves  in,  and  the
    consequences for them if the  Appellant  were  to  have  to  return  to
    Pakistan.

29. DA split up from her husband M in approximately 2009. It had long  been
    an unhappy marriage. In early 2014 she  was  invited  to  dinner  at  a
    friend's house and it was there that  she  met  the  Appellant.    They
    chatted a lot that night and saw each other frequently after  that.  By
    July 2014 they were in a committed relationship.   He  moved  into  the
    family home in September of that year.  They had planned  to  marry  in
    May 2015 but that was all "turned  upside  down"  by  the  Home  Office
    letter accusing him of deception and refusing  him  further  leave.  DA
    states that she was "devastated" by this news. Although she  had  known
    that the Appellant was on a student visa it had  not  occurred  to  her
    that he might not be able to stay with her in this country.   They  had
    been married under Islamic law in March 2015 but she had wanted  a  big
    English wedding - "bridesmaids and everything" but this was put on hold
    because of the Home Office investigation. In the end they were  married
    in a quiet ceremony in July 2015.    Obviously they cannot travel while
    all of this is going on.  This  has  been  hard  for  him  because  his
    grandmother passed away in Pakistan and he was  unable  to  go  to  the
    funeral or see his family.  DA said that she has only "met" his  family
    over Skype - her Pushto is not very good so there is a lot  of  smiling
    and hand waving.   The Appellant himself avers that he is committed  to
    DA and he feels terrible that he  has  put  her  through  all  of  this
    because he is an "immigrant". He loves her and he wishes he could  have
    given her the wedding she wanted.


30. At the time that DA met the Appellant she was a single  mother  of  two
    children. Her daughter O had been born in February 2005 so was at  that
    point 9 years old.   Her son A had been born in October 1997 and so was
    16.  She maintained a reasonable relationship with her ex-husband M and
    the children saw him regularly. After  the  break  up  A  had  remained
    living with his father (for reasons explained below) but this was  only
    round the corner so she still saw him every day.  O  has  always  lived
    with her.  From DA's  perspective the Appellant  is  an  asset  to  her
    family.   In  her  statement  she  uses  striking  language  about  his
    relationship with O and A: "they respect him more than their own  dad".
    When asked whether she stood by that statement she emphatically  agreed
    that she did. She said that her ex-husband is not a bad father  but  he
    doesn't really think sometimes. He currently has a new partner who  the
    children do not like at all. He doesn't  put  them  first  whereas  the
    Appellant does.

31. I was told that A is on the autistic spectrum. Although he is now 20 he
    remains in full time education, does not live independently and remains
    very much dependent on his immediate family for support.  He  struggles
    to go out of the  house  and  finds  it  difficult  to  deal  with  new
    situations.  Although he is technically an adult for  those  reasons  I
    proceed on the basis that he remains an integral part of  this  family:
    Mr Harrison accepted, applying the Kugathas ratio, that this would  the
    proper approach.

32. A 'likes what he knows' and that is why it was decided that  he  should
    stay in the family home when DA and O  moved  out.    They  only  moved
    around the corner and have remained in daily contact.  He is very close
    to DA and O.  It took a while for A to build a  relationship  with  the
    Appellant but now they are very close. They  play  badminton  together,
    sit for hours on the Playstation and mess around  -  A  is  into  heavy
    metal and wears his hair long, and O described to  me  a  recent  funny
    scenario where the Appellant used hair products and straighteners to do
    A's hair. He teaches him to look after himself. O says that her brother
    really values his relationship with the Appellant.  They get on  really
    well. He feels that the Appellant understands him. This was contrasted,
    by both DA and O, with the way that M's new  girlfriend  (now  fianc�),
    and to a certain extend M, behave. DA said that A's  relationship  with
    his father has been good but it has been put under strain in  the  past
    couple of years by his new relationship.   The new girlfriend does  not
    understand A or empathise with his condition. She is  quite  dismissive
    of it. There was a recent incident in  which  M  and  his  fianc�  were
    taking the kids out to a restaurant. As they drove up to the restaurant
    A could see that it was really busy inside and  he  became  scared.  He
    said to his dad that he was really sorry, he didn't want to  spoil  the
    evening but he couldn't actually go into the restaurant because it  was
    so hectic. O said that her father's fianc� responded "oh don't play the
    autistic card with me". A and O both got out of the back of the car and
    started to walk home. They called DA and she came and  picked  them  up
    from the street.  M  and  his  fianc�  went  on  to  have  their  meal.
    Incidents like that have led to the decision that  A  should  now  move
    permanently to live with DA and the Appellant. His father travels a lot
    and no-one is comfortable with him remaining in the house  on  his  own
    with this lady who does not seem to understand his particular needs.


33. A has written a letter to the Tribunal, which I have taken  fully  into
    account albeit that he was unable to attend the hearing.  A's  evidence
    is as follows:

         "When I first met [the Appellant] I said to my mum I hope he has  a
         beard because men with beards are very trustworthy. I was  glad  he
         did have a beard but I was  right  with  my  comment  because  [the
         Appellant] has become more of a dad to me than  my  own  dad.  [The
         Appellant] understands my condition very well. I have  an  Autistic
         Spectrum Disorder and I find it very difficult to meet  new  people
         and to talk to people that I don't know. There  are  several  other
         factors in my condition that my mum and [the Appellant] manage very
         well. When I am at my mums [the Appellant]  will  ask  me  to  play
         racing games and we have also played badminton a few times  on  our
         own because of my social anxiety. I have accepted  [the  Appellant]
         as a father to me and I would be very upset if was to have to leave
         us. I wouldn't be able to trust  anyone  else  like  I  trust  [the
         Appellant]. I know that my sister would also be  devastated  if  he
         was to leave because she adores him"


34. The Appellant himself said that he knows that A has a good relationship
    with his father whom the Appellant describes as a "good guy".  He  says
    that he relates to A as a friend. He calls him 'pal' and A likes  this.
     A stays with DA and the Appellant two nights a  week  at  present  but
    they would like him to move there permanently once they  can  sort  out
    more room.   The Appellant said he and DA love A  very  much  and  they
    want him to feel at home there.


35. No issue was taken with the evidence of A's autism. It was supported by
    a letter from the Cognitive  Behavioural  Therapist  that  A  has  been
    referred to, a Mr Paul Smithson, who lists the challenges faced by A as
    including "difficulties with social interaction,  a  strong  preference
    for set routines, moderate anxiety, worried about future  independence,
    longstanding  difficulties  in  making  and  maintaining   friendships,
    sensitivity  to  changes   in   routine,   actively   avoiding   social
    situations".

36. DA told me that the Appellant and O have had a warm relationship  since
    they met. When she was in primary school he would attend her assemblies
    and "little plays" when DA was unable to,  and  he  takes  her  on  day
    trips, for instance he took her to the Manchester United museum.  Since
    they moved her journey to school is a long one - she needs to  get  two
    different trams and although she will soon start making that journey on
    her own (she is now in year 8 at secondary school) he has done it  with
    her every day since she started so that she gets used to it.

37. Prior to the hearing O had written a letter to the  Tribunal  in  which
    she said this:

         "When my mum and dad split up I never  thought  I  would  be  happy
         again. I moved out with my mum, a little while after  my  mum  said
         she had met someone nice she said I could meet him that weekend  if
         I wanted to. I did find it a little strange because  it  wasn't  my
         dad. We went out to a curry place for food and [the Appellant]  was
         showing me how to fold napkins into swans and fans.  I  thought  he
         was amazing and I couldn't wait to tell me friends how nice he was.
         Not long after Mum told me that [they] were getting married and  he
         moved in. We are a very happy family [the Appellant]  takes  me  to
         school and picks me up from friends or school. He takes me  out  in
         the holidays and gets me shakes at the  local  shop.  I  love  [the
         Appellant] very much, more than my own dad because of how  nice  he
         is to me. My dad has a new girlfriend and spends more time with her
         than he does with me and my brother. My own  dad  doesn't  seem  to
         have time to spend with us anymore..."

    When she gave her evidence I asked O if she  had  written  that  letter
    herself. She confirmed that she had and she said that she meant it  and
    she "doesn't want him to go". She said that her brother  really  relies
    on the Appellant and that is important  because  he's  not  comfortable
    with everyone.   I specifically asked her whether she thought that  she
    loved the Appellant more than she loved her own dad, and asked  her  to
    consider that for a moment: she did, and then said  that  although  she
    does love her dad she does not love his fianc� and  that  she  and  her
    brother have found it difficult because their dad gives her more of his
    time now.  The Appellant always has time for them.

38. The Appellant describes O as a "little monkey" whom  he  loves  like  a
    daughter. It does not matter to him that  she  is  not  his  biological
    child. He has seen her grow up and is very proud of her.


39. In addition to this evidence from the immediate family,    I  was  also
    given letters in support by five witnesses.  The first was from J, DA's
    mother. J states that the Appellant has a  "father  type  relationship"
    with the children and that they love him very much. In  particular  she
    is very pleased about the Appellant's relationship with A: they have  a
    really strong bond and this is important because A  does  not  find  it
    easy to relate  to  people.    In  her  view  it  would  "destroy"  the
    Appellant and "crucify" her grandchildren if he is not allowed to  stay
    with them.

40. The second letter is from Z, a friend of the Appellant's. Z states that
    in his experience the family have a strong bond and that they are  very
    happy together. The children have accepted him,  and  he  has  accepted
    them as his own. It would break their hearts if he had to leave.

41. I was given a letter each from two of DA's  close  female  friends  who
    have both known her for a long time (15  and  20  years  respectively).
    They both comment on the quality of the relationship that the Appellant
    has with DA's children, particularly the support he gives for his "best
    friend" A.    They describe the marriage as a "loving" one.

42. The final letter came, importantly, from M, the father of A  and  O.  M
    states that he knows that the Appellant has  adapted  to  the  role  of
    stepfather very well. M is  confident  that  the  Appellant  loves  his
    children and he knows that he has developed a strong bond with both  of
    them. A in particular has problems forming relationships but  has  done
    so with the Appellant. In M's view it would "devastate" the kids if the
    Appellant was not permitted to stay.


    My Findings

43. I have no doubt that the Appellant enjoys a family life with DA and her
    children. Having heard their evidence Mr Harrison made no submission to
    the contrary;  I note that a more cynical man might have suggested that
    the Appellant was using DA in order to secure leave to  remain  in  the
    UK. I have discounted that possibility. DA herself is clearly no  fool.
    She is an intelligent professional woman who  clearly  understands  the
    implications of having a relationship with someone who  is  subject  to
    immigration control. Importantly, it is a relationship endorsed by  two
    old friends and her mother, the very people could be  relied  upon   to
    intervene if they thought she was  being  taken  for  a  ride.    I  am
    satisfied that this marriage is a genuine and subsisting one.


44. I am further satisfied that the Appellant has a genuine and  subsisting
    'parental relationship' with O, and with A.  With  O  the  evidence  is
    clear. DA, O's maternal  grandmother,  O's  biological  father,  A,   O
    herself as well as three family friends describe her relationship  with
    the Appellant in those terms. They have a strong bond, she  trusts  him
    and relies on him, he does things for her that a father would do for  a
    daughter. It does not detract from her relationship  with  her  natural
    father, but I am satisfied that the Appellant, as  her  stepfather,  is
    playing a paternal role.   In respect  of  A  the  evidence  was  of  a
    slightly different tone.  It was the Appellant's candid  evidence  that
    he thinks of A as his "best friend". It seemed to me that the Appellant
    was careful not to 'tread on the toes' of M when it came to A.  He  was
    at pains to say that he thought A had  a  good  relationship  with  his
    father, and that M was a "good guy".   He described A as "his pal".  No
    doubt that is because A is that bit older, and they enjoy doing  things
    together - playing sports and video games - as equals.  I note  however
    that everyone else involved in this family  spoke  of  the  Appellant's
    particular bond with A, and again, the evidence was expressed in  terms
    of father-son relationship.     I have given  especial  weight  to  the
    evidence of A  himself  that  he  loves  the  Appellant  and  that  the
    Appellant is like a father to him.

45. I am satisfied that the decision to refuse leave to the Appellant is an
    interference with his family life. There is no  issue  taken  with  the
    Respondent's legal power to take  the  decision  she  has,  and  it  is
    accepted that it is in the public interest that the Secretary of  State
    denies leave to those who do not qualify under the Rules.

46. I turn to deal with proportionality.   Here I am  required  to  balance
    the Appellant's rights - and those of his family members - against  the
    public interest in removing individuals who do not  qualify  for  leave
    under the Rules. As I note above the Appellant has been  refused  leave
    to remain because he relied upon an English language  test  certificate
    that was fraudulently procured.   It is important that I underline that
    fact, because in the balancing exercise it  matters  why  he  is  being
    removed. The maintenance of proper immigration control is in the public
    interest: s117B(i) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  I  am
    therefore obliged to attach significant weight to the  public  interest
    in considering the claims of person who cannot meet the  terms  of  the
    Rules.  If those individuals have behaved poorly - in  terms  of  their
    conduct or associations - since they came to the UK then that weight is
    obviously increased.  It is increased yet further if the individual has
    been sent to prison for committing a criminal offence: anyone receiving
    a sentence of between 12 months and 4 years would have to show that the
    impact of removal would be "unduly harsh"  on their  children.  At  the
    very far end of the scale are  those  criminals  who  have  received  a
    sentence  of  four  years  or  more,  where   only   "very   compelling
    circumstances over and above" it being unduly harsh  for  the  children
    would count, a very high test indeed.


47. Where does the Appellant lie on that spectrum?  Probably  somewhere  in
    the middle, but for the purpose of my  decision  I  need  not  identify
    exactly where, since I am satisfied on the evidence before me that  the
    Appellant would still succeed in his appeal even if he were required to
    discharge the onerous burden placed on those facing deportation.

48. I am satisfied that it would be 'unduly harsh' for O to go and live  in
    Pakistan. Much was made by the Appellant of the  'conservative'  nature
    of his home town of Mingaora in the Swat  Valley,  where  he  suggested
    that DA and O might be at risk from extremists,  including  members  of
    his extended family. This to  me  seemed  unlikely  in  light  of  DA's
    evidence that she has been warmly welcomed by his parents and the  fact
    that the couple have undergone a nikah and so are married under Islamic
    law.  I was given no objective evidence whatsoever to demonstrate  that
    the wife and stepchild of a local might be at  risk  simply  for  being
    foreign.  I am satisfied however that it would be  extremely  difficult
    for O to integrate there. Neither  she  nor  her  mother  are  remotely
    religious, and beyond simple greetings neither speak a word of  Pushto.
    They would have to adjust to the severe restrictions placed  on  women,
    in terms of access to education, employment and even basic  freedom  of
    movement. They would have to leave  behind  their  established  private
    lives in the  UK,  and  very  likely,  A.      It  would  be  extremely
    difficult for A to move. Like his mother and sister he would  face  the
    substantial barriers of culture, religion and language, but unlike them
    would have  the  additional  challenge  of  facing  an  entirely  alien
    environment as an autistic person. I accept the evidence that  A  finds
    it distressing coping  with  even  very  small  change.    I  think  it
    extremely, extremely unlikely that A  would  move.  I  think  that  the
    impact on O and DA of leaving A behind would be very substantial.  If I
    need to elaborate I would say that the impact would be  excessive,  and
    inordinately bleak for this close knit family.   Having balanced  those
    matters against the substantial weight to be  attached  to  the  public
    interest in removing the Appellant, I find it to be 'unduly harsh'.

49. I am further satisfied that it would be 'unduly harsh' to expect A  and
    O to remain here without the Appellant. The evidence before me  was  of
    children who at one point (in O's words) did not think that they  would
    ever be happy again. Divorce happens so frequently nowadays that it  is
    easy to forget the devastating impact that it  can  have  on  children,
    even when managed in the apparently mature and civilised  fashion  that
    it was by DA and M.  O made it clear to me that it  was  the  Appellant
    who has made her feel that she was part of a whole family  once  again.
    She is obviously very devoted to him and he to her. In respect of A the
    evidence was, from all concerned, that it is very difficult for him  to
    communicate with, and trust, others.  And yet he  has  built  a  strong
    relationship of trust with the Appellant.  His own father believes that
    A would be "devastated" if the Appellant were to be removed  and  there
    was no evidence before  me  to  contradict  that  powerful  assessment.
    Ultimately I am asked to decide whether these children should  pay  the
    price for the fact that the Appellant was foolish enough to use a proxy
    test taker back in 2012.     Having  considered  all  of  the  evidence
    before me I find that they should not. Even when balanced  against  the
    very substantial public interest in his removal, their  best  interests
    prevail: it would be unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  children  to  live
    without him now.


50. This is not a  deportation,  but  on  the  evidence  I  find  that  the
    Appellant could meet that higher test. In light of  those  findings  it
    must be disproportionate to refuse him leave to remain on human  rights
    grounds.
