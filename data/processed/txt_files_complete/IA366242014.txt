                                     LM
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms R. Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A. Williams, of Andrew Williams, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of  State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal
         against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Birkby, who, by a
         determination promulgated on 14 January 2015, allowed  LM's  appeal
         against refusal to grant him indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the
         basis of  10  years  continuous  lawful  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom.

      2. That means, of course, that LM is the respondent before  the  Upper
         Tribunal and it is the Secretary of State that  is  the  appellant.
         But for ease of reference, as we shall be reproducing extracts from
         the determination of the First-tier Tribunal, we  shall  refer  the
         parties as they were below so that references  to  "the  appellant"
         are to LM and references to "the respondent" are to  the  Secretary
         of State.

      3. The appellant, who is a citizen of the USA born on 24 October 1951,
         arrived in the United Kingdom on 21 May 2004 with  entry  clearance
         for the purpose of work.  That  leave  was  progressively  extended
         until 26 July 2014, so that he could continue with  that  work.  He
         was an engineer employed by the government of the USA and  in  that
         capacity was required to travel  frequently.  The  judge  described
         this aspect of the appellant's work as follows:

             "... by reason of his position (he) was expected to travel  to
             areas of conflict  like  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  on  secretive
             military business to fight terrorism..."

      4. Soon after arriving in the United Kingdom in  2004,  the  appellant
         entered into a relationship with  a  British  citizen,  EH.  Having
         heard oral evidence from both of them, the judge accepted that  was
         a genuine and subsisting relationship  amounting  to  family  life.
         Although they cohabited  only  at  weekends,  maintaining  separate
         households as they looked  forward  to  spending  their  retirement
         together in the United Kingdom,  together  they  renovated  one  of
         their  homes  with  a  view  to  living  there  together  once  the
         appellant's employment finally came to an end.

      5. It appears that the appellant and EH have been financially  prudent
         and have provided for themselves  well.  At  paragraph  14  of  his
         determination the judge observed:

             "The Appellant's  home  is  mortgage  free  and  he  also  has
             investment property. His US Social Security pension of  $1,900
             commenced on 1 December 2014. His military  pensions  come  to
             $1,305  per  month  and  they  commence   in   October   2014.
             Furthermore, the Appellant is due to receive a life  insurance
             pension of US$350 per month in November 2016 when he turns 65.
             He has savings of  US$350,000  in  a  savings  plan  but  also
             �30,000 in premium  bonds.  The  Appellant's  partner  had  an
             annual income  for  the  current  financial  year  of  �11,740
             consisting of a state pension and an occupational pension. She
             also had no mortgage at home and had savings of �103,000."

      6. Although the judge found, and was plainly correct to  do  so,  that
         notwithstanding the precise detail of  their  living  arrangements,
         the appellant and EH enjoyed together a strong family  and  private
         life in the United Kingdom, when the appellant made his application
         for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  he  made  no  mention  of   his
         relationship with a British citizen. That was because  he  assumed,
         incorrectly as it turned out, that it would be sufficient  to  make
         his application on the basis of his 10 years  lawful  residence  in
         the United Kingdom.

      7. The respondent refused the application because  it  was  considered
         that the appellant's periods of absences from  the  United  Kingdom
         since he arrived in 2004  meant  that  he  could  not  satisfy  the
         requirements of the applicable immigration rule,  para  276B.  That
         was because, as we have observed, the  nature  of  the  appellant's
         work for the US government meant that he was frequently required to
         travel abroad so that for that reason he  was  outside  the  United
         Kingdom for a total of 398 days and, over the 10  years  since  his
         arrival in  2004,  the  appellant  had  taken  periods  of  holiday
         amounting to a total of 366 days Thus, in all,  the  appellant  has
         been away from the United Kingdom for a total of 764  days  whereas
         the rules allow only for an overall absence of 18  months,  or  540
         days, before continuous lawful residence is considered to have been
         interrupted for this purpose. Paragraph 276B of the rules  provides
         as follows:

             '276B.  The  requirements  to  be  met  by  an  applicant  for
             indefinite leave to remain on the ground of long residence  in
             the United Kingdom are that:

             (i) (a) he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
             residence in the United Kingdom.

             (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons
             why it would be undesirable for him  to  be  given  indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of long residence,  taking  into
             account his:

                  (a) age; and

                  (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

                  (c)  personal  history,  including   character,   conduct,
                  associations and employment record; and

                  (d) domestic circumstances; and

                  (e) compassionate circumstances; and

                  (f) any representations received on the  person's  behalf;
                  and

             (iii) the applicant  does  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the
             general grounds for refusal.

             (iv) the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge  of
             the English language and sufficient knowledge  about  life  in
             the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.

             (v) the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws except that any period of overstaying  for  a
             period of 28 days or less will be  disregarded,  as  will  any
             period of overstaying  between  periods  of  entry  clearance,
             leave to enter or leave to remain of up to  28  days  and  any
             period  of  overstaying  pending  the  determination   of   an
             application made within that 28 day period'

         Paragraph 276A of the rules states, so far as is relevant  to  this
         appeal, that for the purposes of para 276B":

             (a) "continuous  residence"  means  residence  in  the  United
             Kingdom for an unbroken  period,  and  for  these  purposes  a
             period shall not be considered to have been  broken  where  an
             applicant is absent from the United Kingdom for a period of  6
             months or less at any one time, provided that the applicant in
             question has existing limited leave to enter  or  remain  upon
             their departure and return, but shall be  considered  to  have
             been broken if the applicant:

             ...

                  (v) has spent a total of more than 18 months  absent  from
                  the United Kingdom during the period in question.

      8. Despite that, the judge allowed the appeal  under  the  immigration
         rules on the basis that the appellant had demonstrated that he  had
         in fact met the requirements of the rules,  even  if  he  had  been
         absent from the United Kingdom for more than the 540 days permitted
         by paragraph 276A. His reasoning is set out at paragraph 17 of  his
         determination. Although it was accepted that the appellant had been
         outside the United Kingdom for 366 for holidays or  other  personal
         reasons, the judge considered that the remainder of the period  the
         appellant was absent should be  disregarded  for  the  purposes  of
         paragraph 276B because:

             "... the other 398  days  were  due  to  official  travel  ...
             confirmed by the United States Defence Department. It  is  not
             in dispute that the Appellant was in effect lawfully  resident
             in the United Kingdom when he  travelled  outside  the  United
             Kingdom on business. Indeed, part of the time he spent in  the
             United Kingdom  was  in  assisting  the  US  Armed  Forces  in
             Afghanistan which in turn was clearly assisting the UK  forces
             in Afghanistan. I am not satisfied that  the  wording  "absent
             from the United Kingdom" can mean someone who is lawfully  and
             necessarily working for his employer outside the UK, while  at
             that time based in the United Kingdom... "

         The judge illustrated his reasoning process by drawing  an  analogy
         with the work of an airline pilot, who would  necessarily  be  away
         from the United Kingdom in the course of his work, and continued:

             "Whilst it may be argued that  a  person  in  the  Appellant's
             position or indeed an airline pilot would be physically absent
             from the United Kingdom that would not be in reality absent as
             it was not their choice, rather the choice of their employers,
             to be physically absent from the United Kingdom at that  time.
             In those circumstances I have concluded that the fact that the
             Appellant was physically not present  in  the  United  Kingdom
             does not mean that he was "absent" in the full  sense  of  the
             meaning and the implication of the meaning of the word."

         For those reasons the judge regarded the 398 days spent outside the
         United Kingdom while working as an engineer for the  US  government
         as not having been spent outside the United Kingdom at all so  that
         he had spent less than 540 days absent from the United Kingdom  and
         on that basis found that the appellant meant  the  requirements  of
         paragraph 276B and so allowed the appeal.

      9. We are  in  no  doubt  that  in  taking  that  approach  the  judge
         misdirected himself and so made an error of law.

     10. The judge was plainly wrong to say that it is not the choice of the
         appellant or the hypothetical  airline  pilot  to  be  outside  the
         United  Kingdom  when  carrying  out  their  work.  The  choice  of
         employment is theirs and theirs alone. The  appellant  was  not  an
         enlisted serviceman but an employee who engaged in such work  as  a
         matter of personal choice. The fact that his work was  valuable  in
         terms  of  advancing  the  mutual  interests  of  the  US  and   UK
         governments in their efforts to respond  to  terrorism  abroad  was
         not, strictly, relevant to that. The judge also  erred  in  law  in
         concluding that the days spend outside  the  United  Kingdom  while
         working could simply be disregarded. In taking that approach he was
         having no regard to matters that the rules specifically required to
         be considered.

     11. It would have been open to the judge to  conclude  that  discretion
         should have been exercised differently under the rules. He did not,
         however,  take  that  approach.  Instead,  having  found  that  the
         absences for the purpose of work were to be disregarded, that meant
         that the appellant had not spent more than  540  days  outside  the
         United Kingdom and so there was no need to consider the exercise of
         discretion at all.

     12. The judge went on to allow  the  appeal  also  on  the  basis  that
         refusal  to  grant  leave  would  bring  about   an   impermissible
         infringement of rights protected by Article 8 of the  ECHR.  First,
         he said at paragraph 20 of the determination that he was  satisfied
         that the appellant met the requirements of Appendix FM. In doing so
         he  appears  to  have  concerned  himself   only   with   financial
         considerations,  which  plainly  provided  no  obstacle   for   the
         appellant, but the judge did not address the other requirements  to
         be met not least the requirement of Appendix FM that the  applicant
         must have made a  valid  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner, which of course the appellant had not. It  is  plain  that
         the judge erred in law in reaching the conclusion that  the  appeal
         fell to be allowed under Appendix FM of the immigration rules.

     13. In the alternative, the judge explained why the appeal was  allowed
         outside the rules on Article 8  grounds,  on  the  basis  that  the
         circumstances of the appellant  and  his  British  citizen  partner
         disclosed exceptional reasons for doing so as the interference with
         the private and family life they enjoyed  together  in  the  United
         Kingdom was disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued of
         enforcing immigration control.

     14. In our judgement, that conclusion cannot stand  either,  predicated
         as it was on the flawed reasoning that led to the decision to allow
         the appeal under the immigration rules.

     15. For these reasons we set aside the  decision  of  Judge  Birkby  to
         allow the appeal and, having heard submissions  from  both  parties
         and, having admitted further documentary evidence submitted on  the
         appellant's behalf, without objection from Ms Petterson, we proceed
         to decide the appeal afresh.

     16. First, we address  the  application  made  on  the  basis  of  long
         residence under paragraph 276A and 276B of the rules.

     17. It is common ground and agreed between the parties that, in respect
         of an applicant who has spent more than 540 days outside the United
         Kingdom, there remains a discretion  to  be  exercised  within  the
         rules by the decision maker. The existence of  that  discretion  is
         recognised by the respondent in that she has a published policy  as
         to how that discretion is to  be  exercised  and,  indeed,  in  the
         decision  letter  the  respondent  purported   to   exercise   that
         discretion in a manner that was informed by that policy.

     18. A copy of the current policy was provided by Mr Williams. It is not
         at all clear that this was the policy or guidance in force  at  the
         date of the decision, since on its face is a suggestion that it has
         been very recently published. However, no point was taken  in  this
         regard on behalf of the respondent and it is clear that a  form  of
         the policy  was  considered  because  in  the  refusal  letter  the
         respondent said:

             "It is noted from your absences  that  398  days  are  due  to
             official travel which has been confirmed by letters from  your
             employers. The  other  366  days  were  personal  reasons  for
             holidays  and  visiting  your  family.  However  540  days  is
             considered generous and (is) designed to  cover  a  number  of
             eventualities.  With  this  in  mind,  the  reasons  you  have
             provided are not considered to be exceptional  such  that  the
             requirement to be not absent for more than 540 days should  be
             waved."

     19. The respondent's policy, expressed as guidance to decision  makers,
         includes, now at least, this (with emphasis added):

             'If the applicant has been absent from the UK for more than  6
             months in one period and more than 18  months  in  total,  the
             application should normally be refused.  However,  it  may  be
             appropriate to exercise discretion  over  excess  absences  in
             compelling or compassionate circumstances, for  example  where
             the applicant was prevented from returning to the  UK  through
             unavoidable circumstances.

             ...

             Things to  consider  when  assessing  if  the  absence(s)  was
             compelling or compassionate are:

                . For all cases - you must consider whether  the  individual
                  returned to the UK within a reasonable time once they were
                  able to do so

                . For the single absence over 180 days:

                    o You must consider how much of the absence was due  to
                      compelling circumstances and  whether  the  applicant
                      returned to the UK as soon as they were able to do so

                    o You must also consider the reasons for the absence

                . For overall absences of 540 days in the 10 year period:

                    o You  must  consider  whether  the  long  absence  (or
                      absences) that pushed the applicant  over  the  limit
                      happened towards the start or  end  of  the  10  year
                      residence period, and how soon they will be  able  to
                      meet that requirements

                    o If the  absences  were  towards  the  start  of  that
                      period,  the  person  may  be  able   to   meet   the
                      requirements in the near  future,  and  so  could  be
                      expected to apply when they meet the requirements

                    o However, if the absences were recent, the person will
                      not qualify for a long time, and so you must consider
                      whether    there    are    particularly    compelling
                      circumstances

             All  of  these  factors  must  be  considered  together   when
             determining whether it is reasonable to exercise discretion.'

     20. We do not find that any ambiguity about the version of  the  policy
         in force at the  date  of  the  decision  creates  any  difficulty.
         Plainly, once  a  decision  maker  embarks  upon  the  exercise  of
         considering whether discretion should be exercised in favour of  an
         applicant who has spent more  than  540  days  outside  the  United
         Kingdom, the reason for those absences and the question of  whether
         there are any compelling circumstances are material  considerations
         that must be taken into account.

     21. The position in this application was stark. The judge has  made  an
         unchallenged finding of fact that in his work for the US government
         outside the United Kingdom, including in Afghanistan and Iraq,  the
         appellant was engaging in activities that advanced the interests of
         both the  US  and  the  UK  forces  in  Afghanistan  and  so  these
         activities advanced the interests of the United Kingdom government.
         Other than being absent from the United Kingdom for more  than  540
         days during the ten year period of lawful residence, in every other
         respect the  applicant  met  the  requirements  of  the  applicable
         immigration rule. It is not apparent that any regard had  been  had
         for the reasons for the absences  other  than  that  they  were  in
         connection with the appellant's employment. No regard  was  had  to
         the nature of  the  employment,  the  circumstances  in  which  the
         appellant was employed or the value to the United  Kingdom  of  his
         activities abroad. That  is  despite  the  fact  that  there  is  a
         specific requirement within the rule itself to have regard  to  the
         applicant's  "personal  history,  including   character,   conduct,
         associations and employment record".

     22. We are entirely satisfied that, to use the language of  section  84
         of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  the  person
         taking the decision should have exercised differently a  discretion
         conferred by the immigration rules. In the unusual circumstances of
         this application there is, in our judgement, only  one  sustainable
         outcome of the exercise of discretion under the rule  and  that  is
         one in the appellant's favour.

     23. That is probably enough to dispose of this appeal, which  falls  to
         be allowed on the basis that the appellant meets the requirement of
         the rules because his ten years' lawful and continuous residence in
         the United Kingdom is not to be considered to have been interrupted
         by absences of more  than  540  days.  However,  for  the  sake  of
         completeness we record also that,  although  the  appellant  cannot
         meet the requirements of Appendix FM of the immigration rules,  not
         least because he has not  made  a  valid  application  under  those
         provisions, as he does  meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules  in
         respect of his application for leave to remain on the basis of long
         residence,  refusal  to  grant  leave  to  remain  brings  about  a
         disproportionate interference with his right  to  respect  for  the
         family and private life he and his partner enjoy  together  in  the
         United Kingdom.

Summary of decisions:

     24. The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and  the  decision  to
         allow the appeal cannot stand. To that extent  the  appeal  of  the
         Secretary of State is allowed and the decision of Judge  Birkby  to
         allow the appeal is set aside.

     25. We substitute a fresh  decision  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
         immigration rules and on human rights grounds.
