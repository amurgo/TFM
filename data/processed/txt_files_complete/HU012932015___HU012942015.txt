For the appellant:      Unrepresented, but sponsor attended
For the respondent:     Mr A McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS
 (as amended pursuant to rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
             Rules 2008; amendments are in bold and underlined)


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI2008/269) an Anonymity Order is made. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  Court
orders otherwise, no report of any proceedings or any  form  of  publication
thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original  Appellant.  This
prohibition applies to, amongst others, all parties.

       1. I have anonymised the  appellants'  names  because  this  decision
          refers to the circumstances of the  first  appellant's  two  minor
          children: the second appellant and a son, in relation to whom,  an
          appeal against the refusal of entry clearance  was  allowed  in  a
          First-tier Tribunal decision dated 7  July  2013  (OA/17849/2013).
          The sponsor is the husband of the first appellant  and  father  of
          the second appellant.

Summary of entry clearance process

       2. The appellants are citizens of Nigeria.  The  sponsor  is  settled
          in the  UK.   The  remaining  members  of  his  family  reside  in
          Nigeria.  In an application dated 30  March  2015  the  appellants
          applied to join their husband / father in the UK pursuant  to  the
          Immigration Rules.  The relevant application form relies upon  the
          sponsor's salaried employment in the UK.  It is  claimed  that  he
          is the CEO of two companies ([ ] Ltd and [ ] Limited) and earns  a
          total of ï¿½44,000 on  a  PAYE  basis,  albeit  he  also  has  self-
          employment.


       3. In a decision dated 15  June  2015  the  entry  clearance  officer
          refused the application on financial grounds only.   In  so  doing
          it was assumed that the application was made on the basis  of  the
          sponsor's self-employment.  It was therefore  considered  as  such
          and  refused  because  of  a  failure  to  provide  the  specified
          evidence in support of self-employment.

       4. In the appeal grounds submitted on behalf of the appellants  (form
          IAFT-2), three important points were made: (i) the sponsor is  not
          self-employed but a director  and  employee  of  a  company;  (ii)
          detailed evidence in support of the sponsor's salaried  employment
          was attached and listed  within  form  IAFT-2  itself;  (iii)  the
          First-tier Tribunal had allowed the son's appeal in 2014 and  made
          a clear finding of fact that the sponsor was at the  time  of  the
          decision in receipt of a salary from [ ]  Ltd  [14].   The  First-
          tier Tribunal regarded the claim that the sponsor was in  salaried
          employment  to  be  consistent  with  the   documentary   evidence
          available, including bank statements.

Procedural history

       5. In a decision  dated  1  August  2016  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
          Wellesley-Cole  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  in  a   short
          decision.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  was  not  assisted  by  the
          sponsor's non-attendance at the appeal  and  the  absence  of  any
          explanation for this.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that  the
          First-tier Tribunal was particularly assisted by the  respondent's
          representative either.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  summarised  her
          submissions at [4] as follows: "Nothing was submitted in  relation
          to the finances, nor were any documents provided".


       6. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal  on  the  basis  that
          there was insufficient documentary evidence to support  the  claim
          that the sponsor was self-employed [5].


       7. In a decision dated 16 February 2017 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Deans
          granted permission to appeal observing that it was  arguable  that
          additional documentary evidence  may  not  have  been  taken  into
          account.

       8. The SSHD submitted a rule 24 notice  dated  22  February  2017  in
          which  she  submitted  that  there  was  no  further   documentary
          evidence to consider.

Hearing

       9. At the beginning of the  hearing  Mr  McVeety  accepted  that  the
          appeal was unopposed and the decision needs to be  remade  in  its
          entirety.  He was entirely correct to do so for  the  reasons  set
          out below.


      10. Mr McVeety also agreed that the error of  law  is  such  that  the
          decision needs to be remade completely  -  the  hearing  has  been
          infected by procedural unfairness.  I have had regard to para  7.2
          of the relevant Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  and  the
          nature and extent of the factual  findings  required  in  remaking
          the decision, and I have decided that this is an appropriate  case
          to remit to the First-tier Tribunal.

Error of law discussion

      11. I can state my reasons briefly given the respondent's  concession.
           The First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  take  into  account  crucial
          information available to it as follows:


              i)  the  appellants  relied  upon   the   sponsor's   salaried
                 employment, not his self-employment - this was  made  clear
                 in the entry clearance application form and form IAFT-2;


             ii) documentary evidence in support of the  sponsor's  salaried
                 employment attached to form IAFT-2;

            iii) the First-tier Tribunal decision dated 2 July 2014 allowing
                 the son's appeal and finding that the sponsor  was  at  the
                 time of the decision in receipt of a salary from [ ] Ltd.

      12. None of these matters seems to have been drawn  to  the  attention
          of the First-tier Tribunal  by  the  respondent's  representative.
          It is difficult to see why not.  Whatever the reason for  it,  the
          First-tier Tribunal  determined  the  appeal  without  considering
          available crucial information, relevant to the issues in dispute.

Final points

      13. Mr McVeety acknowledged that the entry clearance  officer  appears
          to have decided the claim on the basis of self-employment and  not
          salaried employment, and this has not been corrected at the  entry
          clearance  manager  review  stage.   In  those  circumstances,  he
          wished to take instructions regarding withdrawing the decision  so
          that it could be reconsidered  on  the  correct  basis,  but  that
          because it is an entry clearance case he needed  further  time  to
          do so.  I have therefore included  a  direction  to  address  this
          eventuality below.


      14. The sponsor asked me to note  that  he  now  lives  and  works  in
          London.  I have  updated  the  file  to  this  effect.   In  these
          circumstances,  it  was  agreed  that  the   hearing   should   be
          transferred to Taylor House, London.

Decision

      15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  a
          material error of law.  Its  decision  cannot  stand  and  is  set
          aside.

      16. The appeal shall be remade by the First-tier Tribunal de novo.

Directions

   1) The respondent shall file and serve within 14 days of  the  date  this
      decision is sent a position statement outlining  an  updated  position
      regarding the matters set out above, particularly at [13];

   2) The appeal is transferred to Taylor House, London.
