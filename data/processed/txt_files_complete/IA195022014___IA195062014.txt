                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr R Sharma, instructed by Charles Simmons
Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ruchi Ruchi, date of birth  11.2.89,  and  Anand  Singh,
    date of birth 25.5.82, are citizens of India.

 2. The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Manuell promulgated  23.2.15,  allowing  the  claimants'
    linked appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of  State,  dated
    10.4.14, to refuse their applications for leave to remain (LTR) in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 entrepreneur and dependant.  The Judge heard
    the appeal on 28.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    23.4.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I found that there were such errors of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  that  the  decision  of  Judge
    Manuell should be set aside,  to  be  remade  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    reserved to myself.

 5. In summary, although the refusal was for 'non-points scoring  reasons,'
    pursuant to section 85A(4) of the 2002 Act,  and  following  Ahmed  and
    another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT  00365  (IAC),  I  found
    that it was an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to  take
    into account evidence other than that  which  was  submitted  with  the
    application, or at least before the Secretary of State at the time  the
    decision was made on 10.4.14. In this case, before making her decision,
    the Secretary of State invited the  claimants  for  interview.  I  also
    found that there was nothing procedurally unfair  about  that  process,
    particularly since paragraph 245DD(h) makes it clear that an  applicant
    has to satisfy the Secretary of State on the balance  of  probabilities
    that the application is genuine and credible.

 6. As the First-tier Tribunal judge referred to at  �4  of  the  decision,
    under section 85(4) of the 2002 Act, the ability  of  the  Tribunal  to
    consider the circumstances prevailing at the date of the appeal hearing
    is circumscribed by section 85A(4). In  a  points  based  system  (PBS)
    appeal, the Tribunal may consider evidence adduced by an appellant only
    if it was submitted in support of, and  at  the  time  of  making,  the
    application to which the immigration  decision  related.  Despite  that
    prohibition, at �12 Judge Manuell considered that "Since the respondent
    had chosen to challenge  the  substance  of  the  business  on  general
    grounds the  appellant  was  free  to  produce  additional  documentary
    evidence to rebut the respondent's allegations." This may thought to be
    justified by a reading of section 85A(4)(d), which states that evidence
    may be considered if it is adduced in connection with the Secretary  of
    State's reliance on a discretion under immigration rules, or compliance
    with a requirement of immigration rules, to refuse  an  application  on
    grounds not related to the acquisition of  "point"  under  the  "Points
    Based System."

 7. However, this very issue arose, in a case almost on all fours with  the
    present appeal  in Ahmed and another (PBS: admissible evidence)  [2014]
    UKUT 00365 (IAC), where a panel including the Vice President held  that
    "Where a provision of  the  Rules  (such  as  that  in  para  245DD(k))
    provides that points will not be awarded if the decision-maker  is  not
    satisfied as to another (non-points-scoring) aspect of  the  Rule,  the
    non-points-scoring  aspect  and  the   requirement   for   points   are
    inextricably linked. As a result, the prohibition on  new  evidence  in
    s85A(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies  to
    the non-points-scoring aspect  of  the  rule:  the  prohibition  is  in
    relation to new evidence that goes to the scoring of points."

 8. At �5 of Ahmed, the Tribunal explained, "the purpose of that  provision
    is quite clear. It is that where a Points Based application is made and
    refused, the assessment by the judge is to be of the material that  was
    before the decision-maker  rather  than  a  new  consideration  of  new
    material. In other words the appeal if it is successful is on the basis
    that the decision-maker with the material before him should have made a
    different decision, not on the basis that a different way of presenting
    the application would have produced a different decision."

 9.  Ahmed related to exactly the same reason for refusal as in the present
    case, reliance on paragraph 245DD(k) for not awarding PBS points.   The
    decision states that, "For the reasons stated earlier in  this  letter,
    under  the  heading  "Non-Points  Scoring  Reasons  for  Refusal",  the
    Secretary of State is not satisfied  as  to  the  genuineness  of  your
    application  and,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  245DD(k)   of   the
    Immigration Rules, no points have been awarded in this area."

10. In Ahmed the First-tier Tribunal Judge took into "material  other  than
    that which was before the decision-maker." Mr Sharma  skilfully  sought
    to distinguish Ahmed by suggesting that it prohibits  only  documentary
    evidence and not oral evidence, and that  in  the  present  appeal  the
    judge was relying on the oral evidence of the claimant(s) in  order  to
    make a credibility finding that differed from that of the Secretary  of
    State. I can see no basis in fact, law or logic  for  making  any  such
    distinction. I do not accept that Ahmed can  be  rationalised  in  that
    way, even though it was not entirely clear what additional evidence had
    considered. I pointed Mr Sharma to �8 of Ahmed, where the Tribunal held
    that the judge "is prohibited from hearing evidence which  does  go  to
    the acquisition of points. On the basis of the principle set out at  �5
    of Ahmed, there is no purpose in considering any oral evidence  at  all
    in relation to a non-points-scoring issue that  is  relied  on  not  to
    award points.

11. Neither did I accept the submission of Mr Sharma that, based  on  Naved
    (Student -fairness -notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC), that it the
    decision is unfair. Naved held that fairness requires the Secretary  of
    State to give an  applicant  an  opportunity  to  address  grounds  for
    refusal, of which he did not know and could  not  have  known,  failing
    which the resulting decision may be set aside on appeal as contrary  to
    law (without contravening the provisions of  s85A  of  the  Nationality
    Asylum and Immigration Act 2002)." However, the Secretary of State  did
    give the claimants the opportunity to address the concerns, by inviting
    them for interview. There was nothing  procedurally  unfair  about  the
    process of inviting for interview before making a decision based  on  a
    non-points-scoring issue, especially since 245DD(h) sets  out  for  all
    applicants that the Secretary of State  has  to  be  satisfied  on  the
    balance of probabilities that  the  application  is  genuine,  and  the
    criteria by which that assessment is to be made.

12. I can see no basis at all for distinguishing  Ahmed  from  the  present
    case. It follows that the decision must be set aside to  be  remade.  I
    would have proceeded to remaking the decision at the  same  hearing  of
    15.9.15, given that it necessarily followed from Ahmed that  there  was
    no purpose in further oral evidence.  At  �5  of  Ahmed,  the  Tribunal
    explained that, "...where  a  Points  Based  application  is  made  and
    refused, the assessment by the judge is to be of the material that  was
    before the decision-maker  rather  than  a  new  consideration  of  new
    material. In other words the appeal if it is successful is on the basis
    that the decision-maker with the material before him should have made a
    different decision, not on the basis that a different way of presenting
    the application would have produced a different decision."

13. However, as explained in �16 of my error of law decision,  it  was  not
    entirely clear what material had been submitted  with  the  application
    and that which had been submitted post decision. The  refusal  decision
    sets out those documents which had been considered by the Secretary  of
    State, but Mr Sharma submitted that such a list  may  not  be  entirely
    reliable. I therefore agreed,  somewhat  reluctantly,  to  adjourn  the
    remaking of the decision, issuing directions for each  party  to  lodge
    and serve on each other a comprehensive list of the  documents  alleged
    to have  been  submitted  with  the  application  made  by  the  second
    claimant. It was not necessary to reserve  the  appeal  bundles  and  I
    directed that reference to the pagination of  the  documents  contained
    within the First-tier Tribunal appeal bundles would suffice.

14. There was no compliance with the direction by the Secretary  of  State,
    and the late-served letter from the claimants'  representatives,  dated
    20.10.15, purporting to "clarify what exactly  the  appellant  provided
    with the initial application," proved to be woefully inaccurate and not
    at all helpful to the purpose of issuing the directions,  combining  as
    it did in the list some documents that were,  as  Mr  Sharma  accepted,
    clearly produced post application, with those that were submitted  with
    the application. It took some time at the  hearing  to  ascertain  that
    many of the  documents  listed  in  the  letter  could  not  have  been
    submitted with the application, as they  were  only  created  or  dated
    after the application was  submitted  on  9.9.13.  In  fact,  the  list
    contained within the refusal decision proved to be more accurate.

15. For example, the representative's letter purports  that  the  marketing
    material at A286-291 of the claimants' appeal bundle was submitted with
    the application, when it comprises an invoice for  printing  "marketing
    material" dated only 8.7.14, allegedly paid in cash. In  any  event,  I
    doubt the reliability of this invoice, as it does not  state  how  many
    documents were printed. It is followed in the bundle by what appears to
    be a copy of a leaflet printed for what  Mr  Sharma  described  as  the
    unfortunately named ASS Consultants Ltd. Mr Sharma was unable to  agree
    that this was the leaflet produced as a result of that invoice, but the
    evidence rather suggests that it is, and in the absence of any evidence
    to the contrary, I so find. It follows that this evidence including the
    leaflet could not have been before the  Secretary  of  State  when  the
    decision was made in April  2014,  but  has  been  produced  since  the
    refusal and should be excluded from consideration  as  to  whether  the
    claimants met the requirements of the Rules.

16. In passing, I observe that the very production of  this  post  decision
    leaflet evidence begs the further and significant question as to why it
    was produced after refusal and before appeal. The  claimants  submitted
    no evidence of any other leaflet which would support the claim made  in
    interview that 50,000 leaflets had been distributed prior to the making
    of the application. It is  curious  that  even  though  the  claimants'
    appeal  bundle  contained  many  documents  produced  long  after   the
    application and even after the decision of the Secretary of State,  the
    claimants did not trouble to include in the First-tier Tribunal  appeal
    bundle evidence addressing many of the reasons  for  refusal,  such  as
    evidence of the leaflet distributed, even though, as I  have  ruled  in
    the error of law decision, such evidence cannot be taken into account.

17. Paragraph 245DD(h)  provides  that  the  Secretary  of  State  must  be
    satisfied  that  the  applicant  genuinely  intends  and  is  able   to
    establish, take over or become a director of one or more businesses  in
    the UK within 6 months, or has done so and continues  to  operate  that
    business or those businesses. Under 245DD(i), in making that assessment
    the Secretary of State will assess the balance of  probabilities.  Such
    an  assessment  involves  more  than  merely  production  of  specified
    documents. In making the assessment the Secretary  of  State  may  take
    into account the factors set out under 245DD(i).

18. It is worth noting that under 245DD(j) the Secretary of State  reserves
    the right to request additional information and evidence to support the
    assessment in (h). 245DD(m) also  provides  that  the  applicant  must,
    unless he provides a reasonable explanation, comply  with  any  request
    made by the Secretary of State to attend for interview.  The  interview
    is thus part of the process envisaged by the Rules. Paragraph  245DD(k)
    provides that if the Secretary of  State  is  not  satisfied  with  the
    genuineness  of  the  application  in  relation  to  a   points-scoring
    requirement in Appendix A,  those  points  will  not  be  awarded.  The
    obvious consequence of that will be the refusal of the application.

19. It does not appear that the Secretary of State  requested  any  further
    evidence  in  this  case,  but  did  invite  the  second  claimant  for
    interview, which took place on 19.3.14. In remaking the decision in the
    appeal I thus have to decide whether, on the  basis  of  the  documents
    submitted with the application and the second claimant's  responses  to
    questions in interview, the Secretary  of  State  should  have  made  a
    different decision when  assessing  on  the  balance  of  probabilities
    whether the second claimant is a genuine entrepreneur, and  did  so  by
    taking into account certain of the  factors  set  out  under  paragraph
    245DD(i), including the viability and credibility of the business plans
    and market research, as explained in the refusal decision.

20. For the reasons set out herein,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  claimants
    failed to demonstrate on evidence submitted with the application and on
    the content of the interview and on the balance of  probabilities  that
    the application is genuine and that the  business  plan  is  viable  or
    credible.

21. In respect of the viability and credibility of the business  plans  and
    market research, the claimants asserted that 50,000 leaflets  had  been
    distributed and that Mr Singh had  interviewed  30  people.  As  stated
    above, on the limited evidence there  is  no  evidence  that  any  such
    leaflets existed, or were printed, or distributed; the assertion  rests
    on the claim alone. As the refusal decision set out, Mr Singh  did  not
    state where the leaflets were distributed and produced no  evidence  to
    enable the Secretary of State to be satisfied that any market  research
    or  the  acquisition  of  primary  data  had  taken  place,  making  it
    impossible to  assess  the  viability  or  credibility  of  the  market
    research. I accept that  he  was  not  asked  in  interview  where  the
    leaflets were distributed, but it is the absence of evidence as a whole
    as to market research which is relied on in the refusal  decision,  not
    simply the location of distribution of leaflets.

22. Whilst there is no prohibition on Mr Singh using the Internet  and  his
    own dissertation as source of secondary data, the  point  made  in  the
    refusal decision is that he has done nothing other than  copy  Internet
    passages and his own dissertation into the business plan. It is for the
    claimant  to  demonstrate  the  viability  and  credibility  of  market
    research. I find that his actions, taken as a whole in the  context  of
    the evidence in the round, do not demonstrate any  viable  or  credible
    market research.

23. The refusal decision relies on the fact that the business has not  been
    set up. Mr Sharma submitted that it was an entirely sensible course  of
    action to await the grant of leave before taking substantive  steps  to
    set up the business. However, the claimants' case  is  that  they  have
    taken substantial steps. Although the business has  not  been  formally
    set up, they have been advertising and even entered into a contract. He
    had published one Gumtree advert  and  claims  to  have  advertised  on
    Facebook.

24. I have grave concerns as to the reliability  of  the  evidence  and  in
    particular as to the claimed contract, purported to  be  dated  9.9.13,
    shortly before the application was made.

25. The services offered set out are those lifted word for  word  from  the
    generic Home Office SOC code website for  Code  2436  for  construction
    project  managers  and  related  professionals,  rather  than  anything
    specifically adapted to the claimants' particular proposed business. In
    my view this is no more than  a  poor  attempt  to  try  and  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules and not demonstrative of a genuine business.

26. There is no credible evidence that  the  claimants  have  any  relevant
    qualification to operate a business as a building contract manager.  Mr
    Singh has a degree in personal management HR, and a masters in Business
    Administration. He claims to have worked as a labour supervisor and  as
    a site access controller at a railway station, maintaining  records  of
    those coming and going and maintaining the fire alarms.  Mr  Singh  has
    not demonstrated how this apparently unskilled work  qualifies  him  by
    experience for managing large construction projects. I find that he has
    little relevant experience at all and none which relates to  management
    of contracts, and there was no evidence of any of this  so-called  work
    experience submitted with the application.

27. The company has been registered at Companies House, but it is clear the
    purported business is not in a position to  operate  professionally  as
    claimed. I have  grave  concerns  that  the  claimants  claim  to  have
    embarked on providing professional services when they do not  hold  any
    public liability insurance for doing so, having only allegedly taken  a
    few quotes. Neither  do  the  claimants  have  any  health  and  safety
    training, experience or qualifications. Neither is there  any  evidence
    that the business is registered with any  supervisory  or  professional
    body for the industry in which it intends to operate. Neither  do  they
    have any business premises, but claim to be working from  home.  Whilst
    working from home is not proscribed, taking the  evidence  taken  as  a
    whole, strongly suggests little effort has been put into establishing a
    genuine, credible and viable business. Mr Sharma sought to rely on  the
    work experience evidence at A287, but it appears that this is also post-
    application evidence.

28. The refusal decision also points out a number  of  concerns  about  the
    submitted contract. Mr Singh has not provided any credible  explanation
    in interview as to how this contact came about. His answers  are  vague
    and lacking in detail. The contract refers to being paid  7%,  but  the
    contact does not set out any detail of the fee to be charged.  I  found
    the claimant's answer at Q15 as being 7% of the service fee "apart from
    the payment" as entirely vague and lacking in clarity.  Neither  did  I
    accept Mr Sharma's explanation that paragraph 2.2 of the  contract  (at
    A235) provides any meaningful answer. The  suggestion  that  the  other
    party reimburses the costs disbursed  by  the  company  plus  7%  makes
    little sense in the light of Mr Singh's answer in interview. I  am  not
    satisfied that Mr Singh in fact understood it in the same way Mr Sharma
    submitted it should be interpreted.

29. The interview provided Mr Singh with the opportunity  to  elaborate  on
    his  application.  There  was  nothing  unfair  about  the   open-ended
    questions asked. I reject the  submission  that  he  should  have  been
    provided information in advance as to the questions asked or that it is
    unfair to rely on the absence  of  information  not  asked  of  him  in
    interview. It  is  clear  from  the  Rules  that  it  was  for  him  to
    demonstrate on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  business  is
    credible. It is obvious that what is required is an overall  assessment
    of the application  and  business  proposal,  taking  the  evidence  in
    context and as a whole. To that extent whilst  individual  elements  of
    the refusal decision  might  be  picked  apart  or  criticised,  it  is
    important not to lose sight  of  the  fact  that  the  purpose  of  the
    viability  and  credibility  requirements  are  to  enable  an  overall
    assessment of the application.  In any event, I  make  the  observation
    that Mr Singh he did not seek to provide any further evidence after his
    interview and before the decision was made. Further, even though it  is
    not admissible, the post-decision evidence he has attempted to rely  on
    does not in fact provide satisfactory answers to the issues raised, all
    of which rather suggests that advance notice of the questions or issues
    would have changed little in the outcome of the application.

30. As Mr Tarlow pointed out, Mr Singh made application for leave to remain
    as an entrepreneur, a person expected to not only  have  the  financial
    means but the business acumen to operate a  business  in  the  UK,  the
    burden of  which  falls  on  him  to  demonstrate  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities,  assessed  by  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the
    business plan and  the  application.  However,  having  considered  the
    application as a whole, I am fully satisfied that this is not a genuine
    application at all. It is, in my view, no more than a poor  attempt  to
    meet the criteria of the Rules by vague, generalised and what can  only
    be described as very weak  evidence.  I  thus  find  the  Secretary  of
    State's concerns about the viability  and  credibility  of  Mr  Singh's
    proposal entirely well-founded. Taken as  a  whole,  I  find,  for  the
    reasons set out, including those relied by the Secretary of State, that
    the application as made, together with  the  interview,  excluding  the
    post-decision evidence,  is  neither  viable  nor  credible.  Thus  the
    decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  entirely  correct  and  in
    accordance with the law.

Conclusion & Decision:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  such  error
on a point of law that it had to be set aside, to  be  remade.  In  remaking
the decision in the linked appeals I find that the claimants have failed  to
demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the application is  genuine
or that the business plan is viable or credible. Ms Ruchi's appeal fails  in
consequence of the failure of Mr Singh's appeal.



The appeal of each claimant is dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed.
