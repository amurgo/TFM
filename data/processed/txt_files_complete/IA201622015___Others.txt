                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M. Iqbal, Counsel instructed by West Ham
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer

Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves minor children. I find that it is appropriate to continue  the
order.  Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
appellants are granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.  This
direction applies both to the appellants and to the respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellants entered the UK on  22  October  2011  with  EEA  family
    permits, which were valid until 27  March  2012.   At  the  time  their
    mother was the family member (spouse)  of  an  EEA  national.  She  was
    issued with a residence card in 2010, which was valid until 01 December
    2015.

2.    The appellants sought a residence card as family  members  on  several
    occasions. An initial application made on 13 January 2012 was rejected.
    The second application made on 16 April 2012 was  refused  on  05  July
    2012 and appeal rights were  exhausted  on  28  November  2012.  On  02
    February 2013 the appellants made a further application for a residence
    card, which was refused on 27  August  2013.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 10 October 2014 but the
    Secretary of State appealed against the First-tier  Tribunal  decision.
    On 15 January  2015  the  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  decision  involved  the  making   of   an   error   of   law.
    Unfortunately, the copy of the Upper Tribunal's subsequent reasons  for
    remaking the decision promulgated on 10 April 2015 is incomplete  so  I
    do not know the exact outcome of the appeal.

3.    It is unclear what happened to the  appeal  thereafter  but  it  seems
    that the Secretary of State was required  to  reconsider  the  decision
    with  reference  to  her  duties  under  section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. A further decision was made on 13
    May 2015 refusing to grant residence cards "with reference  to  section
    55". The decision seems to have been treated as an appealable  decision
    and a further appeal was lodged indicating that the  appellants  wanted
    the appeal to be decided on the papers.

4.    The appellants' representatives  state  that  they  made  two  written
    requests to the First-tier Tribunal on 24 June 2015 and  29  July  2015
    for the appeal to be listed for oral hearing.  The  appellants  produce
    copies of those letters and certificates of posting. It  is  not  known
    whether that correspondence was lost in the post or there was an  error
    on the part of the First-tier Tribunal but the case was not listed  for
    hearing as requested. On 30 September 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kanagaratnam dismissed the appeals on the papers.

5.     The  appellants  appealed  on  the  ground  that  the  decision   was
    procedurally unfair because the appeal was determined without  an  oral
    hearing.

6.    By the time the appeal  was  listed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  the
    family circumstances had changed. There is evidence to  show  that  the
    appellants' mother has been issued with a  residence  card  recognising
    her right of  permanent  residence  in  the  UK.  Mr  Wilding  sensibly
    accepted that there was an error of law on procedural grounds,  and  in
    light of the further developments, suggested  that  it  was  no  longer
    necessary for the appeal to be relisted for hearing. He  accepted  that
    they are now able to show that they have a retained right of  residence
    by virtue of regulation 10(6)(b) of The Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 and suggested that the decision should be remade
    and the appeal allowed. The parties were in agreement.

7.    For the reasons outlined above I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a point of law  in
    relation to a matter of procedural fairness. I set aside  the  decision
    and allow the appeal based on the concession  made  by  the  respondent
    that the appellants now meet the requirements of  the  EEA  Regulations
    2006.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

I remake the decision and ALLOW the appeal under the EEA Regulations 2006
