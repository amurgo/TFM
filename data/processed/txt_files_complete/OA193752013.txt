Solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I see no need for and do not make an  order  restricting  reporting  in
    this case.

 2. The respondent to this appeal, hereinafter "the claimant", is a citizen
    of Bangladesh who was born in 1989.  She appealed successfully  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal a decision of the  present  appellant,  hereinafter
    "the Entry Clearance Officer" refusing  her  entry  clearance  for  the
    purpose of settlement in the United Kingdom as a wife.  There  are  two
    decisions that I have to consider.  The first  is  dated  16  September
    2013 and a copy was handed  to  the  claimant  on  23  September  2013.
    According to that  decision  the  application  was  refused  under  EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of HC 395.  This is because the Entry Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that she had proved  her  competence  in  the
    English language in the required way.

 3. The decision also raised concerns about the sponsor's means but said:

         "However, no final determination has been made at this stage as  to
         whether you meet the income  threshold  and/or  related  evidential
         requirements.  This is because the courts have not yet decided  the
         outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal in a legal challenge  to
         the income threshold requirement.  More information about  this  is
         set out on the Home Office website."

 4. This was clearly a reference to the anticipated decision of  the  Court
    of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) and Others, R (on the application of) v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985 which ruled against a challenge to  the  lawfulness
    of a minimum income threshold of �18,600.

 5. Judgment in that case was given on 11 July 2014  and  on  22  September
    2014 the Entry Clearance Officer made a further decision.  It  is  made
    quite plain in the preamble to that decision that  the  refusal  notice
    issued on 16 September 2013 had reached no conclusion on the claimant's
    ability to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It  also
    made  it  plain  that  the  decision  of  22  September  2014  was  the
    anticipated final determination of the point.

 6. Although the "Refusal of Entry Clearance" explains the  nature  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's concerns it does  not  state  expressly  what
    part of which Rules the claimant failed to satisfy.

 7. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal where many of the points
    were resolved in the claimant's favour.  When the appeal was  heard  in
    October  2014  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  represented  by   a
    particularly experienced Presenting Officer.  At paragraph  17  of  its
    determination the First-tier Tribunal said:

         "During this appeal the Home Office Presenting  Officer  raised  an
         additional issue (not previously raised by  the  ECO  and/or  Entry
         Clearance Manager in terms of the requirements  under  subparagraph
         (n) of evidence relating to Financial Requirements  under  Appendix
         FM-SE; this states that -

         'the gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's bank statement show the net amount which  relates  to  the
         gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant  specified
         provision in relation to the specified bank statements in  relation
         to non-employment income).  Otherwise only the net amount shown  on
         the specified bank statements may be counted'.

         Having raised this issue, the Home Office  Presenting  Officer  was
         not however in a position to establish that this was a  requirement
         applicable at the date of the Appellant's  application  and/or  the
         ECO's  decision.   Further  and  in  any  event,  in  my  judgment,
         considering the whole of the documentary evidence placed before  me
         in the round, I am satisfied that the Sponsor earned in  excess  of
         the �18,600.00 gross minimum threshold - especially in view of  the
         fact that the Appellant's Representative  was  able  to  provide  a
         Schedule of Total Net Pay from both employments (on  the  basis  of
         payslips covering the period December 2012 to May  2013  -  i.e.  a
         period of six months) amounting to �8,758.70. ..."

 8. The First-tier Tribunal then allowed the appeal.

 9. The Rule relied on by the Entry Clearance Officer is correctly cited (I
    think) as FM-SE A1.1.(n). This was added to the Rules by  HC1138  on  6
    April 2014.  The wording of  the  new  paragraph  (n)  is  set  out  at
    paragraph 204 of HC1138 with the instruction that it is inserted  after
    paragraph 1(m).  It is plain  from  paragraph  (b)  under  the  heading
    "Implementation"  of  HC1138"  that  paragraphs  198  to   223   (which
    necessarily includes paragraph 204) shall  apply  to  all  applications
    decided on or after 6 April 2014".

10. Put simply Appendix FM-SE(1)(n) applies in this case.

11. When the First-tier Tribunal Judge gave permission to appeal she said:

         "Given that the sponsor was paid in cash at the material  time  and
         did not deposit his wages from the Bikash Tandoori Restaurant  into
         his bank account in their entirety each week, it is  arguable  that
         the [claimant] was not able to meet the evidential requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE in relation to the submission of corroborating  bank
         statements.  However, at any future  hearing  the  respondent  must
         provide evidence to show that this requirement under Appendix FM-SE
         was in force at the date of  the  ECO's  decision  and  if  so,  to
         provide evidence as to  what  transitional  provisions  might  have
         applied and from when.

12. Before me Mr Parkinson was not able to comply with that direction.  His
    researches had shown that the relevant Rule was in force  at  the  time
    but he could not give me chapter and verse on the point.

13. Judicial harrumphing is more likely to be self-indulgent  than  helpful
    but I feel I  must  add  my  modest  voice  to  the  chorus  of  judges
    complaining  about  the  complexity  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Presenting Officer  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Presenting
    Officer before me have each presented cases before me on many occasions
    and I regard them as experienced and conscientious but they  could  not
    say when the relevant rule came into force.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge clearly did not feel  able  to  address  the  point  at  all  and
    although I have been able to resolve it, I have  had  the  considerable
    benefit of a consolidated version of the Rules  prepared  painstakingly
    by the Legal Research Unit. Even so it has taken at least an hour of my
    time to check and explain the point. I understand that the Secretary of
    State has improved the Home Office website but if  that  is  right  the
    news has not broken through.

14. That said, it is now quite clear to me that the relevant requirement of
    the Rule was in force and the claimant failed to satisfy it.

15. Mr Mustafa made a spirited attempt to justify the First-tier Tribunal's
    decision.

16. He contended that there were in fact two decisions and  the  notice  of
    appeal was only against the first decision made in September 2013.   He
    had not settled the grounds of appeal.  He does not seem to  have  made
    any point about this before the First-tier Tribunal and I do wonder  if
    it had occurred to him when he first argued the case.  Be  that  as  it
    may, it is a point that does not assist  the  claimant.   It  is  quite
    plain from the transitional provisions set  out  in  HC1138  that  sub-
    paragraph "n" was in force then  the  decision  was  made  and  so  the
    claimant has to satisfy it.

17. I do not think  there  is  anything  in  Mr  Mustafa's  point.   As  Mr
    Parkinson emphasised the Entry  Clearance  Officer  never  decided  the
    financial issue and was conspicuously careful to make it plain that the
    point had not been decided in September 2013 and was decided  later  in
    September 2014.  It is a little odd for the Entry Clearance Officer  to
    decline to decide all the points  that  are  necessary  but  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was operating in unusual circumstances and I know  of
    no provision that says that all points must be decided or how it  would
    be of any assistance to the claimant in this appeal if such a provision
    operated.  The fact is that the Rules in force and the House of Commons
    paper bringing it into force made it plain that it applied to decisions
    made after the particular date and this application was  decided  after
    the date.

18. Mr Mustafa also suggested that there was a legitimate expectation  that
    the case would be decided in accordance with the Rules  in  force  when
    the application was made.  I appreciate he is taking every  point  that
    he feels he properly can on behalf of the claimant but  this  point  is
    misconceived.  The only legitimate expectation in  immigration  law  is
    that the application will be decided in  accordance  with  the  law  in
    force at the relevant time and that, absent special provisions, is  not
    at the date of application but the date of decision.

19. Mr Mustafa  referred  me  to  guidance  issued  in  April  2015  headed
    "Immigration Directorate Instruction Family Migration".   At  paragraph
    3.4.2 it  says  that  "decision  makers  are  also  able  to  grant  an
    application despite minor evidential problems (but not where  specified
    evidence is missing entirely)". It is not clear  that  this  gives  any
    power at all to a Tribunal Judge.  Judges have no power to grant  entry
    clearance applications.  Mr Mustafa said there was a 7%  deficiency  in
    approved funds and this was a  minor  evidential  problem.   I  do  not
    agree.  It is a failure to satisfy the Rules.

20. He then referred me to a document headed "Immigration Rules Appendix FM-
    SE D(d)(iii) which provides if the applicant has submitted "a  document
    that does not contain all of the specified information that the missing
    information is verifiable from [other sources] the application  may  be
    granted exceptionally, ...".

21. Again I read this as an enabling provision which means that  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  can  make  exceptional  decisions  without   acting
    unlawfully.  It is not a power given to the Tribunal.  However, even if
    that is wrong, this is not something that would help this claimant.  If
    Parliament had intended form P60 or other evidence of income from a tax
    document, for example, to be sufficient, then that is  what  Parliament
    would have said.  Parliament has set  out  a  procedure  that  must  be
    followed where payment is made in cash and this claimant did not follow
    it.  I see  no  basis  for  saying  that  the  claimant  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Rules.

22. Mr Mustafa sensibly did not contend that the appeal ought to be allowed
    on human rights grounds.  Such an argument had been misconceived and  I
    appreciate his professionalism in not running a point  that  could  not
    possibly bring the result his client wanted.

23. There are slightly concerning elements in this case.  It does  seem  on
    the evidence that the claimant is in  a  genuine  relationship  with  a
    husband who is trying extremely hard to provide for her properly in the
    United Kingdom.  It may well be that he is earning sufficient money but
    he has not complied with the Rules.  The First-tier Tribunal should not
    have said that he did.

Notice of Decision

    I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and I substitute  a
    decision dismissing the claimant's appeal against the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision.
