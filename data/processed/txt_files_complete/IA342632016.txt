Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Sher, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Nigeria  born  on  25  July  1982.  The
    appellant came to the UK on 21 September 2011 having been granted leave
    to enter as a Tier 4 student. She extended her leave,  initially  as  a
    Tier 4 student and then as a visitor until 24 March 2015. On that  date
    she applied for further leave to  remain  as  a  visitor  in  order  to
    receive private medical treatment. Her application  was  refused  on  4
    November 2015. The reasons for refusal letter referred to paragraph  54
    of the Immigration Rules. The appellant had provided a letter with  her
    application stating that she had been diagnosed  with  gallstones.  The
    respondent had written to  the  appellant  on  a  number  of  occasions
    requesting further evidence with regard to the proposed  or  continuing
    treatment,  frequency  of  consultations,  probable  duration  of   the
    treatment and details of the cost. However, satisfactory  evidence  had
    not been received from the appellant. The appellant did  not  meet  the
    requirements of subparagraphs 54(i) to (iv) of the rules. Consideration
    was given to the appellant's right to  enjoy  her  private  life  under
    article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention  by  reference  to  paragraph
    276ADE(1) of the rules. It was not  considered  that  there  were  very
    significant obstacles to the appellant's integration to the country  to
    which she would have to go.

 2. The appellant appealed. Although  she  had  not  mentioned  having  any
    dependent children in her application, at the appeal she stated she had
    three children, born in 2011, 2012 and 2014 respectively.  The  eldest,
    D, was in  primary  school.  The  appellant  appeared  at  the  hearing
    unrepresented. She said the father of her children lived in Nigeria and
    he came to the UK about once a year. The appellant said she had stopped
    working when her visa expired in 2014, since when she had been  relying
    upon food and clothes banks. She said she did not feel safe going  back
    to Nigeria because the father of her children had not wanted  the  last
    child. The children are not familiar with Nigeria.

 3. The appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Raymond  at
    Hatton Cross on 15 February 2017. In a determination promulgated on  31
    May 2017, the Judge dismissed  the  appeal.  His  very  short  decision
    concluded as follows:

    "14. I find by reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and (vi) that there
         would  be  no  very  significant   obstacles   to   the   appellant
         reintegrating with her children in Nigeria, as someone who has  not
         been in the UK for over 20 years, and whose eldest  child  ...  has
         not been in the UK for at  least  7  years.  She  has  achieved  an
         academic qualification which will be of use to her in  working  for
         the future betterment of her children in a country where she  spent
         nigh on 30 years of her life. Also I do not accept that  she  would
         be without the support of the father of her three children who  she
         says resides in Nigeria. I do not accept that the  appellant  feels
         in any way threatened by the father of her three children  who  has
         visited her in the UK. If she felt threatened by him when he was in
         the UK she could have reported him to the police.  I  consider  her
         evidence that they are legally and not "physically"  married,  what
         she meant by this, to be evidence that the appellant was making  up
         as she went along. The appellant also said that she has her parents
         and two brothers in Nigeria. They would also be available to afford
         her son support. Whilst her son [D] has become familiar with school
         in the UK, he is young enough to adapt to life in Nigeria with  his
         mother, quite likely both his parents in fact."

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal because  it
    was arguable that the Judge  had  completely  failed  to  consider  the
    appellant's article 8 rights outside of the rules and in  addition  had
    failed to consider, at all, the best interests of the children.

 5. The respondent filed a rule 24 response opposing the appeal.

 6. I heard submissions from the representatives on  the  question  whether
    the Judge made a material error of law in his decision.

 7. Ms Sher told me the appellant has since given birth to a  fourth  child
    in the UK. Her oral submissions focused on the fact the best  interests
    of the children should have been a primary consideration but the  Judge
    does not allude to this important principle anywhere in  his  decision.
    He makes scant reference to the children. D had been in  the  UK  since
    2012 and was at school. She argued the appeal should  be  remitted  for
    proper consideration of these matters. In particular, it was  necessary
    to make findings on the circumstances which would await the children in
    Nigeria.

 8. Mr Melvin accepted the decision was  "succinct"  but  pointed  out  the
    Judge could only make findings on the evidence he  received,  which  in
    this case was scant. The  Judge  did  not  find  the  appellant  was  a
    truthful witness. He pointed  out  the  appellant  had  chosen  not  to
    disclose the fact she had children to the respondent and only disclosed
    it at the last minute at her appeal. Fundamentally, his point was  that
    the Judge could not have come to any other conclusion than  to  dismiss
    the appeal.

 9. Ms Sher pointed out the appellant had been unrepresented at her appeal.
    I accept  that  is  the  case,  although  I  note  she  was  previously
    represented and a bundle of evidence was filed at the tribunal prior to
    the hearing.

10. I note  the  appellant  prepared  a  witness  statement,  containing  a
    statement of truth.  It  is  exceedingly  short.  In  relation  to  her
    children, all it says is that D was six years of age and was  attending
    primary  school.  His  younger  sister  was  attending   nursery.   She
    continued,

    "6.  My children have integrated into the British culture and would  be
         difficult relocate to Nigeria at  these  crucial  stages  of  their
         lives."

11. In the bundle there was a copy of D's school  report  relating  to  his
    year in the reception class.

12. There is no  getting  away  from  the  fact  the  Judge's  decision  is
    extremely short and fails to follow a  structured  approach.  He  deals
    briefly with the applicable rules relating to the  appellant's  private
    life but he does not apply the family life rules or section 117B of the
    2002 Act. He does not address his mind  to  the  possibility  of  there
    being compelling circumstances. He does not make findings on  the  best
    interests of the children. The decision could therefore be said not  to
    live up to the high standards expected of the tribunal's decisions.  In
    most cases, such paucity of reasoning would lead to the decision  being
    set aside.

13. However, decisions will only be set aside if they  contain  a  material
    error of law. In other words, it must be shown that, but for the error,
    the tribunal might have come to a different decision. In the particular
    circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  has   been
    demonstrated. Though brief, the Judge's findings are sufficient to show
    the appeal could not have succeeded.

14. The Judge was entitled on the sparse evidence provided to find that the
    children's father was supportive and that  the  family  could  relocate
    together in Abuja, where he  lives.  He  was  entitled  to  reject  the
    appellant's claim to fear her husband. Having spent only  5ï¿½  years  in
    the UK and 30 years in Nigeria prior to coming to the UK, the Judge was
    plainly entitled to find the appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    private life rules. At the date of hearing, D, the  eldest  child,  had
    not been living in the UK for a continuous period of  seven  years.  He
    had lived in the UK for only five years at most. None of  the  children
    could gain the protection of section  117B(6)  because  they  were  not
    'qualifying children'. Had the Judge turned his mind to the question of
    the best interests of the children, he can only have found  that  their
    best interests were preserved by their remaining with their mother  and
    returning to live with her and their father. D's educational career was
    in its very earliest stages and  nothing  was  put  forward  which  was
    capable of showing his best interests would be harmed by relocating  to
    Nigeria with the rest of his family. As the Judge found,  he  is  young
    enough to adapt to life in Nigeria.  As  for  the  physical  conditions
    awaiting them, the Judge was  entitled  to  infer  from  the  fact  the
    appellant had been untruthful that there  was  no  reason  to  consider
    there was any risk to the children at all.

15. There is no error of law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  to
    dismiss the appeal shall stand.

16. The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material  error  of  law
and his decision dismissing the appeal is upheld.

No anonymity direction is made.
