Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Jasiri, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
Appellant
For the Respondent:    Miss Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Robertson) who, in a determination promulgated  on
    24th May 2016 dismissed the Appellant's application for entry clearance
    as the spouse of her Sponsor and husband pursuant to the provisions  of
    Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

 2. The background is set out in the determination.   The  Appellant  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan born on 23rd July 1993.  On 23rd February 2012  the
    Appellant married her husband, a British citizen.  The  Appellant  then
    applied for entry clearance as the spouse of her husband, the  Sponsor,
    under the provisions of Appendix FM to the  Immigration  Rules.   In  a
    notice of a decision made on 12th January 2015,  that  application  for
    entry clearance was refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The reasons for refusing the application can be
    summarised as follows.  The Entry Clearance Officer was  not  satisfied
    that the Appellant had provided the  specified  evidence  to  establish
    that the  Appellant  met  the  financial  provisions  of  Appendix  FM,
    paragraph E-ECP.3.1 because she did not supply the evidence required by
    the provisions of Appendix FM-SE, paragraph 7, sub-paragraphs  (e)  and
    (f).  Those paragraphs read as follows:-

         "(e) where the person  holds  or  held  a  separate  business  bank
             account, bank statements for the same twelve month  period  as
             the tax return

         (f)  personal bank statements for the same twelve month  period  as
             the tax return showing that the  income  from  self-employment
             has been paid into an account in the name of the person or  in
             the name of the person and their partner jointly."

     In the reasons given the Entry Clearance Officer stated as follows:-

         "You have submitted business bank statements from your Sponsor  but
         these do not cover a full period of  financial  year  2013/2014  as
         required  by  the  Rules  (Appendix  FM-SE).   You  have  submitted
         business bank statements from your Sponsor but these do  not  cover
         the full period of financial year 2013/2014 and do  not  show  your
         Sponsor's claimed income being paid  into  his  account  over  this
         period, as required by the Rules."

 3. The refusal also considered Article 8 including the best  interests  of
    any child affected by the decision.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  did
    not consider that there were any exceptional circumstances which  might
    warrant a grant of entry clearance outside of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Thus  the  application  was  refused  under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1).

 4. The Appellant submitted Grounds of Appeal on 18th February 2015.  Those
    grounds asserted the following:-

      i) That the Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  failed  to  interpret  the
         purpose and policy behind the new Immigration Rules and Appendix FM-
         SE.  The Respondent failed to apply flexibility in determining  the
         facts and evidence in support of the application and the Rules  had
         been interpreted "very  strictly"  when  there  was  evidence  that
         further investigation could determine that the Sponsor had adequate
         income to support the Appellant.

     ii) The Entry Clearance Officer was wrong to state that he was a  self-
         employed cab driver when he was trading as a  supermarket  and  the
         business bank statements have been provided to confirm  this  along
         with the application.  The Entry Clearance Officer was mistaken and
         incorrect to state that the full bank statements were not  provided
         as they were provided with the application.

    iii) The Entry Clearance Officer was wrong to state that the Sponsor had
         not provided business bank statements for the full  financial  year
         of 2013 and 2014 those were provided with the application.

     iv) The Entry Clearance Officer had a duty to make further enquiries of
         the Sponsor with regards to his gross income.  It was  unreasonable
         to refuse the application on the basis that the gross  turnover  is
         not reflected in the Sponsor's bank statement.  The Entry Clearance
         Officer failed to take into account the  nature  and  type  of  the
         Sponsor's self-employment which by nature was a "cash business" and
         not one  that  would  necessarily  reflect  directly  in  the  bank
         statements.

 5. The appeal came before the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Robertson)  on
    10th May 2016.  In a decision promulgated on 24th May 2016,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  on  human  rights
    grounds.  The  judge  at  paragraph  [9]  of  the  determination,  made
    reference to the issue relating to what documentary evidence  had  been
    provided before the Entry Clearance Officer,  as  the  bundle  did  not
    contain the usual list  of  documents  setting  out  those  which  were
    submitted with the application.  It is  recorded  that  the  Presenting
    Officer was not taking issue as  to  whether  they  were  provided  but
    relied upon the documents that were within the Appellant's bundle.  The
    judge recorded the submission made by the Presenting Officer  that  the
    bank statements did not meet the evidential requirements of Appendix FM
    because they did not support the claim that the Sponsor earned a  gross
    annual income of �18,600  because  this  sum  was  not  paid  into  his
    personal bank account from his business.

 6. Thus the judge heard evidence from the Sponsor and  took  into  account
    the documents that were set out in the Appellant's  bundle  along  with
    the submissions made by each of the advocates.

 7. The judge's analysis of the evidence and his decision and  reasons  are
    set out at paragraphs [12] to [21] relating to  the  Immigration  Rules
    and paragraphs [20] to [26] relating to Article 8.  The judge  accepted
    the Sponsor's evidence that his earnings were from self-employment as a
    sole trader of a supermarket (The 24/7 Convenience Store)  rather  than
    as a cab driver as set out in the original decision.   It  was  further
    accepted by the Sponsor that his personal bank account did not  reflect
    all the income from his business.  As the judge set out paragraph [14],
    the Sponsor's evidence was that his business was run on a  cash  basis,
    that he had takings during the day, mainly cash which would be used  to
    pay for goods bought to sell in the business when he went to  the  cash
    and carry.  He paid for goods in cash.  The  judge  also  recorded  his
    evidence that he would use some of the cash generated by  the  business
    to discharge his own expenses and then deposit any amount that was left
    over into his business or personal account.  He said that  he  did  not
    always deposit takings into his business account  because  it  was  not
    always possible to do this when the business  was  a  24/7  convenience
    store run on a cash basis.

 8. At paragraph [15] the judge dealt with the issue as to whether  or  not
    the documentary evidence adduced established that  the  Sponsor  earned
    the claimed �20,000  per  annum  for  the  tax  year  2013/2014.   When
    considering this issue, the judge observed that this was  a  "technical
    one" based on the interpretation of the provisions of Appendix FM-SE in
    relation to self-employed Sponsors.

 9. To answer this question, the judge considered the submissions  made  by
    each of the advocates.  On behalf of the  Appellant  it  was  submitted
    that there was no requirement in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE for  the
    Appellant's gross income to be paid  into  his  personal  bank  account
    because the provisions of paragraph 7(f) did not  require  all  of  the
    Sponsor's income to be paid into his account.  It was submitted that it
    would be expected that the Sponsor would pay his expenses from the cash
    received before he paid any balance into his personal account.  It  was
    further submitted that the purpose of SA303 and SA302,  was  to  ensure
    that the Sponsor was paying tax on the amount that  he  claimed  to  be
    earning.  It was further submitted that  the  provisions  of  paragraph
    1(n) of Appendix FM-SE did not apply to self-employed income; they only
    applied  to  employment  income.   It  was  also  submitted   that   in
    interpreting the provisions of paragraph 7(f) the plain wording of  the
    Rules must be sensibly applied (applying Odelola  [2009]  UKHL  25  and
    Mahad [2009] UKSC 16.

10. The submissions made by the Presenting Officer were  to  the  contrary.
    It was submitted that the provisions of paragraph 1 of  Appendix  FM-SE
    were  general  provisions,  applicable  to  all  income.   Whilst   the
    Presenting Officer accepted that it was  not  stated  within  paragraph
    7(f) that all the Sponsor's income must to be paid  into  his  personal
    bank account, it was submitted that the specified evidence requirements
    were there to  ensure  that  the  threshold  income  in  E-ECP.3.1  was
    corroborated from a number of sources.  In the  Appellant's  case,  the
    most that was deposited into the Sponsor's personal account was �9,740.



11. The judge's conclusion on this issue is set out at paragraphs  [20]  to
    [21] of the determination.  The judge said this:-

         "[20]    It was stated by Lord Brown in Mahad that -

                  'the Rules are not to be construed with all the strictness
                  applicable to the construction of a statute or a statutory
                  instrument but, instead, sensibly according to the natural
                  and ordinary meaning of the words used,  recognising  that
                  they  are   statements   of   the   Secretary   of   State
                  administrative policy ... the court's task is to  discover
                  from the words used in the Rules  what  the  Secretary  of
                  State must be taken to have intended.'

         [21] I accept the submissions  made  by  Miss  Mepsted  as  to  the
             provisions  of  paragraph  7(f)  of   Appendix   FM-SE.    The
             provisions of paragraph 1(n) are clearly  general  provisions,
             as stated at paragraph 1, and whilst  it  is  clear  that  the
             provisions of paragraph 7(f)  do  not  refer  to  all  of  the
             Sponsor's income being paid  into  his  personal  account,  by
             analogy  neither  do  the  provisions  of  paragraph  6(a)  of
             Appendix FM-SE (which relate to salaried employment)  required
             that all the salary of a Sponsor  in  salaried  employment  be
             paid into a personal bank account.  In each case, it  is  only
             by reference to the overall need  to  establish  from  various
             sources that the income is as claimed that it can be said that
             all the Sponsor's income must be paid into his  account.   The
             forms SA302 and SA303 are simply self declarations  of  income
             and neither is an  independent  source  for  the  purposes  of
             establishing that the Sponsor's income is as claimed.  On  the
             evidence before me, it is not established that  the  Sponsor's
             income meets the threshold requirements of Appendix  FM.   The
             Appellant's appeal  must  therefore  be  dismissed  under  the
             Immigration Rules."

12. At paragraphs [22] to [26] the judge considered the Article  8  issues.
    In this context, he considered the submission made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that the decision to refuse entry on Article  8  grounds  was
    one that "offends against Zambrano".  However, the judge found that the
    Appellant's British national child was not prevented from entering  the
    UK as her father was resident there, it was accepted that he  had  been
    to visit her and her mother three times in  Pakistan  and  during  that
    time he was able to leave his business in the care of employees.  Thus,
    the judge found there was no reason why the child's  father  could  not
    care for her in the UK if she were to  enter  without  her  mother  and
    therefore, the decision did not result in the "denial  of  the  genuine
    enjoyment of the substance of rights conferred by  the  virtue  of  her
    status as a citizen of the Union".  The  judge  accepted  there  was  a
    positive duty to promote family life and that family life  was  enjoyed
    by the Appellant, the  Sponsor  and  their  child.   As  for  the  best
    interests, it was generally accepted that it was in the best  interests
    of the child to be with both her parents.   As  to  the  evidence,  the
    judge found that the child had lived with her mother  since  birth  but
    there was no evidence presented of any difficulties  of  attachment  to
    her father or that he would not be  able  to  care  for  her  emotional
    physical needs if she came to the UK without her mother, other than his
    assertion that he could not  care  for  the  child  because  he  had  a
    business to run.  The judge found that he had employees who had run the
    business in his absence and no evidence was presented  to  support  his
    claim that the business was not as well run  when  he  was  away.   The
    judge found that if his daughter was in the UK he would still  be  able
    to oversee the running of his business.

13. The judge applied the public interest provisions under Section  117  of
    the 2002 Act and found that under Section 117B  the  legitimate  public
    aims are immigration control and the economic wellbeing of the country.
     Whilst the Appellant provided an English language test certificate, it
    had not been established that the Sponsor earned the  threshold  income
    set out in Appendix FM.  The judge went on to state  that  even  if  he
    were to find  that  the  Appellant  was  self-sufficient  applying  the
    decision in AM (Section 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260, the Appellant can
    gain no positive right to a grant of leave from either Section 117B(ii)
    or (iii) whatever the degree of fluency in English or the  strength  of
    his financial resources.  The judge also found that the Appellant had a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child but, it was
    not established that it was unreasonable for the child to  continue  to
    live with her in Pakistan until such time as an appropriate application
    was made with the required supporting evidence.  The judge  found  that
    they had not resided together since the birth of the child who was  now
    3 and was not yet of school age.  The judge did accept that  there  may
    be a temporary separation between the Appellant and her  child  if  the
    child came to the UK before she did but, there was nothing  before  the
    judge to establish that there would be a  permanent  breakdown  in  the
    relationship between the  Appellant  and  her  daughter.   Furthermore,
    there was no evidence to establish that the Appellant could not put  in
    another application with the correct supporting evidence.  In terms  of
    proportionality, taking into account the above circumstances,  weighing
    in the balance the British nationality of the  Sponsor  and  his  young
    child, the judge found that the  interference  was  proportionate  when
    balanced against the legitimate public aims.  The judge found that  the
    Sponsor was aware when he married the Appellant that she would have  to
    satisfy the Immigration Rules for a grant of entry  clearance  and  his
    contention was that he did in fact earn  the  required  income.   Thus,
    their separation was only likely to be for a period of time it takes to
    submit a fresh application with the required  supporting  evidence  and
    for the ECO to make a decision.  Thus the judge  found  there  were  no
    compelling  circumstances  for  a  grant  of  leave  outside   of   the
    Immigration Rules (applying SS (Congo) EWCA Civ 387).

14. The Appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  on  five
    separate grounds.  Those grounds are as follows:-

      a) The judge made a material misdirection in law.  At  paragraph  [21]
         the judge erred in reading the word "all" into  paragraph  7(f)  of
         Appendix FM-SE.  The judge has "done violence to the plain  meaning
         of the Immigration Rules" and imposed a requirement which  was  not
         in the Rules themselves.

      b) The judge made a material misdirection in law at paragraph [21]  in
         applying paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE to a self-employed  case.
         Paragraph 1(n) appears from its plain wording to apply to  employed
         income and not to self-employment.  The judge erred in  finding  it
         applicable in the Appellant's case.

      c) The judge made a material misdirection in law at paragraph  [25(b)]
         by erroneously  conflating  financial  independence  under  Section
         117B(3) of the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  Even if  the
         Appellant could not satisfy Appendix FM that does not mean that she
         was not financially independent.

      d) The judge made an irrational and unlawful finding at paragraph [22]
         when he found that the Appellant's  3  year  old  British  daughter
         could come to the United Kingdom without the Appellant and be cared
         for by the Sponsor.  That is irrational and fails to  consider  the
         welfare of the child.

      e) The judge made a material misdirection of law at paragraph  [25(d)]
         the judge found that it was not unreasonable  for  the  Appellant's
         British child to continue to live with her in  Pakistan.   This  is
         erroneous in law.  The judge failed to properly consider the rights
         of the Appellant's  child  and  when  referring  to  the  temporary
         separation failed to take into account that the Appellant could not
         apply again until the Sponsor put all his takings into the bank for
         a full financial  year.   Thus  the  separation  is  likely  to  be
         significant.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Dineen) on the following grounds:-

         "Grounds (a)-(c)  complain  that  the  judge  made  errors  of  law
         contrary to  the  proper  interpretation  of  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE.  I have considerable  doubts  as  to  whether  such
         complaints are well grounded but they are not  on  their  face  and
         without more, plainly wrong.  At the stage of permission to  appeal
         it is necessary only to show that they are arguable, whether or not
         likely to succeed.  I find they are arguable.

         Grounds  (d)-(e)  complain  of  a  reasonableness  of  the  judge's
         findings.  They do  not  show  that  such  findings  were  arguably
         perverse or otherwise errors of  law,  and  do  not  give  rise  to
         permission to appeal.

         Permission to appeal is granted as to the grounds (a)-(c) only."

16. Before the Upper Tribunal Mr Jasiri appeared on behalf of the Appellant
    and Miss Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer appeared on behalf of  the
    Respondent.  Neither party had provided skeleton arguments, despite the
    issue being  clearly  identified  as  the  interpretation  of  specific
    provisions of Appendix  FM-SE.   At  the  hearing  Miss  Fijiwala  also
    produced a copy of the relevant IDIs which Mr Jasiri had  not  seen  or
    considered and neither representative provided copies of  the  relevant
    Rule as at the relevant date.  Time was given for the advocates to read
    the additional documentation.

17. I heard submissions from each of the advocates but it became plain that
    in order to decide the issue of construction  in  the  context  of  the
    Appellant's appeal that both parties required further time  to  provide
    their submissions as to  the  construction  of  this  particular  Rule.
    After hearing short submissions, I made  directions  for  each  of  the
    parties to file written submissions.

18. In accordance with those directions each party  provide  their  written
    submissions and copies of the relevant Rules and guidance in  force  at
    the relevant time. I shall make reference  to  those  submissions  when
    reaching a conclusion on the issues raised.

Decision on error of law:

19. I therefore set out  the  relevant  provisions  as  identified  by  the
    parties:

    7(f) of Appendix FM SE states as follows:


         In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as a sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:
         personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as the tax
         return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of
         the person and their partner jointly.

    1(n) of Appendix FM SE states as follows:

         The gross amount of any cash income may be counted where the
         person's specified bank statements show the net amount which
         relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to the specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment income). Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements may be
         counted.

    Paragraph 9.3.8 of the guidance states as follows:

         Self-employed income can be cash-in-hand if the correct tax is
         paid. In line with paragraph 3.1.5 of this guidance, it would
         generally be expected that the person's business or personal bank
         statements would fully reflect all gross (pre-tax) cash income.
         Flexibility may only be applied where the decision-maker is
         satisfied that the cash income relied upon is fully evidenced by
         the relevant tax return(s) and the accounts information.

    Paragraph 3.1.5 of the 2014 guidance states as follows:

         Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the gross amount of any cash
         income may be counted where the person's specified bank statements
         show the deposit of the full net amount which relates to the gross
         amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant specified
         evidence provided in addition to the specified bank statements in
         relation to non-employment income). Otherwise, only the net amount
         shown on the specified bank statements may be counted.

20. There is no dispute between the parties that the appellant's sponsor
    carries out self-employment as a sole trader and that for the purposes
    of Appendix FM the appellant is required to demonstrate that the
    sponsor could meet the income threshold of �18,600.


21. It is further not disputed that   the sponsor provided his personal and
    business bank statements before the first-tier Tribunal in accordance
    with paragraph 7 (f) as set out above. However, as the appellant's
    submissions set out at paragraph 17, those bank statements did not
    fully reflect all gross (pre-tax) income.


22. It is against this background that I consider the submissions of the
    parties. It also appears to be common ground that paragraph 7 (f) does
    not refer to all of the sponsor's income being paid into his personal
    account. This was accepted by the presenting officer before the first-
    tier Tribunal and by the judge at paragraph [21]. However as identified
    by both parties, the issue relates to whether, from various sources of
    specified evidence that the sponsor's income is as claimed.


23. Having considered the relevant paragraphs, it can be said that in
    accordance with the requirements of paragraph 7 (f) of Appendix FM the
    sponsor's bank statements should fully reflect the gross cash income.
    Both parties refer to this as the "general expectation" (see paragraph
    15 of the appellant's skeleton argument and paragraph 9 of the
    respondent's skeleton argument). That does not require all the monies
    to be paid into an account but can be demonstrated from either personal
    or business bank statements. This is reflected in the guidance at
    paragraph 9.3.8 which makes onward reference to paragraph 3.1.5 of the
    guidance. This sets out that paragraph 1 (n) applies where the gross
    amount of any cash income may be counted where the specified bank
    statement shows the deposit of the full net amount which relates to the
    gross amount. Otherwise only the net amount shown on the specified bank
    statement may be counted.


24. Having considered the respective submissions of the parties, I do not
    identify any disagreement with that interpretation of the rules. As
    identified in the appellant's submissions as it is accepted that the
    appellant could not satisfy the "general expectation" in the rules for
    the reasons set out at paragraph 17; namely that the bank statements
    did not fully reflect all gross (pre-tax) profit, but that in
    accordance with the guidance at 9.3.8 the issue is whether the entry
    clearance officer and the judge exercised the flexibility contained
    therein (see paragraph 18 of the appellant submissions and paragraph 12
    of the respondents submissions).


25. I therefore consider that issue which both parties now agree is the
    relevant issue. As the respondent submissions set out the guidance at
    paragraph 9.3.8 states that flexibility may only be applied where the
    decision-maker is satisfied that the cash income relied upon is fully
    evidenced by the tax return and accounts information.


26. In this case, the respondent submits that the judge did consider this
    and applied flexibility at paragraph 21 of the determination when he
    made reference to the documents entitled "SA 302 and SA 303" whereby
    the judge found that they were self declarations of income and that
    neither were independent sources establishing the sponsor's income.
    Therefore, as the income could not be established from all the sources,
    flexibility should not be applied.


27. By way of response, it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that
    there were documents before the entry clearance officer which, when
    taken together, were sufficient to demonstrate his income for all
    sources met the required income threshold of �18,600 and relies upon
    the relevant tax return and letter from the sponsor's accountants.


28. At paragraph 9 of the determination the judge identifies a difficulty
    which arises in a number of cases before the first-tier Tribunal and
    this tribunal; namely what documents were put before the entry
    clearance officer for the purposes of the application made. In this
    case the respondent's bundle did not contain the usual list of
    documents detailing the evidence submitted with the application. The
    judge recorded that the presenting officer did not take issue as to
    whether the documents were provided but invited the judge to consider
    the documents in the appellant's bundle. Those documents included at
    pages 6 and 7 the SA302 and SA 303 which the judge made reference to.
    It is now agreed by the respondent that the accounts information
    relating to the sponsor (including copies of his accounts for two
    financial years) had been submitted with the application and thus were
    before the entry clearance officer. Whilst the respondent submissions
    state that it is not clear whether those documents were before the
    first-tier Tribunal, it is plain from the agreed position now that
    those documents were before the entry clearance officer when the
    decision was made. I cannot be clear whether those documents were in
    fact before the first-tier Tribunal as separate documents or not.


29. A Respondent's bundle should provide a full copy of all documentation
    sent with the application to provide a full background to the decision
    under challenge. Furthermore if  this is not done, the appellant's
    representatives should identify and provide confirmation of the
    documents that were sent. As I have set out in the preceding paragraph,
    it is not clear whether the accounts information which was clearly
    before the entry clearance officer found its way to the judge. I
    therefore proceed on the basis that it was before the entry clearance
    officer who did not apply the rules in accordance with the stated
    guidance to which there was no reference or any application of
    flexibility when considering the documentation. This resulted in a
    flawed approach before the first-tier Tribunal who did not consider the
    issues on the basis that both parties have now proceeded. In those
    circumstances I am satisfied that there is a material error of law and
    set aside the decision and proceed to remake it is invited by both
    parties on the evidence that is before the tribunal.


30. The respondents submission at paragraph 15 is that even on the basis of
    the account information, flexibility should not be exercised in the
    appellant's favour on the basis that it is not clear upon what
    documents the accountant has noted the accounts for the years ending in
    2013 and 2014. It is submitted that if it is on the basis of the SA 302
    and 303, those documents have already been rejected as not being an
    "independent reflection". Therefore the appellant has not demonstrated
    that he can meet the financial requirements.


31. Both parties identify that the issue is whether the documents, when
    taken together as evidence from all sources, demonstrate that
    flexibility should have been exercised in the appellant's favour. The
    personal bank statements reflected a sum of �9740 but the sponsor's
    account as to his method of trading set out at paragraph 14 of the
    determination appears to have been accepted by the judge. What he did
    not accept was that the SA 302 and SA 303 was "independent evidence".
    However when seen alongside and in conjunction with the letter from the
    accountant and the accompanying accounts, in my judgement those
    documents can be viewed together as evidence of the sponsor's profit
    from his self employment. The "account information" is not prescribed
    and the appellant provided information from his accountants relating to
    the trading profit and loss accounts for the relevant periods along
    with the application. Those accounts show net profit from self-
    employment in excess of the required income threshold of �18,600 and in
    accordance with the information the sponsor had provided along with the
    application.


32. For those reasons, I have reached the conclusion that I prefer the
    submissions of the appellant and that on the documentation provided the
    appellant has demonstrated that her sponsor can meet the income
    threshold of �18,600 as a self- employed sole trader.
