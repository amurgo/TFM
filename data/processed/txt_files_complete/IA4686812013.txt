Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant on 28th August 2013 applied for limited leave  to  remain
    in the UK on the basis of  family  and  private  life  and  exceptional
    circumstances.  The respondent  refused  his  application  for  reasons
    explained in a letter dated 5th November 2013.  Judge David  C  Clapham
    SSC heard the appellant's appeal in the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  22nd
    September  2014  and  dismissed  it  by  determination  dated  7th  and
    promulgated on 8th October 2014.

 2. The Presenting Officer in the First-tier Tribunal  undertook  that  the
    appellant would not be removed until an asylum claim made by  his  wife
    and children had been resolved.  The judge said at paragraph 21 that in
    view of that undertaking he could not consider Article 8 grounds.   The
    appellant's first ground of appeal to the Upper tribunal  is  that  the
    judge should not have declined to consider Article 8 on  the  basis  of
    accepting the undertaking of the Secretary of State.

 3. I indicated in course of submissions that  the  first  ground  is  well
    founded.  The most relevant authority is MS (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2007]
    EWCA Civ 133.  It was not cited by either party  although  Mr  Ndubuisi
    was able to recall part of the reference when I mentioned the principle
    involved.  In MS the Court of Appeal held that the Tribunal should have
    decided whether removal of an appellant while she  had  an  outstanding
    case seeking contact with her children would violate Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.  An undertaking not to remove until contact was resolved did  not
    avoid the question.  In that light, this appellant's removal  would  be
    disproportionate prior to resolution of the  status  of  his  wife  and
    children.

 4. In terms of the Immigration Rules the appellant argued  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal that his appeal should be allowed because he  would  have
    achieved ten years' continuous residence by 2nd October 2014  and  Home
    Office policy permitted applications to be made within 28 days prior to
    completing the qualifying period.  The judge held that the appeal could
    not succeed because at the date of the hearing the ten year period  had
    not been completed.  This is  the  subject  of  the  second  ground  of
    appeal.

 5. Mr Ndubuisi argued that the policy was for applications to  be  allowed
    within the 28 day period prior to  the  completion  of  the  qualifying
    period.  That is wrong.  The policy envisages that applications may  be
    made within those 28 days but that they will not be granted unless  and
    until they satisfy all the requirements of the Rules.

 6. Mr Ndubuisi sought to make a further point which is not in the grounds.
     He said that the judge should have allowed the appeal because although
    the ten year period had not been completed by the date of  the  hearing
    it  had  been  reached  before  the  determination   was   signed   and
    promulgated.  He was unable to refer to  any  reported  authority  that
    cases may be decided on  circumstances  later  than  the  date  of  the
    hearing.  He produced a copy on an unreported  case,  IA/40854/49730/13
    Samba & Maharajan.

 7. I did not think there was any merit in the second ground.

 8. At this stage of the hearing Mr Ndubuisi advised that he  had  tendered
    further evidence within the last few days, although it had not yet been
    placed on the file before  the  Upper  Tribunal  nor  received  by  the
    Presenting Officer.  This is to show  that  the  appellant's  wife  and
    children have now been granted refugee status.

 9. Although that information suggests that there  may  be  little  further
    point in these proceedings, Mr Ndubuisi nevertheless sought a  decision
    on the second ground.  He further argued  that  on  the  basis  of  the
    Article 8 ground the determination should be set aside in its  entirety
    and allowed under the Immigration Rules, because the appellant has  now
    completed the ten year residence period.

10. I could see no reason why the determination  should  be  set  aside  in
    respect of the Immigration Rules if there were no error on that  issue,
    in order to make a decision on a different basis.

11. Having intimated my decision to the extent above, I  formally  reserved
    my determination.

12.  The  Tribunal  considers  matters  arising  after  the  date  of   the
    respondent's decision where permitted by section 85(4) of the 2002 Act.
     The leading case is LS (Gambia) [2005] UKAIT 00085.  Since  that  case
    the  general  understanding  has  been  that  where  s.  85(4)  applies
    circumstances are considered at the date of the hearing, as  stated  in
    Macdonald's Immigration Law & Practice, 9th ed., vol. 1,  at  �20.15(8)
    and at �20.114.

13. Cases are decided on what is before the parties and the  judge  at  the
    hearing.   A  moving  target  at  later  dates  would  have   odd   and
    unmanageable results.  I remain of the  view  that  the  second  ground
    discloses no legal error.

14. Since preparing this determination up to this stage,  Mr  Ndubuisi  has
    submitted further written submissions  based  on  the  unreported  case
    referred to above.

15. The requirements for reliance upon unreported cases are not addressed.

16. Neither in the FtT nor in the UT should appeals be argued on  a  series
    of afterthoughts.  This issue  was  not  mentioned  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and even if that were to be overlooked it came too late in the
    Upper Tribunal.

17. In any event, the parties in the unreported  decision  did  not  debate
    whether circumstances were to be considered at the date of  hearing  or
    at a later date.  In so far as the judge may have allowed  that  appeal
    on the basis of residence short of the qualifying period at the date of
    the hearing, he appears to have gone wrong.

18. The appeal as originally brought under the Immigration Rules stands  as
    dismissed.

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal in respect of Article 8 of
    the ECHR is set aside.  The appellant's appeal  as  originally  brought
    under Article 8 is allowed to the extent that he should have such leave
    as may be appropriate in light of the  current  status  of  his  family
    members and subject to the usual checks and requirements.

20. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
