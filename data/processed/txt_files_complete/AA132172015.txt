               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Nicholson, Counsel instructed by GMIAU
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Heynes
    made following a hearing at Manchester on 25th July 2016.

 2. The appellant claimed that she was at risk on  return  to  Afghanistan,
    having dishonoured her husband's family by  escaping  from  them  after
    sexual abuse at the hands of her brother-in-law, who was  an  extremely
    influential man, a former ambassador.   Her  father,  a  senior  police
    officer, is dead and her husband has disappeared.

 3. The judge disbelieved the appellant's account in its entirety.

 4. Mr Harrison did not seek to defend this determination.

 5. The judge did not engage with the main  issue  in  the  appeal,  namely
    whether the core of her story about the events which led to her leaving
    Afghanistan was true.  Instead he concentrated his  attention  on  what
    the appellant had done with her passport after arrival in  the  UK  and
    the circumstances in which she made her actual asylum claim here.

 6. The judge erred in law by failing to deal with relevant matters and his
    decision is set aside.  It is remitted to the first tier  tribunal  and
    will have  to  be  re-made  by  another  First-tier  Judge  sitting  at
    Manchester.

No anonymity direction is made.
