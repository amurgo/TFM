                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a  citizen  of  Nepal  born  on  5  March  1951.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated  12  June  2014  to
    remove her from the United Kingdom and  to  refuse  to  vary  leave  to
    remain.  Her appeal was allowed at first instance by Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Majid and the Respondent appeals with leave against  that
    decision.  For the reasons which  I  have  set  out  below  I  found  a
    material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  and  have
    set it aside and have remade the decision.  Thus although  this  appeal
    comes before me in the first place as an appeal by  the  Respondent,  I
    have continued to refer to the parties as  they  were  known  at  first
    instance for the sake of convenience.

2.   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 10 November 2012 with  a
    visitor's visa valid from 1 November 2012 until 1 May 2013.  On 5 April
    2013 the Appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain on the  basis
    of being dependent upon her son who is settled in the  United  Kingdom.
    The application was refused on 12 June 2014 and the Respondent  made  a
    decision to remove the Appellant by way of directions under Section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

The Application

3.   With  her  application  to  vary  leave  the  Appellant  submitted  two
    statements, one from herself and one from her son Mr Rajip Rai.  In her
    statement the Appellant said that she was born in Nepal and was married
    to an ex-army Ghurkha.  Her husband had a second wife and his behaviour
    towards the Appellant was such that she had to divorce  him.   She  had
    been visiting her son in the United Kingdom over the last few years and
    was here on a visit visa again.   Her  son  was  also  serving  in  the
    British Army and was stationed in the United  Kingdom.   The  Appellant
    had no other relatives in Nepal and was not able to care  for  herself.
    She needed assistance with bathing, preparation  of  clothes,  changing
    clothes, administering medication and to be encouraged to  get  out  of
    bed and conduct activities.  Her son, the  Sponsor,  gave  her  �200  a
    month which was directly deducted from his  wages  and  came  into  her
    account.  She had an account in Nepal and the money was there  for  her
    to use if necessary.

The Explanation for Refusal

4.   The Respondent refused the application  stating  that  the  Appellant's
    desire  to  live  with  her  son  and  his  family  was  insufficiently
    compelling to grant  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Her
    illnesses such as depression  and  hypertension  could  be  treated  in
    Nepal.  There were numerous  charities  and  organisations  there  that
    could assist with mental health disorders.  The financial  support  she
    received from her son could continue if she returned to Nepal.  As  her
    application had been  submitted  for  a  purpose  not  covered  by  the
    Immigration Rules the application  fell  for  refusal  under  paragraph
    322(1) of the Immigration Rules.

5.    As  the  application  was  made  after  9  July  2012  the  Respondent
    considered the provisions of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules
    and Appendix FM.  Under paragraph 276ADE the Respondent noted that  the
    Appellant was aged 63 and had entered the United Kingdom on 10 November
    2012.  She had not therefore lived continuously in the  United  Kingdom
    for at least twenty years.  She was neither under the  age  of  18  nor
    between 18 to 25.  Rather she had only lived in the United Kingdom  for
    one year and seven months.  During that time she could not have severed
    all ties including social, cultural and family ties  with  Nepal.   She
    had resided in Nepal for over 60 years prior to arriving in the  United
    Kingdom.

6.   The Appellant could  not  bring  herself  within  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM as she  had  not  demonstrated  she  was  in  a  subsisting
    relationship with a person present and settled in the  United  Kingdom.
    She had no children under the age of 18 here.   Whilst  a  family  life
    might  be  in  existence  between  the  Appellant  and  her  son   that
    relationship was between adult relatives and it was not  sufficient  to
    justify a grant of leave in the United Kingdom.

The Appeal

7.   The Appellant appealed against that decision  in  grounds  prepared  by
    the charitable organisation representing her "Enough  is  Enough".   It
    was argued that the Appellant was a divorc�e and faced much  stigma  in
    Nepal.  She had been through much emotional abuse  whilst  bringing  up
    her children and wanted to be  with  them  now.   The  Appellant's  son
    wished to remain in his post in the British Army in the United  Kingdom
    and if his mother were to die in Nepal he would be unable to return  to
    perform the funeral rites.  The Appellant had three children,  her  son
    Rajip who was in the armed forces in the United Kingdom, a daughter who
    was married to a man serving in the  armed  forces  in  Germany  and  a
    second son who lived in Hong Kong working  in  construction.   Although
    the Appellant's son might be able to secure some help for an hour or so
    in Nepal it could not replace the 24 hour care she would  receive  with
    her family in the United Kingdom.  There  was  background  material  to
    show that women in particular faced a number of problems in Nepal where
    domestic violence was a widespread problem and where mental health  was
    a largely neglected area.

The Hearing at First Instance

8.   The appeal came before Judge Majid when the Appellant  was  represented
    by Counsel, Ms D Qureshi, who I was told was  instructed  on  a  direct
    access basis (and not available to attend before me). The  Judge  heard
    oral  evidence  from  the  Appellant  and  at  paragraph  14   of   his
    determination quoted verbatim from the Appellant's statement  which  he
    had before him.  This stated that the Appellant was on  antidepressants
    and waiting for counselling and had no other relatives in Nepal.

9.   The Judge found that the Appellant would not  be  a  burden  on  public
    funds if her application was granted.  She did  not  feel  happy  about
    returning to Nepal.  Her  ex-husband  had  subjected  her  to  domestic
    violence and that had triggered the depression in her.  In his  reasons
    why he was allowing the appeal the Judge wrote:

         "... it is only fair that in a particular case an individual is not
         deprived of the protection of the Convention where that  course  is
         justified  by  compelling  circumstances.   Powerful  factors   are
         outlined in paragraphs 10 and 14 above which justify the  grant  of
         leave, respecting family and private life under the ECHR 1950.




         "I am fully conscious  of  the  legal  requirements  stipulated  by
         immigration law.  It is incumbent upon me  to  advert  to  the  new
         Rules  giving  respect  to  the  animus  legis  dictated   by   the
         Constitutional Supremacy of Parliament.  The  rule  of  law  should
         benefit this Appellant who should have the advantage of the company
         of her biological children and who has nobody left  to  care  about
         her in Nepal.

         "...  I am persuaded that the Appellant comes within  the  law  and
         can benefit from the relevant Immigration Rules as amended and  the
         protections of the ECHR."

The Onward Appeal

10.  The Respondent appealed against this decision, arguing that  the  Judge
    had made an error of law by treating the application as one within  the
    Immigration Rules when it was not.  The Judge had  also  erred  in  his
    approach to Article 8.  The Judge had failed to take into  account  the
    provisions of Section 117 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 nor had he taken into account or attached any  weight  to  the
    requirements of Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE, paying no regard  to
    the Respondent's policy contained  within  Appendix  FM  for  leave  to
    remain to be granted as an adult dependent  relative.   The  Judge  had
    failed to have regard to the case law in respect of adult children  and
    their parents and had failed to provide adequate reasoning to  conclude
    that family life was engaged.  The Judge had attached undue  weight  to
    his acceptance of the evidence that the Appellant was not going to be a
    burden on public funds and  had  failed  to  take  into  account  other
    countervailing factors such as possible recourse to the National Health
    Service.  The Judge had provided no adequate reasoning to  support  his
    conclusion that the Appellant was in her final years.

11.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson on 8  January  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote:

          "It is arguable as submitted in the grounds that the Appellant was
         not entitled to leave to remain as an  elderly  dependent  relative
         under the Immigration Rules or on the basis  of  her  private  life
         here and that the Judge did not conduct a proportionality  exercise
         under Article 8 taking into account the provisions of Sections 117A
         and B of the 2002 Act.  Permission is granted on all grounds."

The Error of Law Stage

12.  When the matter was called on for hearing before me the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr Ali Khan from the charitable organisation  Enough  is
    Enough on a pro bono basis.  I was informed that  Ms  Qureshi  who  had
    been instructed at first  instance  was  not  available  that  day.   I
    indicated that in the first place I would have to decide whether  there
    was an error of law such that the decision fell to be set aside.  If it
    did I would then have to decide whether to remake the  decision  myself
    or remit the appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal for the case to  be
    heard again.  If I decided there was no error of law than the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal would stand.

13.  In brief submissions the Presenting Officer indicated he relied on  the
    grounds of onward appeal.  The Judge had not  considered  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules but had allowed the appeal under  the  Rules  anyway.
    The Section of  Appendix  FM  which  deals  with  dependent  relatives,
    Section ECDR, is in relation  to  applications  made  from  abroad  not
    within the United Kingdom.  The determination was devoid  of  analysis.
    Some of the law cited was out of date, some of  the  determination  was
    irrelevant and in some parts it  was  not  clear  what  the  Judge  was
    saying.

14.  In reply it was accepted on behalf of the Appellant that she could  not
    meet every specific requirement of  the  Immigration  Rules.   She  was
    putting her case on the basis of Article 8.  She had a son  who  was  a
    serving member of the army in this country and had grandchildren.   She
    was not a drain on public funds.  If she were forced to return to Nepal
    her son would also have to return because it was his duty to look after
    her.  The Appellant  had  a  number  of  medical  conditions  including
    depression and diabetes and a back problem.  She was 63 years  old  but
    given the much lower life expectancy in Nepal compared  to  the  United
    Kingdom that was a substantial age.  Medical  care  available  for  her
    would be way below the level obtained in the United Kingdom.

15.  I indicated to the parties after the  submissions  that  I  found  that
    there was a material error of law in the  determination  such  that  it
    fell to be set aside and that I would give fuller written reasons which
    I now do.  The Judge has purported to allow the appeal  on  two  bases,
    that the Appellant could bring herself within the Immigration Rules and
    that it would breach this country's obligations under Article 8  (right
    to respect for private and family life) of the Human Rights Convention.
     It is clear  that  the  Appellant  cannot  bring  herself  within  the
    Immigration Rules, there are no Rules which fit her situation  for  her
    to come within and as the Respondent pointed out in the refusal  letter
    the Appellant could not claim to be in this country on the basis  of  a
    family life or private life under the Immigration Rules.  It  was  thus
    an error for the Judge to  nevertheless  allow  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is significant that the Judge did  not  identify
    in his determination which Immigration Rules he was of  the  view  that
    the Appellant did meet.

16.  The assessment of Article 8 is of necessity more  at  large.   However,
    the Judge again failed in his determination to give any or any adequate
    reasons why he was allowing the appeal under Article  8.   He  paid  no
    attention to the statutory requirements contained in Section 117 A to D
    of the 2002 Act.  The Appellant had established  her  private  life  in
    this country at a time whilst her status was precarious because she was
    here first on a visit visa and then secondly on "3C leave" (pursuant to
    the Immigration Act 1971).  The Judge found that  the  Appellant  would
    not be a burden on public funds but did not explain why he came to that
    conclusion given the possibility that the Appellant  would  be  seeking
    treatment under the National Health Service.

The Disposal Issue

17.  Having informed the parties that I found an  error  of  law  the  issue
    arose as to disposal of the proceedings.  I canvassed the views of  the
    parties as to whether I should proceed to hear  the  matter  there  and
    then or whether I should  remit  the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard again pursuant to  the  authority  of  the  Senior
    President's direction or whether the matter should remain in the  Upper
    Tribunal but the hearing be adjourned possibly for further evidence.

18.  On behalf of the Appellant Mr Khan indicated that he would  request  an
    adjournment because he would wish to call  Mrs  Rai's  daughter-in-law,
    the wife of her son Rajip.  The witness had not made  a  statement  and
    had not given evidence to the Judge at first  instance.   Her  evidence
    was to the level of support she gave to the Appellant.  I was told that
    she dresses the Appellant in the morning, bathes her,  administers  her
    medication and helps her to go to the doctor.  Mr Khan indicated he was
    unable to say what else the witness might add to that list.

19.  I did not consider it appropriate to remit the case back to the  First-
    tier to be heard  again.   There  were  clearly  difficulties  for  the
    Appellant in arranging  representation  for  herself  and  these  would
    potentially be exacerbated by remitting the matter back to  the  First-
    tier.  There had been an effective hearing of this appeal, albeit  that
    the determination produced by the Judge  was  flawed  in  a  number  of
    material respects.  I did not consider therefore that  this  case  came
    within the  provisions  of  the  Senior  President's  direction  and  I
    indicated that I was not prepared to remit the matter and would  rehear
    the decision.

20.  Having decided that the next issue  was  whether  I  could  rehear  the
    matter there and then or would have to adjourn for further evidence.  I
    considered the issue bearing in  mind  that  the  test  of  whether  to
    adjourn is one of fairness.  The proposed witness had not attended  the
    Tribunal this afternoon, notwithstanding a direction that in the  event
    that an error of law was found the Tribunal  would  expect  to  proceed
    with any necessary oral evidence being made available.  No  effort  had
    been made to call the witness at first instance and no effort had  been
    made to take a statement from the witness as to  what  she  might  give
    evidence about.  The Appellant had said in her statement submitted with
    her application for variation of leave  to  remain  that  she  required
    assistance with bathing, administering medication etc.  and  that  does
    not appear to have been disputed by the Respondent. The evidence of the
    witness as far as I could glean  added  nothing  of  substance  to  the
    Appellant's unchallenged evidence. The Respondent's argument  was  that
    the daughter in law's care did not amount  to  sufficiently  compelling
    and compassionate circumstances such that the Appellant's appeal should
    be allowed outside the Immigration Rules.  In those circumstances I was
    not of the view that a  just  determination  of  the  appeal  would  be
    assisted by an adjournment for the attendance of  a  potential  witness
    whose exact evidence was not known because  no  witness  statement  had
    been taken from her.  I indicated  therefore  I  was  not  prepared  to
    adjourn the matter and the case proceeded.

The Substantive Re-Hearing

21.  On behalf of the Appellant further evidence was submitted in  the  form
    of the Appellant's general practitioner records from 3 April 2013 until
    20 October 2014 and correspondence from her GP  regarding  appointments
    to have blood tests taken. The Appellant gave brief  oral  evidence  in
    which she denied that she had had any treatment from her GP before  she
    made her application for a variation of leave.

22.  In closing for the  Respondent  it  was  argued  that  the  GP  records
    produced on behalf of the Appellant raised a concern as to whether  the
    treatment received from the general practitioner  was  being  paid  for
    privately or whether it was being treated under the  NHS.   Whilst  the
    Appellant was receiving money from her  son  her  financial  dependency
    could never suffice in terms of establishing a family life on its  own.
    There were no more than normal emotional ties between the Appellant and
    her son.  There was no evidence to suggest that the Appellant could not
    receive treatment in Nepal for her medical conditions.

23.  In closing for the Appellant it was argued that the Appellant had  only
    received treatment from her GP under the NHS after she had  lodged  her
    application for a variation for leave.  There was  not  just  financial
    support the Appellant received from her son but also emotional support.
     She received a widow's pension.  It was  a  small  amount.   Her  care
    needs were imperative.  She should be able to have assistance from  her
    family members.  The only chance of that would be  if  she  could  live
    with her son,  daughter-in-law  and  her  grandchildren.  After  I  had
    reserved my decision the Tribunal received  a  communication  from  the
    Appellant's representatives indicating that the Appellant  was  not  in
    fact in receipt of a widow's pension, her husband may  still  be  alive
    but he had deserted her.

Findings

24.  The Appellant cannot bring herself within the  Immigration  Rules.   As
    the Respondent points in the refusal letter she  cannot  bring  herself
    within either Appendix FM  or paragraph 276ADE.  The provisions in  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to enter as a dependent relative  apply  to
    entry clearance out of country applications not, as in this case, an in
    country application for a variation of leave which had been granted  to
    her as a visitor.

25.  The Appellant therefore seeks to remain in this country  under  Article
    8 outside the Immigration Rules.   As  has  been  stated  in  the  case
    authorities such as MM, the assessment of an  Article  8  claim  is  at
    large but informed by UK and Strasbourg jurisprudence.

26.   The  Appellant  has  a  family  life  with  her  son  but  that  is  a
    relationship of adults  and  I  find  there  is  no  more  than  normal
    emotional ties.  Whilst it is correct that the Appellant's daughter-in-
    law assists the Appellant with day-to-day tasks, there is no reason why
    upon return to Nepal the  money  currently  paid  by  her  son  to  the
    Appellant into her account in Nepal could not be  utilised  to  provide
    similar care.  As the Respondent  points  out,  there  is  no  evidence
    before me that treatment is unavailable for the Appellant.  It may  be,
    as the background material relied upon by the Appellant suggests,  that
    it is not to the same standard as in the United  Kingdom  but  that  of
    itself would not lead to a breach of the Convention.  The  relationship
    between the Appellant and her son has up till now been conducted  at  a
    distance with the parties seeing each other from time to  time  through
    visits.  There is no reason  why  that  could  not  continue  once  the
    Appellant was back in Nepal.

27.  I place little weight on the Appellant's assertions that she  would  be
    subject to verbal abuse by the  people  because  of  her  status  as  a
    divorced woman.  Even if (as is now said) her ex-husband  is  not  dead
    she is not in any contact with him and so he cannot harass her. Even if
    neighbours might pass unkind comments etc  such  occasional  harassment
    even if it were to exist does not  cross  the  threshold  of  treatment
    contrary to Article 3.  The  Appellant  could  therefore  continue  her
    relationship with her son upon return to Nepal and family life could be
    continued elsewhere.  It would be a matter for the Appellant's  son  as
    to whether he wished to return to Nepal to be with her.   I  understand
    he is reluctant to leave his unit in this country to  return  to  Nepal
    but given his close ties to his country of origin it  is  difficult  to
    see how it would be considered to be  unreasonable  to  expect  him  to
    return if he so wished.

28.  The Appellant has only been in the United  Kingdom  for  a  very  brief
    time.  During that time she has made extensive use of the facilities of
    her general  practitioner.   It  cannot  be  said  therefore  that  the
    Appellant would not be  a  burden  on  public  funds  since  she  would
    continue to require considerable input from the National Health Service
    were she to remain in this country.   Such  private  life  as  she  has
    established here has been established whilst her status  is  precarious
    and in accordance with Section 117B little weight is to be ascribed  to
    it  when  assessing  the  proportionality  of  interference   with   it
    consequent upon the Appellant's removal.

29.  The Appellant's removal would be in accordance with the legitimate  aim
    of immigration control since she has overstayed her visit visa and  has
    made use of public funds.   The  legitimate  aim  is  pursuant  to  the
    economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom.  Given the little  weight  to
    be ascribed to her private life, and given the  fact  that  her  family
    life  could  be  continued  elsewhere  and  in  any  event  is  only  a
    relationship of adults with no more than normal emotional ties,  it  is
    clearly proportionate to the legitimate  aim  being  pursued  that  the
    Appellant's application for a variation of leave  be  refused  and  her
    appeal against the removal decision also be dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the
Respondent's decision to refuse to vary leave and to remove the Appellant.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have set aside the First-tier decision on the grounds that  it  made  a
material error of law, I also set aside the decision to  make  a  fee  award
against the Respondent.
