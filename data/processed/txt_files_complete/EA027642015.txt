Representation:

For the appellant:         Mr A. Jaffar,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  S.Z.
                 Solicitors.
For the respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Presenting Officer.

                           Decision and Directions


 1. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer dismissed  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant, a national of India born on 30 September 1978,  against  the
    decision of the respondent of 4 November 2015 to refuse his application
    for a residence card as the extended family member of  Mr  Vinay  Kumar
    (the "sponsor"), a German national said to be exercising Treaty  rights
    in the United Kingdom.

 2. The respondent's decision was  made  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (hereafter the "EEA Regulations").  The
    respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application  for  the  following
    reasons:

    (i)  the appellant  had  not  established  his  relationship  with  his
         sponsor; and

    (ii) he had not established that he was residing with and/or  dependent
         upon the sponsor either  immediately  before  his  arrival  in  the
         United Kingdom or since his arrival in the United Kingdom.

 3. The judge dismissed the  appeal  on  the  ground  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal of an  extended
    family member under the EEA Regulations.  In this  respect,  the  judge
    relied upon Sala (EFMs: Right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).

 4. The judge did not have the benefit of the  judgment  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 which held that  Sala  was  wrongly
    decided. It is clear from the Court of Appeal's judgment in  Khan  that
    the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper  Tribunal  have  jurisdiction  to
    decide appeals from extended family members under the EEA Regulations.

 5. I am therefore satisfied that, through no fault of his own,  the  judge
    materially erred in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal  for  want
    of jurisdiction. I am satisfied that this led the judge  to  fall  into
    the error of not  deciding  the  disputed  facts  in  this  appeal,  as
    summarised at my para 2 above.

 6. I therefore set aside the decision of the judge in its entirety.

 7. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will re-make the relevant decision itself.  However, para  7.2
    of the Practice Statements for the Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal   (the   "Practice
    Statements") recognises that it may  not  be  possible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when it is satisfied that:

"(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the First-
tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that party's case
to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

(b)  the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary
in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that, having
regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit
the case to the First-tier Tribunal."

 8. In my judgement, this case falls within both para 7.2 (a) and (b).  The
    appellant has not had a hearing of the disputed issues in this  appeal.
    I am therefore of the view that a remittal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    is the right course of action.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer involved the  making
of a material error of law such that the decision to dismiss the appeal  for
want of jurisdiction is set aside.

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on  the
merits on all issues by a judge other than Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
Colyer.
