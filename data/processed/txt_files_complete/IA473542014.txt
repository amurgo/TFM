                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 16th October 1991. He
       arrived in the UK in 2010 with leave to enter as a  Tier  4  general
       student migrant. His leave expired on 12th April  2014.  He  applied
       for further leave in the same capacity on 12th April 2014, and  says
       he posted further evidence in the form of bank statements to support
       his application on 28th April 2014. His application was  refused  on
       7th May 2014.  His appeal against  the  decision  was  dismissed  by
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Hussain in a determination promulgated  on
       the 19th June 2015.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Lambert on 21st September 2015 on the basis  that  it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law in  failing  to  consider
       the argument made by  the  appellant  that  as   online  application
       instructions allow 15 working days for supporting  documents  to  be
       posted to the respondent the bank statement evidence ought  to  have
       been considered as a Post Office receipt had been  provided  showing
       provision of further evidence in this time frame.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law

Submissions

    4. The grounds of appeal argue that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
       law for the reason in the grant of leave and  refer  to  the  online
       instruction which says: "Next steps for  your  application:  Collect
       your supporting documents together and post  them  with  your  cover
       sheet within 15 working days to: PO Box: 180, Bootle, L80 4WG."  The
       grounds of appeal also contend  that  there  was  an  error  in  the
       determination of the matter under Article 8 ECHR.

    5. In oral evidence Mr Shabbir added that he had not kept copies of the
       documents he sent within the 15 day time frame, which  included  his
       bank statement, or of the cover letter he had written sending  them.
       He had also not tried to obtain further copies from the  bank  since
       that  time.  He  had  understood  further  evidence  could  not   be
       considered if it was not evidence submitted with the application.

    6. Mr Shabbir said that a letter obtained from Home Office  records  by
       Mr Melvin which indicated that the  bank  statements  would  not  be
       available  until  26th  May  2014  had  been  written  without   his
       instructions by a college adviser who had known he  had  an  initial
       problem getting the bank statements from Pakistan but was unaware he
       had managed to send them on 28th April 2014.

Conclusions - Error of Law

    7. It is clear that the appellant argued  in  his  grounds  of  appeal/
       appeal statement that his bank statements had  been  submitted  with
       the application, as they were submitted within the terms for on-line
       applications, and so formed part of the evidence which  should  have
       been considered by the Tribunal under s.85A (4) of the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act in a points based appeal such as this. It
       is clear that the appellant was awarded points for his CAS but  that
       his application was refused for the sole  reasons  that  points  for
       maintenance were not given as  he  had  not  provided  the  relevant
       evidence of funds. It is clear that the argument  outlined  was  not
       considered by the First-tier Tribunal when it ought to have been.

    8. However in order to have succeeded in his appeal to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal the appellant needed to show he had ï¿½1600 for 28 days prior
       to his application which was evidenced by suitable bank  statements.
       I accept that there was post office evidence that the appellant sent
       a letter to the respondent's address on 28th April 2014  within  the
       15 working day  period  and  also  prior  to  the  decision  of  the
       respondent refusing leave. However there was no documentary evidence
       before the First-tier Tribunal that this letter  included  the  bank
       statement and even if  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  accepted  the
       appellant's oral evidence that this was so, he had  not  supplied  a
       copy of the document so there would have been no way that the First-
       tier Tribunal could have found that he had supplied a bank statement
       which complied with the documentary provisions  of  the  Immigration
       Rules or that it showed sufficient funds for the relevant period  of
       time. For these reasons any error on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal could  not  have  been  material,  as  the  Tribunal  would
       inevitably have to have dismissed the appeal for  want  of  evidence
       that the appellant could fulfil the maintenance requirements.

    9. I find that the position is the same with respect to any failing  by
       the First-tier Tribunal in  consideration  of  the  Article  8  ECHR
       appeal. I accept that the applicant has private life in the UK:  his
       social ties and friends in this country which have come about due to
       his studies. He had not shown  however  that  there  would  be  very
       significant obstacles to his integration if he  were  to  return  to
       Pakistan, and thus could not have succeeded in an appeal  under  the
       private life Immigration Rules at paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi).  Looking
       for any compelling matters outside of these Rules I fail to find any
       such issues that were before the First-tier Tribunal;  but  even  if
       the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  considered  this  route  they  would
       inevitably have found that the appellant's removal was in accordance
       with the law and proportionate  and dismissed  this  appeal.  Whilst
       the appellant speaks reasonable English he lacked  any  evidence  he
       could support himself financially and so could not show he would not
       be a burden on tax-payers. Further as  someone  who  has  only  held
       precarious status little weight should be given to his private  life
       ties in accordance with s.117B (5) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
       and Asylum Act. These considerations,  combined  with  the  need  to
       maintain effective immigration control in the public interest,  mean
       that the Article 8 ECHR appeal would have inevitably  failed  before
       the First-tier Tribunal.


          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      the making of a material error on a point of law.

   2. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appeal  is
      upheld.
