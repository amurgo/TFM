For the Appellant:     Ms G Patel - Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison - Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by [ST], a citizen of Sri Lanka born [  ]  1972.   He
    appeals against the decision of the Respondent made  on  28th  February
    2014 to refuse to grant asylum and to remove  the  Appellant  from  the
    United Kingdom.

 2. The Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  and  his  appeal  was
    dismissed by a First-tier Tribunal Judge  on  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds but allowed under Articles 3 and 8 of  the  European
    Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms
    (ECHR).  The Secretary of State appealed against the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Edwards and on 6th August 2015, having  heard
    submissions, I found that there was a material error of  law  in  Judge
    Edwards' determination because he had failed to give  adequate  reasons
    for his decision.  He simply said that he could see no  reason  not  to
    accept the medical  evidence  and  gave  very  little  explanation  for
    dismissing the appeal on asylum grounds.  It was agreed by the  parties
    before me on 6th August that the decision of Judge  Edwards  could  not
    stand and that the case would have to be reheard.  I was told  at  that
    point that the Appellant, due to his medical condition,  would  not  be
    giving evidence and that the case would proceed on submissions only.

 3. I now proceed to remake the decision.

 4. No oral evidence was tendered.  The Appellant did not attend court.

 5. I shall briefly set out the basis of the Appellant's claim for asylum.

 6. The Appellant claims that he had no interest in joining  the  LTTE  and
    did not do so, but because his younger brother was a member,  the  army
    suspected that he was a  member  too.   On  three  different  occasions
    between 2000 and 2004 he visited LTTE camps with his brother who was an
    active member and was involved in shootings.

 7. He says that in 2007 his brother was involved in the shooting of a  man
    called Reji.  A week after that a  man  who  was  a  member  of  Reji's
    brother's gang went to the Appellant's aunt's house and  beat  her  and
    her daughter up, threatening to kill the  Appellant  and  his  brother.
    They smashed up the house.  The Appellant remained at his aunt's  until
    May 2009 when the army surrounded his  aunt's  house,  entered  it  and
    arrested the Appellant.  He was beaten and asked where his brother was.
     He was asked where the weapons were hidden.  He was taken  to  a  camp
    where his hands were tied behind his back and he was  beaten.   He  was
    made to drink urine.  He was hung up and left until the next  day  when
    he was taken down and beaten again.  They kept  asking  him  where  his
    brother was and where the guns were  hidden.   He  had  his  photograph
    taken and some people who had been  with  his  brother  identified  the
    Appellant as being his brother.   The  army  believed  him  to  be  his
    brother and continued to torture him.  A bottle was broken on his cheek
    and salt was rubbed into the wound.  On another occasion he was  hooded
    and taken back to his aunt's house where the Appellant gave the  men  a
    grenade he had been given by his brother in 2008  at  which  point  his
    brother told him that he should detonate it if anyone  came  to  bother
    him.  On this occasion the Appellant was beaten and stabbed on the legs
    and ankles with a knife.  He was  taken  back  to  the  camp.   On  one
    occasion he was tied up and lifted on a pulley above  the  ground,  his
    head was covered with a plastic fertiliser  bag  and  he  felt  boiling
    water being poured over his body.  He asked to be shot  he  was  in  so
    much pain.  He was kept in the camp for two years and three months.  He
    was not beaten up but was not given  any  medicine  to  help  heal  his
    wounds.

 8. One day in the evening a major called Wurakone came to the  Appellant's
    cell, ordered soldiers to remove the handcuffs and told him that he was
    going to a different camp for investigation.  He took the Appellant  to
    his office and gave him a good pair of trousers and a  shirt.   He  was
    taken to a restaurant where he met a man called Bobby.  The  major  had
    apparently come to help him escape after the Appellant's aunt had  paid
    him 10 Lakhs.  He was taken by 'Bobby'  in  a  van  to  Colombo,  given
    clothes and a false passport and put on a flight to Dubai.

 9. The Appellant said that whilst he was in detention in 2011 he was  told
    that his brother had been killed and his body  thrown  over  a  bridge.
    His body had been found in the sea.

The Decision of the Secretary of State

10. The Secretary  of  State  in  the  refusal  letter  accepted  that  the
    Appellant is Sri Lankan and  a  Tamil.   The  Secretary  of  State  had
    checked a website called Tamilnet from which she apparently ascertained
    that Karuna's brother Reji was killed in 2004 and not in 2007 as stated
    by the Appellant and he was indeed killed by the  LTTE  special  forces
    which is highly inconsistent with the account given by  the  Appellant.
    The Secretary of  State  considered  that  the  account  given  by  the
    Appellant was not credible because if the authorities were sufficiently
    interested in the Appellant to go and behave as they did at his  aunt's
    house they would have checked  with  his  other  relatives,  especially
    bearing in mind that he had only moved about twenty miles into the home
    of another very close relative.  The Secretary of State noted that  the
    Appellant had said three times in his interview that he was  not  given
    any medication for the wounds which he sustained in detention but  then
    said that he was taken to a doctor in an army sick  bay  where  he  was
    given a bed and had his wounds cleaned and treated.  He also said  that
    they had left medicine with him so that his wounds could be cleaned and
    medicated.  The Secretary of State considered this to  be  inconsistent
    with the background information which she had before her  which  is  to
    the effect that a detainee has the right to see a medical  officer  and
    doctors are obliged to report any suspicious injuries.  She  considered
    the Appellant's account of what had happened in Sri Lanka  and  of  his
    treatment in detention to be inconsistent.  She took into account  that
    although the Appellant had provided photographs  showing  various  body
    parts none of them showed his face so no weight could  be  attached  to
    the photos.

11. The Secretary of State also questioned the documentation  used  by  the
    Appellant to travel to the UK.  According to Home  Office  records  the
    man whose name was on the passport that the Appellant used to travel to
    the UK lives at the same address in Bristol that  was  the  Appellant's
    home from the time he arrived in the UK in September  2011  until  23rd
    November 2011 and both he and the man whose name was  on  the  passport
    both originate from Batticaloa in Sri Lanka.   Furthermore  the  travel
    document contains a Uganda exit stamp dated 26th  September  2011,  the
    day the Appellant claims to have been in Dubai about  to  commence  his
    travel to the UK.  The Secretary of State therefore did not accept that
    the Appellant had been given the passport by 'Bobby' who had been  paid
    to arrange his escape.

12. The Appellant had provided other documents, particularly  letters  from
    the Information Book of Batticaloa Police Station and from the  Rt  Rev
    Dr J Kingsley Swampillai, Dr Arman Navasardyan and  Dr  Gramaniladhari,
    but these documents are all photocopies or faxed copies.  The Appellant
    had said that he would provide the original documents but has failed to
    do so.

13. The Secretary of State considered the medical evidence that was  before
    her at the time the decision was made:

      a) She noted that the Appellant had been  initially  assessed  by  the
         Cardiff Mental Health Team in June 2012 and  that  this  assessment
         said that the Appellant -would be at a  high  risk  of  suicide  if
         deported and while the risk was not imminent it  was  moderate  and
         constant.

      b) On 25th June 2012 the Appellant was assessed  by  a  mental  health
         nurse after taking himself to a police station having had  fleeting
         thoughts of suicide.

      c) On 10th July 2012 he was assessed by a social worker who noted that
         his tone and rate of conversation were appropriate while  he  spoke
         about problems in Sri Lanka, torture and the loss  of  his  brother
         but he became angry and agitated at the discussion of deportation.

      d) On 5th December 2013 he met with a psychiatric  doctor  who  stated
         that  the  Appellant  had  "no  apparent  symptoms  of   depressive
         disorder, PTSD".

      e) On 6th December 2013 he approached the police asking to  be  locked
         up to prevent himself taking his own life.  He  indicated  that  he
         felt there was no reason to stay in the world as he did not have  a
         wife or children.  The clinical impression was  that  he  was  well
         supported in the asylum community and that "you did not  intend  to
         end your life although remained concerned about deportation".

      f) On 9th December 2013 he was awoken by a representative of the  UKBA
         and having had a knife under your  pillow  he  threatened  to  kill
         himself on opening the door as he feared they had  come  to  arrest
         and deport him.

14. In her report Dr Lord  had  noted  that  the  Appellant  has  continued
    support from his aunt in Sri Lanka who has been assisting in his asylum
    appeal by sending human rights documents for him.  She took  from  this
    that the Appellant has a loving supporting relative with his  interests
    at heart.

15. The report of Dr Lord considers the Appellant's scars and the Secretary
    of  State  went  through  this  report  very  thoroughly  indeed.   She
    concluded that the medical report  does  not  support  the  Appellant's
    claim to have been ill-treated in detention.  She did not  accept  that
    the medical report shows that the marks on the  Appellant's  body  were
    caused in the manner claimed by the Appellant.  She also noted that  at
    no point had he provided a report showing a diagnosis of PTSD that  had
    been written by a person qualified to diagnose this condition.   Having
    said that the Secretary of State  noted  that  two  years  earlier  the
    Appellant had been considered by a doctor to be at high risk of suicide
    should he be removed to Sri Lanka but this suicidal ideation is related
    not to his claimed past but to a future fear.

16. She went on to consider the Appellant's claim in light of the  decision
    Y Sri Lanka [2009] EWCA Civ 362.

Submissions for Appellant

17. Ms Patel began by pointing out that  the  Home  Office  had  previously
    withdrawn two decisions in this case.  In the refusal letter  they  did
    not consider all the medical reports.   There  was  a  report  from  Dr
    Chandra Ghosh but this was not referred to in the refusal letter.   She
    pointed out too that the Appellant had given a lot  of  detail  in  his
    responses to the questions at the interview, in  particular  about  the
    camps that he went to and his brother's activities.   His  brother  was
    killed by the authorities.  She referred me to the death certificate of
    the Appellant's brother at page 163  of  the  bundle  establishing  his
    death on 2nd August 2011.

18. With regard to the death of Reji I have in  the  bundle  a  copy  of  a
    letter which the Appellant's representative sent to the Home Office  in
    response to the refusal letter in which it is stated that the Appellant
    could not say exactly when Reji was killed.  He knew only that  it  was
    between 2004 and 2007.

19. Ms Patel  also referred me to page 166  of  the  Appellant's  bundle  1
    which is a copy of a letter dated 23rd November 2011 and on the  headed
    notepaper of M�decins Sans Fronti�res signed by Dr Stewart Condon which
    states:

         "I hereby certify that [ST] underwent treatment at the  history  of
         being poured a hot water on  his  chest  up  to  his  toes  and  he
         received treatment for the thermal injuries caused during the above
         incident."

20. Ms Patel submitted that this confirms that he was treated  by  M�decins
    Sans Fronti�res who routinely provide medical aid to those detained  in
    Sri Lanka.  At page 157 there is an arrest warrant dated 14th  December
    2011 issued for failure to attend the court.   It  was  issued  by  the
    Magistrates' Court in Batticaloa.  There is  a  letter  also  from  the
    village leader dated 15th July 2013  saying  that  some  unknown  armed
    person came in search of the Appellant and his aunt.  There is a letter
    from a Bishop of the Diocese of  Trincomalee  -  Batticaloa  dated  8th
    November 2011 at page 167 confirming the Appellant's  brother  to  have
    been in the LTTE and the Appellant's arrest, detention and  release  by
    payment of a bribe.

21. Ms Patel  also  referred  me  to  the  document  at  page  168  of  the
    Appellant's bundle 1 which was issued by the Human Rights Commission of
    Sri Lanka and refers to a threat reported to them on 27th March 2013 by
    [TS]. The complainant is the Appellant's aunt and this document ties in
    with the letter from village  leader  to  which  I  incidentally  would
    attach little weight since clearly it was written 3  months  after  the
    complaint was made and the information came from the Appellant's  aunt.
    There is nothing tom suggest that  the  village  leader  witnessed  the
    incident.   Under 'Category' it states:

         "Threat. [ST]."

22. Ms Patel said that this is an acknowledgement of a  complaint  made  to
    the Human Rights Commission.

23. Ms Patel submitted that the Appellant would be at  risk  on  return  in
    terms of subparagraph 4 of the heading of GJ.  He would be perceived to
    be a supporter of the LTTE and to have had a significant role.   It  is
    irrelevant whether  he  actually  was  involved  with  the  LTTE.   The
    Appellant fears ill-treatment on return.  She asked me to consider  all
    the medical evidence including his medical records  which  are  in  the
    bundle.  She submitted that Dr Ghosh has confirmed in her report of 7th
    February 2014 that there is  a  causal  link  between  the  Appellant's
    current  state  and  the  ill-treatment  to  which  the  Appellant  was
    subjected in Sri Lanka.  In this report at page 9  she  said  that  the
    attempt he made to kill himself while walking down the  railway  tracks
    suggests that he remains a very serious risk of suicide if he is  faced
    with threats of deportation.  There was also evidence that he had tried
    to set himself on fire and that he had taken an overdose.   He  has  to
    collect his medication from the pharmacy daily because of the  risk  of
    overdosing.  He keeps a knife by him and says that he would use  it  if
    attempts were made to pick him up to send him back to Sri Lanka.

24. In the most up-to-date  report  dated  26th  September  2015  Dr  Ghosh
    confirms that the Appellant made a suicide attempt on 25th July when he
    was admitted to hospital.  He has a support worker and is supported  by
    the Mental Health Team.  He has been accessing mental health  care  for
    over three years and needs lots of support.  He  takes  four  different
    kinds of medication.  She says it is obvious from pages 11 to 13 and 26
    to 30 how often he has been admitted to hospital.  At pages 26 to 30 of
    the Appellant's bundle 3 for example I have confirmation of  attendance
    at the emergency department on 7th October 2012,  the  complaint  being
    that he was "unwell"; on 6th December 2013  the  complaint  being  "OD"
    which I assume is 'overdose' as the CDU indication is "deliberate  self
    harm" - mixed overdose (he was discharged five  hours  later);  on  9th
    December 2013 when the complaints were "suicidal thoughts,  threatening
    to stab himself with a knife ".  (He was discharged home that day.)

25. He has  been  receiving  counselling.   There  is  a  report  from  his
    Counsellor saying that he needs a more specialist form of support  such
    as specific trauma-related therapy.

26. In his submissions Mr Harrison  said  he  would  rely  on  the  refusal
    letter.  He accepted that it does not deal specifically with the report
    of Dr Ghosh but it does deal with the Appellant's mental condition.  He
    conceded that it is clear that  the  doctors  are  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant has mental health issues but at no point has anyone found out
    that he has been telling the truth.  The Secretary  of  State  did  not
    believe him.  Judge Edwards did not  believe  him.   The  doctors  have
    taken what he has  said  at  face  value.   He  has  never  been  found
    credible.  Dr Lord found that there had been injuries to his  body  and
    says one of them is diagnostic (the burn by hot water)  but  there  are
    many ways of getting this.  She said the fact that  the  Appellant  has
    claimed on four occasions that he has tried to  kill  himself  and  has
    never been successful speaks to  his  real  intention.   What  he  says
    indeed is that he will kill himself if attempts are made to remove  him
    from  the  UK.   He  questioned  why  the  letter  from  M�decins  Sans
    Fronti�res was written after the Appellant's brother died.  There is an
    issue of when he was treated.

27. Mr Harrison pointed out that there is a document at page 104 of  bundle
    3 which is a letter from Dr Lucie  Klenka  a  Consultant  Psychiatrist.
    She had seen the Appellant on 24th August 2015.  He had told  her  that
    he is suffering and at times he does feel suicidal.  She confirmed that
    this is reflected in the assessments that had been recently carried out
    by the Liaison Team.  She said that he is still no further  forward  as
    far his legal status in the  UK  is  concerned  and  is  understandably
    worried about deportation which  is  undoubtedly  contributing  to  his
    mental state.  He  told  her  that  it  was  the  constant  flashbacks,
    nightmares and images that he gets in his head of his time back in  his
    home country which are the most debilitating of his symptoms.  He is on
    a waiting list for EMDR (no explanation of  this  acronym  given)  with
    psychological therapies.  She states:

    "I  have  not  made  a  follow-up  appointment  to  see  him   but   if
    circumstances change I will be happy to do so in the future."

28. In response Ms Patel pointed out that the Appellant does not  have  the
    ability to instruct those instructing her.

29. She said it is clear from the  above  that  the  Appellant  has  mental
    health problems. He has presented on several  occasions  with  suicidal
    thoughts and ideation. This is a significant factor in  the  Assessment
    of his appeal. In her report of 7th February 2014 Dr Ghosh states  that
    the Appellant is suffering from  severe  PTSD.   She  states  that  any
    threat of deportation is likely to lead to a greater  deterioration  of
    his mental state.  She says that he remains a significant suicide  risk
    and if he were put on a plane to Sri Lanka it is her  opinion  that  he
    would kill himself.  There is also a letter dated 25th June  2014  from
    Dr Lucie Klenka saying that any communication about his  asylum  status
    and any discussion about the possibility of him returning to Sri  Lanka
    would place an enormous amount of stress on the Appellant and she feels
    that he would be incapable of giving any valid  evidence  in  court  or
    whilst being cross-examined.  She opines that the  distress  that  this
    would cause would mean that any evidence that he would  give  would  be
    very much overshadowed  by  the  extreme  emotions  that  he  would  be
    experiencing at the time of attempting to give his evidence.

30. Dr Lesley Lord found that a scar on the Appellant's cheek is diagnostic
    of a healed incised wound caused by a sharp object  and  typical  of  a
    wound that was not repaired and which gaped as it was healing.   It  is
    therefore highly consistent with his account of being  slashed  on  the
    cheek with a piece of broken glass.  She finds the  long  scar  on  his
    left arm to be diagnostic of an  incised  wound  and  therefore  highly
    consistent with his account of him having used the sharp point of a pen
    used to drag down the arm.  The other mark that she found diagnostic is
    the scarring on the arm, chest and genital area  diagnostic  of  healed
    burns and therefore with his account of having hot water thrown at him.

Burden and Standard of Proof

31. The burden is on the Appellant to show with regard to the asylum appeal
    that returning him would expose him  to  a  real  risk  of  an  act  of
    persecution  for  reasons  set  out  in  Regulation  6  of   the   2006
    Regulations.  With regard to Humanitarian Protection he would  have  to
    show substantial grounds for believing that he would face a  real  risk
    of serious harm as defined by paragraph 339C of the  Immigration  Rules
    or face a real risk of a breach of his protected human rights.

My Findings

32. I have given very careful consideration to all the evidence put  before
    me in this case, including the medical evidence, the arrest warrant and
    the other documents.  I have considered all the background  information
    relied upon by both parties and the Home  Office  Operational  Guidance
    note relative to Sri Lanka (OGN).

33. The Appellant claims that he would be at risk  of  persecution  in  Sri
    Lanka because he would be perceived as a supporter of the LTTE. He  was
    never involved with the LTTE but his brother, now  deceased,  was.  The
    Appellant claims to have  been  arrested,  detained,  ill  treated  and
    released on payment of a bribe. He claims that an  arrest  warrant  was
    issued in December 2011 and that in 2013 the authorities  went  looking
    for him in Sri Lanka. There is some evidence that he  was  treated  for
    burns in Sri Lanka by M�decins Sans Fronti�res  (MSF)  but  it  is  not
    clear when this treatment was given,   the grammar in the note is  poor
    and   it is unclear why the note would be issued in November 2011 after
    the Appellant had left the country. There is a question too of  how  he
    obtained it.

34. Because the Appellant did not give evidence there was no opportunity to
    seek clarification of any of the matters which do raise issues such  as
    the note from MSF, his evidence that he received no  medical  treatment
    or medication and his evidence relating to the death of Reji which  was
    both inconsistent and at odds with  the  background  information.    He
    clearly said in his interview that his brother shot  Reji  in  2007.  I
    note  that  the  Respondent  raised  questions  about  the  Appellant's
    identity and about the documents he was carrying when  he  entered  the
    UK.

35. It seems to me that much of the Appellant's account of  events  in  Sri
    Lanka is intrinsically  implausible.  I  have  considered  whether  his
    mental state may have caused difficulties for him  in  recounting  what
    happened in Sri Lanka but both in his screening and  asylum  interviews
    he said he had no medical problems  apart  from  some  back  pain.   He
    underwent a very comprehensive interview and gave detailed answers.  No
    other evidence was provided by the Appellant apart from a  response  to
    the refusal letter for  which  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  he  gave
    instructions to his representatives. There are no statements.

36. The Appellant was never involved with the LTTE.  I accept that  he  may
    have been suspected of involvement  because  of  his  brother.  I  must
    however take into account that he had no problems for a two year period
    between 2007 and 2009 and I consider it  highly  unlikely  that  during
    that period he did not leave the house as claimed in his interview.  He
    said that in 2009 when he was arrested there were 100  men  surrounding
    his aunt's house. It is hard to comprehend why so  many  men  would  be
    deployed on this since there is nothing to suggest that  the  Appellant
    had done anything to bring himself to the attention of the  authorities
    or that there had been any concerted effort to find him prior to  that.
    The Appellant was clear that when he was first taken  into  custody  he
    was being asked about his brother so the 100 men were not there because
    it was believed he was his brother, a known LTTE activist. It was  only
    some time into his detention that the authorities apparently formed the
    view that the Appellant was indeed his brother. This leads  me  to  ask
    how he was able to secure his release from detention, as  he  said,  '2
    years and three months after his arrest in May 2009'. His  brother  was
    apparently killed on 2nd August 2011 and the Appellant claims  to  have
    found out about this in September 2011 from the man who let him out  of
    detention.   The fact that a Major, a senior officer  was  prepared  to
    take the risk of releasing him on payment of a bribe does not  indicate
    any particular interest in the Appellant. His brother was by this  time
    dead. The Appellant left Sri Lanka in September 2011 and a warrant  for
    his arrest was issued in December that year. I do not accept  that  the
    authorities would have had any interest in the Appellant at that  time.
    In general the  chronology  of  his  account  and  of  the  documentary
    evidence raises many questions.

37. It is of course the case that in 2009 there were many arrests of people
    believed to be supporters of or working for the LTTE  either  willingly
    or otherwise.  Despite the inconsistencies in his evidence I shall give
    the Appellant the benefit of the doubt and accept that he was  at  some
    point arrested, detained and ill-treated. I agree with  the  Respondent
    that the report of Doctor Lord assists the Appellant  a  little  but  I
    think it highly unlikely that he was detained for as long as he says or
    that he was released with the aid of a Major when he says he was, given
    the very recent death of his brother who they had mistaken him for.

38. There is some additional documentary evidence  some  of  which  I  have
    referred  to  above.  It  seems  to  me  that  these   documents   were
    commissioned for the purposes of the asylum appeal. There is  a  letter
    from the police in Batticoloa saying  that  the  Appellant's  aunt  had
    reported him missing after he had been 'abducted'  by  an  unidentified
    group with green uniforms in May 2009. This document was issued on  7th
    November 2011 around the same time  as  the  other  documents  and  the
    Appellant never said he had been abducted. He was clear from the outset
    that he had been arrested.

39. I turn to the question of risk on return and in order to assess this  I
    must first consider what the Tribunal said in the Country Guidance case
    GJ.  Ms Patel in her submissions said that paragraphs 4 and 7(a)  apply
    to the Appellant.  The summary states:

         (2) The focus of the Sri Lankan government's  concern  has  changed
         since the civil war ended in May 2009. The LTTE in Sri Lanka itself
         is a spent force and there have been no terrorist  incidents  since
         the end of the civil war.

         (3)  The  government's  present  objective  is  to  identify  Tamil
         activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism  and
         to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in  Amendment
         6(1) to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983,  which  prohibits  the
         'violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka . Its focus is on
         preventing both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil
         separatist organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within
         Sri Lanka.

         (4) If a person is detained by the  Sri  Lankan  security  services
         there remains a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  or  harm  requiring
         international protection.

         (5) Internal relocation is not an option within  Sri  Lanka  for  a
         person at real risk from the  Sri  Lankan  authorities,  since  the
         government now controls the whole  of  Sri  Lanka  and  Tamils  are
         required to return to a named address  after  passing  through  the
         airport.

         (6) There are no detention facilities at the  airport.  Only  those
         whose names appear on a "stop"  list  will  be  detained  from  the
         airport. Any risk for those in whom the Sri Lankan authorities  are
         or become interested exists not at the airport, but  after  arrival
         in their home area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID
         or police within a few days.

         (7) The current categories of persons at real risk  of  persecution
         or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka,  whether  in  detention  or
         otherwise, are:

             (a) Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a  threat  to
             the integrity of Sri Lanka  as a  single  state  because  they
             are, or are perceived to have a significant role  in  relation
             to post-conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or a
             renewal of hostilities within Sri Lanka.

             (b) Journalists (whether in print or  other  media)  or  human
             rights activists, who, in either case, have criticised the Sri
             Lankan government, in particular its human rights  record,  or
             who are associated  with  publications  critical  of  the  Sri
             Lankan government.

             (c) Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned
             and  Reconciliation  Commission  implicating  the  Sri  Lankan
             security forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan authorities in
             alleged war crimes. Among those who  may  have  witnessed  war
             crimes during the conflict, particularly in the No-Fire  Zones
             in May 2009, only those who have already identified themselves
             by giving such evidence would  be  known  to  the  Sri  Lankan
             authorities and therefore  only  they  are  at  real  risk  of
             adverse attention or persecution on  return  as  potential  or
             actual war crimes witnesses.

             (d) A person whose name appears on a computerised "stop"  list
             accessible at the airport, comprising a list of those  against
             whom there  is  an  extant  court  order  or  arrest  warrant.
             Individuals whose name  appears  on  a  "stop"  list  will  be
             stopped at the airport and handed over to the appropriate  Sri
             Lankan authorities, in pursuance of such order or warrant.

         (8) The Sri Lankan authorities' approach is based on  sophisticated
         intelligence, both as to activities within Sri  Lanka  and  in  the
         diaspora. The Sri Lankan authorities  know  that  many  Sri  Lankan
         Tamils travelled abroad as economic migrants and also that everyone
         in the Northern Province had some level  of  involvement  with  the
         LTTE  during  the  civil  war.  In  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka,   an
         individual's past history will be relevant only to the extent  that
         it is perceived by the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  as  indicating  a
         present risk to the unitary Sri Lankan  state  or  the  Sri  Lankan
         Government.

         (9)  The  authorities  maintain  a  computerised   intelligence-led
         "watch" list. A person whose name appears on a "watch" list is  not
         reasonably likely to  be  detained  at  the  airport  but  will  be
         monitored by the security services after his or her return. If that
         monitoring does not indicate that such a person is a Tamil activist
         working to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state or  revive  the
         internal armed conflict, the individual  in  question  is  not,  in
         general, reasonably likely to be detained by the  security  forces.
         That will be a question of fact in  each  case,  dependent  on  any
         diaspora activities carried out by such an individual.

         (10) Consideration must always be given to whether, in the light of
         an individual's activities and responsibilities  during  the  civil
         war, the exclusion clauses are engaged (Article 1F of  the  Refugee
         Convention and  Article  12(2)  of  the  Qualification  Directive).
         Regard should be had to the categories for exclusion set out in the
         "Eligibility Guidelines For Assessing the International  Protection
         Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka ", published by UNHCR on  21
         December 2012.



40. Paragraph 4 only applies to the Appellant if he is at  risk  of  arrest
    and detention on return and taking account of what the Tribunal said at
    paragraphs 8 and 9 I see no reason to consider that he would be of  any
    interest. It is accepted  that  many  people  in  Sri  Lanka  had  some
    involvement with the LTTE but there is no evidence that  the  Appellant
    ever had any. His brother is dead. He was released from detention. I do
    not accept that an arrest  warrant  would  be  issued  against  him  in
    December 2011 or even if one was that the authorities  have  shown  any
    interest in him since then. I do not accept that they were looking  for
    him in 2013, given the evidence before the Tribunal in GJ. There is  no
    reason why the Appellant would be perceived  to  be  a  threat  to  the
    integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state. He never had any role in  the
    past let alone a significant one and if he had had such a role he would
    not have been allowed out of prison as he was and  significant  efforts
    would have been made to find him.

41. I find therefore that the Appellant has not established that there is a
    reasonable likelihood that he would face a real risk of persecution  if
    he were returned to Sri Lanka.

42. I turn now to the medical evidence and the question of whether in light
    of his medical condition the removal of the Appellant from the UK would
    give rise to a breach of his human rights under either Article 3  or  8
    of the European Convention for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
    Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).  In the most  recent  medical  report  the
    conclusion of Dr Ghosh is that the Appellant is  suffering  from  quite
    severe PTSD and that there is a causal link between  his  mental  state
    and the description of the torture. He is  receiving  anti  depressants
    and  antipsychotics.  Dr  Ghosh  says  the  antipsychotics  have   been
    prescribed because the Appellant                          has developed
    persecutory delusions in relation to people of Sri Lankan origin  as  a
    result of his PTSD. There is  a  considerable  amount  of  evidence  of
    mental health problems from which it is clear it is the fear  of  being
    returned to Sri Lanka that has the most impact  on  the  Appellant.  In
    that regard I have considered the decision of the Court of appeal  J  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629. In that
    case the Appellant, also Sri Lankan, had  said  that  he  would  commit
    suicide if he were returned  to  Sri  Lanka.  It  was  found  that  the
    Appellant had been detained and subjected to horrific torture but  that
    he would not be at risk of persecution on return. The medical  evidence
    recorded that he had taken an overdose after his asylum claim had  been
    refused and had 'features of severe depressive disorder' and PTSD.   He
    was under the care of psychiatric services  in  the  UK.  A  Consultant
    Psychiatrist said that his statement that he might kill himself in  the
    UK rather  than  be  returned  to  Sri  Lanka  'should  be  taken  very
    seriously'. She said he might try to commit suicide  en  route  to  Sri
    Lanka and thus perhaps pose a threat to other passengers. She said that
    his problems had been exacerbated by the asylum process in the UK.  The
    Court of appeal in considering the matter relied on the decision D v UK
    (1997) 24 EHRR 423 and  N(FC) v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31.They discussed  the
    question of 'a significant increase in  the  possibility  of  completed
    suicide'. They referred to JS v SSHD [2005] UKIAT 00083  and  to  AA  v
    SSHD [2005] UKIAT 00084.

43. The circumstances of the Appellant in J are clearly similar to those of
    the Appellant but I have of course considered the Appellant's  case  on
    its  own  merits  whilst  taking  account  of  the  general  principles
    expressed in J.

44. The threshold for a breach of Article 3 is extremely high and  must  be
    assessed in the light of the various stages  of  the  removal  process,
    i.e. in the UK and in Sri Lanka. There was  discussion  in  AA  and  JS
    about these various stages and it was accepted that an Appellant  would
    have the support of his  mental  health  professionals  in  the  UK  on
    receipt of the decision to remove him and that the Home Office  have  a
    policy for removals where there is a stated risk of suicide  and  would
    provide an escort if no family member was available to travel with  the
    Appellant. It was accepted that mental health care is available in  Sri
    Lanka. In AA the Tribunal said,

         "Third stage-transit: there are no reasons to suppose that the
         Secretary of State would not provide appropriately qualified
         escorts. This is known to be done. Other measures in other cases
         may include accompanying family members."
45. In J the Court said,

         'But in any event, there is no reason to suppose that the  measures
         that would be put in place in the UK to protect the appellant  from
         self-harm would not include  measures  to  mitigate  his  PTSD  and
         depression. He has  been  treated  for  these  conditions  in  this
         country for a few years, and  there  is  no  indication  that  this
         treatment will not continue for so long  as  is  necessary.  It  is
         conceded on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  there  are  adequate
         facilities in Sri Lanka, and there is no reason to suppose that his
         treatment would not be continued there.'

46. According to Dr Lord's report the  Appellant  has  the  continuing  and
    loving support of his aunt in Sri Lanka. He has presented  at  hospital
    several times saying he has had suicidal thoughts though  he  has  also
    variously said that he had no such thoughts.  On one occasion  he  said
    that that he had been walking along the  railway  line.   There  is  no
    evidence that he has ever had to be sectioned  or  indeed  hospitalised
    for any more than a few hours. It  is  recorded  in  a  letter  of  4th
    January 2014 from his Counsellor Monica Balley that  he  had  told  her
    that he had made several suicide attempts between 7/10/13 and  13/1/14.
    His hospital records record that he had threatened to  cut  his  throat
    and that he had overdosed on pills  on  6th  December  2013,  on  which
    occasion he was discharged from hospital after 5  hours.  There  is  no
    evidence of 'several suicide attempts'. I was told that  the  Appellant
    was incapable of instructing his solicitor but it  is  not  clear  when
    this became the case. He had clearly received documents from  his  aunt
    in 2013 and to assist his appeal and  these  had  been  passed  to  his
    representatives.

47.  I accept that the Appellant has mental health problems, that he on one
    occasion attended hospital having taken an overdose and that he has  on
    several occasions attended and reported  suicidal  ideation.  I  accept
    that he has medication and support in the UK. I accept that he does not
    want and indeed  fears  return  to  Sri  Lanka.     I  am  however  not
    satisfied, given the process that would be adopted to remove  him,  the
    fact that he could live with his aunt in Sri Lanka and that  she  would
    care for and support him, and the fact that  medication  and  treatment
    for his illness would be available to him, that his removal would  give
    rise to a breach of Article 3.

48. I would make it clear that I have carefully  considered  Y&  Anor  (Sri
    Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 362
    and have in particular  noted that the Court said,

         'None  of  this  reasoning  represents  a  licence  for   emotional
         blackmail by asylum-seekers. Officials and immigration judges  will
         be right to continue to scrutinise the authenticity of such  claims
         as these with care. In some cases the Home Office may want to  seek
         its own or a joint report. But there comes  a  point  at  which  an
         undisturbed finding that an appellant has been tortured  and  raped
         in captivity has to be  conscientiously  related  to  credible  and
         uncontradicted expert  evidence  that  the  likely  effect  of  the
         psychological trauma  (aggravated  in  the  present  cases  by  the
         devastation of home and  family  by  the  tsunami),  if  return  is
         enforced, will be suicide.'

49. I do not accept that the circumstances of the Appellants in  Y  pertain
    in this case. The Appellant has family in Sri Lanka and  the    medical
    evidence  does  not  support  a  finding  that  his  mental  health  is
    sufficiently serious to warrant a grant of leave to remain in the UK.

50. I have also considered whether there would be  a breach of  Article  8,
    following the guidance set out in  Razgar, R (on the Application of) v.
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, and in s117B
    of the  Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He has provided no
    detail of family life in the UK. I accept that he has  a  private  life
    and that that private life  includes  his  medical  treatment  and  his
    relationships with the professionals who look after and support him but
    for the reasons set out above I do not consider that his removal  would
    give rise to a disproportionate interference with his private life  and
    find it would be proportionate taking account of the need for effective
    immigration control in the UK.

Notice of Decision
