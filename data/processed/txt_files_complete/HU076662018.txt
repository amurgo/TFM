               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Zane Malik of Counsel, instructed by Awan Legal
Associates
For the respondent:    Mr Esen Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 16 March 2018 to refuse him indefinite leave to remain  pursuant  to
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules HC  395  (as  amended)  on  the
    basis  of  10  years'  lawful  residence   in   the   United   Kingdom,
    alternatively on human rights grounds. The appellant is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is an 'earnings discrepancy' case.  The history of this appeal  is
    set out in the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer on 4  September
    2020, setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. In brief, the appellant meets all  of  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276B, save that the respondent applied paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Rules
    (the deception provision) by reason of his  having  under-declared  his
    income in his 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 tax returns, such that  he  under
    paid tax for those years. He under-declared his self-employed income by
    almost �55000.

 4. At the beginning of the hearing today, Mr Malik  and  Mr  Tufan  agreed
    that the decision in this appeal would turn on a finding of fact as  to
    whether the appellant was dishonest in  his  submission  of  those  tax
    returns.  It was also common ground that the  burden  of  proving  that
    fact lies on the Secretary of State, not the appellant.

 5. By a transfer order dated 1 December 2020,  Acting  Principal  Resident
    Judge Kopieczek declared himself satisfied that it was not  practicable
    for Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer to remake the decision without further
    delay and the appeal was transferred  for  rehearing  afresh  before  a
    differently constituted Tribunal.

Respondent's position statement

 6. In his position statement on behalf of the respondent,  Mr  Christopher
    Bates, a senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  relied  on  Ashfaq
    (Balajigari:  appeals)  [2020]  UKUT  00226  (IAC),  Abbasi  (rule  43:
    paragraph 322(5): accountants' evidence) [2020] UKUT 00027  (IAC),  and
    Yaseen v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2020]  EWCA  Civ
    157.

 7. The  conclusions  to  be  drawn  from  those  decisions  are  that  the
    explanation by any accountant said to have made or  contributed  to  an
    error is essential,  because  the  allegation  of  error  goes  to  the
    accountant's professional standing (Ashfaq),  that  if  the  accountant
    does not attend and give evidence, the Tribunal is  unlikely  to  place
    any material weight on an accountant's letter admitting fault (Abbasi),
    and that where dishonesty is proven in an  earnings  discrepancy  case,
    very strong positive factors will be necessary before the balance  will
    tilt back in favour of indefinite leave to  remain  for  the  appellant
    (Yaseen).

 8. The respondent maintained her position.

Appellant's case

 9. In his skeleton argument for the appellant,  Mr  Malik  identified  two
    issues: first, whether the  appellant  was  dishonest  in  his  earlier
    dealings with the Secretary of State and/or HMRC and falls for  refusal
    under paragraph 322(5), and second, whether in any event,  his  removal
    would  breach  the  United   Kingdom's   Article   8   ECHR   duty   by
    disproportionately interfering with his private and family life in  the
    United Kingdom.

10. The appellant had lived in the United Kingdom lawfully for more than 10
    years and in principle, subject to the dishonesty issue, qualified  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of long residence  (paragraph
    276B of the Rules). Mr Malik relied on Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department v Shehzad  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  615,  in  which  Lord  Justice
    Beatson, with whom Lady Justice Black and  Lady  Justice  King  agreed,
    observed that in cases involving allegations of dishonesty, the primary
    evidential burden was on the Secretary of State  to  furnish  proof  of
    deception.  If the Secretary of State provided prima facie evidence  of
    deception, the burden shifted to the appellant to provide  a  plausible
    innocent explanation.

11. There was no legal burden  on  the  appellant  to  disprove  dishonesty
    (Balajigari v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 673, at [42] in the judgment of Lord Justice  Underhill,  who  gave
    the judgment of the court).  The Secretary of State must prove that the
    appellant  was  dishonest,  which   required   reliable   evidence   of
    sufficiently reprehensible conduct and an assessment of whether his  or
    her presence in the United Kingdom was  undesirable.   That  should  be
    followed by a balancing exercise as to whether there were other factors
    outweighing the presumption that leave should be refused.

12. Mr Malik also relied on Yaseen.  The  appellant's  case  was  that  the
    respondent was unable to prove that he was  personally  dishonest;  and
    even if he were, the nature of the alleged conduct was not such  as  to
    engage paragraph 276B(ii)(c) and 322(5) of the Rules.

13. The discretionary refusal  of  indefinite  leave  to  remain  would  be
    neither  justified  nor  proportionate,  it  being  accepted  that  the
    appellant met all the other requirements of paragraph 276B:   see  also
    Ashfaq  and OA and others  (human  rights:  new  matter:  section  120)
    Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65 (IAC).   Mr Malik also made brief  reference  to
    section 117B and to the decision of the Supreme  Court  in  Rhuppiah  v
    Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  58:  an
    appellant's appeal could sometimes succeed even where  his  immigration
    status was always precarious.

14. On the facts of this appeal, the public interest in removal was reduced
    to the extent that his removal from the United Kingdom would amount  to
    a disproportionate interference with his Article 8 ECHR rights.

15. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the  Upper  Tribunal
    today.

Upper Tribunal hearing

16. I heard oral evidence from four witnesses: the appellant  himself;  his
    former accountant Mr Muhammad Afzal Khan of Universal Accounts Ltd; his
    present accountant, Mr Talaat Mahmoud Sheikh of Graham Nobel Denholm  &
    Co; and his former landlord and friend, Mr Mohammed Taj.

17. On the crucial issue, the appellant's evidence was that  this  was  his
    first year of self-employment; that he did not know much about tax  and
    was distracted by his mother's steeply declining health;  and  that  he
    relied on Mr Khan entirely.  He said that at the end of  the  year,  Mr
    Khan sent him a document of about 15-20 pages  and  that  he  had  pre-
    authorised Mr Khan's firm to submit his tax return.   He  approved  the
    tax return by telephone:

         "He asked me, do I want to submit these taxes, and I said, yes, you
         carry on.  He said he would complete everything and I  approved  it
         on the phone.  I had already given him my consent: [I told him] you
         can make my accounts, everything."

    That is certainly an incautious and careless approach to  an  important
    matter like accounting for taxes to the Inland Revenue, which  was  the
    appellant's personal responsibility, not that of his accountant.

18. The appellant's account is that he did not discover the error until  he
    was consulting a mortgage advisor some three  years  later:  Mr  Jayesh
    Patel, a mortgage advisor with GB Mortgages Limited  has  confirmed  in
    writing that he did advise the appellant on his mortgage  in  September
    2015, and that the appellant came along with his then landlord, Mr Taj.

19. The appellant's account, not confirmed in the letter from Mr Patel,  is
    that Mr Patel expressed his opinion that with the declared income,  the
    appellant could not afford a mortgage.  The appellant then replied that
    he was sure he had earned more than the sum declared.

20. With the help of Mr Sheikh's firm, the appellant  caused  his  previous
    tax returns to be investigated and discovered the discrepancy. He  made
    a payment plan with HMRC  for  �14816.16  including  interest,  but  no
    penalties, to be paid in instalments of �200 over 73 months.

21. When challenged about the error, Mr Khan took responsibility  and  paid
    the interest due to the appellant in cash.  He says he did  so  because
    the firm's card reader for electronic payment was not working that day.
    Mr Khan paid the appellant �1852.67 for damages and interest,  and  the
    appellant  banked  �1720  the  same  day,  having  spent  the  balance.
    Universal Accounts Ltd's invoice dated 4 May 2016, and a bank statement
    for the period 27 February - 27 May 2016 are produced, and support that
    account.

22. The appellant  was  satisfied  by  the  reparation  made  by  Universal
    Accounts Ltd and made no complaint to any external  professional  body.



23. There was no re-examination.

24. Mr Muhammad Afzal Khan confirmed his name and address and  adopted  his
    statement.  He was tendered for cross-examination. He accepted that  he
    should have checked the trainee accountant's work, but they  were  very
    busy at that time.

25. When pressed, Mr Khan said the trainee's name was Zayrab  Tasdiq:  that
    name does not appear in his witness  statement.  No  witness  statement
    from Mr Tasdiq is before me and he did  not  give  oral  evidence.   Mr
    Tasdiq no longer worked for Universal Accounts Ltd and  Mr  Khan  could
    not say whether he had subsequently qualified  as  an  accountant.   Mr
    Khan said that was up to the Tribunal whether to count Mr Tasdiq  as  a
    trained accountant now.

26. Mr Khan explained that the firm had at that  time  two  clients  called
    Tahir Iqbal, and that Mr Tasdiq had used the wrong file to prepare  the
    appellant's accounts.  Mr Khan had apologised to both clients and  paid
    compensation to the appellant (�1852.67 in cash) for the interest which
    he had to pay to HMRC when the correct position was declared.  Mr  Khan
    could not explain how he happened to have that much cash  available  to
    pay the appellant on that day.

27. Mr Khan took the opportunity to clarify paragraph 8(d) of  his  witness
    statement, which as adopted reads as follows:

         "8. ... (d)   Filing tax returns was implicitly part of our service
         (our expertise) that we provided.  We hereby confirm  that  we  did
         not send  Mr  Tahir  Iqbal  tax  returns  for  his  perusal  before
         submission, as we prepare all our tax  returns  through  commercial
         software."

    Mr Khan said that he had meant to  say  that  they  had  not  sent  the
    appellant the tax calculation document:  he  had  sent  the  draft  tax
    return, of course.

28. Both documents were about 16-18 pages long.   The  commercial  software
    which they used to prepare  tax  returns  was  called  TaxFiler.  After
    sending the appellant the draft tax return, he had telephoned  him  for
    approval, then submitted the tax return to HMRC.   Mr  Khan  emphasised
    that 'Never ever we can file tax  return  without  showing  it  to  the
    client'.

29. There was no re-examination.

30. Mr Talaat Mahmoud Sheikh, the appellant's current accountant, confirmed
    his name and address and adopted his statement. So far as  relevant  to
    these proceedings, Mr Sheikh's evidence was as follows:

         "Mr Iqbal came to see us in early October 2015  requesting  details
         of his taxable income required for  a  mortgage  assessment.   This
         income is normally based on the SA302 certification issued by HMRC.

         We therefore  carried  out  a  review  of  our  client's  2012/2013
         (06/04/2012  to  05/04/2013)  income  and  2013/14  (06/04/2013  to
         05/04/2014) income for mortgage purposes.   Because  Mr  Iqbal  was
         employed as well as self-employed during these two  tax  years,  we
         carried out an exercise to establish our  clients'  taxable  income
         for these two tax years from the  two  sources  of  income.   As  a
         result of this review, it came to light that our client's 2012/2013
         income showed a substantial shortfall [of �32647]...

         Mr Tahir Iqbal had been under  the  impression  that  all  his  tax
         affairs were up to date and correct to reflect his true income.  He
         was therefore very surprised to learn of the 2012/2013 shortfall in
         income.

         Mr Iqbal then instructed us to carry out a review of  the  previous
         two tax years  (2010/11  and  2011/12)  in  case  there  were  more
         errors... Upon carrying out a review of the two tax years, it  came
         to light that Mr Iqbal's 2010/11  income  showed  a  shortfall  [of
         �27769]. ...

         We advised Mr Tahir Iqbal that due to the gravity of the errors  he
         should contact his ex-accountant immediately and to get the 2010/11
         and 2012/13 tax files reviewed by him.  Once this review  had  been
         carried out by the ex-accountant and the findings  made  known,  we
         immediately prepared amended 2010/11 and 2012/13  self-  assessment
         tax returns as instructed  by  Mr  T  Iqbal  and  which  were  duly
         forwarded to HMRC under cover of our letter on the 26/11/2015.

         Our client has exercised  his  rights  to  amend  his  2010/11  and
         2012/13 tax returns under the provisions of  the  Taxes  Management
         Act 1970 and which were accepted in their entirety by HMRC. ... "

31. There was no cross-examination of Mr Sheikh by Mr Tufan.

32. In answer to questions from me, Mr Sheikh said that the practice of his
    firm was that they would normally email the draft tax  return  and  tax
    calculation to a client, including the potential tax liability, queries
    and outstanding issues, and  receive  approval  by  email.   Sometimes,
    although not recently because of the pandemic, he would see a client to
    go through the tax return for approval.  No tax return would  be  filed
    without client approval.

33. If the client telephoned rather than emailed, Mr Sheikh  would  make  a
    timed and dated note to document the approval, but 'more and  more,  it
    comes by email'.  He had never been in the position of  having  to  pay
    compensation, but if he did so, it would not be in cash: he would  want
    the transaction to be documented.

34. In answer to a supplementary question from Mr  Malik,  Mr  Sheikh  said
    this:

         "It is technically possible for an incompetent accountant to submit
         a tax return without showing the client  the  tax  calculation.   I
         think it's quite possible."

35. Mr Sheikh's evidence therefore stands  unchallenged  and  falls  to  be
    treated as entirely credible.

Analysis

36. It was common ground that the only issue in this appeal is whether,  as
    a matter of fact, the respondent could show that the appellant had used
    deception in making the under  declarations  which  had  triggered  the
    respondent's reliance on paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules  HC
    395 (as amended).

37. I have to decide which witnesses before me gave reliable evidence.   Mr
    Sheikh's evidence was not questioned and must be taken to be  credible.
    Mr Khan was an  unimpressive  witness,  but  his  account  of  the  lax
    proceedings in his firm was  confirmed  by  Mr  Sheikh.   The  accepted
    evidence of Mr  Sheikh  was  that  it  was  'quite  possible'  that  an
    incompetent accountant, such as Mr Khan admitted his firm to be,  might
    submit a tax return without showing the client the tax calculation.

38. The unshaken evidence of the appellant and of Mr Khan was that  he  had
    pre-authorised the firm of Universal Accounts Ltd to do just  that  and
    that he had  approved  the  submission  of  his  tax  return  over  the
    telephone, having not checked the accounts, because he  was  na�ve  and
    his mother was very ill.

39. The evidence before me does establish laxity and  carelessness  by  the
    appellant in failing to check his tax return  at  a  time  of  personal
    stress. It is right to say that he behaved irresponsibly in failing  to
    check his tax returns, which was not compliant with his duty  to  HMRC.
    However, the underpayment has been declared and HMRC  have  imposed  no
    penalties on the appellant.

40.  The  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  establishes   incompetence   and
    negligence by Universal Accounts Ltd and  by  Mr  Khan  in  failing  to
    supervise a junior member of his  staff.  The  appellant,  having  been
    compensated for  the  interest  accumulated,  chose  not  to  take  the
    professional negligence issue further.  That  was  a  matter  for  him,
    although his forbearance seems generous.

41. On the evidence before me, and applying the ordinary civil standard  of
    balance  of  probabilities,  the  respondent  has  not  discharged  the
    evidential burden upon her of proving dishonesty by the appellant.   It
    was not necessary to go on to consider Article 8 ECHR  and  I  make  no
    findings thereon. Absent a finding of  dishonesty,  as  agreed  by  all
    parties at the beginning of the hearing, this appeal must succeed.

DECISION

42. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law and has been set aside.


    I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.
