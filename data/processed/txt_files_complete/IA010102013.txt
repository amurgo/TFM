    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: the appellant did not
           appear and was not represented
          For the Respondent: Ms M Tanner a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who was born on 24 June  1982.  He
      has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge A  Cresswell  who  dismissed  his  appeal  against  the
      respondent's decision of 21 December  2012  to  refuse  him  leave  to
      remain in the UK as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the
      Points-based  System  and  for  a  Biometric  Residence  Permit.   The
      respondent also made a decision to remove the appellant from the UK by
      way of directions under  s  47  of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  and
      Nationality Act 2006.


   2. The application was refused because the respondent  did  not  consider
      that the appellant was entitled to the required points for Maintenance
      (Funds). The bank statements he had supplied were not for the required
      period or a complete set.


   3. The appellant appealed and asked for his appeal to  be  determined  on
      the papers which is what the judge did on  8  March  2013.  The  judge
      found that although the appellant had said that he would  supply  more
      particulars none had been submitted. The  situation  had  not  changed
      since the position considered by the respondent.  The  respondent  had
      established the grounds for refusal. The judge dismissed the appeal on
      asylum and human rights grounds.


   4. The appellant applied for permission to appeal which was granted by  a
      judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. Notice the  hearing  before  me  was
      given to the appellant and his solicitors. The solicitors wrote to the
      Tribunal on 8 July 2013 stating that they would  not  be  representing
      the appellant at the hearing and asking that the case  be  decided  by
      way of written submissions. They enclosed a bundle containing  a  copy
      duplicate bank certificate of deduction of tax, 21 pages of copy  bank
      statements, a copy of what may be the  appellant's  Nepalese  identity
      card and a copy of the UK Visa from his passport.


   5.  I  heard  the  appeal  in  the  absence  of  the  appellant  and  his
      representatives with brief oral submissions from Ms Tanner.


   6. In paragraph 7 of the determination the  judge  listed  the  documents
      before him which included "(ii) the notice  of  appeal  and  documents
      attached that notice and received since that notice". It is clear that
      the judge had before him the respondent's bundle and a letter from the
      appellant's solicitors dated 3 January 2013  submitting  the  form  of
      appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal, the reasons for refusal letter  and
      grounds of appeal. I cannot find on the Tribunal file any other bundle
      or any letter from the appellant or his solicitors indicating  that  a
      bundle of documents has been supplied.


   7. The judge said that in the grounds of appeal the  appellant  indicated
      that he intended to particularise his grounds further but he  had  not
      done so.


   8. In his grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  the  appellant  claims
      that the judge failed to give proper consideration to "the  bundle  of
      documents that were submitted by him in support of his application and
      in the appellant's bundle of documents (which was sent  prior  to  the
      hearing). A copy of the  appellant's  bundle  is  enclosed  with  this
      appeal." The First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  who  granted  permission  to
      appeal could not find this bundle. She said this in  paragraph  4  her
      grant of permission. I would have expected the appellant's  solicitors
      to have picked up on this and to have  provided  the  missing  bundle.
      They have not done so. I cannot find such a  bundle  on  the  Tribunal
      file nor any sufficient indication that it was ever submitted. I  find
      that the appellant has not established that it was ever submitted.  It
      has not been said that the bundle submitted with the latest letter, of
      8 July 2013, is the missing bundle which was either before  the  judge
      or submitted with the application for  permission  to  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal.


   9. I must consider whether the judge erred in law. The main allegation is
      that he did so by failing to consider a bundle of  relevant  documents
      submitted by the appellant. The appellant  has  not  established  that
      such a bundle was submitted or that it was before the judge. It is not
      clear what the bundle contained or whether this would  have  made  any
      difference. If,  which  has  not  been  claimed,  the  missing  bundle
      contained the same copy bank statements as those in the  bundle  which
      accompanied the solicitors letter of 8 July 2013, then  the  appellant
      has not established that these were ever before the respondent or  the
      judge. I have studied these bank statements and they do not show  that
      the appellant was in possession of the required �1600 for the required
      consecutive 28  day  period  to  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in
      paragraph 1A  of  Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  bank
      statements show no consecutive 28 day period  prior  to  the  date  of
      application during which the balance  at  all  times  amounted  to  or
      exceeded �1600. In these circumstances the  appellant  has  not  shown
      that even if the respondent had exercised any  evidential  flexibility
      policy it would have made any difference.


  10. I cannot see any basis on which the appeal  could  have  succeeded  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds on the evidence before the judge.


  11. I  find  that  the  judge  did  not  err  in  law  and  I  uphold  his
      determination.
