                     DECISION BY CONSENT AND DIRECTIONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

      i) Upon the parties' agreement that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal promulgated on 4th January 2019 discloses a material error
         of law, it is hereby ordered by consent as follows.

     ii) The First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of law in relation to the
         complaints made in the Grounds of Appeal specifically  in  relation
         to the Appellant's request for  an  adjournment  or  bringing  this
         matter to the  judge's  attention  prior  to  promulgation  of  the
         decision on 4th January 2019.

    iii) The error is quantified and agreed as follows:

          a) As noted by Judge Blundell in granting permission  to  appeal,
             the Appellant stated he was unable to attend  his  hearing  on
             2nd January 2019 at  IAC  Newport  owing  to  illness  and  he
             applied for an adjournment through his solicitors on that same
             day by way of an e-mail to the customer service address albeit
             at 12:20pm in the afternoon.  That e-mail attached to it a fax
             cover sheet.  I do not understand why a fax was  not  sent  to
             IAC Newport instead of an email, however, the email  that  was
             sent attached (i) a 'notice of acting'  from  MTG  Solicitors,
             and (ii) a statement of fitness for  work  advising  that  the
             Appellant was not fit for work between 31st December 2018  and
             7th January 2019 and (iii) a prescription  for  the  Appellant
             dated 31st December 2018 prescribing some Triptan tablets  for
             a migraine attack.

          b) The judge's consideration of these matters may be seen at ��11
             to 12 of the decision.  It appears that at  the  date  of  the
             hearing on 2nd January 2019 the Tribunal had  not  heard  from
             the Appellant and there was no communication from  him  or  an
             application for  an  adjournment  and  leaves  me  with  great
             sympathy for the  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  First-tier
             Tribunal Judge rightly made a check with  the  representatives
             on  file  (as  far  as  he  was  aware  of  who  the   current
             representatives were) to discover whether they had applied for
             a further adjournment or not, and  noted  that  the  time  and
             venue for the hearing had been sent out  by  first-class  post
             and that the Appellant had replied that he  would  attend  the
             hearing on 2nd January 2019.

          c) It thus appears that the judge was unaware  of  the  email  of
             12:20pm of 2nd January 2019 and its attachments  at  least  on
             the date of hearing and possibly prior to the  decision  being
             drafted.  This appears to be because the e-mail that was  sent
             to the Tribunal's customer services address at 12:20pm on  2nd
             January 2019 was not forwarded to IAC Newport until 11:52am on
             4th January 2019.

          d) In granting permission to appeal Judge Blundell noted, that it
             was a "most unsatisfactory state of affairs", which could have
             been avoided if the Appellant's  newly  instructed  solicitors
             had attended the hearing rather than assuming as they  did  in
             their facts of 2nd January 2019 that a  revised  hearing  date
             would  simply  be  provided.   Judge  Blundell   demanded   an
             explanation for the  course  of  action  taken  by  the  newly
             instructed solicitors and directed that it should be  provided
             to the Upper Tribunal.

          e) By way of a letter of 1st March 2019, written  anonymously  on
             behalf of MTG Solicitors, it is stated that the non-attendance
             occurred for two reasons:

             "1.  Junior Counsel could not be instructed so late in the day
                  to make an adjournment request and

               2. The funds  held  on  account  were  for  the  substantive
                  hearing which the Appellant had put  together  with  great
                  difficulty with the assistance of his family and therefore
                  he could not afford to waste further costs for Counsel  to
                  attend for the adjournment request.  This is especially as
                  fees are considerably higher for Counsel given Newport FTT
                  is not the Appellant's local court.  In light of this, the
                  Appellant instructed the firm to write to the FTT  in  the
                  above terms.  The Appellant  is  only  19  years  old  and
                  unfortunately not in receipt of Legal Aid therefore it  is
                  important for the funds put together to  be  used  at  the
                  substantive hearing.  Sadly they have now been used in the
                  upcoming UT appearance due to the judge at the FTT  giving
                  no consideration of the request made by us on 2nd  January
                  2019."

 2. Notwithstanding the statement that attendance on the day of the hearing
    was  not  possible  due  to  the  Appellant's  limited  funds,  further
    conflicting remarks were made by the Appellant in e-mail sent by him to
    the Tribunal's customer service address on 2nd January 2019 at  10:16pm
    at night (that being the same day his hearing had taken place).  This e-
    mail also sent to customer services was received at  IAC  Newport,  the
    following morning, on 3rd  January  2019  at  11:22am.   The  Appellant
    confirmed that he had instructed his solicitors on 24th  December  2018
    and stated that he had been advised not to attend court when  he  spoke
    with his solicitors on 31st December  2018.   The  Appellant  complains
    also in his e-mail of lapses by his solicitors and being let  down  and
    essentially explaining his reasons for not attending as falling at  the
    solicitor's door, and not his.

 3. On behalf of the Secretary of  State,  I  was  asked  to  note  certain
    peculiar features, however, happily, it is not for me to determine  (a)
    the veracity of when the Appellant's solicitors  were  instructed,  (b)
    whether or not they could or should have come on  record  earlier,  (c)
    why they did not phone or fax the First-tier Tribunal on  the  date  of
    hearing to convey their adjournment application or (d) confirm its safe
    receipt given it was not sent  in  time  for  the  10am  start  of  the
    Tribunal's list, nor (e) whether the Appellant was told not  to  attend
    without an adjournment being secured, nor (f)  whether  there  was  any
    truth to the Appellant's complaints against his own solicitors.

 4. I share Judge Blundell's view that this is a most unsatisfactory  state
    of affairs however whilst I must note the peculiarities of this appeal,
    none of the above is ultimately germane to the error of law at stake.

 5. The short point that I  take  from  all  of  this  is  that  the  first
    communication to arrive at the Tribunal was  the  e-mail  sent  by  the
    Appellant on 2nd January 2019 at 10:16pm which arrived on  3rd  January
    2019 at 11:22am.  This document according to a manuscript note  on  its
    face was put before Judge Woolley on 4th  January  2019  however  Judge
    Woolley directed that the judgment already being  made  would  continue
    with promulgation in the normal course.  It is that  action  which  the
    parties agree was a material error of law as, at that point,  as  noted
    by Judge Blundell, the First-tier Tribunal  was  still  seized  of  the
    matter: see E and R v Secretary of State  for  Home  Department  [2004]
    EWCA Civ 49, [2004] QB 1044 at [27]  which  confirms  inter  alia  that
    "...up until the date of promulgation,  the  IAT  would  have  been  at
    liberty to admit further evidence (whether or not it was under any duty
    to do so)...In accordance with ordinary principles,  the  IAT  remained
    seized of the matter until the decision was  formally  communicated  to
    the parties".

 6. It was therefore an error for the judge to not consider  the  materials
    submitted by the Appellant regarding his non-attendance.  I do not know
    whether the email (and its attachments) from the solicitors  ever  made
    its way before the judge;  however,  after  receiving  the  Appellant's
    email, the judge ought to have either recalled the parties or acted  in
    some  way  upon  the  communication  rather  than  proceed   with   the
    promulgation of the  decision  of  4th  January  2019  given  that  the
    Appellant's application  to  adjourn  was  brought  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's attention before promulgation when it was  still  seised  of
    the matter.

 7. As a consequence of the above agreed errors, the decision is set  aside
    in  its  entirety  and  is  remitted  to  be  heard  by  a  differently
    constituted bench.

 8. The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error by
    consent.

Directions

10. I make the following directions for the  continuation  of  this  appeal
    that shall shortly follow before the First-tier Tribunal:

    1.   The appeal is to be remitted to IAC Hatton Cross (not IAC Newport,
         given that the Appellant  suffers  from  funding  difficulties  and
         given the unnecessary distance that he  would  have  to  travel  to
         attend his hearing).

    2.   A Dari interpreter is required.

    3.   At present the Appellant and two witnesses may be called  to  give
         evidence.

    4.   The time estimate given for this appeal is three hours.

    5.   No special directions have been requested and none shall therefore
         be given however I note that the Appellant is yet to serve a bundle
         upon the Tribunal in any form and I thus  direct  that  any  bundle
         shall be served no later than 7 days before the remitted hearing.

    6.   The First-tier Tribunal issued an  anonymity  direction  which  is
         hereby maintained.




Anonymity

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
