For the Appellant:     Mr Brown, Counsel instructed by CB Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Ethiopia born in 1988.  He appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Housego) to dismiss his appeal on all grounds.

 2. The background to the appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that
    the Appellant is an illegal entrant who has lived in the United Kingdom
    since at least 2006.  An  asylum  claim  was  rejected  and  he  became
    'appeal rights exhausted' in  2007.   He  did  not  however  leave  the
    country and in 2015 he was convicted on two counts of  Grievous  Bodily
    Harm and sentenced to concurrent sentences of 7 ï¿½ years'  imprisonment.




 3. It will be apparent from that brief chronology that the  Appellant  had
    something of an uphill struggle in respect of the 'human  rights'  limb
    of his appeal. It was not however a hopeless cause, with the  Appellant
    submitting inter  alia  that  he  was  a  victim  of  torture  who  had
    psychological problems as a result.  The  Appellant  also  relied  upon
    protection grounds, arguing that  he  was  exempt  from  the  automatic
    deportation provisions in s32 of the Borders Act 2007 because he was in
    fact a refugee. The basis  of  that  claim  was  involvement  in  Oromo
    separatism.

 4. When the appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal the  Appellant  was
    in  detention.  The  hearing  was  held  at  Harmondsworth.   When  the
    Appellant was brought  before  the  judge  he  was  unrepresented.   He
    indicated that there were some documents in his cell which he wanted to
    present. These included documents relating to his relationships with  a
    partner and child in the United Kingdom, a 'Rule 35'  report  which  he
    averred would confirm  his  history  of  torture,  and  some  documents
    purporting to originate from the police in Addis Ababa in the course of
    an investigation into the Appellant's "unlawfully inciting  people  for
    an uprising". The judge declined to permit the Appellant to  return  to
    his cell to get the documents and the hearing proceeded  without  them.
    The appeal was then dismissed on all grounds.

 5. The Appellant, still at that stage unrepresented, drafted  the  grounds
    himself.  First-tier Tribunal EM Simpson considered  it  arguable  that
    they disclosed an error of  law  in  the  approach  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal:

         "Having regard to the primacy of the principle of  natural  justice
         underlying  our  jurisdiction  of  law,   there  appeared  material
         grounds giving rise to arguable errors  of  law  having  considered
         both the Decision and permission grounds (and for clarification the
         typed record of proceedings) that when determining the  appeal  the
         judge appeared to have inadequate regard to  the  appellant  having
         been unrepresented at the hearing, including in the light  of  R.35
         evidence that  likely he was a vulnerable adult witness , of  which
         R.35 Report there  was  a  brief  mention  and  discussion  in  the
         decision (para 41, 62) but absence of regard to its import viz. the
         Presidential  Guidance  'Child  Vulnerable  Adult   and   Sensitive
         Witness' with no sight of said report in the appeal file, only  the
         HO's response of  the  07/06/2019,  giving  rise  to  the  question
         whether it had effectively been the HO  response  which  the  judge
         considered...".


    Judge Simpson also regarded it as arguable that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons.

 6. Before me  Mr  Diwnycz  accepted  that  at  least  in  respect  of  the
    procedural unfairness  point  upon  which  Judge  Simpson  had  granted
    permission, he was not in a position to advance a  contrary  case.  The
    Appellant  had  asserted  that  he  was  a  victim  of   torture,   was
    unrepresented and wanted the matter put back in the list to enable  him
    to fetch papers from his cell. Those papers were subsequently submitted
    with the grounds of appeal,  prima  facie  indicating  that  they  were
    indeed available to him.  The Secretary of  State,  whilst  maintaining
    that the case was without merit and  should  ultimately  be  dismissed,
    accepted that fairness, particularly in  respect  of  an  unrepresented
    witness,  required  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  conduct  a   careful
    assessment of whether he was in fact  a  'vulnerable'  adult   witness.
    Such a finding should have been the starting  point  of  the  tribunal,
    since it would frame the way in which the hearing  would  proceed,  and
    the evidence would be assessed.  No such finding is discernible in  the
    decision. For that reason it is accepted that the decision must be  set
    aside to be  remade  by  another  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    remittal being  the  appropriate  disposal  in  a  case  of  procedural
    unfairness.




    Anonymity Order

 7. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




      Decisions

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The  appeal
    is to be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal.


 9. There is an order for anonymity.
