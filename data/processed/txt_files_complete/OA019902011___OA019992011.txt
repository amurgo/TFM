Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Caskie, instructed by Katani & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms C Gough, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The sponsor is a national of China.  He has an  unedifying  immigration
    history, but he has indefinite leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom,
    confirmed following a successful appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The appellants are his wife and son,  the  latter  now  aged  20.   The
    appellants' appeal to this Tribunal against the determination of  Judge
    J C  Grant-Hutchinson  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  their
    appeals against the decisions of the respondent  on  22  November  2010
    refusing them entry clearance with a view to settlement as the wife and
    minor child of the sponsor.

 2. As will be apparent from the date  of  the  decision  under  challenge,
    these appeals have a long history.  As it happened, the appeals against
    the Entry Clearance Officer's decision coincided with an  investigation
    by the Secretary of State into the status of the sponsor.  At the  date
    fixed for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  sponsor  had
    been recently detained, and so did not appear.  There was no very clear
    explanation for his absence.  The  judge  proceeded  to  determine  the
    appeals, and dismiss them.  On 18 July 2011 he was served  with  Notice
    of a Decision under s 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999,  which
    had the effect of invalidating his leave. He had an in-country right of
    appeal which he exercised, successfully as we have said: on 20 December
    2011 the First-tier Tribunal sent out its decision allowing his appeal.
     No immediate action  was  taken  by  those  representing  him  or  the
    appellants.  The next event of note is  an  application,  long  out  of
    time, for  permission  to  appeal  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination.  That application was granted by a  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge: although it is far from clear on what basis he decided to extend
    time.  The Upper  Tribunal  remitted  the  appeals  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and they were heard by Judge Grant-Hutchinson on 3 July  2013.
     At that stage the issues between the parties were firstly, whether the
    marriage was subsisting and the parties intended to live together,  and
    secondly,  whether  there  would  be  adequate  maintenance   for   the
    appellants, without recourse to public funds, if they were admitted  to
    the United Kingdom.  Judge Grant-Hutchinson found  in  the  appellants'
    favour on the first point, but dismissed the appeal because she was not
    satisfied as to maintenance.  Her conclusions on  that  issue  are  the
    subject of the appeal to this Tribunal.

 3. We are concerned with events as they were at the date of  the  decision
    on 22 November 2010.  The second appellant  was  well  under  18.   The
    judge correctly referred to the levels of income  support  which  would
    payable to a family consisting of the sponsor  and  the  appellants  if
    they  were  entitled  to  claim  benefits.   She  then  calculated  the
    sponsor's income net of housing costs, and found that, on the basis  of
    the documents produced to her, it was over �240 a week  short  of  what
    would be required to maintain  his  family  adequately.   It  had  been
    suggested to her that the most important of the documents  produced  to
    her, that is to say, the sponsor's  tenancy  agreement,  misstated  the
    rent as weekly, when monthly rent was intended: she did the calculation
    on that basis too, and found that there would still not  be  sufficient
    money: the shortfall was over �36 per week, and that was without taking
    into account any Council  Tax  liability,  because  the  judge  had  no
    information about whether the rent included Council Tax or not.

 4. The judge therefore concluded that the appeal  must  be  dismissed  for
    failure to meet the maintenance requirements of the rules.

 5. Earlier in her determination, the judge  had  described  the  issue  of
    maintenance as arising unexpectedly in the  hearing  before  her.   The
    judge who granted permission to appeal against Judge Grant-Hutchinson's
    decision remarked that it was not easy to see why that  was  the  case,
    because maintenance had  been  in  issue  in  the  original  Notice  of
    Decision.  We agree.  The parties had had some  years'  notice  of  the
    issue.  In any event, the appellants' representative was given time  to
    reassess the position,  and  confirmed  the  sponsor's  instruction  to
    proceed with the appeal on the basis of the material available.

 6. The grounds of the appeal attempt to  exploit  the  judge's  acceptance
    that the matter was unexpected, by asserting that "since the appeal the
    sponsor has advised that his wife had employment  in  2010  in  China",
    which had not been taken into account.  The grounds  also  assert  that
    the judge failed to take into account the sponsor's savings,  amounting
    to some �2,412 in total, and the proceeds  of  the  sale  of  a  house,
    evidenced  by  the  first  appellant's  bank  account  book.   All  the
    documentation relevant to the savings was, it is said, before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 7. The judge who granted permission to appeal remarked that it is unlikely
    that the sponsor's savings could in the end make very much  difference,
    and the first appellant's alleged employment in China in 2010 does  not
    seem to affect the matter at all; but the issue of the proceeds of  the
    sale of  the  house  might  do  so,  and  on  that  basis  she  granted
    permission.

 8. At the hearing before us,  without  objection  from  Ms  Gough  or  the
    Tribunal, Mr Caskie relied on all the financial strands of the grounds.
     He did his very best with them, but in our judgment he entirely failed
    to show any proper basis upon which it could be said  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge erred in law or that,  in  any  event,  the  appeal
    ought to have been allowed on the maintenance issue.

 9. Mr Caskie's first difficulty is  that  it  does  not  appear  that  the
    sources of income now said to be determinative of the issue  were  ever
    referred to in the course of  the  proceedings  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or indeed at any previous  time.   There  is  nothing  in  the
    nature of the amount of savings, or  the  other  suggested  sources  of
    finance, which could be regarded as  pointing  unambiguously  to  their
    availability or use for the maintenance of the  family,  and  in  these
    circumstances we find it very difficult indeed to see  what  error  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge is said to have made.

10. But, if we had been satisfied that she erred in failing  to  take  into
    account the material that was before her in the  sense  now  urged,  it
    does not help very much.  Even given the further  time  of  preparation
    for the appeal before us, many of the figures  are  still  vague.   The
    issue of Council Tax is still uncertain.  The cost of the  air  tickets
    (which would have to come out of the savings) is  still  unknown.   The
    issue of whether the lease contains an error in its important terms  is
    still unresolved.

11. So far as the savings are concerned,  if  we  deducted  the  amount  Mr
    Caskie suggested - �800 - for the air tickets, there would be a  little
    over �1600 left, which, on the best interpretation of the  facts  would
    make up the shortfall for rather under a year: that is to say, if there
    were no other charges on it, no liability to pay Council Tax and if the
    rent is in truth payable  monthly.   The  savings  do  not,  therefore,
    assist the appellants to show that they would be adequately  maintained
    even for the duration of the initial validity of the  visa  which  they
    seek.  We should record in addition  that  Ms  Gough  said  that  there
    appeared to have been previous earnings, on which tax may  be  payable.
    That is too generalised an assertion for us to be  able  to  take  into
    account as influencing our decision, but it is  a  factor  which  might
    possibly assist in showing that the decision is unlikely to be  unjust.



12. So far as the funds arising from the sale of the house  are  concerned,
    it is certainly true that evidence of them was before the judge.   Page
    197 of the bundle shows a credit of 1,310,000 RMB on 22 March 2011, and
    this is said that that is the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  the  house.
    Before that payment, the first appellant's  savings  were  very  modest
    indeed.  There is also a document apparently dated  19  November  2010,
    recording a payment of a sum  of  �21,500  to  the  sponsor's  Bank  of
    China's account.  We mention that for completeness: the  appellants  do
    not appear to rely on it, and the sponsor's  recent  witness  statement
    does not mention it.   That  statement  repeats  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's wages and his savings, and says that the family home was sold
    in March 2011 and that the proceeds of sale are  indeed  the  1,310,000
    RMB, described as equivalent to about �13,578.80.

13. The sale of the house was well after the date of the  decision:  indeed
    it is specifically stated by the sponsor to have been  in  response  to
    the decision.  It  was  clearly  not  envisaged  on  the  date  of  the
    decision, on which date the  appellants  must  have  hoped  that  their
    applications would be granted, rather than being refused.  There is  no
    evidence that on the date of the decision it was  properly  foreseeable
    that the house would be sold or indeed that if sold  it  would  readily
    reach any particular amount of money.  More to the point,  however,  is
    that it is accepted that the sponsor and the first appellant have other
    family members remaining in China.  There is no evidence, and there has
    never been any evidence, of the extent to which their needs have to  be
    met out of proceeds of the sale of the house.   Mr Caskie's  submission
    on that issue was simply that "there was no  evidence  that  the  money
    would not be sensibly divided" between relevant family members.   As  a
    submission that the house ought to have been regarded at  the  date  of
    the decision as an asset capable of furnishing any specific  amount  of
    money sufficient to enable the appellant's to meet the requirements  of
    the Rules, that is, in our judgment, hopeless.

14. In summary, therefore, the position is that we are not  persuaded  that
    the judge made an error of law; but even if she had done  and  we  were
    looking at the evidence ourselves  with  the  benefit  of  Mr  Caskie's
    submissions, our judgement is that by a  very  substantial  margin  the
    appellants  would  not  have  made  their  case.   These  appeals   are
    accordingly dismissed.
