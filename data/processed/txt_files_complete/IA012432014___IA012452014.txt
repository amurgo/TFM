For the Appellants:    Mr I Khan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh born on 25 March 1988 and 1
       May 1987. They are wife  and  husband  so  their  appeals  have  been
       linked. The appeal of the second appellant is dependent  on  that  of
       the first. I was not asked and saw no reason  to  make  an  anonymity
       direction.

    2. The first appellant entered the UK with leave to enter as  a  student
       until 31 October 2012. She  completed  her  studies.  She  posted  an
       application for further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant with
       the second appellant as her dependant. However, the  application  was
       not accompanied by the requisite fee and, on 17  November  2012,  the
       respondent wrote to the first appellant stating that the  application
       was invalid. Although the first appellant had provided a credit/debit
       card number with her application, it was rejected because the  expiry
       date was invalid. The first appellant re-submitted her application on
       27 November 2012, by which time  her  leave  had  expired.  In  those
       circumstances, the respondent disputed  that  the  appellants  had  a
       right of appeal.

    3. The grounds of appeal submitted by the solicitors instructed  by  the
       appellants   challenged   the   respondent's   assertion   that   the
       applications had not been accompanied by  the  appropriate  fee.  The
       respondent alleged the expiry  date  given  for  the  bank  card  was
       invalid. The appellants denied giving  an  invalid  expiry  date  and
       maintained funds were available from their bank account. A duty judge
       therefore directed that the case be  listed  for  the  hearing  of  a
       preliminary issue and directed that the burden was on the  respondent
       to establish the point, following Basnet (validity of  application  -
       respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113  (IAC).  She  also  pointed  out  there
       appeared to be two notices of decision, dated 1 May 2013 and  3  June
       2013 respectively, and it was not clear which one was being appealed.
       The appellants were directed to file evidence to show  their  appeals
       were in time given they had not been lodged until  six  months  after
       the date of decision.  Furthermore,  both  notices  stated  that  the
       appellants' leave had  been  curtailed  on  21  September  2011.  The
       respondent was directed to advise which notice of  appeal  was  being
       appealed.

    4. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Goldmeier  on
       13 November  2014.  The  hearing  proceeded  on  the  basis  of  oral
       submissions as the first appellant did not  attend  because  she  was
       unwell. The judge recorded that it was common  ground  that,  if  the
       applications made on 31 October 2012  were  invalid,  there  were  no
       valid appeals. The judge found no reason to doubt the CID note relied
       on by the respondent to the effect the reason for  the  rejection  of
       the applications was that an invalid expiry date had  been  given  so
       the transaction had been declined. He concluded  therefore  that  the
       applications were not accompanied by  the  requisite  fees  and  were
       consequently invalid.

    5. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argued the appellants should
       have been afforded the opportunity to submit the correct card details
       in  accordance  with  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration   Rules.
       Alternatively, the judge erred by overlooking the appellant's  second
       application  made  on  27  November  2012.  Reliance  was  placed  on
       paragraph 245DD(g) of the rules, which states that an  applicant  for
       leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant must not be  in  the  UK  in
       breach of immigration laws except that any period of overstaying  for
       a period  of  28  days  or  less  will  be  disregarded.  The  second
       application was submitted within 28 days of the first.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Garratt. He noted the respondent had  accepted  at  the
       hearing that the date of expiry of the appellants' leave had been  31
       October 2012.

    7. The respondent filed a rule 24 response  opposing  the  appeal.  This
       reiterated that the  appellants'  leave  had  been  curtailed  on  21
       September 2011.

Error of law

    8. I heard submissions as to whether the First-tier Tribunal had made  a
       material error of law. I shall set these out  only  as  necessary  to
       give my reasons.

    9.  It  was  conceded  by  Mr  Walker  that  the  judge  erred  in   his
       consideration of the issue of the validity of the appeal.  He  agreed
       with the submissions made by Mr Khan, as  follows.  The  applications
       had  been  submitted  by  post  on  30  October  2012.  The  date  of
       application should have been  taken  as  the  date  of  posting,  per
       paragraph 34G of the rules. The first appellant's bank  card  expired
       on 31 October 2012. She wrote the  expiry  date  as  "10/12"  on  her
       application form. I was  shown  a  copy.  The  expiry  date  was  not
       therefore an invalid expiry date when the applications were posted on
       30 October 2012.

   10. I note the respondent's letter returning the  application,  dated  17
       November  2012,  gave  a   different   reason   for   rejecting   the
       applications. It expressly stated the credit/debit card details given
       did not match the information held by the bank, which  would  suggest
       the appellants had given a  wrong  expiry  date  in  the  application
       forms. However, this was  contested  vigorously  in  the  grounds  of
       appeal submitted by Universal Solicitors and the respondent was  "put
       to strict proof" to establish the allegation. The CID note relied  on
       by Judge Goldmeier did not provide any detail as to  why  the  expiry
       date was regarded as  incorrect.   I  therefore  accepted  Mr  Khan's
       submission, which was supported by Mr Walker.

   11. I raised with the representatives whether paragraph 34A(ii)  applied.
       This provision requires  the  accompaniment  of  the  fee  to  be  in
       accordance with the method  specified  in  the  application  form  or
       guidance notes. Mr Walker could not show me any provision in the form
       or guidance note to say, for example, that bank  cards  must  have  a
       certain time left before they expire in order to be accepted.

   12. In the circumstances, I accepted the respondent  had  not  discharged
       the burden of showing the applications were not  accompanied  by  the
       correct fee (Basnet).

   13. The point would be academic if, as alleged in the rule  24  response,
       the appellants' leave had been curtailed on 21  September  2011.   In
       that case, the applications could not  have  been  in  time  and  the
       appellants would not have had a right of appeal. However,  Mr  Walker
       accepted that, although leave had been curtailed, it  was  reinstated
       until 31 October 2012. Mr Khan showed  me  evidence  that  the  first
       appellant's appeal against the curtailment decision had  been  listed
       and then adjourned. Mr Khan  explained  that,  before  the  adjourned
       hearing date on  9  December  2011,  the  respondent  reinstated  the
       appellants' leave.

   14. I find the appellants had a right of appeal because the  applications
       which led to the refusals under  appeal  were  made  at  a  time  the
       appellants had current leave. Valid  applications  were  made  on  30
       October 2012.

   15. A further point would be the question of  whether  the  appeals  were
       brought in-time. The papers include a covering letter  enclosing  the
       decisions, which bears the date 6 June 2013. It was addressed to  the
       appellants' former representatives, M Q Hassan Solicitors. As  noted,
       there are two versions of the notices of decision, dated 1 May and  3
       June 2013 respectively.  Mr  Khan  accepted  the  two  versions  were
       identical in all other respects.

   16. The notices of appeal recorded the  decisions  were  received  on  18
       December 2013, some six months later. Mr Walker could not assist with
       any evidence showing when the decisions were served and  he  did  not
       press the point. Mr Khan was able to produce a copy of a letter  from
       M Q Hassan Solicitors (faxed on an unknown  date  in  December  2013)
       addressed to Universal Solicitors, who had  written  on  16  December
       2013 informing M Q Hassan that they had been instructed in  place  of
       them. The letter confirmed that they had not received any letter from
       the Home Office in May or June 2013.  I  therefore  accept  that  the
       respondent did not successfully serve decision notices in  June  2013
       and there is no reason to find the appeals were out of time.

   17. The appellants lodged valid appeals in-time. In these  circumstances,
       the error made by Judge Goldmeier in finding the appeals were invalid
       was material and his decision finding the appellants had no right  of
       appeal is set aside.

Re-making the decision

   18. The parties were content for me to re-make the  decision.  The  first
       appellant was present but was not called to give evidence. The appeal
       proceeded on the basis of oral submissions. The burden rests  on  the
       appellants to establish any factual issues on which they rely and the
       civil standard of proof applies.

   19. The respondent made decisions to refuse to vary the appellants' leave
       and to remove them under section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
       Nationality Act 2006.  She  refused  the  first  appellant's  Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) Migrant application for two reasons.

   20. Firstly, she did not score the 75 points she needed under Appendix  A
       (Attributes) because the bank  statements  she  submitted  were  from
       Janata Bank Ltd, which was not an acceptable financial institution in
       terms of Appendix P of the Immigration Rules. Mr Khan pointed out the
       respondent had erred in her decision  letters  by  referring  to  the
       figure of �50,000. The appellants  had  in  fact  submitted  evidence
       showing access to �200,000. However, as all the funds were held in an
       account at Janata Bank Ltd, nothing turns on this. (see  page  31  of
       the application form)

   21. Secondly, the first appellant did not score the 10 points she  needed
       under Appendix C (Maintenance (Funds)) because she had  not  provided
       the specified  documents  showing  she  had  been  in  possession  of
       sufficient funds for the specified period.

   22. I was only addressed on the first point.

   23. As neither representative could provide me with evidence  of  whether
       Janata Bank Ltd was listed in Appendix P of the rules,  I  agreed  to
       look this up myself. Mr Khan appeared to accept the bank was  on  the
       negative list as at the date of decision. The rules in force  between
       1 May 2013 and 30 June 2013 included Janata Bank Ltd in Appendix P(i)
       which listed  financial  institutions  in  Bangladesh  that  did  not
       satisfactorily  verify  financial  statements.  The  rules  in  force
       between 30 November 2013 and 29 December 2013, when the decision  was
       served, also listed Janata  Bank  Ltd  in  Appendix  P(i)  (financial
       institutions  in  Bangladesh  that  did  not  satisfactorily   verify
       financial statements).

   24. The respondent was correct to apply the rules as in force at the date
       of decision (Odelola v SSHD [2009]  UKHL  25).  The  bank  statements
       submitted were not acceptable owing to the fact they were  issued  by
       Janata Bank Ltd. It follows that the respondent's decision to  refuse
       the first appellant's application and  also  that  of  her  dependent
       husband were in accordance with the Immigration  Rules.  The  appeals
       are dismissed on that basis.

   25. The grounds of appeal submitted by Universal Solicitors to the First-
       tier Tribunal drew attention  to  the  fact  the  reasons  given  for
       rejecting the appellants' application under  Appendix  A  (access  to
       funds) appeared to relate to Appendix C  (maintenance  (funds)).  The
       grounds suggested no reasons were given for rejecting the  investment
       funding, although it is perfectly clear  from  the  application  form
       that the appellants were relying on Janata  Bank  Ltd  statements  to
       show this. It is less clear that Janata Bank Ltd statements were also
       relied on for maintenance. However, if  the  respondent's  contention
       was that the statements provided did not cover the requisite  period,
       then the statements relied on and the period of the shortfall  should
       have been identified.  It  is  not  possible  from  the  reasons  for
       refusal to know why the appellants' applications were  refused  under
       Appendix C. I do not therefore regard it as  a  separate  reason  for
       refusal and I shall assume this point was based on the same matter as
       the Appendix A point.

   26. Mr  Khan  argued  that,  as  Janata  Bank  Ltd  statements  had  been
       acceptable  at  the  date  of  application  (30  October  2012),  the
       respondent had breached the duty of common law fairness. He  did  not
       develop his submission at all and he simply relied on the grounds  of
       appeal. I presume the  appellants  would  say  there  was  procedural
       unfairness on the part of the respondent in failing to give them  the
       opportunity to supply alternative statements by notifying  them  that
       Janata  Bank  Ltd  documents  would  no  longer  to  be  regarded  as
       acceptable.

   27. Again, it has been necessary for me to consult the archived rules  in
       order to see whether there is any validity in the  submissions  made.
       The rules in force between 1 October 2012 and 12  December  2012  did
       not contain either a positive or negative list of  Bangladeshi  banks
       on Appendix P.

   28. The grounds of appeal on which Mr Khan relied were  not  particularly
       helpful to me. Reliance  was  placed  on  the  case  of  Thakur  (PBS
       decision - common law fairness) Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC), a
       Tier 4 case which considered the factual situation in which a college
       was no longer on  the  register  as  the  date  decision,  the  Upper
       Tribunal held as follows:

           "1. A decision by the Secretary of State to refuse further  leave
          to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant  was  not  in
          accordance with the law because of a failure to  comply  with  the
          common law duty to act fairly in the decision making process  when
          an applicant had not had an adequate opportunity of  enrolling  at
          another college following the withdrawal of his sponsor's  licence
          or of making further representations before the decision was made.

          2. The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote:  what
          fairness demands is dependent on the context of the  decision  and
          the particular circumstances of the applicant."

   29. The grounds of appeal  set  out  the  well-known  passage  from  Lord
       Mustill's speech in R v Home Secretary, ex parte Doody  [1994]  1  AC
       531, at 560, and  argued  the  first  appellant  had  been  genuinely
       pursuing her studies in the UK. The decision was therefore  perverse.
       The grounds then go on to  say  she  was  a  dedicated  and  talented
       entrepreneur and the refusal breached article 8 of the  Human  Rights
       Convention.  However, article 8 was not pursued before me.

   30. The grounds as drafted shed little light on how the appellants  might
       have been unfairly treated. The evidence is sparse. However, if it is
       assumed the first appellant had a genuine plan to start up a business
       and she could not have  been  expected  to  know  of  the  change  in
       attitude towards Janata Bank  Ltd  documents  which  were  apparently
       acceptable when she submitted her application, then on the face of it
       there was unfairness in  rejecting  her  application  on  this  basis
       without further reference to her.

   31. In Naved (Student - fairness - notice of points) Pakistan [2012] UKUT
       00014 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held as follows:

          "Fairness requires the Secretary of State to give an applicant  an
          opportunity to address grounds for refusal, of which  he  did  not
          know and  could  not  have  known,  failing  which  the  resulting
          decision may be set aside on appeal as contrary  to  law  (without
          contravening the provisions of s. 85A of the  Nationality,  Asylum
          and Immigration Act 2002)."

   32. I have some doubts about why the appellants should  be  held  not  to
       have been able to know about the change of status of Janata Bank Ltd.
       On the facts of Naveed, the appellant did not  meet  the  maintenance
       rules by reference to the established presence test which was imposed
       as a result of communications between the college and the Home Office
       of which he was unaware. The first appellant in this case was seeking
       to obtain  leave  as  an  entrepreneur  and  therefore  a  degree  of
       familiarity and competence in dealing  with  bureaucratic  procedures
       can be assumed. She was legally represented as well. It has not  been
       explained why she could not be expected to keep abreast of changes in
       the Tier 1 requirements and it can be assumed she had a keen interest
       in them.

   33. However, Mr Walker made no such submissions against  the  appellants.
       Furthermore, there is a clear parallel between  cases  in  which  the
       respondent withdrew  a  sponsor  licence  without  reference  to  the
       student applicant, as in Thakur, and cases in  which  the  respondent
       changed the rules so that bank documents  already  submitted  from  a
       particular institution would no longer be accepted. I shall therefore
       allow the appeals to the limited extent that the decisions  were  not
       in accordance with the law and the case remains before the  Secretary
       of State to make lawful decisions.

NOTICE OF DECISION

   The First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a point of law and  its
   decision that there were no valid appeals is set  aside.  The  following
   decision is substituted:

       The appeals are dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

       The appeals are allowed to  the  extent  the  decisions  are  not  in
       accordance with the law.

       No anonymity direction has been made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeals and I have  therefore  considered  making  a  fee
award of any fees paid. However, I do not  make  a  fee  award  because  the
decisions were correctly made under the rules and the  decision  substituted
by me was made with minimal input from the appellants.
