                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a  decision  of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Birk ('the Judge') promulgated on 20  March
       2017 in which the Judge allowed Mr Semrav's appeal against the  order
       for his deportation from the United Kingdom.

Background


    2. Mr Semrav is a national of Poland born on 26 March 1983 who claims to
       have entered the United Kingdom in 2006.

    3. Mr Semrav has several criminal convictions. The PNC printout provided
       for the purposes of the original appeal hearing shows Mr Semrav first
       came to the attention of the authorities on 29 November 2006 when  he
       was  cautioned  for  an  offence  of  theft  and   kindred   offences
       (shoplifting). A further caution issued on 8 July  2007  followed  an
       incident of  disorderly  behaviour  or  threatening/abusive/insulting
       words likely to cause harassment alarm or distress.

    4. In relation to convictions, the  record  shows  six  entries  in  the
       following terms:

        i. 10 December 2008.  Gwent  magistrates  Court,  criminal  damage.
           Fined �180, compensation �250 and costs �43.

       ii. 6 May 2009. Gwent  magistrates  Court.  Disorderly  behaviour  -
           Public order act 1986 s.5 (1)(a). Fined �75 and costs �60.

      iii. 14 September 2009. Gwent magistrates Court. Theft - shoplifting.
           Fined �120 and costs �85.

       iv. 10 March 2010. Gwent magistrates  Court.  Drunk  in  charge  for
           pedal cycle. Fined �100, victim surcharge of �15, costs �85.

        v. 16 August 2010. Gwent magistrates Court. Drunk  and  disorderly.
           Fined �175, costs �85 and victim surcharge �15.

       vi. 15 May 2012. Cardiff Crown Court. Murder. Life imprisonment with
           a recommendation of minimum of  30  years  being  served  before
           release.

    5. The decision to deport arises from the murder conviction.

    6. Mr Justice Evans, sitting at the Cardiff Crown Court, sentenced  both
       Mr Semrav and three other defendants. The sentences  related  to  two
       incidents occurring in Newport in March 2011.  The sentencing remarks
       indicate Mr Semrav was not involved in  the  first  offence  but  was
       involved in the second offence with three co-defendants.

    7. The Sentencing Judge noted that a lot of alcohol  has  been  consumed
       which was a common feature of both incidents. The victim of the first
       incident was severely beaten and then, whilst asleep  or  unconscious
       on a mattress, one of the accused set fire to  the  mattress  with  a
       cigarette lighter causing a serious fire. The  charges  arising  from
       that incident were  of  attempted  murder  by  setting  fire  to  the
       mattress, arson being reckless as  to  whether  the  lives  of  other
       occupants of the house would  be  endangered  and,  for  one  of  the
       accused, attempting grievous bodily harm.

    8. That first incident occurred on Monday, 7 March 2011. Two days later,
       on the Wednesday, the second incident occurred which  the  Sentencing
       Judge explains in the following terms:

           "The second incident occurred on the Wednesday evening. The four
           of you were then in Semrav's bedsit with  your  victim,  Ramunas
           Raulinautis. He was apparently an acquaintance of you all but in
           particular, a friend  of  you,  Kalkowski.  Again,  alcohol  was
           consumed, and again, over a protracted period, your  victim  was
           subjected to violence. That must have been a  ferocious  beating
           to have caused the loss of blood which stained  the  bedsit  and
           the hallway outside, together with the clothes and  shoes  which
           were washed, but also  to  have  caused  the  extremely  serious
           injuries sustained by Raulinautis. In addition to  the  external
           injuries illustrated in the graphics which the jury  saw,  there
           must have been external injuries in areas which  were  so  badly
           burnt by the fire to which he was  later  subjected,  that  they
           were not able to be seen by  the  pathologist.  In  addition  to
           that, he sustained  brain  damage,  multiple  rib  fractures,  a
           perforation of his bowel and tears to his masentery. Neither the
           evidence given by Semrav during the course of the case  nor  the
           cases advanced by the rest of you comes anywhere near explaining
           the severity of those injuries, and I am not prepared to  accept
           as accurate and reliable Semrav's description of who  did  what,
           which he gave in evidence.

           ...

           When Raulinautis was badly injured and unconscious, he was taken
           out of the bedsit, he was carried out  and  dumped,  unconscious
           and very badly injured,  in  the  forecourt  of  a  neighbouring
           property. There he remained perhaps for about two  hours  before
           you, Lysonik, and you, Semrav, went out, found a bag of shredded
           paper which had  been  put  out  for  recycling  by  neighbours,
           stuffed that paper into  Raulinautis's  clothing,  and  set  him
           alight. Even in his injured state he must have been in agony and
           he continued to suffer until he died  on  the  Saturday  morning
           some three days later.

           There are several aggravating features to  this  incident,  they
           include firstly, the severity of  the  non-burn  injuries  which
           were afflicted upon Raulinautis, secondly, there  were  four  of
           you, each party to the violence  against  Raulinautis;  thirdly,
           the use of a shod foot or shod feet to  injure  him,  and  I  am
           perfectly satisfied that the copper pipe  was  also  used  as  a
           weapon against him; fourthly, the killing was  premeditated  and
           planned. You sought and obtained fuel, the shredded paper, which
           you then used to set fire to Raulinautis. Fifthly,  the  killing
           was in a public place and members of the public saw part of  the
           incident, and sixthly, of course, there is the  obvious  extreme
           suffering to which I have already referred.

           I am unable to identify any positive mitigating factors to  that
           incident. The motive for these two attacks  is  unknown,  as  is
           much of the detail of what happened during the second  incident.
           That is because the  way  that  those  of  you  who  did  answer
           questions of the police answered them and because  of  three  of
           you have not  given  evidence.  Much  of  what  Semrav  said  in
           evidence is totally beyond belief. None of you  is  entitled  to
           the credit which a guilty plea would have attracted, but I  note
           that while none of you is of good character, none of you  has  a
           previous conviction of such seriousness that it aggravates  your
           present position."

    9. The Judge considered the evidence before setting out her findings  of
       fact at [16] - [29] which can be summarised in the following terms:

        i. I find that the circumstances do not establish  that  there  are
           grounds for the Appellant representing a  genuine,  present  and
           sufficiently serious threat  to  the  fundamental  interests  of
           society [17].

       ii. Factors in Regulation 21(5) and (6) of the EEA Regulations  2006
           have been taken into account [18].

      iii. The decision to  deport  letter  does  not  elaborate  upon  the
           reasons for deportation safe to say at  paragraph  7  "you  have
           committed a serious criminal offence and the Home  Office  takes
           the view that there is a real risk that you may reoffend in  the
           future"[19].

       iv. The sentence given by the Crown Court is an accurate  reflection
           of the regard that the offence offends against public policy and
           public security [20].

        v. The Judge also took  account  of  the  fact  the  appellant  had
           provided no evidence of remorse or a change in his character  or
           any indication of  rehabilitation.  The  appellant  pleaded  not
           guilty and so was found guilty after a trial. Weight  was  given
           to the sentencing judge's remarks as to the appellant's role  in
           the offence, the  aggravating  features  and  lack  of  positive
           mitigating factors [20].

       vi. The appellant's record of previous  convictions  sets  out  that
           between 2006 and 2010 he  had  five  convictions.  The  criminal
           record shows a wilful disregard for the UK criminal law although
           the convictions in themselves do not justify the decision [21].

      vii. At [23] "his current conviction means that he  is  not  eligible
           for consideration to parole until 2041. This means  that  he  is
           not  liable  for  release  for  many  years  and  so  cannot  be
           considered to be a present or even  imminent  threat  to  public
           security  or  policy.  Therefore,  the  risk  of  the  Appellant
           reoffending is non-existent at the date of hearing".

     viii. The appellant is aged 33, in good health, has no family  in  the
           UK and has demonstrated little by way  of  social  and  cultural
           integration in the UK save that he refers to some friends. [24].

       ix. The appellant claims to have arrived in 2006 but  there  was  no
           evidence to confirm precisely when he arrived but he would  have
           been in the UK around 2006 based on  his  criminal  record.  The
           appellant continues to have links to Poland where all his family
           reside and he is in contact with his mother and has her support.
           None of those factors weigh in his favour against a  deportation
           order [24].

        x. No weight was placed upon the appellant's contention he will  be
           at risk of harm on return to Poland because of his co-defendants
           and their allies. There  was  no  evidence  to  support  such  a
           threat. No weight was placed upon the complaints of poor  prison
           conditions and privileges in Poland [25].

       xi. At [26] "having balanced all the relevant factors  I  find  that
           the decision is not a proportionate one as the Appellant is  not
           a present threat to the  public  interest  in  terms  of  public
           policy and public security".

      xii. Based on the above findings the Judge allowed the  appeal  under
           the EEA Regulations [27].

     xiii. On the same findings,  the  Judge  dismissed  the  appeal  under
           Articles 2 or 3 ECHR [28].

      xiv. The appellant conceded he has no family members in  the  UK.  He
           has a private life which consists of friends. Any  contact  with
           friends can be continued whilst he is in prison in  Poland.  The
           appellant has not established that his rights and privileges  in
           prison in the UK  are  significantly  different  from  those  in
           Poland  and  not  sufficient  to  consider   the   decision   is
           disproportionate. The appeal based on Article 8 private life was
           dismissed [29].

   10. The Secretary of State sought  permission  to  appeal  asserting  the
       Judge has materially erred in law by failing to consider the decision
       of the Upper Tribunal in Restivo (EEA  -  prisoner  transfer)  [2016]
       UKUT 00449 (IAC).

   11. Permission was granted by another judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       and the matter comes before me for the purposes of an Initial hearing
       to ascertain whether the Judge made a material error of law and if so
       whether the Upper Tribunal can proceed to remake the decision.

Error of law


   12. The decision in Restivo was promulgated on 24 January  2017.  As  the
       decision under appeal was promulgated on 20  March  2017  this  is  a
       relevant decision.

   13. The second part  of  the  headnote,  which  accurately  reflects  the
       findings of the Upper Tribunal at [34], reads:

           "Where the personal conduct of a person  represents  a  genuine,
           present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of  the
           fundamental interests of society, the fact that such  threat  is
           managed while that person serves his or her prison  sentence  is
           not itself material to the assessment of the threat  he  or  she
           poses. The threat exists, whether  or  not  it  cannot  generate
           further offending simply because  the  person  concerned,  being
           imprisoned, has significantly less opportunity to commit further
           criminal offences."

   14. The Judge therefore erred in law as the only reason  the  appeal  was
       allowed was because Mr Semrav could not present a present danger  due
       to his ongoing detention,  without  considering  the  fact  that  his
       personal conduct represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
       serious threat even though it could not  generate  further  offending
       against the wider public as a result of Mr Semrav's incarceration.

   15. I find this error to be material based on a misdirection in  law  and
       accordingly set the decision aside.

   16. The factual findings of the Judge have  not  been  challenged  by  Mr
       Semrav and shall be preserved.

Discussion


   17. It was accepted the  Upper  Tribunal  could  proceed  to  remake  the
       decision.

   18. Mrs Aboni relied upon the Secretaries States  decision  to  make  the
       deportation order to Poland in light of Mr Semrav's conviction on  15
       May 2012 at Cardiff Crown Court.

   19. Details of the offence are set out in the Sentencing Remarks above.

   20. The Secretary of State asserts Mr Semrav poses a  genuine  threat  to
       the  community  of  the  United  Kingdom  such  as  to  justify   his
       deportation.

   21. It was submitted by Mrs Aboni that Mr Semrav had not acquired a right
       of permanent residence in the United Kingdom and was only entitled to
       the lowest level of protection. Which Mrs Aboni acknowledged that the
       sentencing remarks referred to Mr Semrav  working,  it  was  asserted
       there was insufficient evidence to establish that he been  exercising
       treaty rights in the UK for  at  least  five  years.  The  notice  of
       liability to deportation served on 7 September  2015  also  indicated
       there was no evidence of that his circumstances were known.

   22. It was submitted that the decision was proportionate in  relation  to
       consideration of EU free movement rights and under Article 8 ECHR. It
       was a serious offence and nothing had been advanced to show  that  it
       was not a proportionate decision.

   23. Mrs Aboni referred to the decision of the  First-tier  in  which  the
       Judge did not accept the appellant's assertion that he faced  a  risk
       on return or that it had been established that prison  conditions  in
       Poland would make any transfer to Poland to complete a  sentence,  or
       at the conclusion of his sentence, a  disproportionate  decision.  It
       was also found by Judge Birk that there was no  evidence  of  remorse
       and a finding the appellant posed a present and serious threat.

   24. Mr Semrav was asked by the Tribunal whether  he  had  worked  in  the
       United Kingdom to which indicated he had worked between 2006 and 2011
       as a production worker, although there was no evidence of the same in
       the papers. He thought it was from  October  2006  to  March  2011  a
       period of approximately  4  �  years,  indicating  that  he  had  not
       exercised treaty rights for a continuous period of five years  and  I
       find is therefore only entitled to the lower level of  protection  as
       submitted by Mrs Aboni.

   25. Mr Semrav also stated that he disagreed with his conviction  and  did
       not accept the same. When asked what he accepted he did, he  admitted
       he hit the deceased victim as he alleges this person had  stolen  his
       telephone but claims that he did not kill him. When asked why he  hit
       the person concerned he stated it was because he wanted his telephone
       back.

   26. The Tribunal had been assisted prior to Mr Semrav being brought  into
       court by a short discussion with a criminal advocate who was  in  the
       Birmingham Magistrates Court on other business but who was  a  member
       of the firm instructed by Mr Semrav in relation to criminal  but  not
       immigration matters. The basis of the instruction was a desire by  Mr
       Semrav to appeal  against  both  his  conviction  and  sentence.  The
       criminal advocate confirmed that prior to being able to obtain advice
       on appeal it was necessary to obtain a  transcript  of  the  criminal
       proceedings but that there had been delay as a result of the original
       transcription  service  no  longer  being  in  business.  There   was
       therefore no advice  on  the  merits  of  an  appeal  against  either
       conviction or sentence at this time.

   27. The criminal advocate was given permission  to  visit  Mr  Semrav  to
       enable him to see his client and sign for the release of papers  held
       by  the  custody  officers.   This  Tribunal  is  grateful  for   the
       intervention and assistance rendered which will  also  have  been  of
       value to Mr Semrav on the day.

   28. The reality of  the  matter  is,  however,  that  notwithstanding  Mr
       Semrav's desire to challenge his  conviction  and  sentence  and  the
       document he handed up indicating there were no  eyewitnesses  to  the
       attack and that the jury  had  taken  eight  days  to  convict,  this
       Tribunal cannot go behind either the conviction or  sentence  imposed
       by the Cardiff Crown Court. For the purposes of this  appeal  hearing
       Mr Semrav is a convicted murderer.

   29. When asked whether he had undertaken any courses  to  deal  with  his
       propensity for violence or other matters, Mr Semrav indicated that he
       had attended a violence  course  in  2015  but  had  no  certificates
       proving this although claimed that the course taught him to think and
       not to react. He claimed if he was allowed out he would never do what
       it did previously before in that he had "changed  my  mark"  now  and
       that he was a different person. He claims to have a  good  record  in
       prison and to have privileges.

   30. Mr Semrav referred to [23] to the decision  of  Judge  Birk  claiming
       that that decision could not be wrong in law on the basis  he  cannot
       impact on anyone as he is in prison and can therefore not be  a  risk
       to people. This is, of course, a matter dealt with above in the error
       of law consideration.

   31. Mr Semrav asserted he may face a risk back in Poland. It was  thought
       his co-accused were still in prison but will be  returned  to  Poland
       eventually and that they may blame him for what  had  happened.  When
       asked to expand on this belief he claimed they may blame him  due  to
       his statements, not for the offence, but because they got caught  and
       are now in prison.

   32. Mr Semrav confirmed he signed a repatriation agreement because he was
       told that it would not be until nine  months  from  the  end  of  his
       sentence when he will be deported. If he knew what he  now  knows  he
       would not have signed the repatriation agreement.

   33. In relation to [26] of Judge Birk's decision, Mr Semrav  claimed  the
       decision was not proportionate as he  is  not  a  threat.  Mr  Semrav
       stated no one could know he was going to reoffend or how he or anyone
       will know if they can reoffend. He repeated his claim that he was  in
       prison and was likely at the end of his sentence to  be  deported  to
       Poland which indicates he could not pose a risk to the wider  society
       in the UK.

   34. It is of concern that Mr Semrav seeks to deny his involvement in  the
       offence for which he was convicted. It is noted the Sentencing  Judge
       specifically noted that much of  what  Mr  Semrav  had  said  in  his
       defence when giving oral evidence in the criminal trial was  "totally
       beyond belief".

   35.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
       Regulations 2006 (as amended), at Regulation 19(3), a person who  has
       been admitted to, or acquired  a  right  to  reside  in,  the  United
       Kingdom under these  Regulations  may  be  removed  from  the  United
       Kingdom if:

           (a)    he does not have or ceases to  have  a  right  to  reside
           under these Regulations; or

           (b)    he would otherwise be entitled to reside  in  the  United
           Kingdom under these Regulations but the Secretary of  State  has
           decided that his removal is justified on the grounds  of  public
           policy, public security or  public  health  in  accordance  with
           regulation 21.

   36. Although both options are  equally  applicable  to  this  appeal  the
       decision to deport has been made pursuant to Regulation 19 (3) (b) on
       the basis Mr Semrav's removal is justified on the grounds  of  public
       policy, public security or public health, although the latter aspect,
       that of public health, is not applicable on the facts of this case.

   37. Regulation 21(5) states that where a relevant decision  is  taken  on
       grounds of public policy or public security it shall, in addition  to
       complying with the preceding paragraphs of the regulation,  be  taken
       in accordance with the following principles-

           (a)     the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
           proportionality;

           (b)    the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
           conduct of the person concerned;

           (c)     the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
           represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
           affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

           (d)    matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
           which relate to considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
           justify the decision;

           (e)    a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
           themselves justify the decision.

   38. Regulation 21(6) states that before taking a relevant decision on the
       grounds of public policy or public security in relation to  a  person
       who is resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
       account of considerations such as the age, state  of  health,  family
       and  economic  situation  of  the  person,  the  person's  length  of
       residence in the United Kingdom, the  person's  social  and  cultural
       integration into the United Kingdom and the extent  of  the  person's
       links with his country of origin.

   39. In GW (EEA reg 21: 'fundamental interests') Netherlands [2009]  UKAIT
       00050 the Tribunal said that the 'fundamental interests' of a society
       within the meaning of reg 21 (a  threat  to  which  may  justify  the
       exclusion of an EEA national) is  a  question  to  be  determined  by
       reference to the legal rules governing the society in  question,  for
       it is unlikely that conduct that is subject to no prohibition can  be
       regarded as threatening those interests.

   40. It is a preserved finding  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
       appellant has provided no evidence of  remorse  or  of  a  change  in
       character or any indication of rehabilitation. I refer above  to  his
       denial of culpability as illustrated by his desire to  overturn  both
       conviction  and  sentence,  and  his  admitted  use  of  violence  in
       inappropriate circumstances. The nature of that violence is  recorded
       in the sentencing remarks indicating extreme  violence  resulting  in
       serious injuries to the  now  deceased  victim,  irrespective  of  Mr
       Semrav and others having  been  found  to  have  set  the  individual
       alight, whilst still alive, which no doubt contributed  substantially
       to his eventual (very painful) death.

   41. In LO (Portugal) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]
       it was held that the burden of proof was upon the  Claimant  to  show
       that the decision of the Respondent to deport an EEA national was not
       in accordance with the EEA Regulations.  In this  appeal,  Mr  Semrav
       has failed to discharge that burden.

   42. The Secretary of State has submitted sufficient evidence to show that
       Mr  Semrav's  presence  or  conduct   constitutes   a   genuine   and
       sufficiently serious threat. He has been found to  be  an  individual
       with a propensity to violence, especially when in drink, in  relation
       to which there is no evidence that he has undertaken sufficient  work
       to minimise any future risk. The fact he subjected a third party to a
       severe beating over a mobile telephone is clearly illustrative of the
       risk Mr Semrav is likely to pose to others in a  situation  where  he
       considers himself to be wronged.

   43. The Tribunal also notes the decision in Secretary of  State  for  the
       Home Department v Straszewski; and Kersys [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1245  in
       which the Court of Appeal noted that Regulation 21(5) provided that a
       decision to  remove  an  EEA  national  with  a  permanent  right  of
       residence must be based exclusively on the personal  conduct  of  the
       person concerned and matters that did  not  directly  relate  to  the
       particular  case  or  which  related  to  considerations  of  general
       prevention did not justify a removal decision. The Court also noted R
       v Bouchereau (Case C-30/77) in which the Advocate General agreed that
       in exceptional cases, where the personal  conduct  of  an  alien  had
       caused deep public revulsion, public  policy  required  his  removal.
       There was an element of pragmatism in Bouchereau in  the  recognition
       of the right to deport those who had committed the  most  heinous  of
       crimes, which was  at  odds  with  the  principles  of  the  Citizens
       Directive.

   44. Mr Semrav is only entitled to the lowest level of protection and  the
       offence which he has committed with others, of  severely  beating  an
       individual, abandoning him but then returning, stuffing his  clothing
       with shredded paper that had been  found  nearby,  and  setting  that
       paper alight, effectively seeking to burn his victim to death  and/or
       dispose of the evidence, is  an  act  that  will  cause  deep  public
       revulsion giving  rise  to  a  strong  public  policy  requiring  his
       removal.

   45. In relation to the proportionality of the decision, Judge Birk made a
       preserved finding which identified the nature of Mr Semrav's ties  to
       the United Kingdom  and  Poland  and  his  limited  integration  into
       society of the UK. The prospects of rehabilitation, should Mr  Semrav
       be willing to engage with the same has  not  been  shown  to  be  any
       different in Poland than in the UK although in Poland  his  prospects
       may be improved as his mother and other family members may be able to
       visit him in prison and to support and encourage him.

   46. Having carefully considered  the  evidence  made  available  and  the
       competing arguments I find that  Mr  Semrav's  deportation  from  the
       United Kingdom will not be a disproportionate interference  with  his
       right of free movement. It is an action necessary to protect  members
       of the public from the genuine and  sufficiently  serious  threat  of
       violence posed by Mr Semrav.

   47. It is also in accordance with the legitimate aim relied upon  by  the
       Secretary of State that any interference  with  any  protected  right
       established in the  United  Kingdom  is  proportionate,  pursuant  to
       Article 8 ECHR.

   48. The appeal against  the  decision  that  Mr  Semrav  be  deported  is
       therefore dismissed.

Decision

   49. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision as follows.
       This appeal is dismissed.

   Anonymity.

   50. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
