                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by a citizen of Nigeria against  the  decision  of  First-
tier Tribunal dismissing his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Entry
Clearance Officer refusing him leave to enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  her
husband.   The appeal is brought on human rights grounds and  was  heard  by
the First-tier Tribunal and dismissed.

It is now apparent that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made  a  mistake.  The
point of contention was the appellant's financial circumstances.  The  judge
thought that the appellant had to show an income of  �22,000  because  there
were children to consider.   In  fact  he  had  to  show  that  the  sponsor
supporting him had an income in excess of �18,600 because the children  were
British citizen and therefore not part of the financial considerations.

I have a great deal of sympathy for the judge making this  error.  The  case
was dealt with on the papers which is to my mind always hazardous and it  is
a mistake that probably would not have been made if he  had  the  assistance
of a Presenting Officer as I did this morning.

Mr Staunton accepted immediately  that  a  mistake  had  been  made  and  it
followed therefore that the main reason for dismissing the appeal was a  bad
one.

I remind myself this is a human rights appeal but this  is  a  human  rights
appeal concerning a married couple.  There must be a strong public  interest
in promoting their private and family life together  if  that  can  be  done
with regard to other considerations set  out  in  the  rules.  The  negative
factor here concerned finances and that has now been resolved in the  favour
of the appellants.

Notice of Decision

It follows therefore this is an appeal that ought to be allowed  and  I  set
aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  error  of  law  and  I
substitute a decision allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.
