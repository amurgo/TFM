Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Emmanuel Ukaegbu Onuoha, was born on 24 August 1982  and
    is a male citizen of Nigeria.  By a decision dated 17 October 2013, the
    appellant's application to vary his  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom was refused and a  decision  was  taken  to  remove  him  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  J  D  L  Edwards)
    which, in a determination which was promulgated on  24  February  2014,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant had applied for a variation of leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant.   His  application  was
    refused under paragraph 245 of HC  395  (as  amended)  and  also  under
    paragraph 322(2).

 3. I find that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  such  that  its
    determination falls to be set aside.  I have reached that  finding  for
    the following reasons.   First,  on  more  than  one  occasion  in  the
    determination, the judge has wrongly stated that the burden of proof in
    the appeal relating to the paragraph 322(2)  refusal  rested  upon  the
    appellant.  It did not.  The burden of proof was on  the  Secretary  of
    State to prove that the appellant made  false  representations  or  had
    failed to disclose any material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave
    to enter or remain.  The judge has stated at [11] that "the  burden  of
    proof in these cases rests with the appellant. The standard of proof is
    the civil standard of a balance of probability."  Again, at  [22],  the
    judge wrote "the onus of proof in this case [he  makes  no  distinction
    between the paragraph 245 and paragraph 322 refusals]  rests  with  the
    appellant [and the standard of  proof]  is  the  civil  standard  of  a
    balance of probability."  At [26], the judge recorded that "I find that
    the representations submitted to the respondent by the  appellant  were
    false and that Rule  322(2)  applies  here...[the  appellant]  has  not
    established his case and the appeal must be dismissed."

 4. Secondly, I find that the judge has failed to have regard  to  material
    evidence in reaching his determination.  At [18], the judge wrote:

    The respondent had cause to check [the appellant's self-assessment  tax
    return for the years ended April 2011 and April 2012] with HMRC.   From
    that [check]  it  emerged  that  for  that  tax  year  [2010/2011]  the
    appellant  had,  in  fact,  declared  a  net  profit  of  ï¿½6,684.   The
    suggestion of the respondent is that  the  appellant  amended  his  tax
    return after completing 90% of it [online]  but  before  submission  to
    ensure the figure contained on it matched that in his visa application.



 5. At [19] the judge records the explanation given in  oral  testimony  by
    the appellant for this apparent discrepancy in the evidence.   However,
    at no point in his  determination,  does  he  refer  to  the  extensive
    documentary evidence which the appellant had adduced (including a  copy
    of the tax return itself for 2010/2011) which appears to show that  the
    return was 100% complete when it was  submitted  for  consideration  by
    HMRC.  There are documents from HMRC in the  appellant's  bundle  which
    show that the appellant  made  adjustments  to  his  business  turnover
    figures for the year 2010/2011 some months  after  submitting  his  tax
    return online; the judge  found  (wrongly)  that  this  adjustment  had
    occurred whilst the tax return was 90%  complete  and  had  yet  to  be
    submitted.  I  find  that  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  a  proper
    consideration by the judge of the evidence which he had  adduced.  That
    is not to say that the  judge  should  necessarily  have  accepted  the
    appellant's  explanations  supported  by  the   documentary   evidence.
    However, I am not persuaded that the  judge  even  considered  all  the
    relevant evidence or, if he has,  he  certainly  has  given  no  or  no
    adequate reasons for rejecting it and preferring the  position  adopted
    by the respondent.

 6. I set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.  I set  aside
    all the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings of fact.  Given the volume
    of the documentary evidence in this appeal, the fact  that  it  may  be
    necessary to hear oral evidence and the complete failure of  the  judge
    properly to address the case put to him by the  appellant,  I consider
    that it is appropriate for the appeal to be remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal and for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

DECISION

 7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    24 February 2014 is set aside.  None of  the  findings  of  fact  shall
    stand.  I remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  that
    Tribunal to remake the decision.
