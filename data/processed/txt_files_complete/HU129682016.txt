                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                        PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF
             THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to refuse leave to remain on human rights grounds.  She is a citizen of
    Pakistan.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted because the appellant  said  that  the
    First-tier Judge had discouraged her from  calling  six  witnesses  who
    were present in Court and willing to  testify,  giving  the  impression
    that their evidence was not disputed, but then  rejected  the  evidence
    when writing his  decision.   Mr  Levine,  Counsel  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and at  the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing  on  23  November  2018,
    confirms that account.

 3. By an email dated 30 January 2019, Ms Pettersen,  who  represented  the
    applicant before me on 23 November 2018, confirmed that having  seen  a
    witness statement from Mr Levine, the respondent was content  that  the
    appropriate course was for the appeal to be remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal for rehearing afresh.

 4. Pursuant to rule 40(3) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 (as amended), under paragraph 40(2)(a)  of  the  Rules  the  Upper
    Tribunal is not required to provide written reasons for  its  decision,
    where the decision is made  with  the  consent  of  the  parties  (rule
    40(3)(a)).  That is the case in relation to this decision.

 5. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with  no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved. The decision in this  appeal
    will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.
