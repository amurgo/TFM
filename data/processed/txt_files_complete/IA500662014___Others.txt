Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer, Counsel, Paul John & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of  India  who  on
    25 November 2014 received a decision from the appellant (hereafter  the
    Secretary of State or SSHD)  refusing  her  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant. The SSHD decided she did not meet
    the requirement at  paragraph  245edD(f)  and  under  Appendix  A  with
    reference to Appendix J because she was not satisfied (1) that the  job
    the claimant was being sponsored for met the required skill level;  and
    (2) the job as described in the Certificate of Sponsorship and the  job
    title corresponded with the job tasks and job titles shown in the Codes
    of Practice under occupation code 2229.

2.   The claimant appealed. On 28 September 2014, First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Davey allowed the claimant's appeal. At [6] and [7] he concluded:

         "6.  It therefore seemed to me  that  the  appellant  falls  within
             Category 2229 as a therapy profession not elsewhere classified
             and that the Secretary of State must intend in  the  light  of
             the current published guidance on the Standard Classifications
             for Operatives under the  SOC  codes.   As  I  understand  the
             evidence the position is that the Appellant  is  operating  at
             NQF Level 6 and no issue was argued to the contrary.   I  find
             the sponsor was expected to comply with and entitled  to  rely
             upon the published guidance.

         7.   I find the appellant therefore has discharged the burden  that
             her application fell for consideration  under  the  Rules  and
             that she had the required attributes.  There was no issue that
             the sppellant had the required level  of  appropriate  salary.
             She met the English language and maintenance requirements."

3.   The  SSHD's  grounds  were  confined  to  one  short  point;  it  being
    submitted that "[t]he Tribunal has inadequately explained how the final
    determination was arrived at".

4.   At the hearing  I  heard  submissions  from  both  representatives.  Mr
    Melvin conceded that there was no challenge  to  the  judge's  findings
    that the claimant had  met  the  required  skill  level  by  virtue  of
    operating at NQF Level 6.  He maintained, however, that the  judge  had
    erred in finding the  claimant's  job  tasks  and  job  title  met  the
    requirements of Appendix J with reference to the Codes of Practice  for
    Skilled Workers and Student Occupational Classification  (SOC)   Codes.
    Mr Melvin accepted that the Codes of Practice did not require a perfect
    match between the tasks and titles set out at 2229, but her application
    did not demonstrate that she was a therapy professional.

5.   I am not persuaded that the SSHD's ground is made out.

6.   Mr Singer devoted some time to defending the failure of  the  judge  to
    specify that he accepted the claimant's evidence about her job and  job
    tasks, but, as Mr Melvin was  quick  to  accept,  the  SSHD  had  never
    disputed the claimant's claim about what she did. The  only  matter  in
    dispute concerned whether she came within 2229 or not.

7.   I discern no error of law on the part of the judge in respect  of  this
    matter.

8.   In assessing this matter I have paid particular attention to the  terms
    of Code 2229 which I reproduce in its relevant parts here:

|          |                                                      |
|          |Related job titles:                                   |
|          |                                                      |
|          |.  Art therapist                                      |
|          |.  Chiropractor                                       |
|          |.  Cognitive behaviour therapist                      |
|          |.  Dance movement therapist                           |
|          |.  Family therapist                                   |
|          |.  Nutritionist                                       |
|          |. Osteopath                                           |
|          |. Psychotherapist                                     |


9.   Several features of this Description are salient.  First the term  used
    is "Therapy professionals" which on  its  plain  and  ordinary  meeting
    encompasses  all  professionals  who  are  therapists  -  a  very  wide
    category. Second, the  category  is  expressly  described  as  being  a
    residual  one:  ("Therapy  professionals  not  elsewhere  classified").
    Third, in line with the rest of the Codes  of  Practice  document,  the
    description does  not  purport  to  set  out  an   exhaustive  list  of
    necessary job tasks, it is confined to identification of  "Example  job
    tasks".  Fourth, the  seven examples given  are  not  stated  as  self-
    contained requirements.  Put another way, the wording does not  exclude
    a person being able to meet the Description  by  virtue  of  exhibiting
    elements of each example. Fifth, there is no direct correlation between
    the "The Example job tasks" and the  "Related job titles" - e.g.  there
    is no specific reference in the  form to  any  task  related  to  Dance
    Movement.

10.  In light of the above features it would seem that the task of the fact-
    finder is to examine the extent of  the  correlation  between  the  job
    tasks performed with the examples given by reference to the related job
    titles.  On any reading the correlating does not need to be exact,  but
    it must be identifiably close.

11.  In my judgement that is precisely the  type  of  fact-finding  exercise
    conducted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey. At [5] he stated:

         "In this case however it  is  plain  that  the  employer  (sponsor)
         derived the job description as persons responsible for  specialised
         Indian  ayurvedic  therapeutic   treatments   and   massages   like
         pizhichil,  njavarakizhi,   shirodhara,   ubhayagam,   udvarthanam,
         panchakarma, etc.  and  other  ayurvedic  clinical  procedures  and
         examinations.  Massages patients to discover  the  cause  of  pain,
         relieve discomfort, restore function and mobility  and  to  correct
         irregularities in body structure;  preparing  items  used  for  the
         treatments and massages using ingredients such as herbs  and  other
         materials/decorations; ensuring treatment areas  and  utensils  are
         maintained  at  the  required   hygiene   and   safety   standards,
         maintaining treatment  records,  training  and  supervising  junior
         staff; preparing reports; ensuring that a good quality  of  service
         is offered to clients, meeting clients for  treatments  at  various
         locations if required, etc."

12.  Further, Judge Davey correctly noted the  lack  of  direct  correlation
    between Example job tasks  and Related job tiles,  he  stating  at  [4]
    that:

         "From the above it will be seen that many of the job tasks  do  not
         fall  to  be  performed  fall  by  art  therapists,  chiropractors,
         cognitive behavioural therapist, dance movement  therapist,  family
         therapist, nutritionist, osteopath or psychotherapist.  Elements of
         perhaps psychotherapist and osteopath, or possibly, a  chiropractor
         work may be found in some of those examples of job tasks. The tasks
         of eyes surgery and animals plainly contemplate a far  wider  group
         that the headed description of code 2220."

13.  I am entirely satisfied that his findings were not within the range  of
    reasonable responses. From the claimant's own undisputed evidence about
    the tasks her job entailed, there was a  strong  correlation  with  the
    description of job tasks in Code 229; as regards the third, fourth  and
    fifth bullet points especially.  In addition, the claimant's job  title
    was in essence clear of a therapy professional.

14.  I would be underline that the  only ground of challenge  was  that  the
    judge's decision was inadequately reasoned. From the above it  will  be
    clear that it was anything but.

Notice of Decision

15.  For the above reasons I conclude that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    did not err in law and her decision is upheld.

16.  No anonymity direction is made.
