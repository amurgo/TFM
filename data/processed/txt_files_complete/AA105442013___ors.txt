Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr I Palmer of Duncan Lewis Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. These appeals are subject to anonymity orders made by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. The six appellants are a family consisting of  husband  and  wife  and
      their four children who arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  6  October
      2013 and claimed asylum.  They were born on 30  May  1962,  1  January
      1973, 21 July 2001, 24 July 2003, 5 August 2006 and  14  January  2009
      respectively.

   3. They arrived in the UK on 6 October  2013  and  claimed  asylum.   The
      basis of their claim is that they are Sudanese nationals belonging  to
      the Berti tribe from the Darfur region and, as such, they would be  at
      risk on return to Sudan.

   4. In a decision dated 6 November 2013 the  Secretary  of  State  refused
      their claims for asylum and on 13 November 2013, in the case  of  each
      appellant, the Secretary of State made a decision  refusing  to  grant
      leave indicating that directions would be made  for  the  individual's
      removal to Sudan.

   5. The appellants appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Their  appeals
      were heard on 20 February 2014 by Judge Britton.  In his determination
      the Judge accepted that the appellants  were  Sudanese  nationals  and
      from the Berti tribe.  However, he concluded that the appellants could
      safely and reasonably relocate within Sudan to Khartoum even  if  they
      were at risk in Darfur.  As a consequence he dismissed the appeals  on
      asylum and humanitarian protection grounds and also under Art 3 of the
      European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   He   also   dismissed   the
      appellants' appeals under Article 8 of the ECHR.

   6. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   On
      3 April 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (DJ Baird) granted the appellants
      permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable that the  Judge
      had erred in law in reaching his  adverse  findings  on  international
      protection grounds because he had  failed  to  take  into  account  an
      expert report produced  by  Mr  Peter  Verney  and  also  the  Country
      Guidance Case of AA (Non-Arab Darfuris - Relocation) Sudan  CG  [2009]
      UKAIT 00056.  The appeals came before me.

   7. At the  outset  of  the  hearing,  Mr  Richards  who  represented  the
      Secretary of State, accepted that Judge Britton's determination  could
      not stand first because he had failed to take into account the country
      guidance case of AA and secondly because the Secretary of State's  own
      position which was in conflict with the Judge's  conclusion  that  the
      appellants could safely and reasonably relocate  to  Khartoum.   As  a
      result, and having taken advice, Mr Richards accepted  that  I  should
      conclude that the Judge's decision could not stand and that  I  should
      find that the appellants were entitled to refugee status on the  basis
      of the Judge's finding that they all belonged to the Berti tribe.   It
      was accepted that they could not return to their home area  or  safely
      and reasonably internally relocate within Khartoum.

   8. I accept Mr Richards' submissions in respect of the proper outcome  of
      these appeals.  Consequently, I find:

        1) the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in  failing  to  take  into
           account the expert report and the CG case of AA;

        2) the appellants have established that there is a real  risk  that
           they would be subject to persecution for a Convention reason  in
           Sudan as a result of belonging to the Berti tribe and that  they
           cannot safely and reasonably relocate within Sudan.

   9. The appeals are, accordingly, allowed under the Refugee Convention and
      Art 3 of the ECHR.

Decision

  10. For those reasons the First-tier Tribunal's decision to  dismiss  each
      of the appellant's appeals on asylum grounds and under  Article  3  of
      the ECHR involved the making of an error  of  law  and  cannot  stand.
      Those decisions are set aside.

  11. I remake the decisions allowing each  of  the  appellant's  appeal  on
      asylum grounds and under Article 3 of the ECHR.

                               Signed
