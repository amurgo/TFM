Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms L Afful, Solicitor, Lawrencia and Co Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as  the  secretary  of  state  and  the
      respondent as "the claimant".


   2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria, born on 15 November  1955.  His
      appeal against the respondent's decision dated 5 August 2015  refusing
      his application for a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
      Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") was  allowed  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Colyer in a determination  promulgated  on  22  January
      2015.


   3. The Judge allowed the appellant's appeal under Regulation  17  of  the
      2006 Regulations with reference to Regulation 8(5).


   4. The Judge found that the appellant had established all  the  necessary
      criteria under the 2006 Regulations [42].


   5. On 3 March 2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  R  A  Cox  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that the Judge misdirected himself in  law  in  that,  having
      found that there was a durable relationship,  he  allowed  the  appeal
      outright instead of finding that the decision was  not  in  accordance
      with the law and the 2006 Regulations. The authority of Ihemedu  (OFMs
      - Meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT  00340  (IAC)  was  relied  on  by  the
      secretary of state in the appeal.


   6. There is no dispute as  to  the  finding  by  Judge  Colyer  that  the
      appellant is in a durable relationship with an EEA  national.  Nor  is
      there any dispute that his EEA sponsor was exercising Treaty rights as
      an employee, as found by the Judge [30].


   7. Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations grants the discretion to  the
      secretary of state to issue a residence card  to  an  extended  family
      member.  The secretary of state has not yet considered the exercise of
      that discretion.  I cannot consider exercising that discretion  myself
      prior to the secretary of state doing so.


   8. In the circumstances I allow the claimant's appeal on the  basis  that
      the secretary of state's decision was not in accordance with the law -
      TA and Others (Kareem explained) Ghana [2014] UKUT 00316 (IAC).


      Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge involved the  making  of
      an error of law and is set aside.


      I substitute a decision allowing the claimant's appeal to  the  extent
      that his application for an EEA  residence  card  remains  outstanding
      before the secretary of state.


            No anonymity direction is made.





            Signed





                 Deputy       Upper       Tribunal       Judge        Mailer
Date: 11 August 2015
