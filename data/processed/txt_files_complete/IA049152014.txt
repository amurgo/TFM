Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr C Avery
For the Respondent: Mr D Medhurst, Counsel

     DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Details of the Parties and Proceedings


 1. The appellant in the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department.  The respondent, Miss Ekpro, is referred to  hereafter
    as the claimant. She is a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  22nd  September
    1992. On 19th September 2013 she  made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the points-based system.  The  application  was  refused  by  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department on 13th November 2013 on the
    basis that she had failed to demonstrate  in  the  documents  submitted
    with her application that she had the requisite funds for  maintenance,
    namely ï¿½1,600 for the 28 days from 15th August 2013 to  11th  September
    2013.


 2. The claimant had first been granted leave to enter the  United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student on 6th  October  2009.   That  leave  was
    further extended on 25th August  2010.   In  effect  the  claimant  was
    seeking a further extension of leave in  order  to  finish  her  course
    which was due for completion in September 2014. The  claimant  appealed
    against the refusal, which appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Stokes (the Judge) on 3rd March 2014.


 3. The appeal was dismissed under the  Immigration  Rules  but  the  Judge
    noted in paragraph 24 of the determination that the claimant had  lived
    and studied in the United Kingdom since 29  September  2009.   She  was
    then in the middle of an LLM course which commenced on  19th  September
    2013 and was due to be completed on 30th September 2014 and  for  which
    she  had  paid  the  fees  in  full.   The  Judge  found  that  in  the
    circumstances it was disproportionate for her to be removed pending the
    completion of that course  and  allowed  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.


 4. The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  sought  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal against that decision on the grounds  that
    that the only reason for the appeal being allowed was on the  basis  of
    continuing to  finish  the  course.   In  those  circumstances  it  was
    contended that that was not a right which  engaged  Article  8  in  the
    circumstances. Leave to appeal was granted on that basis and there  was
    an initial  hearing before Upper Tribunal Judge King TD  on  17th  June
    2014 who found that there was an error in the  approach  taken  by  the
    Judge in relying simply upon education.


 5. He set aside the decision and found  it  to  be  in  the  interests  of
    justice to allow the claimant, through her representative,  to  develop
    such arguments as may be appropriate in the circumstances. He  retained
    the matter within the Upper Tribunal for those arguments to be advanced
    and  the  matter  accordingly  comes  before  me  for  further  hearing
    following the making of a transfer order in the light of Upper Tribunal
    Judge King's unavailability today.


The Law

  6. Article 8 of the ECHR provides that:
           1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and  family
           life, his home and his       correspondence.
           2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others.

  7. The burden of proof in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR lies with  the
     claimant.  She must prove on the balance of probabilities that  private
     or family life is established and will be interfered with as  a  result
     of the Secretary of State's decision.   Once she has  established  that
     she enjoys this protected right which is threatened with violation  the
     burden shifts to the Secretary of State to show that  the  interference
     is lawful and in pursuit of a legitimate aim; it must be shown that the
     violation is justified and that it does not impair the right  any  more
     than  is  necessary;  in  other  words,  whether  the  interference  is
     proportionate.

  8. On 28th  July  2014  section  19  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014  made
     amendments to the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  by
     introducing a new Part 5A which contains sections 117A, 117B, 117D  and
     117D. These statutory provisions apply to all appeals heard on or after
     28 July 2014, irrespective  of  when  the  application  or  immigration
     decision was made. Part 5A only applies where  the  Tribunal  considers
     article 8(2) ECHR directly.  Section 117A is as follows:

         117A Application of this Part
          1) This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
             determine whether a
             decision made under the Immigration Acts-
                   (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private  and
         family life under
                   Article 8, and
                   (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the
         Human Rights Act
                   1998.
         (2)     In considering the public interest question, the  court  or
         tribunal must (in
                   particular) have regard-
             (a) in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and
             (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.
         (3)     In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means the
         question of
                   whether an interference with a person's right to  respect
         for private and family
                   life is justified under Article 8(2).


  9. Section 117B is as follows:

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases
         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.
         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-
             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-
             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (4)  Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that  is
             established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.
         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.
         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.




My Consideration of the Evidence and Issues


 10. The core submission made for the claimant by Mr Medhurst is that  there
     are factors within this particular case that make  it  of  a  different
     order to the usual. In  accordance  with  previous  directions  a  full
     skeleton argument has been submitted for  this  hearing  outlining  the
     case that it is not the mere fact that the appellant wishes to complete
     her studies that brings her within Article 8. I take  full  account  of
     these submissions but the evidence shows that  matters  have  moved  on
     significantly since the last hearing.

 11. The claimant attended the hearing and gave oral  evidence  by  adopting
     her new statement dated 19th September 2014. The position is  that  she
     has now completed her LLM course  at  the  University  of  Sussex;  her
     dissertation has been submitted and she awaits the result of her degree
     which will be known by 23rd October 2014. All being well, she hopes  to
     graduate in the last two weeks of January 2015.

 12. The accepted background to the matter is that  the  claimant  submitted
     the wrong bank statements with her application; had she  submitted  the
     correct ones  her  application  would  have  succeeded.   She  had  the
     necessary funds from  the  outset  but  unfortunately  used  the  wrong
     statements to demonstrate her ability, meaning that in accordance  with
     the case of Raju [2013] UKUT 00610 (IAC) she was prohibited from  using
     subsequent evidence to overcome the shortfall in the original evidence.
      She accordingly could not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
     Rules, but had it not been for the mistake she would have satisfied the
     Rules.


 13. It is submitted for the claimant that it is relevant to consider in the
     exercise of Article 8 these difficult circumstances which were  further
     complicated by the immigration decision being issued in  November  2013
     but not being not received by the claimant  until  January  2014.   The
     claimant's evidence is that the late receipt was for  reasons  entirely
     beyond her control, namely  error  on  the  part  of  the  Royal  Mail,
     resulting in the delay in delivery. Had she received  the  decision  in
     time she would  have  been  given  the  opportunity  to  make  a  fresh
     application within 28 days.  She  claims  to  have  raised  the  matter
     directly with the Secretary of State in order to request  an  extension
     of the 28 day period but it was not accepted that the decision was  not
     received until January 2014.


 14. It is submitted that this  is  a  relevant  consideration  because  the
     claimant was obliged to bring  an  appeal  in  order  to  preserve  her
     situation and  her  leave  to  remain.  This  is  submitted  to  be  an
     exceptional situation and the claimant  should  be  treated  fairly  in
     accordance with Patel [2011] UKUT 211. It is  accepted  that  following
     the case of Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct  approach)  [2013]
     UKUT 640 (IAC) only if there are "arguably good grounds"  for  granting
     leave to remain outside the Rules is it necessary for the Tribunal  for
     Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there  are  "compelling
     circumstances not sufficiently recognised by the Rules".


 15. The claimant relies upon the case of CDS (PBS: "available": Article  8)
     Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC) to show  that  her  removal  would  have
     sufficiently grave consequences as to engage Article 8; she  has  built
     up a connection with her course, as well as the  ultimate  professional
     qualification sought; she has formed social ties during the  period  of
     study. The claimant's studies are submitted to  be  directly  connected
     with her plan to further qualify in Nigeria.


 16. There is accepted to be no  "near  miss"  principle,  but  Mr  Medhurst
     relied on the case of Nasim & Others  (Article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025
     (IAC) in which it was observed that it would be wrong to say  that  the
     point has been reached where an adverse  immigration  decision  in  the
     case of a person who is here for study or other temporary purposes  can
     never be found to be disproportionate.  The  claimant  states  that  by
     reason of errors, one of which was entirely beyond her control, she  is
     now at risk of extremely harsh and disproportionate consequences.

 17. The claimant relies on the damage caused  to  her  established  private
     life. She gives evidence that she has committed a great deal of energy,
     work and financial resource into completing her LLM. Since her  arrival
     in the United Kingdom on 6th October 2009 she has built up a network of
     friends and contacts here; she has cousins and uncles living in  Bishop
     Stortford and London. She states that she has friends who  were  fellow
     students at the University of Sussex providing contacts  which  may  be
     vital to the development of her future career.  The claimant's evidence
     is that she plans to return to Nigeria to qualify as a barrister in the
     field of commercial law and  it  will  be  important  to  maintain  and
     develop these professional and academic contacts in the United Kingdom.




 18. I return to the evidence of the claimant's current position  which  has
     changed significantly since the first hearing of this appeal;  she  has
     now completed her studies which will not be disrupted as a  consequence
     of the decision of the Secretary of State. The claimant asks,  however,
     to be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom so that she can  graduate
     in person in January 2015 and celebrate her success here. If she has to
     return to Nigeria between now and then she states that  she  will  face
     the expense of returning to the United Kingdom as a visitor.


 19. In these  circumstances  I  find  merit  in  the  submissions  for  the
     Secretary of State made by Mr Avery that it is  difficult  to  see  how
     Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged. If, however, I  take  the  claimant's
     case at its height and accept that a combination of errors  has  worked
     harshly against her so that she could otherwise have succeeded  in  her
     application under the Immigration Rules I find that  the  appeal  could
     still not succeed on a free-standing consideration under Article  8  of
     the ECHR.


 20. The claimant realistically does  not  argue  her  case  on  grounds  of
     protected Article 8 family life in the United Kingdom.   She  makes  no
     more than passing reference to family members and I  find  that  family
     life is not shown to exist. Applying the 5-stage test in Razgar to  the
     claimant's  established  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom  I  am
     satisfied that the answer  to  the  first  four  questions  is  in  the
     affirmative.   I am further satisfied that the answer to fifth question
     is also "yes", namely that the interference to the appellant's  private
     life is proportionate  to  the  legitimate  public  end  sought  to  be
     achieved.


 21. The fact that the maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
     the public interest is now set out in statute; I  must,  and  do,  have
     regard to that in assessing proportionality.  I attach  weight  to  the
     public interest and for all the following reasons I find it not  to  be
     outweighed by the claimant's right to respect for her private  life  in
     the circumstances of this case.  The claimant has  at  all  times  been
     present in the United Kingdom  for  temporary  purposes,  primarily  to
     study and those studies are now complete. There  is  no  disruption  to
     those studies caused by the decision of the Secretary of State.


 22. The evidence does not in  my  view  support  the  submission  that  the
     claimant faces "extremely harsh and disproportionate consequences".  In
     considering  her  evidence  of  the  importance  of   maintaining   and
     developing her professional and academic contacts in the United Kingdom
     I see no reason for this  not  to  be  possible  after  her  return  to
     Nigeria.  Her evidence is that she intends to return to Nigeria to work
     and in these circumstances I find any  interference  with  her  private
     life caused by the decision  of  the  respondent  to  be  minimal.  Her
     private life can continue in my view with little, if any, disruption at
     a distance in circumstances where she has now completed her time at the
     university where these links were formed.


 23. Even if there has been error on the part of the Royal Mail contributing
     to the refusal of the claimant's application, as well as her own error,
     I am not satisfied that the Secretary of State has acted unfairly.  She
     made a decision on the facts before her which showed  the  requirements
     of the Immigration Rules not to be met on the evidence available at the
     relevant time.


 24. In terms of the consequence of having to return to Nigeria  before  her
     graduation in  January  2015  the  evidence  does  not  show  any  bar,
     including expense, to the claimant returning to the United  Kingdom  in
     order to attend the graduation.  Her evidence is that she will  do  so.
     The sequence of events leading to the refusal of  her  application  may
     well have caused additional expense to the claimant but that  does  not
     carry any weight  of  significance  in  her  favour  in  the  balancing
     exercise; she has expended time and money in pursuit of her studies but
     successfully so by completing those studies. I  find  that  the  appeal
     cannot succeed under Article 8 of the ECHR or on any other grounds.


Summary of Decisions


 25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the  appeal  on  human
     rights grounds has previously been set aside.

 26. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal under Article 8  of  the
     ECHR.


 27. This appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the
     Home Department succeeds.

Anonymity


    The position remains that First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to
