                                  DECISION


1.   This appeal was listed for clarification as regards disposal.  We  were
    able to establish that at  a  hearing  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  30
    September 2016 the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  found,  with  the
    consent of the parties, to have materially erred in law and the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision was set aside and  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a hearing de novo.






Signed                                  Date
