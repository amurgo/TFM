                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 29th April 1962 is a  citizen  of  Jamaica.   The
    Appellant who was present was represented by Mr Brown of Counsel.   The
    Respondent was represented by Miss Johnstone, a Home Office  Presenting
    Officer.



Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had made application to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.
     That application had been refused by the Respondent  on  29th  January
    2014.  The Appellant had appealed that  decision  and  her  appeal  was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lambert sitting at Manchester
    on 30th July 2014.  The judge  had  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under both the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The Appellant had appealed that decision and application for permission
    to appeal was refused by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  on  23rd
    September 2014.  The application was renewed on 28th September 2014 and
    permission was granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Goldstein  and  26th
    November 2014.  It was said that without wishing to  unduly  raise  the
    Appellant's hopes it was arguable there may have been an error  of  law
    in the approach taken under EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The Respondent opposed that application by a letter dated 10th December
    2014.  The matter comes before me  by  way  of  directions  to  firstly
    decide whether or not an error of law has been made in this case.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

 5. Mr Brown referred me to the lengthy Grounds  of  Appeal  and  submitted
    that the judge should have looked at  and  concluded  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles in the Appellant and/or her partner relocating
    under EX.1(b).  Further it was said that such matters should have  been
    given better consideration in terms of Article 8 of the ECHR.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

 6. Miss Johnstone referred me to the Respondent's response letter  and  it
    was submitted the Appellant was  not  eligible  under  the  Immigration
    Rules generally nor could she rely upon EX.1.  It  was  submitted  that
    the case could not have succeeded under the Immigration Rules.

 7. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision to consider
    the documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with
    my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 8. The Appellant in this case had entered the United Kingdom in  May  2002
    as a visitor and thereafter had remained as a  student.   On  24th  May
    2004 it was said that she  had  married  a  UK  citizen  and  had  made
    application for settlement in that capacity.  That application had been
    refused and she had become appeal rights exhausted in respect  of  that
    matter on 8th October 2007.  Thereafter in February 2008 she  had  made
    an application under Article 8 of the ECHR  and  that  application  had
    been rejected.  A further application had been made  in  November  2011
    under Article 8 of the ECHR and that application had  been  refused  on
    13th March 2012.

 9. The Appellant's application was for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules  or  alternatively
    under Article 8 of the ECHR outside of the Rules.  Both  those  avenues
    of application were referred to and repeated  within  the  more  recent
    applications for permission to appeal the First-tier Tribunal decision.



10.  The  judge  had  considered  the  Appellant's  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge  noted  at  paragraph  4.2  that  it  was
    conceded on behalf of the Appellant that  she  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM because she was an overstayer who  had  had
    no valid leave since 8th October 2007.  Leaving aside  that  concession
    which appears to have been made before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    the judge was correct to conclude that the Appellant could not meet the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.

11. Firstly, the Appellant had remained in the UK  since  October  2007  in
    breach of the Immigration Rules with no valid leave to remain.  It  was
    also concluded that the Appellant had an outstanding debt  to  the  NHS
    rendering her in breach of  suitability  requirements  under  S-LTR2.3.
    She  accordingly   did   not   meet   the   eligibility   requirements.
    Notwithstanding a person's failure to meet the eligibility requirements
    there are occasions where  paragraph  EX.1  may  be  applicable  to  an
    applicant.  In this case the Appellant had relied  on  EX.1(b)  on  the
    basis that she was in a relationship with  a  partner.   As  the  judge
    noted at 4.1 although it was submitted on behalf of the Appellant  that
    she did not need to  meet  the  cohabitation  requirements  of  Section
    GEN1.2 because she  described  herself  as  a  fianc�e  the  judge  had
    correctly noted that in terms of eligibility provisions under Section E-
    LTRP1.2 she could not rely upon  her  claimed  position  as  a  fianc�e
    unless she had made entry clearance in that capacity which plainly  she
    had not.  Accordingly she could not rely upon GEN1.2  which  would  not
    necessarily require cohabitation.   In  terms  of  reliance  upon  EX.1
    merely as a partner would require her to establish on balance that  she
    had been living with her partner in a relationship akin to marriage for
    a period of two or more years.  The Respondent in  the  refusal  letter
    had raised a number of concerns as to  this  alleged  relationship  but
    even on the basis of the Appellant's own  evidence  that  she  and  her
    partner  did  not  cohabit  because  of  their  religious  beliefs  the
    Appellant was unable to satisfy that aspect  of  EX.1(b).   Accordingly
    the judge was entitled to conclude  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM leaving aside the plain concession made  by
    Counsel on behalf of the Appellant and noted at  4.2  of  the  decision
    that such was conceded.

12. Having concluded that the Appellant did not meet those requirements the
    judge at paragraphs 4.3 to 4.8 had looked at the evidence  to  consider
    whether it was appropriate to look at Article 8 outside of the Rules in
    accordance with case law.  In this respect the judge had also  referred
    herself to the requirements of Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  The judge
    for reasons given, having analysed the evidence considered that  having
    failed to meet the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
    she did not find circumstances justifying consideration  of  Article  8
    outside of the Rules.  The judge made it clear that whilst alive to the
    matters under Section 117B of the 2002 Act she  had  not  applied  that
    Section in any proportionality exercise because she  did  not  consider
    this case needed a consideration outside of the Rules.

13. The interplay between the new Immigration Rules and a consideration  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR has been a vexed  and  confusing  area  for  some
    time.  The judge in this case had  referred  herself  to  the  case  of
    Gulshan and other case law.  It was her view as expressed at  4.3  that
    she should not consider Article 8 outside of the Rules unless there are
    good arguments to do so.  As indicated above the judge  had  thereafter
    outlined salient features of the evidence that led her to conclude that
    there were not those good arguments to consider Article  8  outside  of
    the Rules.

14. I have noted the case of SS Congo and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387  which
    is a further and recent consideration of this interplay.   Those  cases
    were dealing with specific matters  but  helpfully  made  some  general
    points.  The court referred itself to the case of  Huang  and  then  at
    paragraph 29 stated as follows:

         "It is clear therefore that it cannot be maintained  as  a  general
         proposition that leave to remain or  leave  to  enter  outside  the
         Immigration Rules should only  be  granted  in  exceptional  cases.
         However in  certain  specific  contexts  a  proper  application  of
         Article 8 may itself make it clear that  the  legal  test  for  the
         grant of LTR or LTE outside the Rules should indeed be  a  test  of
         exceptionality.  This has now been identified to be  the  case,  on
         the basis of the constant  jurisprudence  of  the  ECHR  itself  in
         relation to applications for LTR outside the Rules on the basis  of
         family life established in the United Kingdom at a  time  when  the
         presence of one or other of the partners was known to be precarious
         see Nagre approved by this court in MF (Nigeria)."

    Having then referred to the question of deportation cases at  paragraph
    31 the court stated thus:

         "In other contexts, it cannot simply be assumed that a strict legal
         test of exceptional circumstances will be applicable when examining
         the application of Article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  or
         within  the  Rules  themselves  where  particular  paragraphs   are
         formulated so as fully to cover the applicability of Article 8. The
         relevant general balance  of  public  interest  considerations  and
         individual interests will  vary  between  different  parts  of  the
         Rules. It is only if the normal balance of  interests  relevant  to
         the general area in question is such  as  to  require  particularly
         great weight to be given to the public interest  as  compared  with
         the individual interests at  stake  (as  in  the  precarious  cases
         considered in Nagre and  the  foreign  criminal  deportation  cases
         considered in MF (Nigeria)) that a strict  test  of  exceptionality
         will apply."

    Those paragraphs seem to suggest that in the case where the presence of
    one or other of the partners was known to be precarious as in  Nagre  a
    strict test of exceptionality will apply in terms of considering a case
    outside of the Immigration Rules.  To some extent that test so  far  as
    "precarious" cases are concerned is supported by the statutory  factors
    referred to in Section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act.

15. In this case the Appellant's status in the UK was indeed precarious and
    had been for some years and that was known to both parties  namely  the
    Appellant and her partner.  The judge  referred  specifically  to  that
    feature.  It is also clear that whilst she had not gone on to  consider
    the case outside of the Rules and had therefore not placed Section  117
    into the proportionality equation she noted at paragraph 4.7:

         "It was known to be precarious from the outset.  This is  the  very
         scenario to which parliament has so recently by Section  117B(4)(b)
         of the 2002 Act instructed me, even if I were to go on to  consider
         Article 8(2) of the ECHR to attach little weight."

    The judge at paragraph 4.3 had not considered this case outside of  the
    Rules because she did not find applying applicable case law that  there
    were good arguments to do so.  The recent case of SS Congo  and  Others
    referred to above would seem to support the proposition that in respect
    of those whose immigration status is precarious  or  deportation  cases
    the test for looking at Article 8 outside of the Rules  is  a  test  of
    exceptionality.  In applying a somewhat lower threshold referred to  as
    "good arguments to do so" it cannot therefore be said that the  judge's
    failure to consider the case outside of the Rules is not in  accordance
    with the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal  in  SS  Congo  and
    Others on 23rd April 2015.   It  cannot  therefore  be  said  that  any
    material error of law was made by the judge in this case.

Notice of Decision

16. There was no material error of law made by the judge and I  uphold  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

17. Anonymity not retained.
