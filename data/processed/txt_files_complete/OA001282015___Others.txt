Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss M Malhotra, Counsel, instructed M A Consultants
(London)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Pakistan, born on 20 February  2001,  19
    October 2002 and 20 April 1996  respectively.   They  applied  to  join
    their father, the sponsor, a British  citizen  but  they  were  refused
    entry clearance on 4 December 2014.  They  appealed  the  decision  and
    their appeals came before a First-tier Judge on 21 March 2016.  On that
    occasion the appellants were represented by Mr M Afzal.

2.   The judge records that there were two bundles before  him.   There  was
    one properly indexed and paginated bundle submitted by  the  appellants
    consisting of 79 pages which he contrasted with the  documents  in  the
    respondent's bundle. This bundle was  neither  paginated,  indexed  nor
    held together in any way.

3.   The judge noted in paragraph 2 of his decision that the mother  of  the
    appellants together with another sister had made a separate application
    for an entry clearance and their applications had been  granted  on  14
    November 2014.

4.   It had initially been contended by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  that
    the sponsor had to demonstrate income for his wife and  four  dependent
    children in the sum of �29,600.  The Entry  Clearance  Manager  however
    had conceded  that  that  figure  was  incorrect.  The  correct  income
    threshold should  have  been  �24,800.   However  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager considered that  the  total  annual  income  evidenced  by  the
    sponsor was �21,865.28.  The sponsor had insufficient savings make good
    the shortfall.

5.   The  judge  found  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  not  been
    unreasonable in approaching matters on the basis that the family should
    be considered as a whole when calculating  the  financial  requirements
    and in any event the appropriate figure  should  have  been  more  than
    �24,800.  However, he found that the appellant could not make  out  the
    lower figure in any event.  He dismissed the appeals on  the  financial
    requirements.

6.   In relation to  accommodation,  while  he  notes  that  it  was  not  a
    requirement under the Immigration Rules, the appellant  had  failed  to
    provide a report in respect of the address he was residing at the  time
    of the application or for his current address.  He  was  not  satisfied
    that such accommodation as might be available would be adequate for the
    three appellants.

7.   The appellants  appealed.   The  grounds  of  appeal  were  settled  by
    different Counsel. A point was taken  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    prohibited the appellant from using the interpreter and  the  appellant
    had signed a letter dated 21 April 2016 where the appellant stated that
    the judge had questioned why he could not  give  evidence  in  English,
    stating he had been in the UK long enough.  The appellant had explained
    he  was  not  confident  to  give  any  evidence   in   English.    His
    representatives  had  asked  for  him  to  give  evidence  through  the
    interpreter but the judge  was  not  happy  with  this.   Although  the
    interpreter had remained in the  room  he  was  not  able  to  use  his
    services.  He had not fully understood some of the questions and  could
    not fully express himself in English.

8.   It was also argued in the  grounds  that  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in
    failing to consider the circumstances as at the date of the application
    to the Entry Clearance Officer and that the judge had wrongly  focussed
    on the lack of  an  accommodation  report  relating  to  the  sponsor's
    current address.  The judge had overlooked the  evidence  of  financial
    requirements in the bundle which included payslips, bank statements and
    a letter from the employer.

9.   The appellants had relied on the same  accommodation  used  when  their
    mother had obtained entry clearance.  The accommodation report provided
    then confirmed sufficient space for  the  family.   There  had  been  a
    failure to make clear and properly reasoned credibility findings.

10.  Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  15
    September 2016.  Curiously no reference was made to the ground relating
    to the interpreter. The matter had not been sent back to the First-tier
    Judge for his comments on the allegation.

11.  On the issue of unfairness, Mr  Afzal  had  prepared  a  statement  and
    attended the hearing.  He confirmed that the sponsor had  requested  an
    interpreter and problems ad arisen from the outset when the sponsor had
    confirmed his current address which was different to the address  given
    in his witness statement which he had adopted just moments  previously.
    This had apparently annoyed the judge although Mr Afzal  had  tried  to
    explain  that  it  was  not  the  appellants'   fault   and   he   took
    responsibility for the mistake.  The judge required the sponsor to give
    evidence in English  but  as  Mr  Afzal  put  it,  he  struggled.   The
    interpreter had remained in the court room throughout but was not  used
    at all.  He confirmed that the sponsor had provided a letter  that  was
    submitted with the application for permission to appeal.

12.  In relation to the appellant's earnings and the financial  requirements
    Miss Malhotra submitted that the respondent had erred in  referring  to
    the net figure for the appellant's earnings of �21,865.28.   The  gross
    figure of earnings was in fact �28,000 which was  sufficient  to  cover
    the requirement that the appellant's earnings exceed �24,000.

13.  Mr Singh had not  had  the  opportunity  to  consider  the  appellants'
    bundle and I put the case back to enable  him  to  familiarise  himself
    with it.

14.  He confirmed that  while  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  mistake  in
    relation to the required income threshold had been corrected, the Entry
    Clearance Manager had erred in failing to correct  the  error  made  in
    respect to calculating the appellant's income.   The  respondent's  and
    the judge had erred in taking the appellant's net rather than his gross
    income into account.  Having considered Appendix FM and the  employer's
    letter which he had checked, he found that  all  relevant  details  had
    been included and  the  requirements  had  been  met.   Accordingly  he
    submitted that it was open to me to find that there had been  error  of
    law on the part of the First-tier Judge in that he had  considered  the
    appellant's net rather than his gross pay. His gross pay  exceeded  the
    threshold.  In relation to accommodation it was not  a  requirement  of
    the Rules to provide a report about overcrowding. At the material  time
    the appellant had been  residing  in  a  three  bedroom  property.  The
    respondent had not taken a  point  on  accommodation  in  the  Rule  24
    response.

15.  Counsel responded on the issue of accommodation.  She pointed out  that
    the younger children would have been aged 13 and 12 at  the  time  when
    the respondent was considering the matter.  There was an elder daughter
    aged 22 who was living separately. The husband and wife would share one
    room.  The two younger appellants had been aged 12 and 13 at  the  date
    of decision and would share a bedroom. The son would have a room.   The
    niece slept in a reception room.  The property was not overcrowded.

16.  Mr Singh did not desire to respond to these  submissions.   I  reserved
    my decision.

17.  I have  carefully  considered  all  the  material  before  me.   It  is
    accepted on behalf of the respondent by Mr Singh that it was open to me
    to find a material error of law in this case.   I  am  grateful  to  Mr
    Singh for his helpful approach in this matter.  He was able to  confirm
    that the respondent had made two errors. The first  was  to  apply  the
    wrong threshold which was corrected by the Entry Clearance Manager  but
    the second - the  calculation  of  the  appellant's  wages  -  was  not
    corrected.

18.  I note that the First-tier Judge was not assisted by  the  presentation
    of the respondent's papers and it would have been difficult to sort out
    three separate bundles relating to the three appellants when these were
    not properly assembled.

19.  It is clear that the judge materially erred in law in  that  he  relied
    on figures provided in error by the respondent.  It also appears to  be
    the position that a property report had been provided in respect of the
    accommodation at the time of the application and having regard  to  the
    points made by Counsel at the hearing before me there is no  reason  to
    believe that such accommodation would be inadequate for the family.   I
    note that in the respondent's response no reference had  been  made  to
    the accommodation question and Mr Singh did not desire  to  respond  to
    the points made by Counsel on the issue of adequacy of accommodation.

20.  In the premises it is not necessary for me to deal  with  the  question
    of unfairness.  Mr Afzal attended the hearing, as I have said,  with  a
    short witness statement.  In paragraph  17  of  the  determination  the
    judge does refer to  questioning  Mr  Afzal  about  why  the  sponsor's
    statement gave his old address and records that Mr Afzal told him  that
    it was a result of a  mistake  in  the  solicitor's  office.  There  is
    nothing in the determination to record  issues  with  the  interpreter.
    The sponsor had certainly asked for an interpreter. The judge does  not
    say whether he heard evidence from the sponsor through  an  interpreter
    or not. There is no reference to the interpreter but it is  clear  that
    one was requested.

21.  Unfortunately when granting permission the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    did not flag up the point made about unfairness. The ordinary procedure
    would be for a reference to be made to the First-tier Judge to give the
    Judge an opportunity to comment on the allegation.  I  have  looked  at
    the First-tier Judge's notes and insofar as I can read them I  find  no
    reference to any problems relating to interpretation or indeed  to  the
    interpreter. However it is not necessary to go into this  as  the  main
    issue has helpfully been conceded by Mr Singh.

22.  For the reasons I have given the decision of the First-tier  Judge  was
    materially flawed in law.  As I allow the appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules it is not necessary to  consider  the  appeals  on  human  rights
    grounds under Article 8 outside the Rules.



Notice of Decision

23.  The appeal under the Immigration Rules is allowed.



ANONYMITY DIRECTION

24.  I make no anonymity order in this case.



TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

25.  As the appeals have been  allowed  any  fees  paid  by  the  appellants
    should be returned to them.
