For the respondent:    Ms CJ Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Williams promulgated 30.7.15, who dismissed  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  26.6.14,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian, and human rights claims and to  remove
    him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 23.7.15.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Baker  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    9.10.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 30.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. At the conclusion of the hearing before me, I reserved my  decision  on
    error of law, which I now give. For the reasons set out below,  I  find
    no error of law in  the  making  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal such as to require the decision of Judge Williams  to  be  set
    aside.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellant claims to be a Syrian national from Do Gerka in  the  Hasakah
    province. To avoid military service in March or April 2004 he  fled  to
    Turkey, with the assistance of an agent arranged and paid  for  by  his
    father. A few months later police officers  came  to  his  family  home
    because he was wanted for military service.  After  5-6  months  living
    illegally in Turkey he returned to Syria and lived in hiding,  avoiding
    the police. In June or July 2009 officers looking for him searched  the
    family home in his absence. His father again arranged for him  to  flee
    Syria to Turkey, two days after the police visit.

 6. It appears that from Turkey the appellant travelled to Greece, where he
    remained for about 6  weeks.  He  then  travelled  to  Italy  and  onto
    Switzerland, where he claimed asylum, which was refused. After 6 months
    he returned to Italy and claimed asylum there, which  was  refused.  He
    remained in Italy for one year before  immigration  officers  took  him
    back to Switzerland in April 2011. He made a further claim for  asylum,
    also refused. He  remained  in  Switzerland  for  another  year  before
    returning to Italy in August 2012, where he made a further  application
    for asylum. In September 2012 he travelled by train to France, using an
    agent, and from France was put on a lorry travelling to the  UK,  where
    he arrived on 15.9.12. He did not claim asylum until June 2013.

 7. Judge Williams concluded, relying in  part  on  an  assessment  of  the
    appellant's credibility, consideration of his claim to have fled  Syria
    to avoid military service, a Syrian identification card, and on Sprakab
    linguistic evidence, that the appellant is not  Syrian  but  Iraqi,  as
    contended by the Secretary of State in the refusal decision.

 8. In granting permission to appeal Judge  Baker  considered  it  arguable
    that the judge erred in law in not addressing the witness statement  of
    the Syrian friend of the appellant, who had been granted refugee status
    and who claimed to know the appellant  in  Syria,  and  in  not  taking
    account of the  respondent's  concession  that  the  appellant  was  of
    Kurdish ethnicity, given his claim to have been raised in the  northern
    part of Syria, close to the Iraqi border.

 9. Judge Baker also found it arguable that in not addressing the  positive
    points on credibility and the background evidence  in  support  of  his
    claims to Syrian nationality, the judge may have  materially  erred  in
    his assessment of credibility and of risk on return to the  country  of
    his claimed  nationality.  "It  is  arguable  that  in  concluding  the
    appellant was from Iraq, an Iraqi national, in  not  providing  reasons
    for that conclusion, the judge may have erred  on  a  material  matter,
    amounting to a material error of law."

10. The grounds relied on by Ms Solanki were somewhat  different  to  those
    set out in the application for permission to  appeal.  Relying  on  her
    skeleton argument dated 28.3.16, she outlined four grounds:

      a) The judge's failure to take into account evidence of a witness;

      b) Procedural unfairness in regard to the Sprakab linguistic evidence;

      c) The judge's assessment of credibility;

      d) The judge's assessment of risk on return.

11. The first ground asserts that the judge failed to consider the evidence
    of Rebar Ali, alleged to be a Syrian national with  refugee  status  in
    the UK. It is stated that the decision of Judge Williams does not  make
    any analysis or attach any weight to this evidence.

12. It is clear from �13 of the decision that before reaching  any  of  his
    findings, Judge  Williams  considered  all  the  evidence  before  him,
    including the oral evidence and those materials  contained  within  the
    appellant's bundle. It is not necessary for a judge to set out each and
    every piece of evidence, as the contents of the bundles are a matter of
    record, provided it is clear that the judge  has  properly  and  fairly
    considered all the evidence in the round. However, at �32 it  is  clear
    that in considering the appellant's claim to be of Syrian  nationality,
    and assessing the linguistic evidence, the  judge  specifically  stated
    that he took into account the witness statement of Mr Ali, as  well  as
    the appellant's own critique of the Sprakab  report.  It  follows  that
    this ground is misconceived.

13. In any event, this witness did  not  attend  the  appeal  hearing.  The
    appellant's bundle contains only  an  unsigned  witness  statement.  Ms
    Solanki asserted that a signed copy had been supplied at  the  date  of
    the hearing, but there does not appear to be any such  signed  copy  in
    the case file. Ms Solanki did not attend the First-tier Tribunal appeal
    hearing, but  relied  on  the  amended  statement  of  the  appellant's
    solicitor Ms Naz, who represented him at  the  hearing.  However,  this
    statement does not confirm that a  signed  copy  was  supplied  to  the
    Tribunal, only that the evidence was "referred to."

14. That the witness had attended earlier adjourned or management  hearings
    has little relevance and adds no weight to  the  evidence.  Little,  if
    any, weight can be attached to the evidence of a witness who  does  not
    attend the appeal hearing so that his evidence can be tested.  Further,
    that the witness claimed to be of  Syrian  nationality  and  a  refugee
    carries  little  weight  unless  such  a  claim   is   accompanied   by
    documentation detailing the basis of his claim and  the  basis  of  his
    being recognised as a refugee; the mere assertion  is  insufficient.  I
    further note that there was no request  for  an  adjournment  for  this
    witness to attend. The only adjournment request related to the  alleged
    failure of the Secretary of State to comply with directions as  to  the
    linguistic evidence.

15. In the circumstances, even if the judge should have said more about the
    witness's statement, given the matters set out above the overall weight
    that could have been attached to this  evidence  was  necessarily  very
    limited and thus could have made no difference to the  outcome  of  the
    appeal.

16. The second ground of appeal raised by  Ms  Solanki  asserts  procedural
    unfairness in refusing the requested adjournment  and  proceeding  with
    the appeal despite the failure of the Secretary of State to comply with
    directions in respect of  the  Sprakab  linguistic  evidence.  In  this
    regard Ms Solanki relies on the guidance in respect of such evidence in
    SSHD v MN & KY (Respondents) (Scotland) [2014] UKSC 30.

17. At �16 and  �17  the  judge  detailed  the  relevant  history  and  the
    information requested at CMR hearings  for  disclosure  of  information
    about the Sprakab report and its authors.  It  was  asserted  that  the
    Secretary of State had failed to  comply  with  directions.  The  judge
    considered the request for adjournment because of absence of transcript
    and for information as  to  the  qualifications  of  the  analysts.  No
    transcript  had  been  provided,  but  the  audio  recording  had  been
    supplied. The judge  was  informed  that  pursuant  to  the  directions
    Sprakab  had  been  spoken  to   and   the   only   information   about
    qualifications  was  that  set  out  in  the  report  and  no   further
    information  was  available.  The  judge  considered  that  a   further
    adjournment would serve no purpose as no further information  would  be
    made available.

18. At �32 the judge took into account  the  appellant's  critique  of  the
    Sprakab report, as well as other evidence relevant to the issue of  the
    appellant's national identity.  There  was  no  error  in  the  judge's
    pointing out that although the  appellant's  representatives  had  been
    supplied with the audio recording the appellant did  not  rely  on  any
    expert or even his own analysis of the content. The judge assessed  all
    of this before reaching the conclusion that he preferred  the  language
    analysis of the appellant's origins to that asserted by the  appellant.
    It is clear that the judge did not rely solely on linguistic  analysis.
    The judge set out the relevant case law from �27  onwards  and  applied
    the guidance  in  MN  &  KY  to  the  report.  The  judge  specifically
    considered the qualifications of the analysts  and  at  �30  placed  no
    reliance on part of the report which did not satisfactorily explain the
    source and nature of the analyst's knowledge as to  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's familiarity with Syria. The judge also  considered  whether
    there had been any unfairness in the length of the interview, which was
    22 minutes, but concluded that he was clearly able to have  a  detailed
    conversation, as reflected in the questions and answers put.

19. Ms Solanki submitted that if the appellant's representatives had  known
    that the Secretary of State was not going to provide a transcript  they
    could have applied for legal aid to fund their own. However,  it  would
    have been  known  long  before  the  appeal  hearing,  when  the  audio
    transcript had been provided, that no such transcript was  forthcoming.
    The appellant's  representatives  should  not  have  waited  until  the
    effective hearing date to make an application to adjourn,  even  though
    concerns were raised at earlier hearings and directions issued.

20. In her submissions on this issue, Ms Solanki did not identify  in  what
    way the appellant had been,  or  was  potentially,  prejudiced  by  the
    failure to comply with directions in relation to the language analysis.
    The judge noted at � 31 that the appellant accepted that he  was  asked
    most of the questions. On enquiry about qualifications the Home  Office
    had been informed that the qualifications were  stated  on  the  report
    (see B6), and the judge concluded nothing would be gained by a  further
    adjournment. Even now it is not clear what in particular is said to  be
    unfair about reliance on the report. For example, the relevance of  the
    nationality of the analysts is  not  explained,  nor  the  question  of
    whether they are employed by Sprakab, nor the demand  to  reveal  their
    identities. The impression given in reliance on this ground is  one  of
    form  rather  than  substance,  that  rather  than  identify  what   in
    particular was in error or unfair, the appellant is seeking to  take  a
    tactical point that directions were not  complied  with  and  thus  the
    report should not have been relied on at all. Weight is  a  matter  for
    the judge and it is clear from the decision that the  judge  did  weigh
    the evidence on this issue fairly in the light of the case authorities,
    accepting some parts of the linguist evidence and rejecting others.  In
    the circumstances, I find no error of law on this ground of appeal.

21. In relation to the third ground relied on by Ms Solanki,  that  of  the
    credibility assessment, it is  complained  that  the  judge  failed  to
    acknowledge the concession as to  the  appellant's  Kurdish  ethnicity.
    However, given the concession there was no need for the judge  to  make
    any finding in this regard. That the appellant was of Kurdish ethnicity
    was understood is clear from �30 where the judge rejects  the  linguist
    evidence claiming to be familiar with the Kurdish part of Syria.

22. Complaint is also made that the credibility  findings  start  with  the
    section 8 requirement to take into account as damaging credibility  his
    behaviour, denying that he had been fingerprinted or claimed asylum  in
    any other country. These were clear untruths  given  in  the  screening
    interview. Whilst an appellant is  not  expected  to  give  a  detailed
    account of his claim at the screening interview, he can be expected  to
    tell the truth.

23. That the judge commenced with this issue does not mean that it was  the
    primary focus or basis on which the rest of  the  credibility  findings
    were made. Commencing at �19 the judge listed a number of factors which
    he considered to seriously undermine credibility. It is clear that  the
    judge has assessed the evidence as a whole and the order in which it is
    laid out in the decision does not indicate the  order  of  priority  or
    consideration. Taken as a whole, rather than dissected piecemeal as the
    grounds attempt to do, I find that  the  judge  has  made  a  fair  and
    careful assessment of credibility,  highlighting  both  evidence  which
    supports and which undermines credibility.

24. Complaint is also made that the judge failed to properly assess risk on
    return at �38 and �39  and  made  no  reference  to  country  guidance.
    However, on the findings of the judge that the appellant is not  Syrian
    but Iraqi, he would not be returned to Syria  but  to  Iraq,  where  he
    stated at Q323 of his interview that he did not fear anything in  Iraq.
    The appellant's representatives did not make any assertions  or  adduce
    any evidence that there was any risk on  return  to  Iraq,  the  burden
    being on the appellant to do so. In  the  circumstances,  there  is  no
    merit in this ground of appeal.

Conclusions:

25. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
However, given the circumstances, I make an anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award
