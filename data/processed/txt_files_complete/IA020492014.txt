                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Israr Ahmed, was born on 18 October 1988 and is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  On 9 December 2013,  the  respondent  refused  to
    vary the appellant's leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and  also
    decided to remove him by way of directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The  appellant  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hindson) which,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 27 March 2014, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The judge had entered the United  Kingdom  on  a  visit  visa  and  had
    overstayed.  Whilst he had stated to the First-tier  Tribunal  that  he
    feared returning to Pakistan (he claimed to  have  been  accused  of  a
    murder there which he had not committed) that aspect of the appeal  was
    not actively pursued in the Upper Tribunal and, in any event,  at  [13]
    the judge had found that the appellant was not at real risk  on  return
    to Pakistan, a finding which has not been challenged in this appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.  At [14], the judge wrote as follows:

         I do accept however that his evidence about the situation in the UK
         and how it has evolved is true.  I have evidence  that  the  couple
         [the appellant and his wife  with  whom  he  lived  in  the  United
         Kingdom] have married both in an Islamic marriage and  in  a  civil
         ceremony.  I have evidence that the appellant's wife  is  pregnant,
         in the form of a letter from her GP.  I have  medical  evidence  to
         the effect that the appellant's wife has  mental  health  problems,
         specifically depression.  The appellant's wife is not fit  to  work
         and is in receipt of state benefits in the form of  Employment  and
         Support Allowance.   In  those  circumstances  an  out  of  country
         application for settlement under  the  Rules  would  inevitably  be
         refused on the financial requirements.

 3. The judge went on [15] to find that  the  appellant's  wife  could  not
    reasonably be expected to live with her husband in Pakistan.   She  had
    been born in the United  Kingdom,  is  a  British  citizen  and  has  a
    daughter by a previous relationship who  is  a  British  citizen.   The
    judge did, however, find  [19]  that  it  would  be  possible  for  the
    appellant and his wife to visit each other in the UK,  in  Pakistan  or
    indeed a third country.  He also noted that the couple had  "chosen  to
    have a  child  together,  notwithstanding  the  precarious  immigration
    status of the appellant".  He also stated that, "whilst it is generally
    accepted the children are best served by growing up with both of  their
    parents present, the appellant's wife would no  doubt  provide  a  good
    home and upbringing for her as yet unborn child, as she appears to have
    done for her daughter."

 4. The judge went on then to consider Gulshan (Article 8-new rules-correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) in particular, [24]:


    Drawing the threads together,  and  not  without  some  difficulty,  we
    conclude that on the current state of the authorities:


    (a) the maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,  although
    Blake J in MM (now under appeal) said that  they  could  constitute  an
    unjustified and  disproportionate  interference  with  the  ability  of
    spouses to live together; he suggested that an appropriate  figure  may
    be around ï¿½13,400, and highlighted the position of young people and low-
    wage earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;


    (b) after applying the requirements of the rules,  only  if  there  may
    arguably be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them  is
    it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there
    are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under  them:
    Nagre;


    (c) the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such  as  Section
    EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF  (Nigeria);
    they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the  absence
    of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal is to be  disproportionate
    it is necessary to show  other  non-standard  and  particular  features
    demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.




 5. The judge went on to conclude that he did  not  "find  that  there  are
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules.
    There are no compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  by
    the Rules."

 6. The appellant now asserts that the judge's application of  the  Gulshan
    "test" led him to refrain from carrying out an analysis  of  Article  8
    ECHR outside the Rules was perverse given  that  he  had  accepted  the
    appellant's account of his circumstances in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    grounds of appeal submit that the judge failed to follow the five-stage
    approach set out in Razgar 2004 UKHL 27.  That submission found  favour
    with Judge Pullig who granted permission noting that, "whilst Chikwamba
    2008 UKHL 40 may have no application in this case  on  the  facts,  the
    judge clearly did not  follow  Razgar  and  did  not  make  any  proper
    assessment of proportionality."

 7. I find that both the grant of permission and the grounds  fall  into  a
    similar error.  Gulshan,  following  on  from  the  line  of  authority
    established in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Nagre [2013]  EWHC
    720,  makes  it  clear  that  the  circumstances  of  the  majority  of
    applicants for leave to remain will fall within the provisions  of  the
    complete code as regards Article 8 ECHR now provided in the Immigration
    Rules.  Only those cases in which the  circumstances  are  particularly
    compelling and, crucially, "not sufficiently recognised by  the  Rules"
    (in the sense that the circumstances are so unusual as not to have been
    anticipated by  Rules),  should  lead  a  judicial  decision  maker  to
    consider Article 8 ECHR outside the  Immigration  Rules.   That  "test"
    requires the exercise of a judicial discretion; it does not  require  a
    full-scale application of Article 8 ECHR jurisprudence  (applying,  for
    example, the detailed analysis  indicated  in  Razgar)  or  a  detailed
    assessment of proportionality.  If a judge were required to  carry  out
    such an analysis, then nothing would be achieved by the application  of
    the Gulshan "test" at all and the very "free-wheeling" Article  8  ECHR
    assessment deprecated in Gulshan would become the norm.  The judge  did
    not, therefore, fall into error by refraining from carrying out a  full
    scale assessment of proportionality; he exercised his discretion not to
    consider Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules  and  he  did  so
    judicially; there is  no  suggestion  that  the  judge  had  regard  to
    irrelevant matters in exercising his discretion  not  to  consider  the
    appeal outside the Immigration Rules nor has he failed to take  account
    of all relevant facts.  He has had proper regard for the fact that this
    appellant did not fall to be considered under EX1 because he was in the
    United Kingdom as a visitor (see E-LTRP2.1).  Significantly, the  judge
    was  aware  that  the   appellant,   notwithstanding   his   precarious
    immigration status, had chosen to start a family in the United Kingdom.
     Although the judge does not say  so  expressly,  the  public  interest
    concerned with the removal of an individual who seeks to circumvent the
    Immigration Rules is clearly a very strong one.  In the  circumstances,
    I am not satisfied that he erred in law by refraining from  considering
    Article 8 outside the Rules.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

 8. This appeal is dismissed.
