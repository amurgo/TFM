                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. We see no need for, and do not make, an order  restricting  publication
    of the details of this appeal.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier  Tribunal  which  allowed  the  appeal  of  the   respondent
    (hereinafter "the claimant") to the extent that it found  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State to refuse  the  application  to  be  "not  in
    accordance with the law".

 3. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was brought by a citizen of India
    against a decision of the Secretary of  State  refusing  him  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant. The decision that was subject  to
    appeal was made under the points based system.

 4. We will try and explain what happened.

 5. The application for leave is dated 29 April 2014.  The application form
    is filled in clearly and the appropriate box is ticked to show that the
    applicant wanted leave for more than three years  (see  question  L1b).
    In order to satisfy the requirements for admission he  had  to  have  a
    minimum annual income of a specified sum that is close to ï¿½30,000.  The
    claimant was not in a position to command that sort of salary and there
    was no possibility of his satisfying that requirement in the Rules.

 6. Ironically it seems reasonably clear that he would have  been  able  to
    satisfy the requirements of the Rules if he had applied for a  stay  of
    less than three years in which event a smaller income would  have  been
    satisfactory.

 7. In either case he had to support the  application  with  a  certificate
    described as a "Certificate of Sponsorship" from the proposed employer.
     The certificate in this case showed the start date as  24  April  2014
    and the end date as 23 April 2017 which is clearly a  period  of  three
    years.  It followed that the actual period shown on the Certificate  of
    Sponsorship did not match with the period the applicant indicated  that
    he wanted.

 8. There was a problem with the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  because  it
    included an endorsement in the following terms:

         "I have entered a UKID number in error - our employee does not have
         one and this box should be  blank.   Please  could  we  extend  the
         sponsorship from three to five years to 23 April 2019."

 9. This is equivocal.  The Certificate of Sponsorship was for three  years
    but indicated a desire to "extend" the period  of  employment  to  five
    years.  We know how this problem came about because it is explained  in
    a letter.  The letter comes from Assurant Solutions.  It  is  dated  10
    June 2014.  It says that:

         "The applicant originally requested 'a three year sponsorship'  but
         after the certificate was issued [the applicant] requested  a  five
         year sponsorship.  I sought advice from the Border Agency  Employer
         Helpline on  24  April  2014  and  the  advisor  informed  me  that
         increasing the duration of the sponsorship was not a problem and  I
         just needed to add a note to the certificate of sponsorship."

10. This explains the addendum that we have  identified  above  seeking  to
    "extend" the sponsorship period to five years.  It is quite clear of us
    that the advice on the telephone was given before the  application  was
    made on 29 April and probably on 24 April 2014 as is alleged.

11. The decision of the Secretary of  State  is  hard  to  criticise.   The
    Secretary of State noted that the applicant  did  not  expect  to  earn
    enough money from his employment to satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    rules for five years' leave.

12. We say immediately that we have  very  considerable  sympathy  for  the
    applicant.  It seems to us that he has  not  done  anything  dishonest.
    The worst that could be said against him is that he has made a bit of a
    mess in making an application. That is  not  to  his  moral  discredit.
    Refusing the application will have very  significant  consequences  for
    him  including  personal  disappointment  and   probably   considerable
    financial loss.  It is a heavy price to pay for a mistake.

13. We understand the First-tier Tribunal's  efforts  to  do  something  to
    assist.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge said that the  advice  given  in
    the telephone conversation was something on which the sponsor relied to
    its detriment. In the case of EK (Ivory Coast) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 it was decided  that  although
    the obligation to act fairly did require  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    advise an applicant about matter of which he was  unaware,  a  decision
    made in reliance on information given might well be unfair. The  First-
    tier Tribunal decided (see paragraph  13)  that  there  was  unfairness
    where:

         "... there had been a change of position of which the Secretary  of
         State was aware,  and  indeed  which  she  had  brought  about,  in
         circumstances in which the students were not themselves at fault in
         any way, but had been caught out by actions taken by the  Secretary
         of State in relation to  which  they  had  had  no  opportunity  to
         protect themselves". It  seems  to  me  that  the  conduct  of  the
         respondent's own Employer Helpline, in  informing  the  appellant's
         sponsor in the course of a legitimate enquiry that the  application
         could be varied in the  manner  requested,  and  the  employer  and
         appellant then acting to  their  detriment  in  relying  upon  that
         advice, and the application being refused because the amendment  of
         the Certificate or Sponsorship  was  then  used  as  the  basis  of
         refusal, cumulatively makes this a  case  where  the  Secretary  of
         State has brought about  the  misfortune,  rendering  the  decision
         unlawful for want of procedural fairness."

14. We cannot agree with that analysis.  What has clearly happened here  is
    that the sponsor tried to assist the applicant by extending the  period
    of sponsorship from three years to five years.  The  sponsor  was  told
    that it was permissible to give effect to that intention by  writing  a
    note to act as an addendum to the certificate of sponsorship  and  this
    is what the sponsor did.

15. We do not know but we think that it would have  not  been  possible  to
    simply change the Certificate before it was submitted because it  would
    have already been served electronically and that is why the note is  in
    the form that it is.  That may not be right.  It does not matter.   The
    fact is that the note is there.

16. We do not see how the Secretary of State can be criticised. Rather  the
    Secretary of State gave a straightforward answer to  a  question  about
    how the effect of the form could be changed. The addendum was added  as
    a consequence of that advice. It then followed that  the  Secretary  of
    State was plainly right to refuse the ensuing application  because  the
    application that was made did not satisfy the Rules.

17. We reflected carefully on the reasons given by the First-tier  Tribunal
    and it seems to us they can only make sense if there is  an  obligation
    on the Secretary of State that goes beyond responding to  the  question
    asked but which requires her to warn  the  interlocutor  of  the  other
    requirements  that  would  have  to  met  before  (in  this  case)   an
    application  for  three  years  leave  could   succeed.   We   see   no
    justification for that. The point Sales LJ elucidated in EK  (in  which
    the applicant  student  was  unsuccessful)  was  that  there  might  be
    "unfairness" where an applicant was caught out by a change made by  the
    Secretary of  Sate  in  circumstances  where  an  applicant  is  either
    ignorant of the change or unable to change his own  position.  That  is
    very different from the present case where it is the applicant who  has
    changed his mind about the length of leave that he wants.

18. Even if such an obligation existed it would not necessarily have helped
    this applicant. The difficulty for the Applicant that will not go  away
    is that, whatever the applicant intended, he  indicated  in  answer  to
    question L1b on his application form that he  wanted  more  than  three
    years' leave.

19. We are quite confident it is asking too much of the Secretary of  State
    to require her to go beyond the scope of the application  and  consider
    if other Rules apply.

20. The First-tier Tribunal Judge should not have made the decision that he
    did.  He was wrong.  We set aside his  decision  and  we  substitute  a
    decision dismissing the appeal against the decision made.

21. We are very grateful to both representatives before us.  Mr  Saini  was
    persistent under a barrage of questions from the Tribunal as we  tested
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision  and  his  submissions  but,  as  is
    explained above, we are satisfied that they were wrong.

Notice of Decision

22. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed. We set aside  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal and substitute our decision  dismissing  the
    claimant's appeal.
