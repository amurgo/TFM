Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Wilding, instructed by B.H.T. Immigration Legal
Services
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Ghana  born  on  26  March  1986.   She,
    together with her brother  Edward,  appealed  decisions  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer refusing them family permits as children over the age
    of 21 of an EEA national.  I need say no  more  about  Edward's  appeal
    because, although both the appeals were  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
    Judge, subsequently in a Rule 24 response dated 25  September  2012  it
    was accepted that the judge  erred  and  that  Edward's  appeal  should
    succeed on the basis  that  he  was  dependent  upon  the  sponsor  for
    essential needs at the date of decision.

2.   At an earlier hearing on 10 January 2013 I found an  error  of  law  in
    the judge's reasoning in respect of concerns he  had  expressed  as  to
    whether or not the appellants were working and therefore in receipt  of
    income at the date of the hearing and also with regard to  the  ability
    of the sponsor to continue to maintain them.

3.   I should also note the fact that as set out  in  paragraph  16  of  the
    error of law judgment, it was common ground that the relevant date  was
    the date of hearing before the judge which was 10 April 2012.   In  the
    Secretary of State's response it was argued that the material date  was
    the date of decision, and submissions in  that  regard  were  set  out.
    However at the hearing before me Mr Nath  accepted  that  the  relevant
    date was the date of hearing and indeed it was also common ground  that
    since the matter was being re-heard the relevant date was the  date  of
    the hearing before me today.

4.   The appellant's claim is based on the fact that she says  she  has  not
    been able to find work in Ghana since a contract she had to work for  a
    bank came to an end at the end of December 2011.   The  judge  accepted
    that her mother, the sponsor in the United Kingdom who  sent  money  to
    her and her brother was an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the
    United Kingdom.  As I have noted above, the judge  had  concerns  about
    the evidence which I found to be marred by errors of law such that  the
    appeal required to be re-heard.

5.   The sponsor, Mrs Charlotte Baah  gave  evidence.   She  relied  on  her
    statement of 16 May 2013.  She had listed the money transfers  she  had
    sent between 1 May 2012 and  18  April  2013,  and  she  also  produced
    evidence of a payment of �200 made on 22 May 2013.  These sums had been
    sent to the appellant for the use of her and her brother Edward.

6.   The sponsor lives with her son Yau,  now  aged  11,  who  was  born  in
    Germany in May 2002, and her other son Asamoah who was born  on  8  May
    1999 and who had been born and brought up in Ghana.  He had been in the
    United Kingdom for two years having previously lived with the appellant
    and Edward.  He was finding it very hard to be separated from them  and
    he missed their influence on him.

7.   When cross-examined by Mr Nath the sponsor said  that  as  regards  her
    youngest son Yau he was not so familiar with the appellant  and  Edward
    but was happy to see them.  He had never lived  with  them.   He  would
    like them all to be together.

8.   At the moment the appellant and Edward  were  not  doing  anything  but
    looking for jobs in Ghana and had been looking for work for  two  years
    or so.  A friend had been to see them last year.  She sent money in the
    sum of some �200 or so a month and at other times when they needed  it.
    She was still working, at Southdown Preston Park Day  Centre  and  also
    was in receipt of benefits as set out in her statement.  She could live
    sufficiently on her income.  She wanted her children with her.

9.   She could not explain the discrepancy  that  had  concerned  the  judge
    about Edward receiving money after the date he  finished  his  national
    service.  She could not remember when he  had  left  national  service.
    The appellant had worked for a bank but she did not know when  she  had
    stopped that work.  She herself lived with her two sons in a flat which
    had three bedrooms.

10.  On re-examination she said that if they came she would work more  hours
    as if they were here then they would be able to look after her youngest
    son when she was not there.  As to why it was so hard for the appellant
    to find a job she said it was quite hard  in  Ghana,  people  were  not
    getting the jobs including graduates  and  new  job  opportunities  for
    graduates were not arising.  Her children had  asked  her  to  talk  to
    friends to find them jobs.

11.  In his submissions Mr Nath noted the sponsor's evidence that she  would
    do more work, but there was no evidence that this  would  be  possible.
    Also the impact of their arrival on her benefits would have to be taken
    into account.  There was an issue as to how much her rent was  and  how
    she could afford it, though the judge had felt it might be possible for
    her to send the money.

12.  The appellant had not been to work for roughly two years.  It was  said
    to be difficult in Ghana to find work and it was unclear how one  could
    prove efforts to find work but there was no evidence of it.  There  was
    the question of when she had ceased working in the bank and the sponsor
    was unable to help with this though  it  was  understandable  that  she
    might not know.  It was however a central point and there was a lack of
    evidence.  Mr Nath relied on the refusal letter.  It had not been found
    credible that attempts had been made to  find  work  over  a  two  year
    period.

13.  As regards an Article 8 claim, the sponsor had  been  asked  about  her
    sons in the United Kingdom missing the appellant and there  was  little
    evidence from her, nothing in the form of letters or cards.  There  was
    nothing to establish an Article 8 claim.  The evidence  did  not  cross
    the threshold as regards Article 8  under  the  Immigration  Rules  nor
    under the ECHR.  The accommodation was a flat with three  bedrooms  and
    there might be issues of overcrowding and there were no details of  the
    living arrangements.

14.  In her submissions Ms Wilding made the point that the  remaining  issue
    was whether  the  appellant  was  dependent  on  the  sponsor  for  her
    essential needs as an extended family member.   As  of  today  she  was
    unemployed and her mother was her  sole  source  of  income.   She  had
    worked after graduating in June 2008 but  had  then  been  in  national
    service between August 2008 and August 2009 and got a job  in  December
    2010 when she had worked for a bank  for  a  year.   She  had  not  had
    employment since then.  That was consistent with the  time  of  earlier
    unemployment.  The Tribunal had heard evidence  about  difficulties  in
    finding work in Ghana.  The  fact  was  that  she  was  unemployed  and
    dependent on the sponsor.  There had been  increasing  numbers  of  new
    graduates coming on to the market which would make it  more  difficult.
    Her evidence was not inherently inconsistent.

15.  With regard to the  dependency  on  her  mother,  the  schedule  showed
    transfers of �1,750 and money sent by a friend in 2012  and  there  was
    also today's receipt and a shipping invoice  in  respect  of  a  parcel
    which had been sent before Christmas.  As a percentage  of  her  income
    together with housing and other benefits this came to around 10%  which
    was a realistic amount for her to eke out  of  her  income.   Also  the
    appellant and Edward had moved into a smaller flat  in  Ghana  reducing
    their outgoings.  It was not necessary for the appellant to satisfy the
    Immigration Rules on maintenance and accommodation.  In any  event  the
    accommodation  was  effectively  three  bedrooms  with  two  officially
    designated bedrooms and a living room space which  could  be  used  for
    sleeping.  She had been supporting the appellant and Edward  in  effect
    on income support levels.  Their presence here would help with  the  10
    year old son.

16.  There was also an Article 8 claim.  The son Nana was  now  19  and  had
    come to the United Kingdom  at  17  and  the  Tribunal  had  heard  the
    evidence that he missed the appellant and Edward.  Edward would come to
    the United Kingdom as his appeal had been conceded and that would leave
    the appellant so there would be an interference with the  family  lives
    of  all.   Although  Edward  was  in  Ghana  now,  his  departure   was
    foreseeable.  It would be entirely unreasonable to expect the family to
    go to Ghana, in particular with regard to the youngest who is at school
    here and had never lived there.  The  sponsor  would  have  to  try  to
    support them  in  a  difficult  economy.   The  interference  would  be
    disproportionate.

17.  I reserved my determination.

18.  It is important to bear in mind, as Ms Wilding reminded  me,  that  the
    test to be met by the appellant in this case under the EEA  Regulations
    is whether she is dependent on the sponsor  for  her  essential  needs.
    The  issues  under  the   Immigration   Rules   for   maintenance   and
    accommodation are therefore not relevant.  I consider the  evidence  to
    be sufficiently clear in this case and the test  is  met.   I  find  it
    credible that the appellant has been unable  to  find  work  in  Ghana,
    having had employment for a short period before  her  national  service
    and thereafter for a year working for a bank.  As Mr Nath said,  it  is
    difficult to see what evidence could be produced  of  efforts  to  find
    work, although I suppose letters of application could be produced,  but
    if one looks  at  the  witness  statement  of  the  appellant,  and  in
    particular the monthly household budget that she sets out,  it  can  be
    seen that the budget is a tight one, and it is difficult to see  why  a
    person might choose to rely on income from the  United  Kingdom  rather
    than obtaining work if work were there to be had.  I  therefore  accept
    the evidence of the appellant's unemployment, and  I  also  accept  the
    evidence of the amounts of money that are sent by the sponsor.  In fact
    I consider the evidence shows that even if it were the case that it was
    argued that the matter stood to be assessed as at date of decision, the
    appellant would still succeed.  The case is made that much stronger  by
    the continuing payments that are being made by the sponsor to her which
    go to evidence further the payments that were  being  made  previously.
    Accordingly, on the basis of either the date of decision or the date of
    hearing before me today, I consider that the appellant has  shown  that
    she satisfies the test of showing dependency on  the  sponsor  for  her
    essential needs,  and  accordingly  her  appeal  against  the  decision
    refusing a family permit is allowed.
