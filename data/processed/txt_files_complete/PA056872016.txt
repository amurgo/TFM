                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of [AN], against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal of 23 May 2017 dismissing his appeal against  the  refusal  of
    his asylum claim of 12 May 2016.

 2. The Appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan, entered the UK illegally on  6
    September 2013 and claimed asylum on 17 October  2013.  His  claim  was
    refused on 14 January 2015, though he was granted  discretionary  leave
    to remain as a minor until 1 January 2016. A  further  application  for
    leave on 18 December 2015 was refused and treated  as  a  human  rights
    claim, the right of appeal thus following.

 3. His asylum claim was based on the following account. He and his  family
    lived in Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province. His uncle [AH]  was  a  Taliban
    commander in Kapisa province, whose role included  recruiting  children
    as suicide bombers. He approached the Appellant at a wedding  and  made
    it clear he wanted to recruit him for this role. He  told  his  father,
    who took the threat seriously, knowing that the uncle had sent his  own
    son [S] to be a suicide bomber, and limited the  Appellant's  movements
    thereafter, accompanying him to school, the  Appellant  returning  home
    amongst a crowd of boys to assure his safety.  The  uncle  visited  his
    family home around a month after the wedding and then again  two  weeks
    later, speaking threateningly to his father the first time  and  saying
    he would just take the Appellant  whatever  the  family's  wishes  next
    time, and the second time repeating his threats. The Appellant's father
    reported [AH] to the police.

 4. Life nevertheless continued normally, until the Appellant met  a  young
    woman called [F], who later came to his house and told him  she  really
    liked him and would be happy to marry. However a few days she  came  to
    him, very upset, saying her parents had engaged her to marry  an  older
    man. They liked one another very much and spoke  at  length  over  this
    period over the telephone. She told the Appellant that if he did  marry
    her  she  would  inform  the  authorities  he  had  tried  to  begin  a
    relationship with her, which would cause  him  problems.  He  left  the
    family home with her and travelled to Kabul, with a view to leaving for
    Iran. They stayed with his cousin [I] in  Kabul,  who  was  willing  to
    accommodate the couple.

 5. On the third day of their stay, six policemen came to  the  house,  the
    Appellant believed accompanied by [F]'s  fiancï¿½,  [K].  They  took  him
    blindfolded to a mountain cave and beat him, and told them  they  could
    kill him as that was their orders. Three  days  later  some  armed  men
    passed, telling the Appellant they were Taliban. He told  them  he  was
    [AH]'s nephew; they recognised his uncle's name, and took him down from
    the mountain, to the home of [AH], who told him he  would  forgive  the
    Appellant if he began to work for him. However, a few  days  later,  he
    announced the Appellant would be required to be a  suicide  bomber.  He
    told his aunt of his plight, and she said she would help send him  away
    if he went with her sons to market the following day. He  escaped  from
    the sons and met a man that had a taxi, who took him to Kabul.  By  now
    he had learned that the security forces had come to his family home.

 6. He left Afghanistan. Attempts to trace his mother  failed.  He  learned
    his father had been arrested by the government.

 7. Before the Tribunal the Appellant supported his case via two documents,
    namely:

    (a)    A report from Police Security Zone Three of [  ]  2012,  stating
         that [GR] son of [GN] (i.e. the Appellant's  father)  had  reported
         [AH] (i.e. the Appellant's uncle) to attend their office;

    (b)    A report from the same office of [ ] 2013  requiring  [GR]  (the
         Appellant's father) to attend the police station as a result  of  a
         complaint from [AM] son of [AQ].

 8. The First-tier Tribunal heard live evidence from the Appellant, and  in
    a relatively concise decision, dismissed his appeal.  It  rejected  the
    Appellant's account as untrue, because

    (a)     The  Appellant  had  failed  to  give  dates  for  any  of  the
         significant events  he  said  had  befallen  him,  but  had  simply
         provided the number of months elapsing between events;

    (b)    This failing was despite the Appellant's  good  academic  record
         evinced via a High  School  certificate,  and  although  the  Judge
         accepted he  might  well  suffer  PTSD,  nevertheless  it  was  not
         credible that a person of his intellectual achievement would not be
         able to provide dates;

    (c)    The time line given by the Appellant were inconsistent with  the
         documents he produced, for example the summons for his  arrest  for
         his relationship with [F] was dated 12 August 2013  when  that  was
         only two days after the date  of  her  claimed  engagement  if  one
         calculated it in line with his estimate of  her  engagement  taking
         place six months before the Home Office interview;  a  copy  police
         report of his father's complaint about his uncle was dated [ ]  May
         2012 though the Appellant's own chronology from the spaces  between
         events taking place would put the event closer to August 2012;

    (d)    It was implausible that his uncle, were he  a  powerful  Taliban
         commander who repeatedly approached the Appellant  and  his  family
         over two months, would then simply let his interest lapse;

    (e)    It was odd that the Appellant would not tell his  parents  about
         his problems with [F] given he had disclosed his uncle's  overtures
         to him;

    (f)    It was simply implausible that the Appellant would, as  a  young
         man of just 15, steal money from his parents to travel to Iran with
         a young woman engaged to a much  older  man,  and  it  was  equally
         unlikely that his cousin would accommodate  them  in  circumstances
         where they were not engaged or married  and  the  relationship  was
         unknown to the family;

    (g)    It was inexplicable that the Appellant  would  be  detained  and
         then taken to a cave from  Kabul  if  these  were  members  of  the
         regular security forces or that he would be released by the Taliban
         in the circumstances he described, or that he would  tell  them  of
         his uncle's Taliban associations given his own history.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal then directed itself to the standard  of  proof
    and looked at the psychological report  from  the  Medical  Foundation,
    noting that he was a child when the incidents he described  took  place
    and that he met the criteria for  a  PTSD  diagnosis,  and  the  expert
    evidence from Dr Giustozzi which was also generally supportive  of  his
    case, but nevertheless rejected his claim in its entirety.

10. Having made this finding, the First-tier Tribunal rejected his claim to
    have lost touch with his family, as it did not accept his father was in
    custody, and found that his claim not to be in contact with his  mother
    or the maternal uncle who had aided his departure from Afghanistan  was
    not credible given he had other extended family members, including  the
    helpful cousin [I], living in Kabul, as well as three other siblings to
    whom he had referred at interview.

11. In  any  event,  Jalalabad  was  under  governmental  control  and  the
    Appellant could live there with  his  family,  or  in  Kabul  with  his
    extended   family,   without   facing    unduly    harsh    conditions,
    notwithstanding his PTSD. There were no very significant  obstacles  to
    his integration in Afghanistan given he would be  returning  to  family
    and friends.

12. Having regard to these conclusions, the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal.

13. The Appellant lodged grounds of appeal against that  decision,  arguing
    that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in

    (a)    Assessing credibility without regard to aspects of  the  medical
         evidence  from  Dr  Jennifer  Hall   (albeit   that   the   grounds
         acknowledged her report had been considered): she had noted that he
         had difficulties in placing events into a coherent  time  line  and
         that his reported history of multiple traumas was, in her  opinion,
         the more likely explanation for  his  mental  presentation  -  this
         failure was  akin  to  putting  "the  cart  before  the  horse"  as
         criticised in the authorities such as Virjon B  and  excluding  the
         medical evidence before coming to a conclusion on credibility;

    (b)    Failing to  give  adequate  reasons  for  findings  on  material
         matters, in particular the corroborative  documentary  evidence  by
         way of police reports.

14. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission  to  appeal  on  12
    September 2017, the Upper Tribunal granted permission, limited  to  the
    second ground, on 23 October 2017.

  Findings and reasons

15. I do not consider there was a material error of law in the reasoning of
    the First-tier Tribunal. It is unsurprising that the  first  ground  of
    appeal was refused permission. It is clear that  the  medical  evidence
    was considered in the course of the overall finding on credibility, and
    not reserved to an afterthought; there are references to  the  age  and
    mental health of the Appellant throughout the material reasoning.

16. The second ground complains  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  did  not
    receive a global assessment with the advantage of the documents said to
    emanate from the police considered for their  corroborative  value.  It
    seems to me that evidence that is particular to an  Appellant  in  this
    way does not require quite the same treatment as does material that  is
    ostensibly independent of them, such as medical  evidence  and  country
    expert reports.

17. Of course, it would be wrong to  decide  against  a  person's  veracity
    without having regard to evidence which  derives  from  an  expert  who
    understands their duty to the Tribunal. But the Tribunal has no way  of
    knowing whether documents from the country of  origin  are  genuine  or
    not. The governing authority is of course Tanveer  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT
    00439, which essentially holds that material of this nature essentially
    stands and fall with the assessment of the evidence as a whole.

18. Accordingly, where the claim is itself vague and inherently incredible,
    it is unlikely that evidence produced by the Appellant will be decisive
    in persuading a  Judge  that  their  evidence  is  nevertheless  to  be
    believed. Doubtless there will be cases where the weight and cogency of
    documentary evidence  may  be  persuasive,  even  though  there  is  no
    corroborative  evidence  extrinsic  to  the  documents  themselves  and
    notwithstanding  that  the  Appellant's  account   may   contain   some
    difficulties; but whether this arises in any particular  case  is  very
    much down to the decision maker in the individual case.

19. The Appellant's assault on the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  this
    ground is essentially a "reasons" challenge. As noted by Beatson LJ  in
    Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 ï¿½35, 37:

         "What is required is that the reasons must give  sufficient  detail
         to show the parties and the appellate tribunal or  reviewing  court
         the principles upon which the lower tribunal  has  acted,  and  the
         reasons that led it to its decision,  so  that  they  are  able  to
         understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons  need  not  be
         elaborate, and need not deal with every argument presented ...

         ... judicial restraint should be exercised when the reasons that  a
         tribunal gives for its decision are being examined  and  it  should
         not be assumed too readily that  the  tribunal  misdirected  itself
         because not every step in its reasoning is set out in it".

20. This is accordingly an  appeal  where  the  enjoinder  in  Piglowska  v
    Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360 (endorsed in the immigration context in  EA
    [2017] EWCA Civ 10 ï¿½27) is relevant: "reasons should  be  read  on  the
    assumption that, unless he has demonstrated  the  contrary,  the  judge
    knew how he should perform his functions and which  matters  he  should
    take into account ... [an] appellate court should resist the temptation
    to subvert the principle that they  should  not  substitute  their  own
    discretion for that of the judge by a  narrow  textual  analysis  which
    enables them to claim that he misdirected himself".

21.  I  do  not  think  the  Judge  here  was  blind  to  the   potentially
    corroborative value of the documents or where the documents in question
    were overlooked. At  paragraph  24  of  its  decision,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal expressly relies on one of two  documents  for  its  reasoning
    that the time line  put  forward  by  the  Appellant  in  his  evidence
    generally is inconsistent with the documentary evidence he put forward.
    In these circumstances, it is very difficult  to  see  that  addressing
    those documents in greater detail would  have  had  made  any  material
    difference to the thinking of the First-tier Tribunal; the contents  of
    the document that was expressly cited in fact  detracted  from,  rather
    than enhanced, the Appellant's credibility.

22. I accordingly find there was no material error of law in the  reasoning
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
