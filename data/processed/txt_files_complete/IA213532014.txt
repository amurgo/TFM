                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is referred as the  Secretary  of  State
    and the Respondent is referred as the claimant.

2.   The claimant, a national of India,  date  of  birth  11  October  1978,
    appealed against the Secretary of  State's  decision,  dated  25  April
    2014, to make removal directions of an  illegal  entrant  as  a  person
    subject to administrative removal under Section 10 of  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.  A form IS151A had been served on 10 March 2006.

3.   The appeal was heard  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  S  Law  (the
    judge)  who,  on  27  November  2014,  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and also under Article 8 of the ECHR.

4.   The Secretary of State was given permission  to  appeal  by  Designated
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Woodcraft on 15 January 2015.

5.   The Secretary of State's arguments on the error  of  law  can  with  no
    disrespect to them be put fairly shortly.    First, the judge had taken
    into account erroneous considerations  in  relation  to  the  issue  of
    maintenance pertinent to  the  date  of  application  or  the  date  of
    decision in what was a clear example  of  a  misunderstanding  of  that
    issue. Secondly, the judge had failed to  provide  proper  reasons  for
    being satisfied that the Claimant fell to be considered under paragraph
    EX1 of the Rules. Thirdly, the judge had failed  to  adequately  reason
    the conclusion that the Claimant succeeded on the Article 8 ECHR claim.

9.   Mr Barnfield correctly accepted, as he must do, that the judge did  not
    properly assess the issues and  took  into  account  matters  which  he
    should not have done.  However it was said  that  in  relation  to  the
    second matter of complaint the reality was  that  the  judge  had  done
    enough to show that he had not solely concentrated on the issues of the
    nationality (British) of the Claimant's wife and recently born child.

10.  Mr Mills argued that in fact, apart from the analysis in  paragraph  18
    of the decision which plainly  was  addressing  the  issue  of  British
    citizenship, there has been a failure to look  at  the  matter  in  the
    round and to give  a  proper  reasoned  argument  for  concluding  that
    Article 8 ECHR rights were engaged.

11.  I agree with Mr Mills that  the  reasoning  falls  significantly  below
    that to be expected of an experienced Immigration Judge but also really
    does not tell the Secretary of State what were the considerations  that
    justified the conclusions that the appeal  succeeded  under  Article  8
    ECHR.

12.  In these circumstances it seems to me that these  three  points  raised
    by the Secretary of State disclosed material errors of law.

13.  It  is  unfortunate  that  aspects  of  the  determination  simply  are
    unconnected as demonstrated in paragraph 20. In those circumstances  it
    is unfortunate that the Claimant should find himself  the  position  of
    having this matter to be reconsidered all over again.

 14.   The Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand. The decision  must  be
    re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.
