                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The  Appellant,  a  national  of  Nepal,  appealed  against  the  ECO's
    decision, dated 27 June 2013 to refuse  entry  clearance  as  an  adult
    dependent relative of an ex-Ghurkha.  The refusal of 10 April 2008  was
    made on the basis that the Appellant did not meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 317 of the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  the  ECO  was  not
    satisfied the Appellant was living alone outside the United Kingdom  in
    the  most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  and  was   mainly
    dependent financially on relatives settled in the United Kingdom.

2.   The Appellant submitted an application on 18 June 2013 and refusal  was
    made  with  reference  to  the  Secretary  of  State's   policies   for
    dependants.  The ECO decided that the Appellant had  not  met  all  the
    requirements of paragraph EC-DR.1.1 of Appendix FM of  the  immigration
    rules.

3.   An appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Napthine  who,  on  7
    November 2014, dismissed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    under Article 8 ECHR.

4.   Permission to appeal the  judge's  decision  was  given  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Levin on 7 January 2015.

5.   At the hearing before me it was accepted by Mr Mills that a  number  of
    issues, including an assessment of the evidence, which was relevant  to
    the issues of entry to the United Kingdom, had not been considered.  He
    and Miss Walker therefore invited me to accept that the judge had  made
    a number of errors of law and that the only course was for  the  matter
    to be remade.

6.   Having considered the grounds and the parties' remarks, I am  satisfied
    that the judge's decision disclosed  a  number  of  errors  of  law  in
    failing to address evidence that had been adduced, failing to  properly
    assess whether Article 8 was engaged, and whether or not the  Appellant
    was entitled to come to the United Kingdom based upon re-establishing a
    family life with his Sponsor father.

7.   Accordingly, I accept that the Original Tribunal decision cannot  stand
    and the matter will have to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions

    (1)  Relist for hearing before any judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         other than Immigration Judge Napthine.

    (2)  Time estimate 1ï¿½ hours.

    (3)  No interpreter required.

    (4)  No findings of fact to stand.

    (5)  The issue to be determined is whether the Appellant has a claim to
         enter the United Kingdom based on Article 8  ECHR  outside  of  the
         Rules.

    (6)  Please relist with reference to Miss Walker's availability.
