Representation:
Appellant   Not represented
Respondent  Miss Fijiwala (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria and is now thirty-nine  years  of
    age. He applied on September 14, 2009 for entry clearance as a  student
    and entered the United Kingdom on September 27, 2009 with  leave  valid
    until November 30, 2010. At the time he applied for entry clearance  he
    made no mention of the fact he had married in Nigeria on September  19,
    2009. On  September  5,  2013  he  applied  for  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of his right to reside as a family member  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The respondent refused this  application  on  March  13,  2014
    because she was not satisfied he  was  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national or that the marriage was genuine and subsisting.

 2. The appellant appealed that decision on March 20,  2014  under  section
    82(1)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002   and
    Regulation 26 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006.

 3. The case was initially listed as a paper case before Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Place on May 6, 2014. The judge was unaware that a bundle
    of documents had been submitted on the appellant's behalf on  April  8,
    2014 and his decision to dismiss the appeal was ultimately set aside by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Lindley on July 16, 2014 who  directed  the
    matter be listed in the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing  on  November
    4, 2014. On October 10, 2014 the appellant's solicitors  wrote  to  the
    Tribunal and invited the Tribunal to deal with the appeal on the papers
    and the November 4, 2014 hearing date was vacated and  the  appeal  was
    then listed before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colvin on  December
    10, 2014. He decided  there  should  be  an  oral  hearing  and  issued
    directions.

 4. When the matter came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Colvin
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") he noted the case  history  but
    proceeded to deal with the appeal on  the  papers  applying  Regulation
    25(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber) Rules 20140. He dismissed the appellant's appeal  in  a
    determination promulgated on February 24, 2015.

 5. The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  March  3,  2015
    submitting the FtTJ had erred because:

      a. The respondent's decision breached his rights as a family member.

      b. The First-tier Tribunal made an error in law.

      c. It was in the interests of justice  for  the  decision  to  be  set
         aside.

 6. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Levin gave  permission  to  appeal  on
    April 25, 2015 stating that it was arguable  by  not  holding  an  oral
    hearing there was a procedural irregularity. The matter came before  me
    on the above date and the appellant was not present. His solicitors had
    sent a letter on June 30, 2015 inviting the Tribunal to deal  with  the
    appeal on the papers.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to make an order now.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 8. Miss Fijiwala relied on the Rule 24 response dated  May  11,  2015  and
    submitted there was no procedural  irregularity.  Whilst  a  Judge  had
    directed the case be listed for an oral hearing neither  the  appellant
    nor his solicitors had raised the lack of such a hearing as  an  issue.
    In fact, it remained, even today,  the  appellant's  position  that  he
    wished for his appeal  to  be  dealt  with  on  the  papers.  The  FtTJ
    considered the appropriate Regulations and gave  reasons  why  he  felt
    able to deal with it on the papers and there was no error.

    FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 9. The appellant's grounds of appeal do not identify where the FtTJ  erred
    because they are generalised. Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Levin
    made no findings on the grounds but found there may be an error because
    the FtTJ failed to hold an oral hearing. The FtTJ considered all of the
    evidence and found the respondent's concerns were properly made and the
    appellant had failed to address them. He also noted that there had been
    no request at any stage for an oral hearing and he was  satisfied  that
    he could deal with the appeal on the facts and papers before him.

10. The earlier decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colvin did not
    bind the FtTJ in circumstances where he considered the case history and
    gave reasons for why he dealt with the case in the manner he did. I  am
    satisfied there was no material procedural error and there  is  nothing
    in the actual grounds of appeal that raises any other error.

    DECISION

11. There was no material error. I dismiss the appeal
