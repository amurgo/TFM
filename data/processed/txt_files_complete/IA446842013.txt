                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a determination of Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal McIntosh promulgated on 8th July 2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a Vietnamese  national  born  1st  November  1990.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 10th April 2012 with leave as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student valid until 30th August 2013.  On 29th August 2013 he
    applied for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  Student.   His
    application was refused on 11th October 2013, the  Respondent  refusing
    to vary leave, and deciding to remove the  Appellant  from  the  United
    Kingdom.

 4. The application was refused with reference to paragraph 245ZX(d) of the
    Immigration Rules with reference to paragraphs 1A and 11 of Appendix C.



 5. The Secretary of State did not accept that the Claimant was entitled to
    be awarded a minimum of 10 points under paragraphs 10 to 14 of Appendix
    C because in order to satisfy the maintenance (funds)  requirement  the
    Claimant needed to show that he had funds of �2,000 for  a  consecutive
    28 day period of time.  The Secretary of State calculated that the date
    of the closing balance on the Claimant's bank statement was 14th August
    2013 and therefore he needed to show evidence of �2,000 being available
    in his account for 28 days between 18th July 2013 and 14th August 2013.
     Between 6th and 8th August 2013 the Claimant's bank  statement  showed
    that he was in possession of no more than �1,572.57.   The  application
    was therefore refused under the Immigration Rules.

 6. The Claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   It  was  contended,
    wrongly, that the Secretary  of  State  was  not  entitled  to  make  a
    combined decision to refuse to vary leave and remove at the same  time.
    The decision was made on 11th October 2013, and section 51 of the Crime
    and Courts Act 2013 made it lawful for two decisions to be made at  the
    same time and to be served in  the  same  document,  with  effect  from
    8th May 2013.

 7. The Claimant contended that he had  sufficient  funds  to  satisfy  the
    financial requirements, and explained that the amount  in  his  account
    fell below the sum of �2,000 because he loaned �700 to a  friend  which
    caused the amount in his account to be less than �2,000 between 6th and
    8th August 2013.   It  was  pointed  out  that  the  Claimant  had  the
    equivalent of in excess of �25,000 in a savings account in Vietnam, and
    also had financial support from his mother.

 8. The appeal was heard by Judge McIntosh (the judge) on 20th  June  2014.
    The judge accepted submissions made by Ms Malhotra  that  the  relevant
    period for which the sum of �2,000 needed to be held, was  between  2nd
    July 2013 and  1st  August  2013.   This  was  because  the  Claimant's
    application was dated 29th August 2013 and  the  appropriate  procedure
    was to count back 28 days from that date, which would give  1st  August
    2013, and then count back a further 28 days which  gave  an  accounting
    period between 2nd July 2013 and 1st August 2013.  In that  period  the
    Claimant had in excess of �2,000 and on that basis the judge found that
    he satisfied the Immigration Rules and allowed the appeal.

 9. Article  8  of  the  1950  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  was
    apparently raised at  the  hearing  on  the  basis  that  it  would  be
    proportionate to allow the Claimant to continue with his education, but
    the judge made no finding on this, having allowed the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, contending in summary that the judge had erred in considering
    the maintenance requirements and had failed to consider paragraph 1A(h)
    of Appendix C. This stipulates that the end date of the 28  day  period
    in which the funds must be  available,  is  the  date  of  the  closing
    balance on the most recent of the specified  documents  submitted  with
    the application, which must be no earlier than 31 days before the  date
    of application.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman.

12. Following the grant of permission there was  no  response  pursuant  to
    rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

13. The Tribunal issued directions that there should  be  an  oral  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether the determination of the
    First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

14. In contending that  the  judge  materially  erred  in  considering  the
    maintenance requirements of Appendix  C  Mr  Bramble  relied  upon  the
    grounds contained within the application for permission to appeal.

15. Ms Malhotra contended that the judge's finding that the relevant period
    for which the Appellant needed to show that he had available the sum of
    �2,000, was 2nd July 2013 until 1st August 2013, and the judge did  not
    err on this issue.

16. In my view the judge erred in law and I set aside the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, for the following reasons.

17. The judge did not correctly consider Appendix C, paragraph 1A(c)  which
    confirms that the funds must be held for a consecutive 28 day period of
    time, and 1A(h) which confirms that the end of the 28 day  period  will
    be taken as the date of the closing balance on the most recent  of  the
    specified documents,  (where  specified  documents  from  two  or  more
    accounts are submitted, this will be the end date for the account  that
    most favours the applicant) and must be no earlier than 31 days  before
    the date of application.

18. In this case the  date  of  application  was  29th  August  2013.   The
    specified document submitted to prove the availability of funds  was  a
    Lloyds TSB Bank statement.  It seemed that  the  date  of  the  closing
    balance was 9th August 2013, although the statement  had  been  stamped
    14th August 2013.  It does  in  fact  appear  that  there  are  further
    entries after 9th August 2013 on page  5  of  the  statement,  and  the
    closing balance is in fact 14th August 2013.

19. Therefore the Claimant  needed  to  show  that  he  had  �2,000  for  a
    consecutive 28 day period ending on 14th August  2013.   It  is  common
    ground that between 6th and 8th August 2013 there was less than �2,000
    in the bank account, and therefore the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules were not satisfied.  This would have been the same result, if the
    closing balance was on  9th  August  2013.   The  judge  was  wrong  to
    conclude that the Claimant  needed  to  demonstrate  a  sum  of  �2,000
    between 2nd July 2013 and 1st August 2013.

20. Having  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  both
    representatives indicated that they were in a position  to  proceed  so
    that the decision could be re-made.

Re-Making the Decision

21. I ascertained that I had  all  documentation  upon  which  the  parties
    intended to rely.  I had the Secretary of State's bundle with Annexes A-
    D, and the Claimant's bundle comprising 62 pages.

22. Ms Malhotra indicated that she did not intend to call further evidence,
    and would not make further submissions in relation to  the  Immigration
    Rules in view of my finding that the relevant period in which a sum  of
    �2,000 had to be available, was the 28 day period  ending  14th  August
    2013, as it was accepted that the amount in the Claimant's bank account
    fell below this between 6th  and  8th  August  2013.   In  relation  to
    Article 8 I was told that there was no family life claim, and  that  it
    was conceded that the Claimant could not succeed with  a  private  life
    claim under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  I  was  however
    asked to find that the Claimant had established a private life  in  the
    United Kingdom, and that it would be disproportionate  to  remove  him,
    which would mean that he could not carry on with his education.

23. Mr Bramble relied upon the Secretary of  State's  decision  dated  11th
    October 2013.  I was asked to conclude that the application  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration  Rules,  and  should  be  dismissed  with
    reference to Article 8 and reliance was placed upon  Patel  and  Others
    [2013] UKSC 72.

24. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

25. The burden of proof in relation to the  Immigration  Rules  is  on  the
    Claimant and the standard is a balance of probability.

26. I find that  the  Claimant  cannot  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules because he was unable  to  demonstrate  that  he  had
    available the sum of �2,000 for a consecutive 28 day period ending 14th
    August 2013 as the amount in his  bank  account  fell  below  that  sum
    between 6th-8th August 2013.

27. In relation to Article 8 my starting point has to be  consideration  of
    the rules.  As there is no  family  life  claim  I  need  not  consider
    Appendix FM.

28. It is conceded on  behalf  of  the  Claimant  that  he  cannot  satisfy
    paragraph 276ADE.  I note that the Claimant only  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 10th April 2012.

29. I then have to decide whether it is appropriate to consider  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.  Guidance on this was given by the Court
    of Appeal in MM Lebanon [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  and  I  set  out  below
    paragraph 135;

         Where the relevant group of IRs, upon  their  proper  construction,
         provide a "complete code" for dealing with  a  person's  Convention
         rights in the context of a particular IR  or  statutory  provision,
         such as in the case of  "foreign  criminals",  then  the  balancing
         exercise and the way the various  factors  are  to  be  taken  into
         account in an individual case must be done in accordance with  that
         code, although references to  "exceptional  circumstances"  in  the
         code will nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But  if
         the relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete  code"  then  the
         proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by  the
         Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.

30. In my view paragraph 276ADE is not a complete code, and there should be
    a proportionality test carried out.  I therefore  decided  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the rules and I have approached this by adopting  the
    five stage approach advocated in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.   I  find  that
    Article 8 is engaged in respect of the Claimant's private life, and  in
    making this decision I take into account AG (Eritrea) [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    801, paragraph 28, in which it was found  that  while  an  interference
    with private or family life must be real if it  is  to  engage  Article
    8(1), the threshold of engagement is not a specially high one.

31. I find that the proposed interference with the Claimant's private  life
    is in accordance with the law, as he cannot satisfy the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules.  I also find that the proposed  interference  is
    necessary  in  the  interests  of  maintaining  effective   immigration
    control.   I  have  to  decide  whether   the   proposed   removal   is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.

32. In considering proportionality I take into account section 117B of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  which  confirms  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control is in the public interest.



33. The Claimant's private life claim is based upon his  wish  to  continue
    his education in the United Kingdom.  In considering this I  take  into
    account Miah v SSHD [2013] QB 35, in which it was confirmed that  there
    is no near miss principle when considering Article 8.

34. I attach  significant  weight  to  the  importance  of  satisfying  the
    Immigration Rules.  I have taken into  account  all  of  the  evidence
    submitted on behalf of the  Claimant  and  in  particular  his  witness
    statement in which he explains why the funds in his account fell  below
    �2,000, and in which he explains  that  his  mother  is  his  financial
    Sponsor.

35. The issue I have to decide is whether it is proportionate to  disregard
    the financial requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,  and  allow  the
    Claimant to continue his education in the  United  Kingdom  by  finding
    that his removal would be a  disproportionate  breach  of  his  private
    life, under Article 8.  I find that it is not appropriate to  disregard
    the Immigration Rules, and I do  not  find  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to be disproportionate,  and  therefore  it  does  not  breach
    Article 8.  It is open to the Claimant to make a fresh application  and
    while this may cause him some difficulty, it does  not  mean  that  the
    decision is disproportionate.  I set out below paragraph 57 of Patel;

         57   It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right.  The merits of a decision not to depart from  the
             rules are not reviewable on appeal: section  86(6).   One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for "common sense"
             in the application of the rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying in the UK for some years (see  paragraph  47  above).
             However, such considerations  do  not  by  themselves  provide
             grounds of appeal under Article 8,  which  is  concerned  with
             private  or  family  life,  not  education   as   such.    The
             opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
             this country, however desirable in general terms,  is  not  in
             itself a right protected under Article 8.

36. I have sympathy for the Claimant, but I am afraid that the Secretary of
    State decision is in accordance with the law and Immigration Rules, and
    does not breach Article 8 of the  1950  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.  Therefore the Claimant's appeal must be dismissed.
