                    Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms M Cleghorn (Instructed by Paragon Law)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Respondent,  with
    permission, against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ennals promulgated on 10th September  2014  by  which  he  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  refuse
    her leave to remain in the UK as a spouse and to remove her to the USA.

2.   For the purposes of continuity I shall refer in this  determination  to
    the Secretary  of  State  as  the  Respondent  and  Mrs  Beard  as  the
    Appellant.

3.   The Secretary of State's grounds argue that the Judge  failed  to  give
    reasons or adequate reasons for findings on  material  matters.  It  is
    submitted by the Secretary of State that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  its
    approach to Article 8. The Appellant entered the UK  as  a  visitor  in
    September 2013 with her leave expiring in  March  2014.  Prior  to  the
    expiry of her leave she applied for leave to remain as the spouse of  a
    British citizen. The grounds refer to MF (Nigeria)[2013] EWCA Civ  1192
    which it is said confirms that the Immigration  Rules  are  a  complete
    code and form the starting point for the decision maker.  In  that  the
    grounds are wrong as the Immigration Rules are a complete code only  in
    deportation cases; that is what MF says.

4.   The grounds the go on to refer to Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -
    correct approach) [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)   arguing  that  that  case
    states that an Article 8 assessment should only be  carried  out  under
    the ECHR when there are compelling circumstances, not recognised by the
    Rules. In this case, it is submitted, the Tribunal did not identify any
    such  compelling  circumstances  and   therefore   its   findings   are
    unsustainable. In that regard the Secretary of State also relies on the
    case of Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).

5.   The grounds point out that the Appellant and her husband entered  their
    relationship in full knowledge of the Appellant's  immigration  status.
    They could return to the USA to apply for the correct  entry  clearance
    and if the Appellant's husband  chose  not  to  return  with  her,  any
    separation would be short. The  relationship  could  be  maintained  by
    modern means of communication. It was also submitted that the Appellant
    spent her youth and formative years in the USA and  was  not  estranged
    from the USA's culture.

6.   Before me Miss Johnstone relied upon the grounds  which  she  indicated
    were self-explanatory.

7.   In reading  of  the  determination  in  this  case  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal it is clear from paragraph 12 that the only reason for refusal
    was the Appellant's presence in the UK as a visitor.

8.   It is clear that  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Home  Office
    Presenting  Officer  made  no  submissions,  simply  relying  upon  the
    Refusal.  The  Appellant's  representative  made  submissions  on   the
    proportionality of requiring the Appellant to return to the USA to make
    an out of country application which on the basis of the evidence  would
    succeed. That submission was not challenged. The Judge also  noted  the
    submission based on material from the Appellant's pharmacist  that  she
    had fragile mental health and a disturbed background such that, it  was
    submitted, not only would there be the stress and distress caused by  a
    potentially lengthy absence from her husband, since she had been in the
    UK visiting her mother in the USA, with whom she had lived,  had  given
    up her own home and so she had neither home nor  employment  to  return
    to.

9.   The judge then goes  on  to  note  that  the  Appellant's  husband  had
    researched the possibility of his obtaining employment in the field  he
    was  experienced  in,  in  the  USA  but  that  his  lack   of   formal
    qualifications were an insurmountable bar to this. The Judge also  note
    that there is of course no guarantee that in  any  event  he  would  be
    granted a visa and work permit by the US authorities.

10.  The Judge accepted the basic facts of the case which were  unchallenged
    in any event. The couple had met over the Internet in 2009. The husband
    travelled to the US and met the applicant in March 2010 and then  again
    visited in September 2010, the summer of 2011, in 2012  and  2013.  The
    couple then returned to  the  UK  with  the  Appellant  entering  as  a
    visitor. They then travelled together to Europe in August 2013  and  in
    October 2013 became engaged and married in December 2013 in the UK.

11.  The Judge accepted evidence that the husband is employed in  the  field
    of vehicle recovery earning in excess of ï¿½18,600 per annum.  He  is  56
    years of age and has a good relationship with his sons who live locally
    and hopes and expects to be a grandfather before long. The Judge  noted
    at paragraph 16 that he could see  that  all  of  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM were met save for the requirement that the  application  be
    made from the USA. He noted that the Appellant had not waited until she
    was an overstayer before making her application.

12.  At paragraph 18 the Judge indicates that he considered the issues  very
    carefully. It was common ground that the Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    Rules by reason of her presence in the UK. He noted that  the  argument
    that  he  should  not  require  her  to   return   as   it   would   be
    disproportionate  and  unreasonable  took  the  case  outside  of   the
    Immigration Rules. The Judge found that taking into account her  health
    and troubled background and the lack of a home or employment in the USA
    as well as the husband's likely inability to find work there, this  was
    a case where he should consider Article 8 under the  ECHR  outside  the
    rules in accordance with the principles set out in Gulshan.

13.  At paragraph 19 he found that there was a well established family  life
    between this married couple which requiring  the  Appellant  to  return
    would disrupt. There was no guarantee that the husband would be granted
    a visa to accompany her and from the information provided to him in the
    Appellant's bundle concerning the US Immigration Rules it  appeared  to
    be highly unlikely that a settlement visa would be granted  to  him  as
    the Appellant would have insufficient income to meet the requirements.

14.  At paragraph 20 the Judge found  that  there  would  be  a  significant
    disruption to the family life of the Appellant and her husband and then
    considered whether that  disruption  is  justified  as  reasonable  and
    proportionate in balancing the  interests  of  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband against the public interest in maintaining immigration control.
    He accepted that the Secretary of State is entitled to  require  people
    to comply with the Rules in order to maintain immigration  control  but
    he  considered  that  in  this  case  Chikwamba   [2008]   UKHL40   had
    applicability and that the severity of the disruption for  the  reasons
    he gave made a requirement  for  her  to  return  purely  to  make  the
    application disproportionate and unreasonable.

15.  In so far as the Judge's reasoning is concerned I can discern no  error
    of law. He has explained why he has  strayed  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules and considered Article 8 under the ECHR and he  has  specifically
    referred to Gulshan. The grounds therefore do not have merit. The  only
    thing that the Judge has not done which he ought to have done was  have
    regard to section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 as inserted by section 19 of the Immigration  Act  2014.  However,
    nothing in that would have  altered  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  and
    accordingly I uphold  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    dismiss the Respondent's appeal.

16.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
