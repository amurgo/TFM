                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Morris promulgated on the 28th  April  2017.   In  that
      decision, Judge Morris  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  Human
      Rights grounds  having  found  that  there  were  not  "insurmountable
      obstacles" for the purposes of paragraph EX.1  and  EX.2  which  would
      prevent the Appellant and his wife returning to Pakistan.

   2. Although permission to appeal  was  initially  refused  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly on the 19th June 2018,  on  the  basis  that  the
      application was out of time, permission to appeal was then granted  by
      Upper Tribunal Judge King on the 11th October 2018, who noted that the
      grounds were out of time, but  the  grounds  were  said  to  raise  an
      important issue of whether the Appellant's claim was one which met the
      Immigration Rules under the partner route. It was said that Judge King
      had found that the hearing had proceeded on  the  basis  of  paragraph
      276ADE and the findings as to insurmountable obstacles were well made,
      but only arose for consideration if the requirements of  paragraph  R-
      LTRPT1.1 of Appendix FM were not met and it  was  arguable  that  they
      were met such as to render  refusal  disproportionate.  Permission  to
      appeal was granted.

   3. It is clear in this  case  that  all  parties  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the transitional  provisions  did
      not apply and that the  appeal  was  considered  under  the  new  more
      limited grounds of appeal, rather than  the  appeal  being  considered
      under the old Immigration Rules.  Mr Tan on behalf of the Home  Office
      conceded that there was a material error and he did not seek to oppose
      any of the grounds put forward  by  the  Appellant.  It  is  therefore
      clearly in the interests of justice pursuant  to  Rule  21(7)  of  the
      Upper Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  2008,  for  the  application  to  be
      admitted, even though out of time.

   4. Within the Grounds of Appeal, it was argued that this case was  caught
      by the transitional provisions of the 2002 Act and was not a new Human
      Rights appeal but rather an old style  Immigration  Rules  appeal  and
      that in fact the Judge needed to consider the  Appellant's  compliance
      with the old Immigration Rule 287.  It was  further  argued  that  the
      relevant  transitional  provisions  in  the  Immigration  Rules   also
      applied, such that the entitlement  at  stake  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal was that of Indefinite Leave to Remain.  It  is  argued  that
      the issues in the refusal letter were recorded by the Judge  as  being
      conceded by the Secretary of State and  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
      ought to have been successful had the correct immigration  rule  being
      applied.  Within the Grounds of Appeal dated the 10th June 2018, it is
      argued that  pursuant  to  Article  9  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014
      (Commencement Number 3 Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order  2014
      (SI2014/2771)  that  the  same  provisions  continue  to  have  effect
      notwithstanding  the  commencement  of  the  new  relevant  provisions
      insofar as they relate to decisions of the Secretary of State made  on
      or after the 6th April 2015 to refuse an application made  before  the
      6th April 2015, where that decision is either  a  decision  to  refuse
      leave to enter, to refuse entry clearance,  to  refuse  a  significant
      entitlement under Section 10 of the 2002 Act or to refuse  to  vary  a
      person's leave to enter  or  remain  and  where  the  result  of  that
      decision is that a person has no leave to enter or remain, unless that
      decision is also refusal of an  asylum,  protection  or  Human  Rights
      claim or a decision made before the 6th  April  2015  in  relation  to
      which before the 6th April 2015, an appeal could have been brought  or
      was pending under the saved provisions.

   5. It is argued that the current application in the present case was made
      on the 1st April 2015 and was therefore  caught  by  the  transitional
      provisions under Article 9(c) of the Commencement Order and  that  the
      Tribunal's jurisdiction was therefore not limited to  a  Human  Rights
      appeal but rather centred on  all  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  the
      Tribunal had to consider under the version  of  Section  82  in  force
      prior to the 6th April  2015.   It  is  argued  the  Judge  failed  to
      directly apply the relevant Immigration Rules to the Appellant's case.

   6. It was further argued that the Appellant entered the UK in  2009  with
      valid Leave to Remain as a fiancï¿½e and was  subsequently  extended  in
      early 2010 by way of grant of Leave to Remain as a spouse.  It is said
      the Appellant therefore obtained his leave under the  old  Immigration
      Rules rather than those set out in Appendix FM and that the  Appellant
      therefore should have benefitted from the transitional provisions  set
      out in Immigration Rule A280(c) in respect of which the provisions  of
      Part A continue to apply on or after the 9th July 2012 to applications
      made by persons in the UK who have been  granted  entry  clearance  or
      limited leave to enter or remain under Part A before the 9th July 2012
      where there  was  a  requirement  of  Part  A  and  where  this  is  a
      requirement of Part A, leave to enter or limited leave  to  remain  is
      extant.  It is said the Appellant's appeal failed to be considered  as
      against the relevant requirements of  the  Immigration  Rule  2A7  and
      therefore there  was  never  any  place  for  consideration  of  "very
      significant obstacles" in the Appellant's case.

   7. It is further argued by the Appellant that had the  Appellant's  claim
      being  properly  looked  at  under  Immigration  Rule  287   and   the
      transitional provisions properly applied, then in circumstances  where
      at  the  Tribunal  the  Secretary  of  State  had  conceded  that  the
      Appellant's "spent" convictions did not need to  be  declared  on  the
      application form and that the Appellant and his wife were in a genuine
      and subsisting relationship and the  only  issue  in  the  appeal  was
      whether  there  were   "insurmountable   obstacles",   that   as   the
      "insurmountable obstacles" was not  relevant  given  the  transitional
      provisions, and the only reasons relied upon were not  being  pursued,
      that the appeal ought  simply  to  be  allowed  and  a  decision  made
      allowing the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  such  that  the
      Appellant would be entitled to Indefinite Leave to Remain.

   8. I note from paragraph 8 of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge that although another reason for the  refusal  was  put  on  the
      basis that the Appellant had not passed an English test at  a  minimum
      level of B1, that the Judge had noted the relevant  certificate  dated
      the 13th October 2016 issued by Trinity College, London confirmed  the
      Appellant had achieved the standard and was produced at  the  hearing,
      and that at the hearing it was noted by the Judge that it  was  argued
      by the Secretary of State that the only issue was whether or not there
      were insurmountable obstacles, such that  the  Judge  found  that  the
      reason regarding the English language test was not  being  pursued  by
      the Secretary of State.  Indeed Mr Tan confirmed  before  me  that  in
      fact the argument regarding the English language test was not  pursued
      at the First-tier.

   9. At the appeal hearing Mr Tan quite properly conceded that there was  a
      material error in this case,  given  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
      properly apply the transitional provisions of  the  Appellant  or  any
      route to a settlement prior to 2012.  He did not  oppose  any  of  the
      grounds of appeal and accepted that it was  pointless  to  pursue  the
      appeal further and agreed that the decision  did  involve  a  material
      error of law by the Judge looking at  "insurmountable  obstacles"  and
      considering it as a Human Rights appeal rather than  an  appeal  under
      the old Immigration Rules. He  conceded  that  the  appeal  should  be
      allowed outright under the Immigration Rules.

  10. I therefore do find following these concessions that the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Morris does contain a material error of  law
      and is set aside.  In light of the  concession  further  made  by  the
      Secretary of State, I find  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  is  to  be
      allowed under the Immigration Rules, the requirements of  those  rules
      having now agreed to have been met.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Morris  does  contain  a  material
error of law and is set aside.

I allow the Appellant's appeal under the old Immigration  Rules  which  were
applicable to his appeal, such that  the  Appellant  would  be  entitled  to
Indefinite Leave to Remain.

Signed
