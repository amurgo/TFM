                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a Kurdish Iraqi national who lived in Mosul. He said
      he was born in October 1990 and is single. He is of the Sunni branch
      of Islam.


   2.  His appeal against the refusal of his protection claim was heard by
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal NMK Lawrence. It was dismissed in a
      decision promulgated on 18 April 2017. His claim was that he fled
      because Isis wanted him to fight for them. The judge referred to
      inconsistencies in his account and concluded the index events
      described were a fiction, concocted for the purposes of seeking
      asylum.

   3. At paragraph 15 the judge referred to AA Iraq [2015 ]UK UT 544 and
      the Court of Appeal's comments in AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944) and
      concluded he could be removed to Baghdad city. The judge did not
      accept the appellant's claim he was not in contact with his family
      and concluded this was a lie in order to prevent his return. The
      judge found he is able to contact his parents and siblings in Mosul
      for assistance in securing the necessary CS ID document. The
      appellant could grant power of attorney to someone in Iraq to obtain
      documentation. The judge referred to the comments in AA Iraq [2015]
      UK UT 544 at para 177 of the difficulties in obtaining SSID from a
      contested area but made the point that the appellant could obtain the
      documentation before travelling. The judge found that having a CS ID
      the appellant could then obtain a passport or alternatively, a
      laissez passï¿½.

   4. The judge concluded it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to
      relocate to Baghdad city. On removal he would be provided with funds.
      This would help whilst he established himself there. There was no
      evidence he was confirmed in body or mind. The judge concluded he
      would not face destitution. The judge referred to the decision of BA(
      returns to Baghdad) Iraq CG [2017] UKUT 18 where it was stated at
      paragraph 118 that the incidence of targeted violence against Sunnis
      did not create a real risk on return.

   5. In the alternative, the judge found that the appellant could travel
      to his home area in Mosul. There were no factors peculiar to him
      which would place him at risk.

The Upper Tribunal

   6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge erred in concluding the appellant could return to Mosul and had
      not considered whether it would be unreasonable or unduly harsh for
      him to relocate to Baghdad.


   7. At hearing I was provided with a skeleton argument on behalf of the
      appellant. The skeleton argument confirms that no challenge is being
      made to the judge's adverse credibility finding. Ms Wilkins submitted
      that the judge had not applied AA Iraq [2015] UK UT 544 correctly.
      There was no evidence that the appellant spoke Arabic. She submitted
      that there was no means of access for the appellant to the IKR.

   8. The presenting officer pointed out that the refusal letter raised
      relocation not only to Baghdad but also to the IKR.He accepted it was
      arguably an error to suggest the appellant could return to Mosul on
      the country guidance decision. However, the situation was fluid with
      the latest information being of Iraqi forces establishing their
      presence in Mosul. In any event, he submitted the appellant could
      relocate to Baghdad and start to make his life there. He submitted
      that within Iraq many had been displaced but they did not all end up
      in refugee camps. He is a young, resourceful man who will be going
      back to trace his family.


Consideration

   9. The appellant has been found not to be credible in respect of his
      claim about events in Iraq. Consequently, his account elsewhere must
      be treated with caution. He may not be disclosing the true situation
      in respect of matters such as education; employment; family and the
      documents he can obtain. I note at screening 1.7 he said he could get
      documents to confirm his identity but he did not have a passport. He
      claims never to have received an education and to have always helped
      his father and selling produce in the market. At para 7 of his
      substantive interview he said he only spoke Kurdish. At question 87
      he said he did not know if his parents and sister were still in
      Mosul.


  10. The judge concluded that the appellant could obtain the necessary
      documentation for travel and a CS ID. The focus of the challenge has
      not been on this conclusion but upon the reasonableness of returning
      him to Baghdad. The judge had concluded the appellant was lying when
      he said he had no contact with his family in order to prevent his
      return to Iraq.

  11. On the judge's findings the appellant is being returned as a young
      Iraqi who had sought to remain here by deception and who had no
      profile in his home country.

  12. In AA Iraq [2015] UK UT 544 the focus of the Upper Tribunal was upon
      paragraph 15(c).Mosul is in the Nineveh governorate. Baghdad is some
      250 miles north. The country guidance case had concluded that Nineveh
      was a contested area where the intensity of the armed conflict was
      such that as a general matter 15 (c) applied.

  13. The judge at paragraph 21 had said that once returned to Baghdad the
      appellant could make his way to his home city if he wanted. This
      obviously is at odds with the country guidance. Any failure to follow
      a clear and applicable country guidance case will be regarded as
      grounds of appeal on a point of law. (See R(Iran and Ors -v- SSHD
      [2005] EWCA Civ 982). If there is fresh evidence a judge can depart
      from the country guidance but must be able to justify this. There is
      nothing to suggest evidence was led justifying such a departure.
      Consequently, in this regard the judge did err in law.

  14. However, the principal issue was the appellant's return to Baghdad
      and his ability to establish himself there. It was the judge's
      conclusion that he could. Paragraph 14 of the head note of AA points
      out that generally it will not be unreasonable or unduly harsh for
      someone from contested areas such as the appellant to relocate to
      Baghdad. The decision gives guidance on relevant factors. It is of
      note that these are listed as factors and are not determinative. The
      reasons advanced by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence were limited.
      In fairness, this was because the information volunteered by the
      appellant was limited and is very difficult to test by the respondent
      or the judge.

  15. The judge said he would have documentation. He would also have a
      financial package. He may have help through his family though there
      was nothing to suggest they were present in person in Baghdad. The
      judge did consider the difficulty being a Sunni in Baghdad presented.
      Those who speak Arabic a better placed to find employment. The
      appellant stated he only spoke Kurdish. I cannot find a finding on
      this point by the judge but there was nothing to suggest he could
      speak Arabic. He is male and as the judge pointed out he is fit and
      healthy. The judge had referred to a financial package until he
      established himself. It is my conclusion there were sufficient
      factors referred to for the decision to be sustainable.

  16. The judge did not go on to consider the possibility of the appellant
      treating Baghdad as a transit point to the IKR. This was dealt with
      in the Refusal and AA found the area was virtually violence free.
      There is no dispute that he is Kurdish. He would gain entry, albeit
      possibly for a limited period.

  17. Ms Wilkins had mentioned possible difficulties with onward travel
      from Baghdad to the IKR. The nature of a laissez-passer is that it is
      issued by the Iraqi authorities here to facilitate return. If this is
      taken from the appellant on arrival at Baghdad airport the country
      guidance case is silent as to the need for documentation for onward
      travel within the country. Put another way, I have not been referred
      to any evidence that further documentation is required for travel
      within Iraq. The onus is not on the respondent to prove in each case
      what documents are required to board an internal flight from Baghdad
      to the IKR.Nor does she have to show that the appellant has them or
      can access them.

  18. Paragraph 170 of the County Guidance case was a discussion on
      internal relocation which does not make its way into the head note.
      The Court of Appeal's comments on para 170 (AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ
      9440 about the CSID being not just a travel document but a necessity
      does not undermine the present decision because the judge concluded
      he could obtain this document.


Conclusions

  19. The judge did err in suggesting the appellant could return to Mosul.
      This was inconsistent with the Country Guidance decision. There was
      no indication of a basis for departing from that guidance. It may be
      the position is different now but nevertheless the parties must be
      given a chance to respond and the evidence led.


  20. However, I do not find this error to be material to the outcome and
      the comments made were obiter. The decision was primarily premised on
      the appellant's relocation to Baghdad. The judge concluded he could
      do this and whilst limited detail is available the judge did consider
      the principal factors. It is my conclusion that this aspect of the
      decision is sustainable.

  21. It would have been helpful for the judge to consider in the
      alternative going to the IKR. However, I do not find this to be a
      material error of law as the decision is sustainable on relocation to
      Baghdad alone. For completeness, a consideration of the IKR would
      most likely have confirmed the outcome, albeit in the alternative.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed. The First Tier Tribunal decision dismissing the
appeal shall stand.
