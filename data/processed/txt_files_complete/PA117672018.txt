Representation:
For the Appellant:          Mr P Stainthorpe, senior presenting officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Soltani, Iris Law Firm, Middlesbrough


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Caskie who allowed  the  respondent's  appeal
    against the decision refusing his asylum claim for reasons given in his
    determination promulgated 27 March 2019.  This was after a hearing some
    21 weeks earlier on 5 November at which  the  judge  announced  without
    giving reasons that the appeal was allowed.

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Albania (Kukes) where  he  was  born  in
    October 2000.  He arrived in the UK as a minor and claimed asylum.  His
    immigration history is not clear as the  refusal  letter  refers  to  a
    claim to have arrived clandestinely on 17 October 2016 but that he  had
    been encountered by Border Force the previous day.   His  asylum  claim
    was made on 10 November.  The judge referred to the  respondent  having
    arrived on 17 July 2017 although he observed some confusion in the Home
    Office papers.  I return to this aspect below.  The claim  was  refused
    on 27 September 2018 by when the respondent was 17� years old.

 3. The basis of the respondent's claim  is  that  he  was  the  victim  of
    domestic abuse by his father who has a problem with alcohol  abuse  and
    who was at the mercy of moneylenders.  These  money  lenders  had  also
    threatened him to kidnap the respondent.  The  police  were  unable  to
    assist.  The respondent had obtained support from his grandparents  but
    his father would bring him back home  when  he  wished.   The  overland
    journey to the UK had begun when he was approached by three  men  after
    the respondent was asked by  his  father  to  go  into  town  and  sell
    cigarettes.  They had said that they would take him to  a  safe  place.
    The respondent's case is that these arrangements had been supported  by
    his grandparents and his mother.

 4. The Secretary of State refused the claim on the basis that it  was  not
    credible.  The claim under the Human Rights Convention was also refused
    with particular reference to Article  8  which  included  also  a  best
    interests consideration.

 5. In an earlier visa application that was made on 10 September  2015  the
    respondent had sought entry clearance as a  student  visitor  to  study
    English with a proposal that he would  stay  at  a  hotel  in  Brighton
    arranged by Junior ISIS for eight days.  His father was recorded to  be
    funding the visit costing �650.  The visa was not granted.

 6. The respondent gave evidence as well as his paternal uncle  [SM].   The
    latter adopted a letter dated 15 October 2018.  This explains  that  he
    is married, has two children and that he has lived  here  for  nineteen
    years.  He considers the respondent to be part of his family.   He  had
    only learned that the respondent was here  some  two  to  three  months
    after his arrival.  The respondent's girlfriend also gave evidence.

 7. A further aspect of the evidence included the provision of  details  of
    another Albanian citizen said to be the respondent's  cousin  on  whose
    behalf a similar claim was made in 2015.

 8. The challenge to the judge's decision is as follows:

         "Committing a procedural impropriety

         1.   The Tribunal's determination fails to  disclose  that,  as  is
             characteristic for this Judge, a decision was made at the  end
             of the PO's submission.  The  Tribunal  decided  that  it  had
             enough information  to  allow  the  appeal  in  court  without
             hearing  from  the  appellant's  representative  and   without
             providing any reasons for reaching his conclusion.  While such
             an approach is conceivable, it is respectfully submitted  that
             the frequency with which  this  particular  Judge  does  this,
             calls into question the independence and  reliability  of  the
             conclusions reached.  Furthermore, this decision  was  clearly
             made without full consideration of the documents served on the
             day of  the  hearing  or  with  little  consideration  of  the
             evidence that was adduced in cross-examination.

         Failing to give adequate reasons for findings on a material matter

         2.   It is also submitted  that  another  aspect  of  this  Judge's
             alacrity in allowing the appeal was that he failed to  make  a
             finding  on  key  elements  if  [sic]  the  evidence  in   the
             credibility assessment.

         3.   The PO noted that in a visit visa application 12 months before
             the appellant arrived in the UK, his father had been  prepared
             to pay �650 for the appellant to come to the UK  on  a  school
             visit.   The  PO  submitted   that   this   contradicted   the
             appellant's  assertion  that  his  father  was  poor,  he  was
             indebted to money-lenders and he was abusive to the appellant.
              It is also contradicted the appellant's claim that his father
             prevent him attending school. The Tribunal made no finding  on
             these points but simply accepted the appellant's account.

         4.   The PO also made the submission that this was a package claim.
              He noted that the appellant's cousin  had  used  exactly  the
             same account in his successful asylum claim only a  couple  of
             years earlier.  The Tribunal made no finding on  whether  this
             was coincidence or an apparent abuse of the Immigration Rules.
              Given that the accounts were the same, it is remarkable  that
             Tribunal simply mentioned it in passing at paragraph 24 of the
             determination without making any finding on its  relevance  to
             this case.

         5.   It is submitted that,  at  the  very  least,  the  credibility
             assessment is incomplete.  Furthermore, it is  submitted  that
             if the tribunal had made reasoned findings on  this  evidence,
             it would have surely found against the appellant."

 9. The judge set out his conclusions in his decision at [23]  to  [31]  as
    follows:

         "23. I have considered all the documentation on the file.  I  begin
             the explanation of my  consideration  of  the  matters  to  be
             determined in this case by noting the standard of proof  in  a
             case such as the present  one  is  low.   The  appellant  only
             requires to establish a real risk of suffering serious harm in
             order to succeed in his appeal.

         24.  In the present  case  I  note  that  the  Secretary  of  State
             rejected the appellant's claim to have a bad relationship with
             his  father  and  indeed  the  decision  letter   specifically
             indicates that his father paying for a school  trip  indicated
             that the appellant had a good relationship  with  his  father.
             However, it was the  appellant's  bad  relationship  with  his
             father which the Secretary of State considered relieved him of
             his obligations in terms of family tracing.  I note  that  the
             documentation produced in respect of  the  appellant's  cousin
             was not accompanied by any consent form for  that  information
             to be released despite the Data  Protection  obligations  upon
             the  Secretary  of  State.   Ms  Little,  the  appellant,  the
             appellant's agents and myself now have a significant amount of
             information in relation to  the  appellant's  cousin's  asylum
             claim.

         25.  Background information has been produced to me in relation  to
             the  prevalence  of  domestic  violence  in  Albania.   It  is
             indicated  in  a  Council  of  Europe   document   that   "the
             inclination to preserve the unity of family at all costs  also
             explain disturbing failures  in  the  procedures  for  issuing
             protection orders for  children".   Amnesty  International  in
             February 2008 reported that domestic violence  had  increased.
             The United States  Department  of  State  indicated  that  the
             police often did not have the training  or  capacity  to  deal
             effectively with domestic violence and Freedom House indicated
             that  "domestic  violence  is  widespread,  and   whilst   the
             Parliament has adopted some measures to combat the problem  in
             recent years, few cases are  prosecuted.   Police  are  poorly
             equipped to handle cases of domestic violence which  is  often
             not understood to be a crime".   The  European  Commission  in
             April 2018 indicated that domestic violence remained a serious
             concern in respect of Albania.

         26.  It is against that background that I require to  consider  the
             appellant's claim.  What he claims happened to him in  Albania
             clearly happens to many in Albania and that adds weight to the
             reliability of the appellant's evidence.  It also adds  weight
             to the appellant's claim that both he and his cousin had  been
             subjected to similar maltreatment.

         27.  The appellant's account of having attempted to report  matters
             to the police but them not responding also  accords  with  the
             background  information.   It  is  clear  to   me   that   the
             appellant's account of his flight from  Albania  was  not  one
             involving him being approached at random by three men who then
             brought him to the UK.  The fact that those men were  said  to
             hold the appellant's passport indicates at a minimum that  his
             mother, who it was  said  previously  had  possession  of  his
             passport, had involvement.

         28.  In relation to the statement by the appellant that neither  he
             nor his family were in fear  of  others  with  regard  to  his
             travel to the United Kingdom it did not appear  to  me  to  be
             contradictory of the position of the appellant stating that he
             was afraid of three men who were threatening  to  abduct  him.
             The possession by three other men of his passport was a matter
             which may  have  provided  the  appellant  with  a  degree  of
             reassurance that these men were at least  being  supported  by
             his mother.

         29.  In relation to the delay in  the  appellant  claiming  asylum,
             when he arrived in the United  Kingdom  as  a  16-year-old,  I
             accept that his lack of knowledge of how to go about  claiming
             asylum until he  had  obtained  advice  provides  an  adequate
             explanation for that delay.  Given the  widespread  occurrence
             of domestic violence in Albania and the  lack  of  willingness
             and ability on the part  of  the  state  agencies  to  protect
             individuals from it by being unwilling or  unable  to  provide
             protection, for the reasons given at paragraph 25 above  I  am
             satisfied that victims of domestic violence in Albania, and in
             particular child victims of such violence  form  a  particular
             social group for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.   The
             social group in question is children.   Not  all  children  in
             Albania suffer domestic  abuse.   Those  who  suffer  domestic
             violence form part of an identifiable group within that  group
             and are unable to obtain a sufficiency of protection  and  are
             entitled to recognition as refugees.

         30.  In relation to the ability of the appellant to be  traced  by,
             in particular, his father I  consider  it  properly  a  matter
             within judicial knowledge that Albania  is  one  of  the  many
             European countries that operates an identity card  system.   A
             single corrupt official with access to that system would allow
             any Albanian to be traced.  I consider  that  the  patriarchal
             society that is Albania, as  demonstrated  in  the  background
             information before me, makes it  at  least  reasonably  likely
             that the appellant's departure from the power of  his  father,
             who could be regarded to be a violent alcoholic gambler  is  a
             significant slight.  I consider that would provide  motivation
             for the appellant's father to seek to  continue  to  harm  the
             appellant and that therefore he continues to  be  at  risk  of
             persecution.

         31.  There is no doubt that the appellant's claim for asylum  looks
             distinctly suspicious.  It did not appear to  me,  having  had
             the opportunity to observe the appellant  providing  his  oral
             evidence and be cross examined in some detail  by  Mr  Appleby
             that the appellant was a young man with guile  to  effectively
             conceal the  truth.   Of  course,  it  is  possible  that  the
             appellant and his uncle and his family in  Albania  noted  the
             opportunity that arose when this boy was  going  on  a  school
             trip to the  United  Kingdom  to  take  the  opportunity  that
             presented.  Ultimately the question  for  me  is  whether  the
             opportunity identified was an opportunity  to  make  a  better
             life  in  the  United  Kingdom  than   the   appellant   could
             realistically hope for in Albania or alternatively so that  he
             could escape the malign clutches of his  father.   Looking  at
             the evidence overall in this case (and leaving out of  account
             the actions and inactions of the Secretary of State  entirely)
             I am satisfied that the appellant has discharge the onus  upon
             him of  establishing  that  he  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
             persecution in Albania.  He was a  credible  and  in  my  view
             reliable witness.  That was my view at the conclusion  of  the
             hearing, and it remains my view today."

 1. Mr Stainthorpe relied on First-tier Tribunal Presidential Guidance Note
    No 1 of 2014 in relation to the first limb of ground 1.  That  guidance
    provides at paragraph 21:

         "21. Notwithstanding that there is power  in  rule  29  to  give  a
             decision notifying the parties of the  outcome  of  an  appeal
             orally at the hearing the Tribunal will  continue  to  reserve
             the substantive decision in an appeal and issue  a  notice  of
             decision and statement of reasons  as  a  single  document  in
             every case.  It will be inappropriate to give  an  ex  tempore
             decision without giving a full statement  of  reasons  at  the
             same time. This is because the  factual  questions  and  other
             issues in dispute in appeals to  the  Immigration  and  Asylum
             Chamber are usually complex and the parties  are  entitled  to
             receive a full statement of reasons for the decision."

 2. Mr Stainthorpe argued that given the complexity of this  case,  it  was
    improper for the judge to allow it  at  the  hearing.   The  presenting
    officer's note did not include an  indication  of  the  length  of  the
    hearing, however Ms Soltani intervened and explained it had  taken  two
    hours 24 minutes.   Mr  Stainthorpe  argued  that  the  judge  had  not
    properly considered the evidence and had failed to resolve the conflict
    in evidence having regard to the position taken  by  the  Home  Office.
    The judge's reference to the respondent being part of  a  social  group
    was undermined by the fact that he was over 18 years old at the date of
    hearing.  He further illustrated his challenge by  reference  to  other
    aspects of the credibility findings and argued that although the  judge
    could have read the country information on  the  day,  he  nevertheless
    contended that he could not have  "reconciled"  it.   In  addition,  he
    contended that the judge had significantly erred in [30]  by  reference
    to the identity  card  system  which  had  not  been  raised  with  the
    presenting officer at the time of the hearing.

 3. By way of response Ms Soltani argued that  Mr  Stainthorpe  had  argued
    matters that were not within the grounds of challenge.  In  particular,
    she pointed to the aspect relating to social group.  In response to  my
    suggestion that this might be a Robinson obvious point, she accepted it
    might be but referred again to the  silence  of  the  grounds  on  this
    aspect.  According to her note of the hearing, it had not  been  raised
    and was not in the reasons for refusal.  She contended that  there  was
    no correlation between the alleged procedural  impropriety  giving  the
    decision on the day and  not  considering  matters  properly.    Simply
    because the judge had indicated that he did not need to hear  from  the
    respondent's representatives did not result in error and she relied  on
    a r.24 response (which I  turn  to  below)  that  deals  with  all  the
    complaints pleaded in the  grounds  specifically  in  relation  to  the
    points raised by the Secretary of State about the visa application,  it
    was misconceived.  The judge had  set  out  in  [10]  of  the  decision
    significant detail in relation to the role of the grandparents in  that
    application.  Although the point had been made by Mr Stainthorpe it was
    simply  not  the  case  that  members  of  the  judiciary  such  as  an
    experienced judge would be unable to engage with those  issues  on  the
    day.

 4. By way of response Mr Stainthorpe  referred  to  paragraph  27  of  the
    refusal letter which raised a Convention reason as an issue.

 5. The Rule 24 response dated 18 July made the following points:-

      i) No evidence was adduced to support the contention  that  there  was
         any difficulty with the judge's independence.

     ii) The grant of permission was solely on the basis that  it  might  be
         arguable the judge had failed to take  certain  issues  potentially
         adverse to the respondent's credibility into account being:-

          a) failure  to  take  into  account  the  apparent  contradiction
             between  the  evidence  in  the  visa   application   of   the
             respondent's father's readiness to finance  the  trip  against
             the latter's claim that his father was poor  and  indebted  to
             money lenders; and

          b) failure to take into account that this was a "package claim".

    iii) As to (a)  above,  the  tribunal  had  recorded  that  it  was  the
         respondent's grandfather who had wished for him to escape  and  had
         assisted with  his  application.   As  to  (b),  it  was  factually
         incorrect to assert the  tribunal  had  only  dealt  with  this  in
         passing; the judge had cited the respondent's evidence on the point
         at [11] where the point was  put  to  him.   He  had  responded  by
         suggesting that they both had similar problems with  their  family.
         The judge had by way of analysis referred to the matter at [24] and
         had assessed the objective material and notes at [26]  the  support
         for the respondent's claim that he and his  cousin  had  both  been
         subjected to similar maltreatment.

 6. My conclusions are as follows.  Ground 1 is in two parts.  The first is
    a procedural one as to whether it was  appropriate  for  the  judge  to
    announce the decision of the hearing and the  second  limb  raises  the
    issue whether there had been adequate consideration by the judge of the
    evidence.  The Presidential Guidance Note makes its  purpose  clear  in
    paragraph [1]:

         "... This guidance is for  information  only  and  is  intended  to
         assist individual judges in exercising their  responsibilities  but
         is not intended to detract from the duty  of  each  judge  to  make
         decisions in proceedings before them".


 7. Rule 29 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014 provides, relevant to this
    issue,:

         "29.-(1) The Tribunal may give a decision orally at a hearing.

              (2) Subject to rule 13(2) (withholding information  likely  to
                  cause serious harm), the Tribunal  must  provide  to  each
                  party as soon as reasonably  practicable  after  making  a
                  decision (other  than  a  decision  under  Part  4)  which
                  disposes of the proceedings-

                  (a)  a notice of decision stating the Tribunal's decision;
                      and

                  ...

              (3) Where the decision of the Tribunal relates to-

                  (a)  an asylum claim or a humanitarian  protection  claim,
                      the  Tribunal  must  provide,  with  the  notice   of
                      decision in paragraph (2)(a), written reasons for its
                      decision;

                  ...".

 8. In my judgment the judge  made  no  error  of  law  in  announcing  his
    decision at the hearing and giving his  written  reasons  with  written
    notice of that decision, albeit several weeks later.  Failure to follow
    guidance does not of itself result in the judge having erred in law.

 9. The second limb to ground 1 argues that the decision was  made  without
    full consideration of the documents served on the day  of  the  hearing
    and/or with little consideration of the evidence that  was  adduced  in
    cross-examination.   The  documents  served  the  day  of  the  hearing
    comprised a full  page  paper  entitled  Refugee  Documentation  Centre
    (Legal Aid Board, Ireland) 'Albania Information on Domestic  Violence',
    dated 25 June 2018 from the Secretary of State.  Included in the bundle
    from the respondent's representatives were several  pages  of  material
    relating to child protection issues in Albania.  The decision of  Judge
    Caskie refers to this material at [7] which he analysed it at  [25]  as
    follows:

         "Background information has been produced to me in relation to  the
         prevalence of domestic violence in Albania.  It is indicated  in  a
         Council of Europe document that 'the inclination  to  preserve  the
         unity of family at all costs also explain  disturbing  failures  in
         the  procedures  for  issuing  protection  orders  for   children'.
         Amnesty International  in  February  2018  reported  that  domestic
         violence had increased.  The  United  States  Department  of  State
         indicated that the police  often  did  not  have  the  training  or
         capacity to deal effectively with  domestic  violence  and  Freedom
         House indicated that 'domestic violence is widespread,  and  whilst
         the Parliament has adopted some measures to combat the  problem  in
         recent years, few cases are prosecuted.  Police are poorly equipped
         to handle cases of domestic violence which is often not  understood
         to be a crime'.  The European Commission in  April  2018  indicated
         that domestic violence remained a serious  concern  in  respect  of
         Albania."

    Evidence given in cross-examination is set out in paragraphs  [14]  and
    [15].  There is no need to repeat that here.  It was not incumbent upon
    the judge to give reasons for his decision at the hearing and it cannot
    be said that the written decision is devoid of reasoning or analysis on
    these two aspects.

19. The second ground of challenge argues in general terms that  the  judge
    had failed to make a finding on key elements of  the  evidence  in  the
    credibility assessment.  This is followed by the two examples  relating
    to the respondent's father's role  in  the  visa  application  and  the
    evidence produced by the Secretary of State that this  was  a  "package
    claim".  Here again I consider the judge did  address  the  two  points
    particularly raised.  The "package" aspect was addressed  in  [17]  and
    further in [24], the respondent's father's funding being also addressed
    in that latter paragraph.  The judge had  earlier  noted  in  [10]  the
    respondent's explanation that his grandfather would be paying  for  the
    trip and having  found  the  respondent  to  be  credible,  it  may  be
    reasonably assumed that the judge considered this aspect had been dealt
    with.

20. Notwithstanding these matters, I have concerns about the correctness of
    approach of the judge to the task before him.  There is  some  evidence
    of carelessness.  In paragraph [1] he refers to confusion in the papers
    provided by the Secretary  of  State  as  to  the  date  on  which  the
    respondent arrived in the United Kingdom and as to whether this was the
    16, 17 or 18 July 2017.  He concluded that he  was  satisfied  "by  the
    preponderance of evidence" that he arrived on  17  July  2017.   It  is
    difficult to see how the judge could have rationally concluded this was
    the arrival date on the papers before him.  The summary of  immigration
    history  in  the  summary  of  the  Home  Office  case  refers  to  the
    respondent's arrival on 18 July 2017.  This was readily acknowledged by
    Mr Stainthorpe to have been an error.  The  respondent's  own  evidence
    disclosed in the screening interview was that he had travelled overland
    (rather than by sea as  indicated  in  the  Home  Office  summary)  and
    furthermore the refusal letter sets out the  immigration  history  with
    this chronology:

    12 October 2016   Left Albania

    16 October 2016   Encountered by Border Force Officer

    17 October 2016   Claimed to have arrived

    10 November 2016  Claimed asylum

    Although this chronology has its flaws, it was never  the  respondent's
    case that he arrived in 2017 or in July of either 2016 or 2017.

21. In paragraph [10], the judge  referred  to  the  respondent's  evidence
    relating to the visa application and observed:

         "... The confirmed that the application  had  been  for  an  8  day
         school trip, but he said that once he arrived in  the  UK,  he  had
         applied for asylum but that had been refused".

    It was not the respondent's case that the visa had been granted.   When
    positing the possibilities in paragraph [31] the judge as will be  seen
    from the passage cited above that he considered the possibility of  the
    opportunity that arose when the respondent was coming here on a  school
    trip.  The judge does not appear to have understood that the  visa  was
    never granted.

22. I accept Ms Soltani's submission that neither aspect is material but  I
    am left with a sense of unease over  the  care  with  which  the  judge
    approached the task before him, not only as to the issue of credibility
    but also the factors he was required to consider in  assessing  whether
    the respondent had a well-founded fear of persecution.   These  matters
    in my judgment come within the scope of the broad introduction  to  the
    second ground.  On the respondent's evidence, the threat of his  kidnap
    resulted in his father paying the debt and thus  it  is  reasonable  to
    assume it had subsided.  This left a claim based on the father's abuse.
     It is  clear  on  the  evidence  that  the  respondent's  grandparents
    provided  him  with  protection  from  that  abuse  but  there  was  no
    explanation why they did not go to the police to obtain  protection  in
    the light of the  respondent's  lack  of  success.   There  is  also  a
    question mark over the nature and extent of abuse by  the  respondent's
    father.  The judge appears to have proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
    account he was given was sufficient to amount to persecution.   Whether
    the respondent as a minor came within a social group required more than
    the short analysis at the conclusion of [29].

23. The judge records in paragraphs [14]  and  [15]  the  evidence  of  the
    respondent's uncle.  This included the indication that he had not found
    out about his arrival until two to three months after it had  happened.
    He had been telephoned  by  the  respondent.   He  had  spoken  to  the
    respondent's grandparents but they had said they had not wanted him  to
    become involved  prior  to  the  respondent's  arrival.   [SM]  is  the
    respondent's paternal uncle.  Bearing in  mind  his  annual  visits  to
    Albania it is reasonable to suppose that he has maintained contact with
    his family.  The judge does not address the plausibility of [SM]  being
    unaware of the respondent's journey despite the evidence that this  was
    organized by his grandparents until some time after his arrival.

24. It is unarguable that by the time the appeal came before the judge, the
    respondent was no longer a minor.  Whatever had happened in  the  past,
    he was no longer within the identified social group and furthermore the
    judge did not give any real consideration to the issue as to what would
    happen to the respondent were he to be returned as a young adult.  This
    would inevitably have involved considerations of internal relocation to
    for instance Tirana and the exploration of whether this would be unduly
    harsh in the context of any connections there should the respondent  be
    unable to establish the availability  of  protection  in  Kukes  should
    there be a risk of repetition of the respondent's father's hostility.

25. In my judgment this case did not ultimately fall to be resolved as  one
    of whether the respondent had fabricated a claim for a better  life  or
    whether he was in need of  refugee  protection.   Instead  it  required
    findings of fact and an assessment of risk based on those findings that
    the respondent would face were he to be returned to Albania by the time
    the judge came to give his reasons in March 2019.  The failure  by  the
    judge to address legitimate  issues  of  credibility  are  sufficiently
    captured by ground 2.  The other aspects of  concern  relating  to  the
    application of Refugee Convention  law  are  in  my  judgment  Robinson
    obvious and were matters that the judge failed to address.

26. I am satisfied the judge therefore erred  in  law  and  set  aside  his
    decision.  Having regard to the nature of the errors,  I  am  satisfied
    that the case requires to be remitted for its further consideration  by
    a differently constituted tribunal.  None  of  the  findings  of  Judge
    Caskie is preserved.
