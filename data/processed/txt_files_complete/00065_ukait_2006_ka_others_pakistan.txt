For the Appellant:           Mr S Park, instructed by Park & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Ms O'Connor, Home Office Presenting Officer

The requirement of adequacy is objective.  The level  of  income  and  other
benefits that would be available if the family were drawing  income  support
remains the yardstick.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, who are all citizens of Pakistan, are the wife and four
    children of the Sponsor, who is an Imam and has leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom for employment as an Imam under  paragraphs  169-177  of
    HC395 until 6th January 2009.  They applied for entry clearance  to  be
    with him as his spouse and children whilst he was working here.   Their
    applications were refused on 11th July 2005.  At that date the children
    were aged 10, 8, 4 and  2  respectively.   The  Notice  of  Refusal  is
    addressed to the first Appellant "and four children",  but  gives  five
    case reference numbers.  It is in the following terms:-

        "194.  The requirements to be met by  a  person  seeking  leave  to
        enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a  person
        with limited leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  under
        paragraphs 128-193 (but not paragraphs 135 I-135 K) are that:


        (iii)    There will be adequate accommodation for the  parties  and
             any  dependants   without   recourse   to   public   funds   in
             accommodation which they own or occupy exclusively; and
        (iv)   The parties will be able  to  maintain  themselves  and  any
             dependants adequately without recourse to public funds


        BECAUSE


        You have applied with your children to join your husband in the UK.
         He has been in the UK for two years but you have  not  applied  to
        visit before.  You stated at interview that he was  busy.   He  has
        stated in the supporting documents that his income is �160  a  week
        however this is not reflected in his bank statements.  He  has  not
        provided any evidence of wage slips and tax or  national  insurance
        contributions.  I am not satisfied that his  earnings  are  as  you
        state or that he can maintain you during your stay.


        You stated at interview that  you  did  not  know  how  large  your
        husband's house is.  You  stated  that  he  lives  alone.   In  the
        supporting documents your husband  stated  that  he  lives  with  a
        family and that two rooms will be made available to you.  I am  not
        satisfied that two rooms is adequate for you and your  husband  and
        four children to live.


        If you decide to appeal against the refusal  of  your  application,
        the decision will be reviewed in conjunction with your  grounds  of
        appeal.  If you have any additional documentation  which  addresses
        the reasons for refusal, you are strongly advised to submit it with
        your notice of appeal, as it may be possible to resolve the  points
        at issue without the necessity for an appeal hearing.


        I therefore refuse your application."


 2. It is clear that there are a number of infelicities in that notice.  In
    particular it is, we understand, common  ground  that  the  appropriate
    paragraph of HC395 for the children is 197.  What is clear, however, is
    that the ground of refusal is that the entry clearance officer was  not
    satisfied that the maintenance and accommodation  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules would be met.

 3. An Immigration Judge allowed the Appellants' appeals in a determination
    sent to the parties on 7th February 2006.  Having reviewed the evidence
    she concluded that:

        "the Sponsor lived and lives frugally and on �160 per week has been
        able to send �400 or so to his family per month though he  has  not
        had to pay his keep.  ... .  It is plain that he is not  paying  in
        actuality a market rate and in fact [a third party] is  subsidising
        the costs.  I bear in  mind  that  income  support  is  for  living
        expenditure and include some allowance beyond food; for furnishing,
        travel etc. that is minimal but is built in.  The Appellants  would
        not be living in accommodation that requires such needs to be  met.




        That he will do so is unchallenged, as is the fact that the Sponsor
        has saved money despite the  modest  income....  In  this  case  to
        notwithstanding that evidence  impose  a  requirement  that  income
        support levels must be met to satisfy the Rules would be  arbitrary
        and against the actual ability to maintain as evidenced. [sic]  The
        Rules do not prescribe a minimum and I would be wrong to apply  one
        irrespective of the facts.  The Respondent will have opportunity to
        review this family situation should further leave be sought but  on
        the evidence at date of hearing even though there is a  deficit  of
        about �100 compared to the income support level the Appellants  did
        show that they could  be  maintained  without  recourse  to  public
        funds."

 4. The Respondent sought and obtained an order for  reconsideration.   The
    ground is, in summary, that the Immigration Judge  failed  to  consider
    whether the Appellants would be adequately maintained  on  almost  �100
    per week less than the income support level.

 5. In the course of his submissions in response to the  grounds,  Mr  Park
    asserted that there are indeed in the  Immigration  Rules  no  specific
    requirements that the level of maintenance available to  applicants  be
    at any particular standard.  He said that if the Immigration Rules  had
    intended to impose such a standard, whether by reference to the  income
    support levels or otherwise, they could have said so.   The  fact  that
    they did not say so meant that adequacy was a  matter  purely  for  the
    discretion, or perhaps more properly  assessment,  of  the  Immigration
    Judge.

 6. We do not accept that submission.  Although it may be said  that  there
    is an element of imprecision in the  relevant  Immigration  Rules,  the
    requirement that the  maintenance  be  "adequate"  cannot  properly  be
    ignored.  To our mind  the  use  of  that  word  imposes  an  objective
    standard.  It is not sufficient that maintenance and  accommodation  be
    available at a standard which the parties and their family are prepared
    to tolerate: the maintenance and accommodation must be at a level which
    can properly be called adequate.

 7. There is a good reason for using the levels  of  income  support  as  a
    test.  The reason is  that  income  support  is  the  level  of  income
    provided by the United Kingdom government to those who  have  no  other
    source of income.  It follows from that that the Respondent  could  not
    properly argue that a family who have as much as  they  would  have  on
    income support is not adequately maintained.

 8. It perhaps does not necessarily follow that in order to  be  adequately
    maintained one has to have resources at least equivalent to those which
    would be available to a family on income support.  But there  are  very
    good reasons for taking  that  view.   A  family  of  British  (or  EU)
    citizens resident in this country will not have less than  that  level.
    It is extremely undesirable that the Rules  should  be  interpreted  in
    such a way as to envisage immigrant families existing (and hence  being
    required to exist, because social security benefits are  not  available
    to them) on resources less than those which would be available  through
    the social security system  to  citizen  families.   To  do  so  is  to
    encourage the view  that  immigrant  families  need  less,  or  can  be
    expected to live on less, and in certain areas of the country would  be
    prone to create whole communities living at a lower standard than  even
    the poorest of British citizens.  It is for this reason that  a  number
    of Tribunal cases, including  Islam  (13183),  Momotaz  Begum  (18699),
    Uvovo (00 TH 01450) (which alone was the subject of  reference  by  the
    Immigration Judge in this case) and RB [2004]  UKIAT  00142  have  held
    that the basic task  for  Appellants  attempting  to  show  that  there
    maintenance will be "adequate" is to show that they will have  as  much
    as they would have if they were able to claim income support.   Similar
    considerations apply to the different benefit structure when there is a
    disabled person in the family, as Munibun Nisa v ECO  Islamabad  [2002]
    UKIAT01369 shows.   There  have  been  one  or  two  cases  which  have
    indicated that a frugal  life  style  can  be  taken  into  account  in
    deciding whether maintenance would be "adequate", but in our view those
    cases should not be followed.  In particular, we doubt whether it would
    ever be right to say that children could be maintained "adequately"  at
    less than the level which would be available to the  family  on  income
    support, merely because one of their parents asserts  that  the  family
    will live frugally.  The purpose of the requirement of adequacy  is  to
    ensure that a proper standard, appropriate to a family living in a  not
    inexpensive western society, is available to those  who  seek  to  live
    here.

 9. The Immigration Judge erred in law in her assertion that "the Rules  do
    not prescribe a minimum".  They do:  they require adequacy.

10. We proceed to  consider  whether  the  Appellants'  appeals  should  be
    allowed or dismissed.  Although the Immigration Judge referred  to  the
    date of the hearing, the relevant date for the purposes of  the  appeal
    is the date of the decision.

11. The evidence relating to the available accommodation and maintenance is
    in part clear but in part extremely vague.  The Appellant works  as  an
    Imam at a mosque.  The mosque itself appears to belong  to  the  person
    who, in the extract from the Immigration Judge's determination which we
    set out above, we called the "third party".  The third party also  owns
    the house where he lives, where the Sponsor  lives,  and  where  it  is
    proposed that the Appellants would live.  The Sponsor  pays  the  third
    party some �35 to �40 per week for  his  accommodation  and  "household
    expenses".  If the Appellants come, it is said that accommodation  will
    be available to them as well, but the cost will rise to �50  per  week,
    still including "household  expenses".   The  third  party's  statement
    indicates that at present the Sponsor takes his meals  with  the  third
    party, and that the cost of his meals  is  therefore  included  in  the
    "household expenses".  An accountant's statement, also produced for the
    purposes of the appeal, states that the Sponsor buys his own  food  and
    drink.  We were asked to consider the case on the basis that the  third
    party would accommodate all the Appellants and provide  them  with  all
    meals, for a cost of �10 or �15 a week in addition to that which he  is
    currently receiving from the Sponsor.

12. The Sponsor's income from his employment is �160 per  week,  apparently
    paid in cash.  The accountant's letter indicates that there will in due
    course be a tax liability but that as the Sponsor is regarded  as  self
    employed, for tax purposes, his liability to tax arises at the  end  of
    the tax year.  We saw no evidence that the Sponsor  has  yet  paid  any
    tax.  There is clear evidence that the Sponsor sends about �100 a  week
    to the Appellants, and the assumption was that the Appellants used that
    �100 per week for their maintenance in Pakistan.  The Sponsor  is  also
    able to save, and his bank account shows that, taken as an average,  he
    has been able to save about �20 per week.

13. The source of the funds from which the Sponsor is paid  appears  to  be
    the mosque.  We have seen a few entries  relating  to  a  bank  account
    belonging to the mosque, showing a balance of rather over �50,000.  The
    evidence is that the mosque has some connection with what is  called  a
    charity, but we saw no trust deed and no indication that the charity is
    registered.  The third party is a director or trustee of this  concern,
    and it was suggested to us by Mr Park in submissions that, as a result,
    he has control over the funds in order to use them for purposes such as
    the support of the sponsor and the Appellants.  There is,  however,  no
    evidence that any  funds  attributable  to  any  charity  are  properly
    expendable for the support of the Appellants other than  by  way  of  a
    legal obligation to pay wages to an employee of the charity.

14. Bearing in mind the third party's declared  intention  to  support  the
    Sponsor's not insignificant family for recompense of only  �10  or  �15
    per week, we enquired as to the source of the third party's funds.   Mr
    Park simply told us that he had no information about that.

15. It is indicated in the evidence that, because of the Sponsor's standing
    in the community, he will be the subject of invitations  to  dine  with
    members of the congregation, and that his wife and children will always
    be included in such invitations.  Thus he  will  have  access  to  food
    other than by the third party's benevolence.

16. So far as concerns accommodation, the Sponsor at present lives with the
    third party and has his own bedroom in the house.   If  the  Appellants
    came the position at the date of the decision was that there  would  be
    another bedroom available; a third has since become  available  as  the
    third party's adult son has left the house.

17. Miss O'Connor's submission was that, at the date of  the  decision,  if
    the Sponsor and the Appellants had been eligible for income support the
    amount of income support payable to them would have been �253 per week.
     Mr Park did not dissent from that calculation.  There would  also,  as
    we understand the position, have been child benefit payable at the rate
    of �16.50 per week for the first child and  �11.05  per  week  for  the
    other three children, amounting in total to �49.65  per  week.   Income
    support is also a gateway to various other benefits.  The two  children
    who were at the date of the decision of  school  age  would  have  been
    entitled to free school dinners, and all six of the family  would  have
    been entitled to free prescriptions.  It  is  of  course  difficult  to
    estimate the value of the latter  benefit  in  particular,  but  taking
    income support, child benefit and other matters together, it  is  clear
    that the total benefit available to the family would have had  a  value
    exceeding �300 per week in income.  Income support is also a gateway to
    housing benefit, as a result of which a family on income support living
    in modest (but adequate) housing is likely to find that their  rent  is
    paid by way of housing benefit.  They will also be entitled to  council
    tax benefit and so will not have to pay council tax.   The  appropriate
    method of calculation for comparative  purposes  is,  as  explained  in
    Uvovo, to separate maintenance from accommodation, and to look first to
    see whether the accommodation  would  be  adequate,  and  then  to  see
    whether the income available  to  the  Appellants  for  maintenance  is
    equivalent to the amount that would be available to a similar family on
    income  support  once  they  had  dealt  with  the   costs   of   their
    accommodation.

18. Despite the doubts raised by the entry clearance  officer,  we  see  no
    reason to  suppose  that  the  accommodation  would  not  be  adequate.
    Whether the accommodation is really available is a matter which depends
    on the third party, who asserts that he  will  provide  it  at  a  very
    modest charge in his own house.  Our concerns on that issue are similar
    to those relating to maintenance, which we shall consider shortly.

19. So far as maintenance is concerned,  the  figures  which  we  gave  for
    benefit entitlement are those net of accommodation.  Looking simply  at
    the figures, the proposal is that from his wage of �160 the Sponsor  is
    to pay �50 for accommodation and "household expenses", leaving �110 per
    week for other expenses for himself, his wife and four children.   That
    is clearly well short of the income of something over the �300 per week
    that they would have if they were on income support; indeed it is  only
    a little more than the �100 per week that it apparently presently costs
    the Appellants to live in  Pakistan.   It  is  said,  however,  on  the
    Appellants' behalf that the comparison with income  support  is  not  a
    fair comparison, because the charge  for  accommodation  would  include
    much of what income support would normally need to be spent on, that is
    to say, food.  It is further said that any deficiency in food  provided
    by the third party would be met by other members of the  congregation's
    invitations to meals.

20. Although we might be prepared to accept  that  such  invitations  might
    from time to time be forthcoming, and we  might  also  be  prepared  to
    accept the third party's genuine intentions, the truth of the matter is
    that there is nothing in this evidence which is firm enough to show  us
    that either such invitations or the munificence of the third party will
    in truth be sufficient to raise the Appellants' resources  to  a  level
    comparable to that which would be available to them on income  support.
    Mr Park pointed out that their living with the third party  would  mean
    that they did not have to pay  utility  bills,  house  insurance  or  a
    television license.  He said that even if food was discounted the value
    of those bills was approaching a �100 per week.  We do not accept  that
    submission.  More particularly, bearing in mind the lack of clarity  or
    transparency about the institution described as a charity, and the lack
    of any evidence at all about the source of  the  third  party's  funds,
    together with the absence of any legal undertaking by the  third  party
    to continue to support the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellants  despite  any
    personal difficulties he may incur (or indeed any personal dispute with
    the Sponsor and his family), and indeed the lack even  of  any  legally
    enforceable contract of  employment  for  the  Sponsor  at  a  firm  or
    calculable salary, we are not prepared to  find  as  a  fact  that  the
    amount of maintenance and security offered by the third  party  are  in
    any genuine sense available.  There is no basis for thinking that there
    are resources, properly and indefinitely available to the third  party,
    in order to supply them.

21. There is in  fact,  as  we  pointed  out  at  the  hearing,  a  further
    difficulty.  Paragraph 194 is in the terms set out  in  the  notice  of
    refusal.  It is more than  arguable  that  that  paragraph  requires  a
    spouse seeking admission to establish that adequate maintenance will be
    available without relying on a third party's support.  The  phrase  for
    children, in  paragraph  197  (iv)  is  that  they  "can  and  will  be
    maintained and  accommodated  adequately  without  recourse  to  public
    funds", but for spouses the requirement is  that  the  parties  to  the
    marriage "will be  able  to  maintain  themselves  and  any  dependants
    adequately without recourse to public funds".  We cannot  suppose  that
    the difference in wording is  intended  to  have  no  effect.   Clearly
    children could not be expected to maintain themselves; but the  wording
    "can and will be maintained" would be perfectly appropriate for spouses
    if it were not intended that third party support  should  be  excluded.
    The  view  that  the  wording  of  paragraph  194,  and  other  similar
    paragraphs in the  Immigration  Rules,  excludes  third  party  support
    appears to be implicit in the decision of the  Tribunal  in  AA  [2005]
    UKAIT 00105, at paragraph 26.  For this reason, we  should  have  found
    that the support offered by the third party could  not  be  taken  into
    account as assisting the first Appellant to satisfy the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules, even if we had  found  that  such  support  were
    realistically available.

22. The Appellants face other difficulties, in particular,  the  impact  of
    tax.   Income  tax  is  as  yet  entirely  undetermined.   As  we  have
    indicated, the Sponsor has a tax liability; and if he were  to  receive
    substantial benefits in kind  from  his  employment  (in  the  form  of
    maintenance of his family and subsidy of their accommodation), as it is
    suggested he would, those too would presumably be taxable.  It may also
    be that, if payments were made from the funds of the mosque (other than
    in satisfaction of a legal obligation to pay a salary) for the personal
    benefit of the Sponsor or the Appellants, whether or  not  through  the
    agency of the third party,  the  mosque's  funds  might  themselves  be
    taxable to that extent or generally.

23. For all  these  reasons  we  have  reached  the  clear  view  that  the
    Appellants have failed to show that they would be maintained adequately
    if they were  admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom.   Their  appeals  are
    therefore dismissed.
