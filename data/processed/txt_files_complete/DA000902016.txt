Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In Person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Lazdauskis's  appeal
against the decision to deport him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
Regulation 19(3)(b) and Regulation 21 of the Immigration (European  Economic
Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr  Lazdauskis  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania, born on 3 May 1989.  He  claims  to
have entered the UK in July 2006  at  the  age  of  17  years  and  to  have
remained here since that time.


On 4 June 2009 the  appellant  was  convicted  of  destroying  and  damaging
property and was  sentenced  to  a  12  months'  conditional  discharge  and
ordered to pay compensation and costs. He was also convicted,  on  the  same
day, of failing to surrender  to  custody  at  an  appointed  time  and  was
ordered to pay a fine or serve a day in prison.

On 10 August 2015 the appellant was convicted of  five  separate  counts  of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm, failing to provide  a  specimen  for
analysis, assaulting a constable, driving otherwise than accordance  with  a
licence and using a vehicle without insurance. He was sentenced to  a  total
of 12 months' imprisonment and was ordered to pay �900 towards  court  costs
as well as a victim surcharge of �100. He was disqualified from driving  for
12 months and his licence was endorsed.


The nature of the offence is described in the respondent's  decision  of  12
February 2016 as follows. On 16 May 2015 the police were contacted when  the
appellant was observed driving erratically and clearly drunk. He  approached
the police officers and was verbally  abusive  and  refused  to  supply  his
details or give a breath sample. He was arrested, handcuffed and put in  the
police car. Whilst the police car was  travelling,  he  kicked  out  at  the
officer who was driving and caused him  to  lose  control  of  the  car  and
swerve into the opposite carriageway until he  managed  to  regain  control.
The appellant continued to be verbally abusive  and  to  struggle  with  the
police. The police officer who had been driving sustained an injury  to  his
hand as a result.

In light of the conviction, the appellant was notified on 21 September  2015
of his liability to deportation and was asked to give reasons why he  should
not be deported. His solicitor responded, raising Article 8 issues.


On 12 February 2016 the respondent made a decision to deport  the  appellant
on grounds of public policy in accordance with regulations 19(3)(b)  and  21
of the EEA Regulations. In making that  decision,  the  respondent  accepted
that the appellant had acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK  on
the basis of five years' residence exercising  treaty  rights,  although  it
was not accepted that he had been continuously resident for 10  years  under
the  regulations.  Accordingly,   consideration   was   given   to   whether
deportation was justified on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
security. The respondent noted the nature of the  appellant's  offence,  the
potential danger caused and the harm and injuries to  the  victims.  It  was
noted that the OASys assessment found the appellant to pose a  low  risk  of
re-offending, but the harm  that  would  be  caused  was  considered  to  be
serious. The respondent considered that the appellant  posed  a  significant
threat to the safety and security of  the  public  and  concluded  that  his
deportation  was  justified   on   serious   grounds   of   public   policy.
Consideration was given to the fact that he had a  child,  two  sisters  and
his mother in the UK and was in lawful employment  but  considered  that  he
could reintegrate into private life in Lithuania. The  respondent  concluded
that the appellant's  deportation  to  Lithuania  would  not  prejudice  his
prospects of rehabilitation. As regards Article 8, the  respondent  accepted
that the appellant had a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with
his child, a Lithuanian national born on 25 September 2008,  but  considered
that it would not be unduly harsh for his child to remain in the  UK  whilst
he was deported. It was  noted  that  the  appellant  was  no  longer  in  a
relationship with the child's mother.  The  respondent  concluded  that  the
appellant could not meet the requirements in paragraph 399(a)  and  (b)  and
paragraph  399A  and  that  there  were  no  very  compelling  circumstances
outweighing the public interest in his deportation.  His  deportation  would
not, therefore, breach Article 8 of the ECHR.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was heard on  20
June 2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Birk.

Judge Birk heard from the appellant, his two sisters  and  his  mother.  She
concluded that the circumstances did not establish that there  were  serious
grounds for believing that the appellant represented a genuine, present  and
sufficiently serious threat to the public.  The  judge  accordingly  allowed
the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on
the grounds that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  by  failing  to  consider
rehabilitation in line with the principles in MC  (Essa  principles  recast)
[2015] UKUT 520 and by failing to consider  the  lack  of  evidence  of  the
appellant having addressed his former offending triggers.

Permission to appeal was initially refused by the First-tier  Tribunal,  but
was then granted on 12 August 2016 by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kekic  on  the
grounds raised.

Appeal hearing and submissions

Mr Mills submitted that the judge had erred by concluding that  because  the
appellant was considered by the probation services to pose a low risk of re-
offending, serious grounds of public policy or severity had  not  been  made
out. His submission was that the judge should  have  done  more  and  should
have looked at the triggers leading to the offending,  which  in  this  case
was excess drinking, and should have noted that there  was  no  evidence  to
show that the appellant  had  sought  to  address  that  trigger.  The  only
evidence was that of the  appellant  who  claimed  not  to  have  drunk  any
alcohol since May 2015, yet he had been in prison for the  majority  of  the
time. The judge had therefore erred by failing to do  more  to  justify  the
conclusion she reached that the appellant would not re-offend.

The appellant did not have anything to say in reply,  other  than  that  the
fact that he had not re-offended showed that he was not drinking.

Consideration and findings.

It seems to me that Judge Birk gave full and careful  consideration  to  all
the evidence before her when considering whether the appellant posed a  risk
to the public. At [21] she considered the appellant's  criminal  record  and
the nature of his offending;  at  [22]  she  noted  the  sentencing  judge's
remarks as to the appellant's character,  that  he  was  a  person  of  good
character who had shown remorse for his actions; and at  [23]  to  [26]  she
considered and addressed the probation services reports including  the  pre-
sentence report, the OASys assessment and a probation officer's report.

The grounds assert that the judge simply relied upon the conclusion  in  the
probation reports as to the appellant posing a  low  risk  of  re-offending,
but did not actually give full consideration herself to any ongoing risk  by
questioning  the  appellant's  efforts  to  address  the  trigger   to   his
offending, namely alcohol. However that is clearly not  the  case.  Contrary
to Mr Mills' submission, the evidence of the appellant's  awareness  of  the
effects of alcohol and his attempt to  address  that  matter  did  not  only
consist of the appellant's own oral evidence. A closer look at  the  content
of the probation reports, in particular the pre-sentence reports  and  OASys
reports, shows that that was a matter considered in  some  detail  in  those
reports and relied upon by the judge. At [23]  the  judge  referred  to  the
conclusions in the pre-sentence report. In the report the probation  officer
referred at page 5 to the influence of alcohol in the appellant's  offending
history and to the offence being an aberration and at page 7 he referred  in
detail to the issue of alcohol misuse. Significantly, the report  refers  to
the fact that the  appellant  did  not  fit  the  criteria  for  an  alcohol
treatment requirement, supporting the appellant's evidence recorded at  [27]
of the judge's decision that if there  were  necessary  courses  offered  he
would comply. The OASys report, at I3 of  the  respondent's  appeal  bundle,
also referred to the appellant's abstinence from alcohol and  the  views  of
the probation services in that regard. Clearly, therefore, the  question  of
the appellant addressing the trigger to his offending  was  something  fully
and carefully considered by the judge on  the  basis  of  all  the  evidence
available. The fact that the appellant had not presented  tangible  evidence
by way of certificates was not, in my view, a reason to  conclude  that  the
judge had not given full and proper consideration to the relevant matter.

The respondent's grounds also assert that the judge failed to  consider  the
question of rehabilitation, but it is clear that she did give  consideration
to the matter, in accordance  with  the  guidance  in  MC.  Aside  from  the
matters already considered, namely the appellant's efforts  to  address  the
trigger of his offending, the judge gave careful consideration to the  other
matters referred to in [8] of the head-note to MC,  specifically  addressing
at [29] the question of rehabilitation, and taking account of the fact  that
the appellant's former employers were happy to take him  back  and  that  he
had resumed work and taking account of his family ties.

It seems to me, therefore, that the assertions made  by  the  respondent  in
the grounds are simply not made out. The judge's decision is a  careful  and
thorough one, taking account of all relevant matters and all  the  evidence.
The judge gave full and cogent reasons for making the findings that she  did
and the conclusions that she reached  were  entirely  open  to  her  on  the
evidence.

For all of these reasons I conclude  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  do  not
disclose any errors of law in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  requiring
the decision to be set aside.

DECISION

The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly dismissed. The making of  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a  point  of
law, such that the decision has to be set aside. I  do  not  set  aside  the
decision.  The  decision  to  allow  Mr  Lazdauskis's   deportation   appeal
therefore stands.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order for anonymity. I  see  no  reason
    for that order to continue and I therefore discharge the order.
