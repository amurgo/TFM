    1. Pursuant to the Rule 24 response of the Secretary of State  dated  22
       May 2019, I allow the appeal of  the  appellant  and  set  aside  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  I  re-make  the  decision
       allowing the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary
       of State.

       citizenship.  This decision reflects  the  current  understanding  of
       s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act,  as  amended,  and  the  decision  of  the
       Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) and  others  v  SSHD  [2018]  UKSC  53;
       [2019] Imm AR 400.

       DECISION

        i) I allow the appellant's appeal and set aside the decision of the
           First-tier Tribunal.

       ii) I re-make the decision allowing the appellant's  appeal  against
           the decision of the Secretary of State  made  on  25  June  2018
           refusing him leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
