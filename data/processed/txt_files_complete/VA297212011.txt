                                     and

                           Entry Clearance Officer

                                                                  Respondent





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. On 4 June 2013, the Upper Tribunal  received  a  letter  from  Mr  M
       Rafiq, the sponsor of the appellants' proposed visit to  the  United
       Kingdom. He wrote that "I would like to inform you  that  I  do  not
       have contact with [the appellants] and take  no  responsibility  for
       them."
    2. The applications for entry clearance indicate  that  the  appellants
       intended to reside with Mr Rafiq during  their  visit.  Indeed,  the
       issue  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the  appeal  concerns   the
       availability of accommodation. I have no reason to  doubt  that  the
       letter which the Upper Tribunal has received has been  sent  by  the
       proposed United Kingdom sponsor of  these  appellants  and,  in  the
       light of the contents of that letter, I consider that the appellants
       cannot now possibly succeed in their appeals before  this  Tribunal.
       In the  circumstances,  I  have  decided  to  determine  the  appeal
       forthwith and without a hearing. For the avoidance  of  doubt,  this
       determination supersedes the directions which I  issued  on  14  May
       2013.

       DECISION


       These appeals are dismissed














      Signed
