Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Muquit of Counsel instructed by Barar &
Associates
For the Respondent:    Ms C Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Ross promulgated on 2  April  2019,  in  which  the
    Appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse her  application  for
    an EEA Residence Card as an extended  family  member  under  Regulation
    8(2) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 dated
    27 March 2018 was dismissed.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Algeria, born on 20 February  1967,  who
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in 2002 and to  have  been
    living here with Cherif Atmani (the  Sponsor),  her  nephew  who  is  a
    French national, ever since.  She first made an application for an  EEA
    Residence Card as the extended family  member  of  the  Sponsor  on  23
    February 2016.

 3. The Respondent refused the application  the  basis  that  although  the
    family relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor was accepted,
    there was insufficient evidence to establish  financial  dependency  on
    the Sponsor prior to the Appellant  entering  the  United  Kingdom  and
    similarly insufficient evidence that she has continued to be  dependent
    on the Sponsor or  residing  with  him  in  the  same  household  since
    entering the United Kingdom.  The Respondent noted  in  particular  the
    lack  of  documentary  evidence  supporting  any  of  the   Appellant's
    application  and  that  written  statements  on  their  own  were   not
    sufficient.

 4. Judge Ross dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated  on  2  April
    2019 on the basis that the Appellant had not established that  she  was
    dependent on, nor a member of the Sponsor's household in Algeria or  in
    the United Kingdom.  The findings were as follows:

         "19.  I have considered the appeal under  Regulation  8(2)  of  the
         Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations   2016.    The
         appellant would be an "extended family member" of her EEA  national
         only if she can show that she was  dependent  upon  her  nephew  in
         Algeria before she came to the UK and  continues  to  be  dependent
         upon him in the UK or is a member of his household.

         20.  I am not  satisfied  the  before  she  came  to  the  UK,  the
         appellant was financially dependent upon her  nephew  his  date  of
         birth is 29 August 1970 and therefore would have been aged 23  when
         he  left  Algeria.   The  household  in  Algeria  was   never   the
         appellant's nephew's household, given that  his  father  was  alive
         until January  2019.   I  do  not  accept  the  evidence  that  all
         transactions in Algeria have to be  done  in  cash  because  it  is
         impossible to open a bank account.

         21.  I find the evidence of cash being  taken  to  Algeria  by  the
         nephew's  friends  was  vague  and  non-specific.   No  documentary
         evidence has been produced of any trips undertaken with the purpose
         of transferring  cash  to  the  appellant  from  her  nephew.   The
         appellant's nephew could have referenced cash withdrawals from  his
         account to specific times and dates when his friends were  visiting
         Algeria and taking his cash with them.  He has not done so.

         22.  Further, I find the evidence that  the  appellant  is  totally
         financially dependent upon her nephew in the UK is also  vague  and
         non-specific.  Mr Atmani was unable to be clear as to how much  the
         cases and every month [sic] and the appellant's  evidence  on  that
         point was that the amount varies.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
         appellant has no other  sources  of  income  other  than  the  cash
         handouts from her nephew.  There is no documentary evidence of  the
         appellant living in her nephew's house,  notwithstanding  that  she
         has been in the UK since 2002.

         23.  I do not accept the evidence of the appellant's nephew that he
         was unaware of how to  regularise  his  aunt's  immigration  status
         until 2016 when he consulted a solicitor.  No credible  explanation
         has been provided as to why the appellant came to the UK  illegally
         and remained here for  14  years  before  making  any  attempts  to
         regularise her status.  The appellant's own evidence was  that  she
         said she was not alone and was living with  her  nephew  who  could
         have helped at any time and did not until 2016.

         24.  I find if the appellant was genuinely a dependent of a  nephew
         who came to the UK for that reason, an application would have  been
         made soon after her arrival and not 16 years later.  I bear in mind
         of course that lack of immigration status has limited relevance  in
         an EEA residence permit application.  However, given  the  lack  of
         documentary evidence and other reliable evidence as to  dependency,
         the appellant's credibility and the credibility of her  nephew  are
         relevant factors.

         25.  Given the  lack  of  reliable  and  credible  evidence  as  to
         dependency I find that the appellant  is  not  an  extended  family
         member under Regulation eight 8 of the EEA Regulations 2016.  Since
         this is an EEA appeal I cannot consider  any  human  rights  issues
         raised, such as the appellant's private life with her nephew or her
         nephew's children.  It is open  to  the  appellant  to  make  human
         rights application should she wish to do so."

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals on the ground that the First-tier Tribunal  erred
    in law in failing to consider the evidence in support of her appeal  as
    a whole.  Specifically, that the  First-tier  Tribunal  fails  to  make
    findings as to the credibility of the numerous witnesses  who  provided
    written statements and attended the oral hearing and  simply  dismissed
    the  evidence  as  vague  and  non-specific.   Further,  the  Appellant
    challenged the First-tier Tribunal's decision on  the  basis  that  the
    wrong legal test had been applied by the  reference  to  being  totally
    financially dependent in the decision.

 6. At the oral hearing, I gave a preliminary  indication  to  the  parties
    that I considered that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in
    failing to assess in particular the credibility of the witness evidence
    in support of the appeal and failing to give adequate reasons  for  the
    findings made.  On behalf of the Respondent, Ms  Chuna  accepted  these
    errors  in  the  decision.   However  as  indicated  in  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal, the primary issue is whether  those  errors  were
    material to the outcome of the appeal.

 7. As set out by the First-tier Tribunal in paragraph 19 of  the  decision
    under appeal, Regulation 8(2) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 provides that a person  is  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national only if they can show either prior dependents
    or membership of the same household  in,  in  this  case  Algeria,  and
    continuing dependence or membership of  the  household  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 8. At the outset of the oral hearing,  I  identified  to  the  parties  my
    concern that even if all of the witness evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal was accepted as credible (upon which I make no  finding),  the
    Appellant would still not  be  able  to  establish  that  she  met  the
    requirements of Regulation 8(2), specifically  because  she  could  not
    show prior dependence or membership of the same household  in  Algeria.
    It was accepted on behalf of the Appellant that there was no  error  in
    the First-tier Tribunal's finding that the Appellant was not  a  member
    of the Sponsor's household in Algeria, given that he was at  that  time
    only a junior member of a large extended family living together and  it
    was not his household.  That  leaves  only  the  possibility  of  prior
    financial dependence.

 9. Mr Muquit submitted that the Appellant's  case  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was a straightforward one, her appeal was based  on  the  fact
    that she was divorced, had never worked in Algeria  and  had  no  other
    source of income in Algeria, such  that  she  was  totally  financially
    dependent on the Sponsor then  and  now.   He  was  however  unable  to
    identify any evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  beyond  a  brief
    statement from  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  asserting  financial
    dependency.  There was for example no  evidence  of  whether,  even  if
    accepted, the cash transfers were for the sole benefit of the Appellant
    rather than the  family  household  within  which  she  was  living  in
    Algeria, nor in any event as to what the money was used for and whether
    it was to meet the Appellant's essential needs.

10. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Chuna submitted that the accepted error
    by the First-tier Tribunal in the assessment of  the  witness  evidence
    was not material because in any event the evidence  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, even taking at its  highest,  did  not  establish  prior
    financial dependency on the Sponsor in Algeria  because  there  was  no
    evidence of whether the money was for the sole benefit of the Appellant
    or for her and/or her wider family and  no  evidence  of  what  it  was
    actually being used for.  Further, it was maintained that in  assessing
    the credibility of the witness evidence,  it  would  be  reasonable  to
    expect that there would be some documentary evidence in support of  the
    statements made as to the money transferred.

11. On behalf of the Appellant, Mr  Muquit  submitted  that  it  would,  in
    essence, be unfair on the Appellant if her appeal were to fail at  this
    stage  on  the  basis  of  insufficient  evidence  of  prior  financial
    dependency in Algeria when the focus of the  Respondent's  reasons  for
    refusal and evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was specifically as
    to the lack of documentary evidence of the transfers of cash  from  the
    Sponsor to the Appellant in Algeria.  It would not be procedurally fair
    on the Appellant if her appeal was then refused for a different  aspect
    of her case which she was not put on  notice  about.   The  appeal  was
    previously on a much more narrow issue and what the money was spent  on
    was not asked of the Appellant.

Findings and reasons

 1. As indicated above and to the parties at the outset of the  hearing,  I
    find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in its assessment of the
    evidence before it on behalf of the Appellant, with  conclusions  being
    given without sufficient reasons and with no specific assessment of the
    credibility  of  numerous  witnesses   whose   evidence   was   largely
    unchallenged before it.   It  was  not  sufficient  to  simply  say  in
    paragraphs 20 and 21 that the evidence is not  accepted  and  that  the
    witness evidence was vague and non-specific.  Further,  the  suggestion
    that the Sponsor could have referenced cash withdrawals from  his  bank
    account at specific times and dates from the period 1996  to  2002  was
    unrealistic.  The First-tier Tribunal simply failed to engage with  the
    evidence that was before it and if it was the case that it  was  simply
    not accepted because of the lack of documentary  evidence  in  support,
    that should have been expressly stated and reasoned.  It was not.

 2. However, even if all of the evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    including the witness evidence, was accepted to be credible  and  taken
    at its highest, I  find  for  the  reasons  set  out  below,  that  the
    Appellant could not in any event satisfy the requirements of Regulation
    8 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  such
    that the error cannot be material to the outcome of the appeal.

 3. In order to establish dependency, the Court of Appeal confirmed in  the
    case of Lim v Entry Clearance Officer Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383, that
    it is not enough simply to show  that  financial  support  is  in  fact
    provided by the EU citizen to the family  member,  but  also  that  the
    family member must need the support from his or her relatives in  order
    to meet his or her basic needs.  If the  person  can  support  himself,
    there is no dependency, even if he is given financial support by the EU
    citizen as the additional resources would not be  necessary  to  enable
    him to meet his  basic  needs.   If  a  person  is  unable  to  support
    themselves from their own resources, the court will not need to ask why
    that is the case, save perhaps where there is an abuse of  rights.   If
    for example a person chooses not to seek employment  and  become  self-
    supporting, that is irrelevant.

 4. In the present appeal, the witness evidence in relation  in  particular
    to the transfer of cash from the Sponsor to the Appellant  in  Algeria,
    even if wholly accepted, is not on its  own  sufficient  in  accordance
    with Lim to establish dependency.  The provision of  financial  support
    alone is not enough, it must also be established that the person  needs
    the support to meet his or her basic needs.  As to whether she  did  or
    could have done so in the present appeal, it is necessary to look  more
    closely at the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal on this
    point.

 5. With her original application for an EEA  residence  card  made  on  23
    February 2016, a letter of support was provided by the  Sponsor  and  a
    statement from the Appellant herself.   The  letter  from  the  Sponsor
    states that the Appellant is living with him as  a  family  member  and
    that he has supported her financially since her  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom and also before her  arrival  by  sending  money  with  trusted
    family members and friends whenever somebody visited.  Details are also
    provided of the Sponsor's brother, a French citizen who also helps  the
    Appellant  financially.   The  Appellant's   statement   includes   the
    following:

         "1- Since Cherif and Moussa Atmani moved to  France  in  1993  they
         always managed to send me (us) money  through  friends  and  family
         whenever they find an opportunity.

         2-3- My brother Mohamed Abdelaziz  Atmani  (Cherif's  and  Moussa's
         Dad) was the person in charge of the house as we were living  under
         his wings with his wife and children as Nordine Atmani was  only  a
         child of 10 years old, Mohamed  Abdelaziz  Atmani  was  the  person
         supporting all the family until he moved to France after  his  wife
         and children Haroun, Nordine and Naziha Atmani left Algeria  to  go
         to France to live in the meantime Moussa  always  managed  to  send
         money to Algeria to support us.

         4- The address in Algeria is ...

         My brother Mohamed Abdelaziz Atmani was responsible  for  the  rent
         and all other bills, nothing to do with me.  My mother  retired  at
         the age of 60 and now she's 85 years old,  her  income  was  200  a
         month Algerian money about �20 a month in the UK.

         5- My sister Keltoum  Atmani  (disable),  my  other  sister  Fatiha
         Atmani, my brother Mohamed Abdelaziz Atmani with his  wife  Malicat
         Atmani and their children Haroun, Nordine and Naziha Atmani, Cherif
         and Moussa Atmani left to France 1993 and 1992 respectively.

         6- I don't know how much my brother Mohamed  Abdelaziz  Atmani  was
         paying all the bills as he was the man in charge and as he knows  a
         woman it is not my business to stick my nose in.

         ...

         9- Cherif pays my phone bill it is a pay as you go and it  is  only
         �10 a month.  He makes sure I eat and drink properly  when  I'm  in
         his house and Nordine does  the  same.   They  all  support  me  my
         brother Mohamed Atmani and his four sons  Cherif,  Moussa,  Haroune
         and Nordine all contribute to my financial support, Cherif  is  the
         person in charge if I need something Cherif will make sure  I  will
         get it from France or the UK that means  from  my  brother  Mohamed
         Abdelaziz or his sons Moussa and Haroun  who  lives  in  France  or
         Cherif and Nordine in the UK.

         ...

         I always lived with Cherif as we are  brother  and  sister  as  I'm
         three years older than him we live together in Algeria all our life
         I come to the UK in 2002 I was in ...  and  2007  September  15  we
         moved to ... The landlord passed away his daughter wanted the  flat
         and Cherif could not get a house to rent as he had  three  children
         he end up in temporary accommodation  where  I  had  to  stay  with
         Nordine since but I still go to stay a couple of days a  week  with
         Cherif's family as they are my family and I consider  the  children
         as my own children."

 6. It is  clear  from  this  initial  statement,  supported  also  by  the
    Appellant's oral evidence, that in Algeria she  lived  in  an  extended
    household family group with her mother, siblings and their families and
    that the household was financially sustained by the Appellant's brother
    (at least until he went to France in 1992/93) and her mother's  income.
    Further, that financial support was provided not only to the  Appellant
    but also to other members of her family living in  Algeria.    Although
    it is not entirely clear whether the Appellant is referring to  support
    in Algeria or the United Kingdom, the statement also contains  evidence
    that the Appellant was financially supported by several members of  her
    family, including her brother and three of his children as well as  the
    Sponsor.

 7. In the Appellant's written statement  prepared  for  this  appeal,  she
    states the following in relation to her situation in Algeria:

         "3. Before coming to the United Kingdom in September 2002, I  lived
         with Cherif and our family at ... Algeria.

         ...

         6.  Furthermore, I have been financially  dependent  on  Cherif  in
         Algeria and in the United Kingdom ...

         8.  Back when I was living in Algeria, Cherif frequently  sent  the
         cash with the help of her family and friends.   Cherif  would  meet
         them in London are given a certain amount of money  (cash).   Then,
         the family or friend  would  travel  to  Algeria  while  they  were
         visiting family or going on holiday and give me  the  money  (cash)
         personally on behalf of Cherif.

         9.  The reason we use cash instead of bank transfer in  Algeria  is
         because cash  is  a  traditional  way  of  dealing  with  financial
         transactions.  Indeed, banks are  not  as  developed  like  in  the
         United Kingdom.  Cash is more practicable, and we  do  not  provide
         any cash receipts as this  is  deal  within  the  family  and  with
         friends."

 8. The Sponsor's written statement prepared for this appeal is in  similar
    terms and  contains  the  following  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    situation in Algeria:

         "2. I confirm that Ourida has been living with me and our family at
    ... Algeria.

         ...

         6.  I can confirm that Ourida and I have been  living  together  in
         Algeria and in the United Kingdom. ...

         7.  Additionally, I have  been  financially  supporting  Ourida  in
         Algeria and in the United Kingdom.

         8.  Before Ourida joined me in the United Kingdom, I regularly sent
         her cash money through family and  friends.   Whenever  family  and
         friends would travel to Algeria  for  different  reasons,  such  as
         holiday visiting family, they would give my cash money to Ourida on
         my behalf.

         9.  In Algeria, we do not use bank accounts as we do in the  United
         Kingdom.  Cash is the  normal  way  of  transferring  money  making
         payments.  Therefore, cash receipts and  bank  statements  are  not
         easily accessible, and we have the tendency to just deal with  cash
         as this is part of our culture more convenient for us.  It is  very
         common to give money (cash) to family and friends for them to  then
         give it to someone else on our behalf."

 9. In neither of the written statements set out above is there any express
    reference to the Appellant not having any other income in Algeria (save
    for support also  being  given  from  family  members  other  than  the
    Sponsor), whether the cash transfers relied  upon  through  family  and
    friends visiting Algeria were for  the  Appellant's  sole  benefit,  as
    opposed to the family household including the  Appellant's  mother  and
    siblings; nor does it contain even a bare assertion that the money  was
    needed to support the Appellant's basic needs.   The  additional  eight
    written statements from different  individuals  who  gave  evidence  of
    transferring cash from the Sponsor to the Appellant do not contain  any
    details as to who the ultimate beneficiary the cash was,  nor  what  it
    was used for.

10. The oral evidence of the witnesses before the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    recorded in paragraphs 6 to 16 of  the  decision  under  appeal.   This
    included that the Appellant did not work in  Algeria  and  lived  there
    with her mother, siblings and their families.  In  paragraph  9  it  is
    stated that the Sponsor would transfer cash through friends and  family
    to the Appellant in Algeria, sometimes �200, sometimes  �300  depending
    on the year.  There is nothing to suggest that there was any regular or
    set amount of financial support, nor that  it  was  in  response  to  a
    particular request or required sum  of  money,  nor  that  it  was  for
    essential needs.

11. In paragraph 15, it is recorded that the  Sponsor's  brother  confirmed
    the Appellant's living arrangements  in  Algeria  and  stated  that  he
    continues to send money to the Appellant's mother and sister.  He  also
    said "The cash which was sent to Algeria while the appellant was  still
    there, was in order to support the  elderly  grandmother  and  disabled
    sister", although it is not entirely clear  whether  the  reference  to
    cash is financial support given by this witness will  by  the  Sponsor.
    However, it does indicate that cash was given  collectively  by  family
    members outside of Algeria to the family household in Algeria.

12. I have further had regard to the record of proceedings to check whether
    any further evidence was given by any of the witnesses about  financial
    dependency in Algeria which has not been recorded in  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  There was nothing material to the issue under
    consideration not already set out in the decision.

13. Taking into account all of the above, I find that the Appellant has not
    established that she was provided with financial support (even as above
    on the assumption that the cash transfers were made as detailed in  the
    witness evidence) by the Sponsor which she needed to meet her essential
    needs.  There is not even a bare statement to that effect  from  either
    the Appellant or the  Sponsor  and  no  detail  whatsoever  as  to  the
    Appellant's financial circumstances or that of a household  in  Algeria
    after her brother moved to France in 1992/93.  What I do find from  the
    evidence is that there has been financial support from  family  members
    outside of Algeria to the family members within the same  household  in
    Algeria.  I take into account that an individual need not be mainly  or
    wholly financially dependent on the EEA sponsor, but  on  the  lack  of
    detailed evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  evidence  is
    simply not  sufficient  to  establish  that  the  Appellant  personally
    received financial support that she needed to  meet  her  basic  needs,
    such that she could establish that she was financially dependent on the
    Sponsor  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Regulation  8(2)  of   the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.  On that  basis,
    the error  of  law  in  the  assessment  of  the  witness  evidence  in
    particular, by the First-tier Tribunal was not material to the  outcome
    of appeal, which in any event would have been dismissed.

14. I do not accept the submissions by Mr Muquit that in so  finding  there
    is any procedural unfairness to the Appellant on  the  basis  that  the
    issue of financial dependency was outside of  the  narrow  point  being
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal  in  the  appeal.   The  original
    reasons for refusal were, in part, on the basis that the Appellant  has
    not established prior financial dependency on the Sponsor whilst  still
    in Algeria, with reference to  the  lack  of  documentary  evidence  of
    financial support.  That is sufficiently broad to put  prior  financial
    dependency in issue as a reason for refusal and not any narrower  basis
    in relation only to documentary evidence.  The burden is of  course  on
    the Appellant to establish that  she  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Regulations for the issue of an EEA Residence Card, including financial
    dependency, not just transfer of money to  her  from  the  Sponsor  and
    there was insufficient evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  which
    would have enabled such a finding in her favour.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
