Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Young, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    unrepresented the respondent appeared in person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Raikes who for reasons  given  in
    her determination dated 23 April 2014 allowed the  respondent's  appeal
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. The respondent whom I shall refer to as the claimant is a  national  of
    Poland where she was  born  26  February  1986.   She  applied  to  the
    Secretary of State on 13 January 2014 for recognition of her  right  to
    permanent residence in the United Kingdom under the  Regulations  based
    on her employment since 2 January 2009.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the application because,  as  stated  in
    the Reasons for Refusal Letter dated 14 February 2014,

         "However you have failed to provide  sufficient  evidence  to  show
         that  you  were  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  UK  for  five
         continuous years as a worker.  Whilst there is  no  requirement  to
         earn a certain level of income, the low earnings you  are  provided
         on you [sic] P60 certificates, suggest that you may not  have  been
         continuously exercising Treaty Rights in the UK for five continuous
         years as a worker during your five your qualifying period."

 4. Thus it was the continuity of the claimant's  employment  that  was  at
    issue.  She had provided evidence with her application of employment by
    five employers including

    (1)  TPS Fruit and Veg Limited between 25 June 2006 and 8 January  2010
         (described as on and off seasonal work)

    (2)  Cinnamon at Home, 1.1.2009 to 1.1.2010

    (3)  Mr H Cox trading as Fife Arms Hotel, 08.05.2009 to 08.10.2009

    (4)  Mr Bruce and R Scott the Chemist and Coffee Shop 1  February  2011
         to 30 November 2011.

     (5)      Mount West Abattis Mitred  trading  as  Banff  Springs  Hotel,
1.02.2011 to date.

 5. The judge directed herself correctly as to the burden and  standard  of
    proof as on the claimant and the relevant Regulation  (reg.  15(1)(a)).
    She considered the evidence before her with evident care including  the
    claimant's passport,  accession  state  worker  registration  card  and
    accession  state  worker  registration  certificate  as  well  as   P60
    certificates from 2009/10 to 20/12/2013.  In  addition  the  judge  had
    before her a letter from the  claimant's  employer,  wage  slips,  bank
    statements and a registration certificate issued by the Home Office  on
    23 September 2010 as well as a letter from the claimant's sister  dated
    23 February 2014.

 6. The judge reached her conclusion on the evidence in these terms:

         "I have noted that whilst she accepts  that  she  was  receiving  a
         relatively low income, this was due to only being  able  to  access
         part-time employment.   I have also noted however her bank  account
         and the letter of support written by her sister.  I therefore find,
         looking at  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and  the  absence  of  any
         requirement to demonstrate a certain  level  of  income,  that  the
         appellant was exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom  or  a
         continuous period of five years."

     Thus the judge allowed the appeal.

 7. The challenge by the SSHD is that in essence the evidence  only  showed
    at the very highest, four years of employment in  the  UK.   The  judge
    failed to provide adequate reasons.  It was noted that the claimant was
    only able to access part-time employment but the judge had not explored
    the regularity of that employment and the  possibility  of  periods  of
    unemployment.

 8. I heard submissions from Mr Young on behalf of the Secretary of  State.
    The appellant was assisted by  a  Mr  Mohommed  Alauddin  who  holds  a
    residence card as the claimant's family member  which  was  granted  in
    November 2010.  I gave  him  permission  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant. This was after asking Mr Young why the Secretary of State was
    pursuing the appeal as evidently she was  satisfied  in  November  2010
    that the claimant was a qualified person for the purpose of  the  issue
    of the residence card.

 9. Mr Young expanded on the  arguments  in  the  grounds  and  in  essence
    maintained that there was insufficient material  before  the  judge  to
    support the conclusion reached.  He complained that the judge  had  not
    made a finding as to when  the  claimant  had  started  employment  and
    argued there was no P60 for the 2008/2009 tax year.   He  identified  a
    paucity of evidence for the employment with Fife Arms and Cinnamon with
    reference to a single payslip during the following tax year.   The  P60
    for Cinnamon to 2009/2010 was unclear as to how long the  claimant  had
    been working for. The last payslip was for February 2013.   However  he
    acknowledged bank statements reflected the income from the employer  to
    31 December 2013.

10. Mr Alauddin explained that the wage slips for 2009 had  been  lost  but
    said the claimant could rely on the registration scheme card  dated  23
    January 2009 referring to employment with Cinnamon At  Home.   He  drew
    attention to the bank statement reflecting the  employment  closest  to
    the date of application.

11. My conclusions are as follows.  It  is  clear  from  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision that she has not challenged the fact of employment but
    whether it had been of a continuous  nature.   In  my  view  the  judge
    reached her conclusions without arguable error.  The  task  before  her
    was to decide on the balance of probabilities whether the claimant  had
    been continuously employed as claimed and I am persuaded that based  on
    the evidence her finding was one which she was entitled  to  reach.   I
    consider there is force in Mr Alauddin's point that  the  authorisation
    from the Secretary of State under the worker registration scheme  which
    refers to a job start date of 2 January 2009 read with the letter  from
    Mr Chowdhury trading as Cinnamon At Home was  sufficient  to  show  the
    fact of employment with that firm from the beginning of  January  2009.
    The further evidence reflected in the P60 end of year  certificate  for
    2009/2010 for that  employment  indicated  that  although  the  payment
    overall received was modest, it was sufficient.

12. As to the evidence of employment leading up to the date of application,
    the bank statements demonstrated as recently  as  31  December  2013  a
    payment from Mount West Abattis of ï¿½502.89 on 31 December 2013.

13. The Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  questioned  the  continuity  of  the
    claimant's employment in general terms without  specific  reference  to
    any of the varying employments of which  evidence  had  been  provided.
    That was the case the claimant was required to meet and I am  satisfied
    on the evidence that the judge reached a permissible conclusion on  the
    evidence before her.

14. The grounds of challenge to the judge's decision  do  not  persuade  me
    that the evidence only showed  four  years  of  employment  in  the  UK
    particularly in the light of the evidence in  the  bank  statement  for
    December  2013.   I  consider  the  judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for
    accepting the  evidence  before  her  including  the  letter  from  the
    claimant's sister.

15. In summary, therefore, the challenge is a disagreement rather than  one
    which identifies error of law.   This appeal is dismissed.
