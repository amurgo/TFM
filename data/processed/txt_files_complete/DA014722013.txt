                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Goodman, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Anderson, instructed by Government Legal
Department


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, whose nationality  is  in  dispute,  appeals  against  a
    decision of the respondent made on 9 July 2013 that he is a  person  to
    whom section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies.  That was on the
    basis that he had been sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment for  robbery,
    attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent.

 2. This appeal was brought before the amendments to section 82 and section
    84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (enacted by  the
    Immigration Act 2014) came into force. By operation of Articles  9  and
    11 of the Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement  No  3,  Transitional  and
    Saving Provisions) Order 2014, sections 82 and 84 of the 2002 Act apply
    in this appeal as they were in force prior to the changes introduced by
    the 2014 Act.

 3. The appeal against the decision made was heard by Designated First-tier
    Tribunal Judge McCarthy who dismissed it in a determination promulgated
    on 11 October 2018.  That decision was set aside for  the  reasons  set
    out in my decision promulgated on 4 October 2019, a copy  of  which  is
    annexed to this decision.

History of this appeal

 4. This  is  a  "limbo"  case,  that  being  a  convenient  shorthand  for
    describing the position of a  person  whom  the  respondent  wishes  to
    deport or remove, but  where  there  is  a  limited  prospect  of  ever
    effecting his deportation or removal.

 5. The core of the dispute in  this  case  is  the  extent  to  which  the
    appellant  has  been  co-operative   to   permit   the   obtaining   of
    documentation  and  whether  the  alleged  lack  of  co-operation   has
    contributed to the impossibility of achieving deportation.

 6. The appellant's case is that he was  born  in  Portugal  in  1977,  his
    father being a Portuguese national and an  officer  in  the  Portuguese
    Forces; his mother was a Jamaican citizen.  He left Portugal at the age
    of 3, the family going to live in the United States  where  his  father
    was a military attach� attached to the Portuguese Embassy in Washington
    DC.  He arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993  and  has  remained  here
    since.

 7. On 21 July 2005 the  appellant  was  convicted  of  robbery,  attempted
    robbery and two offences of possession  of  an  imitation  firearm  and
    sentenced to nine years' imprisonment, offences committed in 2003.   On
    11 September 2008 the respondent issued a notice of decision to make  a
    deportation order against him against which he did not appeal  and,  on
    24 October 2008, the respondent issued a deportation order  made  under
    Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 bearing in mind  the  criteria
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 which were
    then in force.

 8. On 21 September 2010 the appellant was due to be  released  on  licence
    but was instead detained by direction of the Secretary of State and  on
    28 September 2010 she sought  to  deport  him  to  Portugal.   He  was,
    however, returned the same day as there was no  evidence  presented  to
    support his nationality.  He was then detained for a further 38 months.



 9. During that period of detention, the deportation order was  revoked  on
    18 October 2010; the Secretary of State issued  a  further  deportation
    order on the basis that the appellant is a foreign criminal as  defined
    in section 32 (1) of the UK Borders Act 2007. The decision  was  served
    on 11 July 2013 and an apply duly lodged within time.

10. On 16 July 2013 the appellant issued proceedings  for  judicial  review
    seeking: a quashing order against the deportation order  served  on  11
    July 2013; release from detention; and, the award of damages for  false
    imprisonment.

11. A substantive judicial review  application  was  heard  on  28  and  29
    October 2014, the High Court quashing the second deportation order  and
    declaring that the appellant had been  falsely  imprisoned  between  18
    October 2010  and  30  November  2013.   There  then  followed  further
    hearings to consider the quantum of damages.

12. The Secretary of State appealed the High Court's decision to the  Court
    of Appeal which, in the decision reported as R (on the  application  of
    Paulo Antonio) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 48, quashed the decision  of  the
    High Court in respect of the second deportation order and remitted  for
    retrial the issue of the lawfulness of the appellant's  detention  from
    20 January to 30 November 2013.  The retrial did  not  proceed  as  the
    action was settled by consent. The Secretary  of  State's  position  is
    that this was for pragmatic reasons.

13. The proceedings in the First-tier  Tribunal  were  stayed  pending  the
    outcome of the litigation in the High Court and subsequently the  Court
    of Appeal as the legality of the decision giving rise to the appeal was
    under challenge in those proceedings.

14. The appellant's case is that there is  no  prospect,  or  no  realistic
    prospect, that he can leave the United Kingdom or that his  deportation
    can be enforced in a reasonable period of time to Jamaica, to  Portugal
    or elsewhere.  His case is that he has made a full and frank disclosure
    of all the relevant material about his antecedents in Jamaica, Portugal
    and in the United States; and, has  complied  with  the  Home  Office's
    requests for information.  He accepts that there is no avenue left open
    to him to establish his entitlement to Portuguese nationality and  that
    it has been established, on the basis of detailed investigations by the
    respondent and enquiries made by them, that  the  Jamaican  authorities
    would not accept he is a national.

15. The Secretary of State's case is that the appellant has not in  reality
    been co-operative and has withheld information about  his  origins  and
    history and thus defeating attempts to establish his  nationality.   In
    short, the information he has given cannot be verified, and she submits
    it is false which is  why  the  Jamaican  authorities  (and  Portuguese
    authorities) have been unable to document him.  In doing so she  points
    to discrepancies and inconsistencies in the accounts the appellant  has
    given over time.

16. It is, however, of note that Designated Judge McCarthy records  in  his
    decision that:

         "[50]    In case it is not clear from elsewhere, I record  that  Mr
             Swaby (the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer)  confirmed  the
             respondent accepts the appellant  is  neither  Portuguese  nor
             Jamaican, and cannot be deported to either country.   To  that
             extent, the respondent's position has moved on  slightly  from
             when the Court of Appeal considered matters."

17. It is also of note that since that decision,  on  30  April  2019,  the
    respondent disclosed as part of the  High  Court  proceedings  a  draft
    release referral document in  which,  amongst  other  matters,  it  was
    stated that  the  appellant  may  have  been  compliant  and  had  been
    forthcoming with information.

18.  The  Secretary  of  State,  although  not  seeking  to  withdraw   her
    concession, maintains her position that  the  appellant  has  not  been
    candid and that any compliance has been apparent rather than real.

The Hearing on 15 March 2021

19. It  is  unfortunate  that  despite  my  error  of  law  decision  being
    promulgated in 2019, it was not possible to list this appeal before  15
    March 2021.  A hearing listed on 31 January 2020 had  to  be  abandoned
    and it was not possible to list this for hearing owing to the pandemic.
     I am, however, indebted  to  both  sets  of  solicitors  in  providing
    comprehensive bundles and to both Counsel for  production  of  skeleton
    arguments.

20. It is common ground that the appeal was to be heard de  novo  and  that
    none of the findings of fact reached  by  Judge  McCarthy  were  to  be
    maintained.  I heard evidence from the appellant and Ms Okoh.   I  also
    heard evidence via Skype from Ms B  Haque  and  Ms  G  Carpenter,  Home
    Office officials and from Mr Hilaire Sobers, an expert  witness  relied
    on by the appellant.  In addition, I had before me the following:

      1) Consolidated bundle paginated from A1 to G77.

      2) Supplementary bundle.

      3) Further supplementary bundle.

      4) Authorities bundle.

      5) Skeleton argument from Ms Anderson.

      6) Skeleton argument from Mr Goodman.

21. The appellant adopted his witness statement  adding  that  he  had  not
    heard anything from the Portuguese  Consulate  since  the  conversation
    which he had had with their official, Ms Morgado, on 4 June  2020,  nor
    had he been contacted with regard to possible Jamaican nationality.  He
    said he had not been asked by the Home Office for  further  information
    regarding Jamaican nationality.

22.  In  cross-examination  the  appellant  was  referred  to  the  witness
    statements of Ms Haque which set out the alleged discrepancies  in  his
    various  accounts.   He  said  that  he  had  not  seen  these  witness
    statements before.  He said that he could not actually remember what he
    had said in 2011 but he was sure it was not an  accurate  recording  of
    what he had said.  He said he was aware of the previous allegations  of
    inconsistency.  He said that what was recorded at paragraph  19  should
    be "1990" not "1991".  He  said,  responding  to  the  exhibit  at  BC4
    referring to the qualifications he had obtained in Jamaica and then  in
    New Jersey, USA ( O levels and A levels),  that  although  he  recalled
    putting down the names of St Anne's College  and  Newark  College,  New
    Jersey he had not attended either.  He had chosen a college in  Jamaica
    because people always assumed that he is Jamaican.  He  said  that  the
    name "Major" which appears in his name was a nickname which he had used
    from about the age of 16.

23. Asked about his date of birth being given as 27  May  1975  (page  146,
    page 159) that it should be 1977, that he had not corrected it  because
    it was some twenty  years  ago.  He  said  he  had  ticked  the  "black
    Caribbean" box of ethnic origin in the job application form as that was
    what he identified with.

24. He said that on his birth certificate his parents and nationalities had
    been recorded but he had not seen it since before he was  12  years  of
    age.

25. The appellant said that he had had a ten year passport issued  in  1991
    and a Portuguese ID card issued at the same time.  He said that the  ID
    card had been retained by the police in Telford and  the  passport  had
    been retained later when he had been arrested by police from  Tottenham
    Police Station in 2003.  He said that neither had been returned to him.



26. Asked what identity  documents  he  had  used  from  2001  onwards  the
    appellant said that he had held a provisional licence and that  he  had
    opened accounts with Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds TSB  banks  prior  to
    the expiry of his passport.  He said he had not had  a  reason  not  to
    renew his passport but that he had not done so.

27. The appellant denied that the information he had  given  about  by  his
    father's identity was not  true  and  he  could  not  explain  why  the
    Portuguese Embassy had not  been  able  to  verify  details  about  his
    father.  He said he could not explain it and  he  had  given  the  best
    information.  It was also put to him that he had not  given  the  right
    details and name about his mother which was why there was no record  of
    her and that if he tried, he would be able to contact his siblings.  He
    said he could not say  why  the  Jamaican  government  could  not  find
    records relating to his mother but that it was false to say that he had
    chosen not to be in contact with family.  He said  he  had  fallen  out
    with his sister and had not spoken to her since he  went  into  prison.
    He said he had tried to contact her since but not been able to  do  so.
    He had tried contacting the telephone numbers of her friends but on the
    last occasion in 2014, he had been told that she  no  longer  lived  in
    Georgia.  He said he had last tried to  contact  his  brother  in  2011
    before he left detention.  He did not know what happened to him, he had
    tried to contact him by phoning ex-girlfriends.  He  said  one  by  the
    name of Jennifer, whose surname he did not know, lives in Maryland, and
    said she had not seen him for a long time.

28. It was put to the  appellant  that  if  he  wanted  to,  he  could  get
    sufficient information to get a Jamaican passport.  He said  that  that
    was not so.  He confirmed that his unlawful detention  claim  had  been
    settled.

29. In re-examination, he said that he  had  not  told  the  truth  in  his
    application to DENSO as he really wanted the job, that they had  wanted
    somebody who knew about assembly work so he had lied to  get  the  job.
    He said with regard to page 156, at the time  he  did  not  really  see
    things as they ought to be done and did not care about certain  things,
    which is why he had not put down the correct date.  He  confirmed  that
    he had not spoken to his sister since before he went to prison in 2003.
     The last time he had known her whereabouts was in 1999.

30. The appellant added that his mother's sister was called Sylvia  Johnson
    whose daughter was called Stella Yvette.  He said his  mother  had  two
    other sisters, Audrey and McKenzie as well as a  brother  called  Amos.
    He said he had never seen or heard from them but believed  that  Audrey
    had been living in Canada.  He said that the aunt that came with him to
    London was not a blood relation but a good friend who had died in 1997.
     She had been a Jamaican national.

31. Ms Okoh adopted her witness statement adding that she  currently  lives
    in Nottingham about twenty miles away from where the appellant lives in
    Derby.  She confirmed that she had two boys and two girls as well as  a
    grandchild.  She said that the appellant was close to her children  and
    that, if asked to state his nationality then he would say he was  black
    and assume that he is Jamaican.  He  said  that  they  had  links  with
    Jamaica through her father.  She said her elder son's father now  lives
    in Jamaica but had left to go there many years ago.

32. I then heard evidence from Ms Bridget Haque (formerly  Carter)[1],  who
    adopted her witness statements.  In cross-examination she said that the
    2013 witness statement had been prepared in relation  to  the  judicial
    review claim commenced by the appellant; the second had  been  prepared
    in connection with the High Court damages claim that  followed.   Asked
    how they were prepared, she said that somebody from their "legal  side"
    prepared them but she did not know who and did not remember.  She  said
    that a person preparing the statement would contact her,  then  request
    any emails that she might have in relation to  the  case.  She  gave  a
    summary of her side and the other person produced the witness statement
    and sent it to her.  She made sure that she verified it and  signed  it
    off.  She confirmed that both witness statements had been  prepared  in
    the same way.  She said that she had been able when asked in  preparing
    the 2013 witness statement to verify things.  She  said  she  had  been
    informed that she had to read it through to make  sure  what  they  had
    written was to the best of her knowledge.

33. Ms Haque said that the decision as to what was to be exhibited  to  her
    statements and what was just to be summarised was not  a  decision  she
    made.  Asked about exhibit BC4  and  whether  she  had  chosen  not  to
    exhibit the release referral she said somebody had asked her if she had
    it and she had said she did not have it in her folder.   She  said  she
    knew it had existed because she had written it and it was noted in  the
    statement that had been written.  She was not sure why it had not  been
    attached to  the  statement  and  somebody  else  had  dealt  with  the
    attachments.

34. Referred to the letter from GLD of 19  August  2019  stating  that  the
    draft release referral had been found in her inbox [F58], she  accepted
    that she would at the time have had access to it.  She was  asked  why,
    if she had written in the release referral that the appellant had  been
    compliant, she had not mentioned in her witness statement [41] that  he
    had been forthcoming with information, she said that it is one thing to
    give information, but if it is pursued and it comes back  unfounded  it
    is different.  Ms Haque said she  had  not  mentioned  it  because  the
    statement was written for her and she had not to put it in as  she  did
    not write the statement.  She said that she did understand her duty was
    to make full and frank disclosure and she did not know why it  was  not
    put in her statement.  Asked if it was  because  it  did  not  fit  the
    narrative of the person writing the statement, she  said  she  did  not
    know.

35. In re-examination she was asked if information is given but  cannot  be
    verified whether that was compliant; and, what she had meant  by  being
    compliant.  She had had conduct of the file, had  weekly  conversations
    with  the  appellant.   She  said  someone  can  quite   happily   give
    information yet every avenue they had looked into and investigated  had
    come up null and void.  She said there came a point when the  appellant
    was not complying; he had provided enough  information  to  investigate
    but that everything had turned out false and he was wasting  time  even
    as to his name.  She said there had not been compliance.

36. In  response  to  my  questions  about  how  she  knew  what  tests  or
    investigation had been carried out by those asked to do  so,  she  said
    that they were allocated to specialists  who  used  their  systems  who
    would then tell her what had been found.  She said that this was by way
    of a simple email saying that they had  found  nothing  rather  than  a
    detailed explanation of what had been done.

37. I then heard evidence from Ms Gemma Carpenter who adopted  her  witness
    statement.  She confirmed that she was not giving evidence as an expert
    and she understood the difference  between  fact  and  opinion.   Asked
    about the list of documents said to have been omitted from  the  letter
    of instructions to Hilaire Sobers,  set  out  in  paragraph  5  of  her
    witness statement, she accepted that what was said at 5(a) and (b)  was
    wrong but that it would have been GLD who drafted that.  She  said  she
    assumed that the drafter was David Williams, the gentleman to whom  she
    was speaking. She said that when she had said in the witness  statement
    of truth that it was true, she had just relied on  what  GLD  had  sent
    her.  She accepted that in 2014 the Home Office had been satisfied that
    the appellant was not Portuguese and that  further  investigations  had
    had the same result.  She said these investigations had  been  made  as
    she was not aware that they had gone down the  Portugal  route  before.
    She said they do not at all times check what had been done before it is
    recorded and they rely on colleagues.  It had not been flagged  at  the
    time  that  this  had  been  investigated.   She  said  they  had   not
    investigated again the possibility that the appellant  is  Jamaican  as
    she has been told that there was nothing else  they  could  do  without
    further information.  She accepted she was not an  expert  on  Jamaican
    culture.

38. In re-examination Ms Carpenter confirmed that her role within the  Home
    Office is to redocument individuals, to liaise with  overseas  missions
    and they might arrange interviews. She said that  she  had  operational
    expertise.

39. I then heard evidence from Mr Hilaire Sobers who  adopted  his  witness
    statement and supplementary letter.  He said that as far as that he was
    aware, in order to establish his Jamaican  citizenship,  the  appellant
    would need to provide his mother's birth  certificate,  his  own  birth
    certificates and his mother's passport or government issued  ID,  which
    would need to be originals.

40. In cross-examination Mr Sobers confirmed that there were in effect  two
    types of people returned to Jamaica: those who had money and those  who
    were deportees.  He confirmed that his statement has been targeted with
    respect to those who do not return with money.  He said  that  assuming
    that the appellant  could  be  landed  he  would  be  classified  as  a
    deportee.  He said he had no personal knowledge of  the  appellant  and
    was just acting on instructions given.  He said it was not his practice
    to interview people about whom he was giving an opinion.  He  confirmed
    that the minimum  wage  in  Jamaica  is  approximately  7,000  Jamaican
    dollars a month and that if told that  the  appellant  had  �35,000  on
    which to rely, he considered that hypothetically that would be a  large
    sum. It would be difficult to say how long somebody could live on that,
    it depended  on  where  that  person  lived,  urban  areas  being  more
    expensive  than  rural  areas.   Asked  about  the  provisions  of  the
    Constitution  with  regard  to  nationality  he  said  he  was  not   a
    nationality expert but believed that if you entered as a legal resident
    (that is as an alien, not a commonwealth citizen), you  would  need  to
    establish residence on aggregate for seven years  in  order  to  obtain
    citizenship.  Asked how he knew what documents were needed to establish
    nationality, if not an immigration specialist, he said  had  looked  up
    the information provided by the Passport and  Immigration  Agency.   He
    said he had no knowledge  of  anybody  being  accepted  as  a  Jamaican
    citizen on the basis of interview on arrival.

41. In response to my questions Mr Sobers said  that  he  was  unsure  when
    systems of record keeping of births had changed in Jamaica.

Submissions

42. Ms Anderson submitted that the appellant was  not  credible  given  the
    different accounts he had given and the inconsistencies  identified  in
    Ms Haque's second witness statement.  She submitted that there are also
    inconsistencies between the witness statements of the appellant and his
    oral evidence including as to the names of  siblings  and  his  mother.
    She submitted that some of the details should, like the identity of his
    father, be verifiable given that he had been a government employee  and
    also that one would expect there  to  be  records  of  a  passport  and
    identity  card  being  issued.    This   issue   regarding   Portuguese
    nationality had been put to the officials again and different personnel
    had come up with the same result.

43. Ms Anderson asked me to note that the appellant had  a  conviction  for
    dishonesty, that he was not a man of good character  and  that  he  had
    lied to get a job, which was relevant.  He had given false  information
    as to qualifications and experience  and  false  date  of  birth.   She
    submitted that it was an indicator that he would give false information
    to suit his ends.  She submitted that the information regarding Jamaica
    was vague and the details regarding the mother were not accurate.

44. Ms Anderson submitted that the appellant needed to  show  that  he  was
    giving an  accurate  account  especially  concerning  his  father.   As
    regarding losing touch with siblings he submitted it was not impossible
    to trace people around the world and given that he had dates  of  birth
    and proper names, this ought to have been done.

45. With regard to his Jamaican nationality, Ms Anderson submitted this was
    a matter of law, relying on AS (Guinea) [2018] EWCA Civ  2234  at  [52]
    citing R (on the application of Nhamo) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2012] EWHC 422

46. Ms Anderson submitted that the appellant's mother was Jamaican and as a
    matter of law he was entitled to  nationality  based  on  his  mother's
    nationality at birth.  She accepted that plainly there would  be  cases
    where that information could not be produced  but  that  the  appellant
    ought to be able to produce them and the mother would  have  needed  to
    have some form of identity if she had been able, as was said to be  the
    case, to travel.  The appellant said that he was born in a hospital and
    that with the right name and  details  he  could  be  documented  as  a
    Jamaican national.

47. Ms Anderson submitted that weight could be attached to the evidence  of
    Ms Haque and Ms Carpenter and there had been no significant  change  in
    the Home Office's position.  They had always doubted the evidence about
    his Portuguese antecedence.  Turning  to  the  grounds  of  appeal,  Ms
    Anderson submitted that the decision to deport could not be challenged,
    this being res judicata that it  had  been  decided  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  She submitted further that simply because someone could not be
    removed did not mean that they had to  be  granted  leave,  relying  on
    Jeunesse v The Netherlands [2014] ECHR 1036  where distinction had been
    drawn between positive and negative obligations.

48. Ms Anderson submitted that this appeal ought to be dealt  with  in  the
    basis set out in RA (Iraq) [2019] EWCA Civ 850 and that in  this  case,
    each of the arguments put by the appellant rely  on  his  case  on  the
    evidence being accepted.  There was no fall-back position of what would
    happen if he was not being truthful as he  needed  to  show  he  cannot
    leave the United Kingdom and cannot  document  himself  as  a  Jamaican
    national.  She submitted in this case that  there  was  a  very  strong
    public interest in removal; that the appellant had twice  been  refused
    parole and there was evidence of poor conduct whilst  in  prison.   She
    submitted that there would not be very compelling circumstances here as
    he would be going back with money, having received �35,000 in  damages.
    She submitted that the case had been settled on  pragmatic  grounds  as
    the damages had long since eclipsed the cost of  defending  the  action
    which cost public funds and  was  on  the  basis  of  no  admission  of
    liability.  She submitted further that Ms Okoh had contacts and friends
    in Jamaica on whom the appellant would be able to rely.

49. Ms Anderson submitted that the appellant had not shown that he  was  in
    limbo and that  the  apparent  inability  to  remove  was  because  the
    appellant was not giving accurate information and thus he failed at the
    first hurdle; he was not genuinely in  limbo.   Ms  Anderson  submitted
    that this is a case in which there had been concealment  and  therefore
    it was legitimate to accept that the appellant can  be  removed.   This
    was not  a  case  in  which  the  appellant  said  he  had  never  been
    documented.  She  submitted  that  R  (on  the  application  of  AM)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (legal "limbo") [2021]  UKUT
    62 (IAC) ought not to be followed but in any event was a very different
    factual situation.

50. Ms Anderson submitted that it was not  permissible  to  step  into  the
    shoes of the Secretary of State to  say  that  the  appellant  must  be
    granted leave and that, relying on Kaitey v SSHD [2020] EWHC  1861,  it
    could not be argued that there  is  a  situation  whereby  because  the
    appellant cannot be detained he must be granted leave.

51. Mr Goodman submitted that the respondent's concession was properly made
    on the evidence and that it was not  possible  to  go  behind  it.   He
    submitted that the Secretary of State's position  is  contradictory  in
    that the she appears  to  have  revived  an  intention  to  deport  the
    appellant to Jamaica yet there was the concession that  he  is  neither
    Portuguese nor Jamaican and cannot be deported to either  country,  the
    position previously accepted and which was inescapable on the evidence.
     He submitted that little weight  could  be  attached  to  the  witness
    statements of Ms Haque or Ms Carpenter and that the statements  drafted
    in response to defend the unlawful detention claim required  it  to  be
    said that there was sound evidence of removal to Jamaica to defend  the
    case.  He submitted further that it could not be said, contrary to what
    Ms Haque had said, t all the evidence could not be verified.   Evidence
    had been found relating to the former employers  and  that  no  records
    were available as regards the documents seized by the police.

52. Mr Goodman submitted that the inability of the appellant to  prove  his
    entitlement to Portuguese nationality  did  not  mean  that  the  whole
    account was a fabrication.  He submitted that his evidence was careful,
    that he had listened to the questions and answered them and taken  time
    to respond to the evidence set out in  Ms  Haque's  statements  to  the
    effect that he had been consistent.  He submitted further that I should
    adopt a Lucas direction, that there was no real difference between  the
    appellant's father being a military attach� as opposed to being in  the
    Air Force.  He submitted further that the  discrepancies  in  names  of
    those of Jamaican relatives had not been properly put to him  and  that
    he had properly explained the apparent difference in the  name  of  his
    mother.  He submitted further that  the  name  Stella  had  been  given
    several times, it was not clear why there were  differences,  but  this
    did not undermine the core veracity of the account given.

53. Turning to the evidence of  the  Secretary  of  State's  witnesses,  Mr
    Goodman submitted that they had not written their  own  evidence  which
    was quite a serious matter.  They were in effect  submissions  made  by
    GLD presented as evidence, both statements containing  errors  yet  had
    been signed as statements  of  truth.   He  submitted  there  had  been
    serious failures in disclosure and no proper information how a damaging
    document (the draft referral) had not been  disclosed.   Ms  Haque  had
    been unable to explain why, if it was in her inbox,  it  had  not  been
    disclosed.

54. Mr Goodman submitted that there had been no proper evidence to show why
    the claim had been settled nor evidence to show that this  was  due  to
    the cost to the public purse.

55. Mr Goodman submitted that  insofar  as  it  purports  to  give  opinion
    evidence, Ms Carpenter's evidence should be  disregarded.   Turning  to
    Section 84(1)(g) of the 2002  Act  Mr  Goodman  submitted  that  it  is
    implicit in relying on this Section the appeal must  be  determined  on
    the hypothetical assumption  that  removal  will  be  given  effect  in
    consequence of the immigration decision.   He  submitted  further  that
    this ground was not concerned, unlike the other grounds of appeal, with
    the reality that removal cannot be enforced pursuant to the deportation
    order.  He submitted further that the evidence of Ms Carpenter that the
    Secretary of State would not return the appellant  without  the  agreed
    documentation necessary for immigration demands the Tribunal to  assume
    that removal would be effected, relying on MS (Palestinian Territories)
    v SSHD [2010] 1 WLR 1639 at [23].

56. Turning to the damages award Mr Goodman submitted  that  the  appellant
    would not have access to the �35,000 awarded given that he had to repay
    �13,000 from a previous award.  In addition, there were debts he had to
    repay to people from whom he had borrowed money in the  United  Kingdom
    and there were also statutory charges payable in respect of  legal  aid
    costs.

57. Mr Goodman submitted that it was only a fanciful possibility  that  the
    appellant would be able to obtain his mother's birth certificate.

58. Mr Goodman submitted that submissions that any matter was res  judicata
    were  misconceived  as  judicial  review  requires  that  there  be  no
    alternative remedy, that is  it  considers  something  that  cannot  be
    raised in the First-tier Tribunal which is in this  case  requesting  a
    deport decision to be quashed.

59. Mr Goodman submitted  that  the  effect  of  the  deport  order  is  to
    criminalise the appellant's presence here unless he  is  held  on  bail
    subject to conditions preventing him for applying for leave  to  remain
    or to be treated as being stateless.  He submitted that success in this
    appeal would open an opportunity for him to apply for  leave  and  that
    the Secretary of State, loses nothing if the appellant is not  deported
    or removed given the restrictions that could be imposed on the terms of
    any leave granted.

60. Mr Goodman submitted  that,  following  Kaitey,  immigration  bail  and
    detention  were  corollaries  of  each  other  and  that  liability  to
    detention can only exist where there is a possibility  of  removal.  He
    submitted that if the power to detain does not exist then there  is  no
    liability to detention and that if there is no prospect of removal then
    there is no power to detain.  He submitted that there was, in terms  of
    the ground of appeal under section 84 (1) (c), clearly an  interference
    which would not necessarily achieve the objective  given  the  lack  of
    purpose in maintaining the deportation order.  He submitted, turning to
    RA (Iraq) that this is an actual limbo case.  The appellant cannot just
    leave the United Kingdom, he cannot just change his mind and  establish
    his nationality.  He submitted it was speculation to  suggest  that  he
    could do so and the Secretary of State's concession was properly  made.
    He submitted that this case was similar to that in Mendizabal v France.
     He accepted that the decision in AM  was,  factually  very  different,
    that the appellant was the author of his own misfortune  which  is  not
    the case here.  He submitted that the appellant had not  been  able  to
    prove his own identity let alone his mothers and accordingly the appeal
    ought to be allowed.





The law

61. Under the legislation in force at the date of decision in this  appeal,
    the decisions against which an appeal could be brought were set out  in
    section 82 of the 2002 Act and, so far as is material, provided:

         82 Right of appeal: general

         (1) Where an immigration decision is made in respect of a person he
         may appeal to the Tribunal

         (2) In this Part "immigration decision" means-

             (a) refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom,

             ...

             (j) a decision to make a deportation order under section 5(1)
             of that Act, and

             (k) refusal to revoke a deportation order under section 5(2)
             of that Act.

         (3A) Subsection (2)(j) does not apply to a decision to make a
         deportation order which states that it is made in accordance with
         section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007; but-

             (a) a decision that section 32(5) applies is an immigration
             decision for the purposes of this Part, and

             (b) a reference in this Part to an appeal against an automatic
             deportation order is a reference to an appeal against a
             decision of the Secretary of State that section 32(5) applies.

62. The grounds  of  appeal  against  immigration  decision  were,  at  the
    relevant time, set out in section 84 which provided:

         84 Grounds of appeal

         (1) An appeal under section 82(1) against an immigration decision
         must be brought on one or more of the following grounds-

             (a) that the decision is not in accordance with immigration
             rules;

             ...

             (c) that the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human
             Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) (public authority not to act contrary
             to Human Rights Convention) as being incompatible with the
             appellant's Convention rights;

             ...

             (e) that the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the
             law;

             ...

             (g) that removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom in
             consequence of the immigration decision would breach the
             United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention or
             would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998
             as being incompatible with the appellant's Convention rights.

63. The Secretary of State's powers to deport  foreign  national  offenders
    are set out in Section 32 UKBA 2007.   It  is  not  disputed  that  the
    claimant is  a  foreign  criminal  as  defined  in  that  section.   By
    operation of section 32 (5) UKBA, the Secretary of State  must  make  a
    deportation order in respect of a foreign criminal  unless  she  thinks
    that an exception in section 33  of  the  Act  applies.   That  section
    provides, so far as is relevant, as follows:-

         33 Exceptions

         (1) Section 32(4) and (5)-

         (a) do not apply where an exception in this section applies
         (subject to subsection (7) below), and

         (b) are subject to sections 7 and 8 of the Immigration Act 1971
         (Commonwealth citizens, Irish citizens, crew and other exemptions).

         (2) Exception 1 is where removal of the foreign criminal in
         pursuance of the deportation order would breach-

         (a) a person's Convention rights, or

         (b) the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.

         ...

         (7)  The application of an exception-

             (a)  does not prevent the making of a deportation order;

             (b)  results in it being assumed neither that deportation of
             the person concerned is conducive to the public good nor that
             it is not conducive to the public good;

          but section 32(4) applies despite the application of Exception 1
         or 4.

64. Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, as set out in Schedule  1  to
    the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:

         Article 8

         1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
         life, his home and his correspondence.

         2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others.

65. I am satisfied that the facts of this case on any reasonable view  fall
    within the terms of a "Limbo" case as defined in RA (Iraq).  It  is,  I
    consider, necessary to set out paragraphs [62] to  [72]  of  that  case
    given its centrality to much of the submissions made.

         "62.  In my view, there are four stages to  the  analysis  where  a
         'limbo' argument is raised in this context.

         (1) Stage 1: Distinguish between  prospective  'limbo'  and  actual
         'limbo'

         63.  The term 'limbo' is a convenient shorthand for describing  the
         position of a person whom the SSHD wishes to deport or remove,  but
         there is a limited prospect of ever effecting  his  deportation  or
         removal (for the purposes of this judgment, the  terms  deport  and
         deportation  should  be  viewed  interchangeably  with  remove  and
         removal). The term 'limbo' is loosely used to cover individuals who
         may be in one of two discrete states: (i) first, someone in respect
         of whom a decision to deport has been  taken,  but  no  deportation
         order has in fact been made; or (ii) second, someone in respect  of
         whom a deportation order has already been made but who has not  yet
         been deported. In many cases, an  individual  in  the  first  state
         (such as this Appellant to date) may have suffered little or no day-
         to-day impact on his or her private or family life.   Thus,  for  a
         person in the first state, the effect of possessing leave to remain
         under s. 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 (i.e. pending appeal)  will
         have been that they are free to  work  and  to  enjoy  private  and
         family life.  This may be described as prospective 'limbo'.  Where,
         however, in the second state, a deportation order has in fact  been
         made, there will normally be no leave to remain, and the individual
         will be unable to work, claim benefits or receive more  than  basic
         GP care under the NHS. This may be described as actual 'limbo'.

         64.  In approaching any claim based on 'limbo' grounds,  therefore,
         it is necessary first of  all  to  distinguish  between  these  two
         different  situations,  namely  prospective  'limbo'   and   actual
         'limbo', when assessing the balance between (a) the public interest
         in making or sustaining a decision to deport and then a deportation
         order on the one hand, and (b) the impact on Article  8  and  other
         Convention rights of an individual on the other. The  former  state
         of prospective 'limbo' is likely  to  weigh  less  heavily  in  the
         balance in the interests of the individual than the latter state of
         actual 'limbo', but each case will depend on its own facts and  the
         periods involved.

         (2) Stage 2: Prospects of effecting deportation must be remote

         65.  There is a threshold question to be addressed as to the  (non)
         'deportability' of the individual. In  order  to  raise  a  'limbo'
         argument in the first  place,  i.e.  whether  the  public  interest
         justifies making or sustaining a decision to deport  or  issuing  a
         deportation order itself, the following must be  demonstrated:  (i)
         first, it must be apparent that the appellant  is  not  capable  of
         being actually deported immediately, or in the foreseeable  future;
         (ii) second, it must be apparent  that  there  are  no  further  or
         remaining steps that can currently  be  taken  in  the  foreseeable
         future to facilitate his deportation; and (iii) third,  there  must
         be no reason for anticipating change in the situation and, thus, in
         practical terms, the prospects of removal are remote.

         66.  If those  criteria  are  not  satisfied,  a  challenge  to  an
         otherwise lawful decision to deport, or deportation order,  on  the
         basis of 'limbo' (or prospective  'limbo')  calling  into  question
         whether the public interest in deportation should  be  overcome  by
         considerations of  family  or  private  life  or  other  Convention
         rights, is likely to face formidable, or  potentially  insuperable,
         obstacles.

         (3) Stage 3: Fact-specific analysis

         67.  Where those criteria are satisfied, a court or  tribunal  must
         next engage in a fact-specific examination of the case.  This  will
         typically comprise both a retrospective and  prospective  analysis,
         including: (i) an assessment of  the  time  already  spent  by  the
         individual in the UK, his status, immigration  history  and  family
         circumstances; (ii) the nature and seriousness of any  offences  of
         which the individual has been convicted; (iii) an assessment of the
         time elapsed since  the  decision  or  order  to  deport;  (iv)  an
         assessment of the prospects of deportation ever being achieved (see
         above); and (v) whether the impossibility of achieving  deportation
         is due in part to the conduct of the individual, e.g.  in  not  co-
         operating with obtaining documentation.

         (4) Stage 4: Balancing exercise

         68.  The fourth stage is the balancing exercise to be  carried  out
         between (a) the public interest in maintaining an effective  system
         of immigration control, and in deporting those who ought not to  be
         in the United Kingdom and (b) an individual's Article 8  and  other
         Convention rights.

         69. This will involve an assessment of (i) whether  the  individual
         remaining in a state of 'limbo' (or prospective 'limbo') will  have
         an impact on the individual's Article 8 or other Convention  rights
         and, if so, the extent of that impact; and (ii) how far that impact
         is proportionate when balanced with  the  public  interest  in  the
         decision to make an order, or to sustain the same.

         70. The public interest  in  question  is  principally  the  public
         interest in maintaining an effective system of immigration control,
         and in deporting those who are in the UK  illegally.  There  is  no
         separate public interest in preventing such individuals  from  e.g.
         working or relying on benefits or gaining the full  range  of  free
         health care.  Parliament has, however, decreed by statute that such
         benefits and opportunities are  to  be  withheld  from  those  here
         illegally. Parliament must be taken to have intended that the  lack
         of such benefits and opportunities  will  form  a  disincentive  to
         coming or remaining here illegally.  The statute has to be read  in
         accordance  with  s.3  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.   It   is
         compatibility with Article 8 and other Convention rights  which  is
         relevant - not 'criminalisation' of the Appellant's presence in the
         UK as Mr Chirico would suggest. Further, the parallels he seeks  to
         draw with the Hardial Singh principles are of  marginal  assistance
         since they arise in the different context of release from temporary
         detention (c.f. R (Hardial Singh)  v.  Governor  of  Durham  Prison
         [1983] EWHC 1 (QB)).

         71. The principal basis on which it might be said that  the  public
         interest in continued 'limbo' may be so weakened, such that Article
         8 rights or other Convention rights might  tip  the  balance,  will
         normally only arise in cases where it  is  clear  that  the  public
         interest in  effective  immigration  is  extinguished  because,  in
         practical terms,  there  is  no  realistic  prospect  of  effecting
         deportation within a reasonable period (see above).

         72.  Further, as Simler J said in R (Hamzeh and others) (supra)  at
         [50]:

             "[50] There is no policy or practice  whereby  persons  whose
             removal from the UK  cannot  be  enforced,  should,  for  this
             reason alone, be granted leave to remain. It is not  difficult
             to see why this should be  the  case.  A  policy  entitling  a
             person to leave to remain merely because no  current  enforced
             removal is possible, would undermine UK  immigration  law  and
             policy, and  would  create  perverse  incentives  to  obstruct
             removal,  rewarding  those  who  fail  to  comply  with  their
             obligations as compared to those who ensure  such  compliance.
             Moreover, in the same way as immigration law  and  policy  may
             change,  so  too  the  practical  situation  in  relation   to
             enforcing removal may change or fluctuate over  time  so  that
             any current difficulties cannot be regarded as perpetual.""

66. It is necessary also to consider the scope of this  appeal  given  that
    there has already  been  a  decision  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  which
    addresses to an extent the lawfulness of the deportation order made.

67. I turn first, then, to the extent of that decision as  binding  on  me.
    In doing so, I remind myself that  the  decision  under  appeal  is  "a
    decision that section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007  applies";  that
    was not the question before the Court of appeal which  was  considering
    the lawfulness of the second deportation order.

68. The Court of  Appeal  found  that  the  decision  to  make  the  second
    deportation order was lawful. The Secretary of State submits  that,  in
    consequence, the appellant cannot properly argue on other grounds  that
    the immigration decision giving rise to this  appeal  was  unlawful.  I
    respectfully disagree.

69. The appeal before the Court of Appeal arose  from  an  application  for
    judicial review brought the issues in which could not have been  raised
    in a statutory appeal which law against the decision that the appellant
    is a person to whom s 32 (5) applies,  not against the decision to make
    the deportation order, or against the deportation order itself.

70. As was noted in R (Sivasubramaniam) v Wandsworth [2002] EWCA  Civ  1738
    at [47]:

         "... judicial review is  customarily  refused  as  an  exercise  of
         judicial discretion where an alternative remedy is available. Where
         Parliament has provided a statutory appeal procedure it will rarely
         be  appropriate  to  grant  permission  for  judicial  review.  The
         exceptional case may arise because the statutory procedure is  less
         satisfactory  than  the  procedure  of  judicial  review.  Usually,
         however, the alternative procedure is more convenient and  judicial
         review is refused."

71. There is no indication from the Court of Appeal that they  thought  the
    case had been improperly brought.  As is  evident  from  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision [45] only ground one related  to  the  lawfulness  of
    issuing  the  second  deportation  order.  The  court  found  for   the
    respondent on that issue, an issue which could not have been brought to
    the FtT.

72. Whether, and to what extent, the principles of res judicata  and  issue
    estoppel apply in public law is complex, particularly where,  as  here,
    the argument from the respondent is necessarily that the grounds raised
    in this appeal could (and should) have been raised in the action before
    the Court of Appeal. The appellant accepts  that  the  Tribunal  cannot
    consider the lawfulness of the decision to make a deportation order  or
    the deportation order itself.

73. The relevant principles were discussed by Carnwath JSC in R (DN) Rwanda
    [2020] UKSC 7 at [44] onwards. In essence,  the  respondent's  case  is
    that there  is  no  logical  difference  between  "a  point  which  was
    previously raised and decided and one which might  have  been  but  was
    not". But that is not the case here; the points as to legality in  this
    appeal could not have been brought in the judicial  review  action  (as
    there was a statutory appeal) and vice versa.

74. For these reasons, I consider that the  appellant  can  properly  argue
    that the immigration decision made in this case  was  wrong  under  the
    grounds set out in section 84 (1)(c) and (e).

75. That is not, of course, to say that the decision of the Court of Appeal
    is not relevant. It is evident from the material before me and from the
    comments made by the Court of Appeal in its decision at [4] to [6],  it
    being amongst other things the Secretary of State's case at that  point
    that the appellant had been less than co-operative [28] but I  bear  in
    mind that these conclusions are based primarily on a  decision  of  the
    High Court about which the Court of Appeal observed at [39] to [40]:

         "39.  In considering the conduct of the Respondent, and indeed  the
         actions of the Appellant's officials, the  Judge  noted  more  than
         once that he had  heard  no  oral  evidence,  and  thus  no  cross-
         examination,  of   the   Respondent   or   of   the   Home   Office
         representatives (2014 judgment, paragraphs 103 to 110). Insofar  as
         fraud might be relevant to damages, that could have been  cured  by
         the time of the later damages hearing.  However,  as  matters  fell
         out, no such evidence could be brought to bear on liability.

         40.  In addressing the problematic conflicting  accounts  from  the
         Respondent, the judge first considered whether there was sufficient
         in this to establish wrongdoing so as to support a defence based on
         ex turpi causa. He noted that there had never been any  prosecution
         for the offences under Section 26 of the 1971 Act,  of  failing  to
         produce information or  making  false  statements  [2014  judgment,
         paragraph 105/106]. The judge concluded there was no basis for  the
         application of ex turpi causa.  In  my  view,  he  was  right.  His
         conclusion on this has not been appealed. I need not expand on  the
         point beyond observing that it is clear even active deception by  a
         detainee cannot prevent an application for release from  detention,
         or access to the court  in  order  to  establish  the  legality  of
         detention. To conclude otherwise would be to undermine the rule  of
         law. Such conduct may of course be relevant to the level of damages
         to be awarded for wrongful detention."

76. I bear in mind that oral  evidence  had  not  been  heard,  but  it  is
    sensible to note what the Court of Appeal said at  paragraphs  [76]  to
    [78] and [82]:-

         "76.  It seems to me that the judge in essence rejected  the  claim
         that the Respondent had misled the authorities and had set  out  to
         frustrate deportation. It is certain that he did not reach detailed
         conclusions on the matters raised and did not  consider  the  third
         Hardial Singh principle in the light of such conclusions.

         77.  I am fully conscious of the degree to which a judge  at  first
         instance is better placed than an appellate judge to reach  factual
         conclusions. That is circumscribed here by the fact that the  judge
         heard no live evidence, although he made it clear he  thought  that
         would have been desirable. He certainly reached no  conclusions  on
         the detail of the matters advanced by the  Appellant,  nor  did  he
         link such findings to the proper approach to the application of the
         third Hardial Singh principle. It may be that he  was  not  greatly
         helped in this regard by submissions on behalf of the Appellant.

         78.  With respect to the Judge, it seems to me that  he  was  wrong
         not to reach clear conclusions as to the  Appellant's  conduct  and
         move from such to consider the third Hardial Singh principle. In my
         view the conduct may be highly relevant to what should be  regarded
         as a breach of that  principle.  Here  too  the  strong  policy  of
         Parliament set down in the 2007 Act is an  essential  part  of  the
         context.

         ...

         82.  It is not necessary for us to consider Ground  3.  I  do  add,
         however, that if  in  due  course  there  is  a  finding  that  the
         Respondent  failed  to  cooperate  or  set  out  to  frustrate  his
         deportation, then to the extent that he is  nevertheless  found  to
         have been unlawfully detained, I am of the  clear  view  that  such
         conduct is or may be an important factor in assessing the level  of
         damages, following earlier authority including my own  judgment  in
         the decision of R (NAB) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 1191 (Admin). Given that
         the action was settled, there was no prior  finding  on  the  issue
         identified by the Court of Appeal."

77. In assessing  the  evidence,  it  is  appropriate  to  start  with  the
    concession recorded by Judge McCarthy set  out  at  [12]  above.     No
    formal application has been made to withdraw it although it is possible
    to make such application as is clear from AM  (Iraq)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    2706 at [39] to [45] although there is, buried at pages 38 to 39  of Ms
    Anderson's skeleton argument, a submission that what was said is not  a
    concession which could be binding on  the  respondent,   nor  could  it
    materially impact on the article 8 appeal, as it is a rejection of  the
    veracity of the appellant's claims, nor is it an accurate

78. With respect, this is not the sort of issue to be put into the very end
    of a lengthy skeleton argument, and I recall the  observations  of  the
    Court of Appeal in this case at [48] to [49].  If the respondent wishes
    to withdraw a concession, then she can apply to  do  so;  she  has  had
    ample time in which to do so.

79. I consider that on no proper basis can it be said that  the  respondent
    had not made  a  concession  on  an  issue  of  fact;  the  appellant's
    nationality is in issue and as a  matter  of  foreign  law  that  is  a
    question of fact before the First-tier (and Upper) Tribunal.  No proper
    explanation is given as to why the statement by Mr Swaby is not binding
    and if it is  not  the  respondent's  current  position,  it  begs  the
    question  of  why  no  application  has  been  made  to  withdraw   the
    concession. The respondent wishes to read into the  concession,  as  is
    submitted in the skeleton at [88],  that  it  is  a  rejection  of  the
    appellant's assertions as to his antecedents; that may be implicit  but
    it is not what was said which is a concession of a material question of
    fact as to the prospect of the appellant's nationality and  as  to  the
    possibility of removal.

80. I bear in mind also that the  events  to  which  the  appellant  refers
    occurred, in some cases such as the death of his father over  30  years
    ago.  Much of the material collected from him with  respect  to  family
    details,  education  and  work  history  and  so  on  was  obtained  in
    interviews taken over a period of several  years.   Further,  with  the
    exception of the recent attempts made  in  respect  of  the  Portuguese
    Consulate seeking details of the appellant, there appears to have  been
    no interviews conducted by  the  respondent  since  the  appellant  was
    released from detention in November 2013.  That  is  over  seven  years
    ago.

81. Unlike the Court of Appeal and the High Court, I  heard  evidence  from
    the appellant and two witnesses from the Home Office, all of whom  were
    cross-examined.  Bearing in mind it has been submitted to me  that  the
    witnesses have not told the truth, I consider it appropriate to  direct
    myself that sometimes people do not tell the truth  in  fact  lie,  for
    many reasons: see MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC 11  at  [32]  to  [33],  per
    Dyson SCJ.

82. Given the decision of the Court of Appeal, the  appellant  cannot  have
    been unaware that it is a major part of the respondent's case  that  he
    has not told the truth and has given different names, dates  of  births
    and details about his family.

83. In that context it is surprising that the  appellant  was  not,  as  he
    says, shown the witness statement of Ms Haque of 24 November 2020 which
    sets out in detail at [18] to [21] the information provided in the past
    as do records at  paragraphs  and  the  discrepancies  alleged  by  the
    respondent. These are tabulated at paragraph [22].

84. I note also that when questioned, Ms Haque explained that  the  witness
    statement had been prepared for her by someone she did  not  know  from
    her legal department. She had given them a summary of the case and  the
    witness statement was then prepared from that and  other  material.   I
    have taken careful note of where evidence and the  explanation  provide
    for the failure to exhibit earlier the draft referral release.

85. In re-examination it was put to Ms Haque that it was one thing to  give
    information and another to give information that  cannot  be  verified.
    When asked what she had meant by being compliant she said that  he  had
    been given all sorts of information in the weekly conversations she had
    with him but that every avenue they looked into and investigated  could
    not be confirmed  and  that  there  was  a  point  when  this  was  not
    compliance.   She  said  that  he  had  given  enough  information   to
    investigate but everything was false and that he was wasting  his  time
    even as to his name.

86. The appellant does, however, seek almost to make compliant  a  term  of
    art. It is not.  It is certainly true that the appellant was  providing
    information, some of it in relation to addresses  and  schools  in  the
    USA, and dates of birth, being quite detailed.  But  it  is  remarkable
    that ultimately it has not led to any of that being confirmed.

87. I have serious concerns about the evidence of Ms Carpenter who accepted
    that despite the witness statement of truth that she  had  signed,  her
    statement at paragraph 5 that two witness statements from the appellant
    had been omitted from the documents supplied to the expert, Mr  Sobers,
    was not true.  Her explanation for the  error  was  that  the  GLD  had
    drafted it and that she assumed that the  witness  statement  had  been
    written by David Williams.

88. It is evident from Mr Sobers' report at pages 76 to 115 the opinion was
    based on the documents provided by Duncan Lewis listed  in  Appendix  2
    (see footnote 1 at page 76) and this lists the witness statement  of  8
    June 2020 as confirmed in the letter  of  instruction.   Also  included
    were the undated and 5 July 2013 witness statements.

89. I do not understand how a witness statement could  have  been  prepared
    with the assistance of a lawyer such that it records something which is
    clearly untrue on the basis  of  the  material  provided  to  the  Home
    Office.  I do not consider that Ms Carpenter set  out  deliberately  to
    mislead but there is no satisfactory  explanation  for  her  signing  a
    statement of truth and then accepting that what she had  said  in  that
    statement was not true.  I accept that witness statements are  prepared
    within government, as indeed in any large organisation  in  the  manner
    described but that does not in any away absolve those responsible  from
    ensuring that statements are  true  and  reliable.  It  is  of  greater
    concern where, as here, it is unusual for Home  Office  representatives
    to be cross-examined and to a large extent the Tribunals and indeed the
    High Court exercising its judicial review function have  to  take  what
    the Home Office says at face value.  The danger is this: through cross-
    examination  and  because  the  documents  were  before  me,   it   was
    established that what was said  was  not  true;  in  many  cases  where
    witness statements are given, summarising or where  the  documents  are
    not also disclosed, this simply would not have come to light.

90. In these circumstances and where the party concerned is the  state,  it
    is all the more important that the highest  standards  are  maintained.
    Whether or not this amounts to a contempt in the face of the  court  is
    not a matter for me to decide.  It  is  not  evident  that  CPR  81  or
    Practice Directions 81 or 81X are of applicability in this matter.

91. I do not consider that any proper explanation  has  been  given  by  Ms
    Carpenter for saying what she said in paragraph 5 yet which she  admits
    is not true.  In the circumstances, absent any good reason as to why  a
    civil servant should not tell the truth, I consider that weight  should
    not be attached to her evidence unless confirmed by other  sources  and
    certainly no weight could be attached to her opinions.

92. Much of what Ms Haque says is confirmed by other sources and  is  to  a
    great extent drawn from other documents.  It  has  not  been  submitted
    that the material quoted in length  at  paragraphs  [18]  to  [21]  are
    untrue but equally these are summaries of evidence made by  the  people
    who undertook the interviews.  Further, the documents  referred  to  in
    the table at paragraph 22 do appear elsewhere and the appellant has had
    ample time to consider the alleged discrepancies and to explain them.

93. In assessing the investigations undertaken by the Secretary of State to
    confirm  the  appellant's  identity,  I  bear  in  mind  Ms  Anderson's
    submission that it would not be in the Secretary  of  State's  interest
    not to be able to show that the appellant is a citizen  of  Jamaica  or
    for that matter Portugal.  There is substantial force in that argument.
     But equally insofar as the witness statements were  prepared  for  the
    court hearing in 2013, it was important for the Secretary of  State  at
    that point to show a lack of co-operation and that  the  appellant  had
    not been forthcoming  with  evidence.   I  was  not  satisfied  by  the
    explanation of the failure by Ms Haque  to  include  or  refer  to  the
    referral draft in which she had said in the "referral case suitable for
    contact management" at [23].  "Mr Antonio may have been compliant as he
    has been forthcoming in supplying information, however all the  avenues
    that have been pursued and he still claims to be Portuguese".

94. Whilst that statement is not as  categorical  as  the  appellant  might
    like, nonetheless  it  is  difficult  to  understand  how  it  was  not
    disclosed earlier.  Ms Haque accepted that she was aware of it  as  she
    had written it, but I bear in mind also that the witness statement  was
    prepared in December 2013 and that she may  have  difficulty  recalling
    exactly what happened.  Ms Anderson's first question in  re-examination
    was clearly a leading question; it suggested to Ms Haque that there was
    a difference between giving information and  giving  information  which
    could  not  be  verified.   Whilst  Ms  Anderson  later   amended   her
    questioning, nonetheless I consider that the damage had  been  done  in
    concerning the weight that I can attach to Ms Haque's  evidence.   That
    said, it is consistent with the respondent's position that none of  the
    checks which had been undertaken on  the  appellant  had  provided  any
    evidence.  Other than on one occasion an official being able to talk to
    the appellant's brother, and verification of the appellant working  for
    DENSO, nothing of substance has been verified.  But I do bear  in  mind
    that there is no incentive for the Secretary of State not to be able to
    verify information about the appellant; on the contrary.

95. Turning now  to  the  appellant's  testimony  and  the  allegations  of
    inconsistency made, I bear in mind that  the  appellant  was  given  an
    opportunity to comment on what was recorded at paragraphs [18] to  [21]
    of Ms Haque's statement.  These were issues highlighted by the Court of
    Appeal as noted above.

96. There was a degree of consistency about the appellant's  mother's  date
    of birth, 24 August 1945, but it is not clear why in the  biodata  form
    she is referred to as Wilhelmina Wilson rather than later Stella Yvette
    Wilson (or Stella Francesca Wilson).  It is  of  note  that  Ms  Stella
    Francesca  Wilson's  name  comes  from  information  supplied  by   the
    appellant's solicitors in the letter of 6 December 2011 but I  consider
    that no satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the mother is
    recorded as Wilhelmina.  I accept that the notes at C34, extracted from
    the Home Office notes, indicate that  is  the  mother's  name  but  the
    information must have come from somewhere.  The father's name has  also
    changed from Juan Carlos Antonio to Jorge Silva Antonio,  then  in  the
    letter from Duncan Lewis to Carlos  Hugo  Antonio  and  then  to  Jorge
    Carlos Hugo Silva Antonio in Duncan Lewis' letter of 4 June 2013.

97. Similarly, the names and dates of birth of the brother and sister  vary
    significantly in the case of the sister from  1974  (biodata  form)  to
    1982 in an interview on 2 December 2011 and  1984  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal against deportation order.  Some of  the  differences  regarding
    the name such as Juanita or Joanita are easily explainable as  recorded
    by people unfamiliar with either Portuguese or  Spanish,  similarly  no
    inferences can be drawn to the brother's name varying from Henrique  to
    Enrique.  Other differences arise from when he arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  In the 8 February 2011 interview he  is  recorded  as  having
    arrived in February 1995 yet on 25 February 2011 that it was  in  1992.
    He is also recorded  on  24  January  2013  as  saying  his  Portuguese
    passport was issued in New York in 1992 yet in oral  evidence  that  it
    was in 1990.

98. Although there is no evidence of the  appellant  having  made  National
    Insurance contributions, checks undertaken with HM  Revenue  &  Customs
    finding no trace of him, it does appear that the appellant did work for
    DENSO.  The application appears to have been in 2001 but the  appellant
    openly admitted that his education  and  training  recorded  there  was
    untrue and that he had not attended either of the colleges  he  claimed
    to have attended.  He indicated that he did not require a  work  permit
    which is consistent with him having a Portuguese passport.

99. I consider that the appellant's explanation  for  his  lies  is  wholly
    unacceptable.  That he was also prepared to permit an incorrect date of
    birth to be used also casts doubt on his credibility.  His  explanation
    that he really wanted the job and that DENSO wanted somebody  who  knew
    about assembly work and he therefore lied to get the job is not  in  my
    view  a  satisfactory  explanation.   I  consider  that   this   counts
    significantly against the appellant and  undermines  significantly  his
    credibility.

100. I note the submission that the appellant has been convicted of a  crime
    involving dishonesty. That is of little assistance given that it was  a
    robbery rather than fraud. But, having  undertaken  a  robbery  in  the
    circumstances  described  in  the  sentencing  marks  does  go  to  the
    appellant's character.

101. Taking that into account with the other material identified above,  and
    viewing his evidence in the round with the other material, I find  that
    his evidence is not something on which I can safely  rely  upon  unless
    confirmed by other independent material.

102. In reaching that conclusion I have borne in mind the submissions by  Mr
    Goodman that the appellant has no incentive in not showing that  he  is
    Jamaican as the leave he would receive in the United Kingdom even  were
    he successful would be very limited, and subject to  many  restrictions
    to all intents and purposes the same as he faces now  whilst  on  bail,
    but that is predicated on the assumption that there is not  some  other
    good reason the appellant does not want to go to Jamaica.

103. Having heard the appellant, and considered the evidence as a  whole,  I
    am not, given my findings on his credibility,  satisfied  that  he  has
    given all the information available to him. It is, I consider, unlikely
    that all the information would have drawn a blank; and, although I have
    doubts about Ms Carpenter's evidence, I consider it improbable that the
    respondent's  enquiries,  including  those  made  in  the   USA   (some
    correspondence with US government departments are exhibited) and to the
    Jamaican authorities who responded that there was no trace, all lead to
    dead ends if the information given was accurate.

104. In reaching my conclusions I, take into  account  the  concession  that
    the appellant is not Jamaican and not a citizen of Portugal but that is
    hardly a ringing endorsement that what he has  said  is  true;  on  the
    contrary.

105. In respect of the Portuguese citizenship, it  is  I  consider  fair  to
    note that if what the appellant has said is true, it is very surprising
    that the Portuguese government would have no record of his  father  who
    had been attached to the  embassy  in  Washington.   Similarly,  it  is
    difficult to understand how the Portuguese government  would  not  have
    records of having issued the appellant a passport and an  ID  card  his
    name.

106. There is little evidence of the  appellant's  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom in documentary form.  Other than the job application for  DENSO
    there is little to support his account; there are no national insurance
    records or other documentary evidence of his employment.

107. Much has been made about the draft in  which  Ms  Haque  had  indicated
    that the appellant had been "compliant". That draft states (F12, [14])

         "Mr Antonio may have been compliant as he has been forth coming  in
         supplying information, however  all  the  avenues  that  have  been
         pursued"

108. It is evident that words are missing from that paragraph,  which  is  a
    draft, but, importantly, it is expressed conditionally: "may have  been
    compliant".

109. What then is the  impact  of  the  concession  that  the  appellant  is
    neither Jamaican nor Portuguese?  Both issues are  matters  of  foreign
    law and as such are questions of fact on  which  a  concession  can  be
    made. But there is no concession that the appellant has been  truthful,
    or has complied fully in providing all  the  information  available  to
    him.  While it can be argued that that is implicit in  the  concession,
    it is certainly not accepted by the respondent that the  appellant  has
    told the truth; on the contrary as the hearing demonstrated. Nor can it
    be construed as a concession that the appellant has been "compliant" in
    providing information.  The concession is simply as  to  certain  facts
    which make up the matrix of the facts for consideration in the  appeal.
    It does not follow from the acceptance  that  he  is  not  Jamaican  or
    Portuguese that he has no nationality, or an  acceptance  that  he  has
    told the truth about his background.

110. While I accept, as I must, in the light  of  the  concession  that  the
    appellant is neither Jamaican nor Portuguese, his compliance  with  the
    documentation process, such as it is, has resulted in dead ends.

111. Applying the law to  the  facts,  I  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant is not a Jamaican national and is not a Portuguese  national.
    I accept in consequence that there is no realistic prospect that he can
    leave the United Kingdom or that his deportation order can be  enforced
    during a reasonable period of time to Jamaica or any other country.

112. I accept that if what the appellant was telling is the truth,  then  he
    is or would appear to be on the  evidence  of  Mr  Sobers  entitled  to
    Jamaican citizenship but is unable to show that he is so  entitled.   I
    accept on the basis of Mr Sobers' evidence, albeit that he  is  not  an
    expert on nationality law, that it is highly unlikely that the Jamaican
    authorities would be persuaded that the appellant is, in the absence of
    documentary evidence and in  the  light  of  the  enquiries  they  have
    already undertaken, a Jamaican national and that he would be  permitted
    to land in Jamaica. In  reaching  that  conclusion,  I  note  that  the
    Jamaican authorities have not been able to document him.  I accept that
    it is more likely that, on the evidence as currently exists,  he  would
    be detained for a  short  time  and  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom
    probably by the next return flight.  To that extent,  any  interference
    with his protected rights in Jamaica is likely to be minimal, and there
    is no sufficient basis for submitting that it would engage article 3 of
    the Human Rights Convention.

113. Accordingly, on the basis of the evidence and concession,  and  in  the
    absence of  any  foreseeable  change  in  circumstances,  there  is  no
    prospect of effecting deportation; any removal is likely to  result  in
    him being returned to the United Kingdom.

114. Returning then to the grounds of appeal, I consider ground  (g)  first,
    accepting that this involves a  hypothetical  assumption  that  removal
    will be given effect. The appellant's case is that he is  not  Jamaican
    and would not be admitted.

115. The removal scenario is, as Mr Goodman accepts, hypothetical,  in  that
    it assumes the appellant will be allowed to enter Jamaica. But equally,
    it is hypothetical that if that were to occur, he would  not  be  given
    some form of leave.

116. I am not satisfied that the appellant would face a breach of article  3
    on return to Jamaica. There is insufficient material to show  that  any
    detention would breach article 3, and while I accept that he would,  if
    admitted, have difficulty in establishing himself, he would  have  some
    money from his damages award and some grant paid on removal. He has not
    shown that he would be destitute even if he could not work.

117. Given I have not accepted what the appellant  has  told  me  about  his
    lack of ties to Jamaica, or support, even if  he is not Jamaican, I  am
    not satisfied on the  evidence  he  has  given  me  that  he  would  be
    destitute to the extent necessary  to  engage  the  high  threshold  in
    article 3, nor am I satisfied for these reasons and those set out below
    that his circumstances are  such  as  to  amount  to  "very  compelling
    circumstances", even taking into account the  length  of  time  he  has
    spent here; and, I have only his word for it (and  to  an  extent  that
    being repeated by other witnesses)  that  he  has  no  connection  with
    Jamaica, a country in which he has claimed  (albeit  falsely)  to  have
    been educated.

118. Turning then to article 8, which I accept  is  engaged,  even  assuming
    for these purposes that removal would not be "effected" as he would  be
    returned, it does not follow that the decision is  not  "in  accordance
    with the law".

119. In Gallagher et al v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]
    UKSC 3 at [14] to [41] approval was given to Christian Institute v Lord
    Advocate [2016] UKSC 51 at [79] to [80]:

         "79.  In order to be 'in accordance with  the  law'  under  article
         8(2) of the ECHR , the measure must not only  have  some  basis  in
         domestic law - which it has in the provisions of  the  Act  of  the
         Scottish  Parliament  -  but  also  be  accessible  to  the  person
         concerned and foreseeable as  to  its  effects.  These  qualitative
         requirements of accessibility and foreseeability have two elements.
         First, a rule must  be  formulated  with  sufficient  precision  to
         enable any individual - if need be with  appropriate  advice  -  to
         regulate his or her conduct ( The Sunday Times v United  Kingdom  ,
         para 49; Gillan v United Kingdom , para 76). Secondly, it  must  be
         sufficiently   precise   to   give   legal    protection    against
         arbitrariness:

         '[I]t must afford a measure of legal protection  against  arbitrary
         interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded  by
         the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be
         contrary to the rule of law ...for a legal  discretion  granted  to
         the executive to be expressed in  terms  of  an  unfettered  power.
         Consequently, the law must indicate  with  sufficient  clarity  the
         scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities  and
         the manner of its exercise. The  level  of  precision  required  of
         domestic legislation - which cannot in any case provide  for  every
         eventuality - depends to a considerable degree on  the  content  of
         the instrument in question, the field it is designed to  cover  and
         the number and status of those to whom it is addressed.' ( Gillan ,
         para 77; Peruzzo v Germany , para 35)

         80.  Recently, in R  (T)  v  Chief  Constable,  Greater  Manchester
         Police , this court has  explained  that  the  obligation  to  give
         protection against arbitrary interference requires that there  must
         be safeguards which have the effect of enabling the proportionality
         of the interference to be adequately examined. This is an issue  of
         the rule of law and is not a matter on which  national  authorities
         are given a margin of appreciation.""

120. On that basis, and applying these principles, I am not  satisfied  that
    the appellant has shown that the decision is not  "in  accordance  with
    the law".  On the contrary, the law is  clear;  he  is  not  a  British
    National, and may be  deported;  and,  he  is  a  foreign  criminal  as
    defined. The lawfulness of the deportation order in question  has  been
    confirmed by the Court of Appeal.

121. In assessing proportionality, I accept that were  the  appeal  allowed,
    the appellant's conditions of leave could well be restrictive, and that
    he would remain liable to deportation, as the legislation provides. But
    I do not accept the submission that  maintaining  a  deportation  order
    serves no purpose. It is, for clear reasons, manifestly in  the  public
    interest that he be deported, and the Secretary of  State  is  under  a
    duty to remove foreign criminals.

122. Contrary to Mr Goodman's submissions I do not accept  that  maintaining
    a deportation order that cannot be carried out is an improper  purpose;
    they are imposed and endure, for many  reasons,  not  just  to  require
    departure from and prohibit return to the United Kingdom.  They express
    the public interest in removing foreign criminals, and that is  clearly
    part of policy as expressed in s117C of the 20002 Act.

123. I turn next to the principles set out in RA(Iraq)  and  in  R  (on  the
    application of AM) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (legal
    "limbo") [2021] UKUT 62  (IAC),  accepting  however  that  the  factual
    situation in the latter is very  different.   In  doing  so  I  not  Ms
    Anderson's trenchant criticisms of the latter, but I do not accept  her
    submission that it  was  per  incuriam,  insofar  as  that  applies  to
    jurisprudence of the ECtHR. I accept that the European Court  of  Human
    Rights has always distinguished between cases in which a state expels a
    settled migrant, and those in which it either  expels,  or  refuses  to
    admit,  a  person  with  no  such  rights.  The  former   involves   an
    interference with rights protected by article 8, and must be  justified
    under article 8.2. The latter does not. But that is not the end of  the
    matter. The legal question in the second type of case  is  whether  the
    state has a positive obligation, imposed by  article  8.  Some  of  the
    approach which applies in a negative obligation case can be  transposed
    to positive obligation cases, such  as  the  question  whether  a  fair
    balance has been struck between the state's interests and those of  the
    migrant. There may well come a point where a  positive  obligation  may
    arise.

124. As a starting point, I conclude that the appellant is in  actual  limbo
    as a  deportation  order  has  been  made  and  on  the  basis  of  the
    respondent's concession, the prospects  of  effecting  deportation  are
    remote.

125. With regard to stage 3, in addition to the  findings  made  above,  the
    appellant has not shown that any of the time  he  has  spent  here  was
    lawful, either with leave  or  as  an  EEA  citizen  exercising  Treaty
    rights. He has not established any family life,  and  there  is  little
    evidence of a private life, given that he cannot work, run  a  business
    or undertake similar activities. I accept he has had  relationships  in
    the past and has a network of friendships; and, taking his case at  its
    highest, has no family in the United Kingdom or elsewhere with whom  he
    is in contact.

126. The offences he committed were very serious. That is reflected  in  the
    length of the sentence imposed and in the  sentencing  remarks  of  HHJ
    Eades; the offences involved pre-planning,  the  use  of  an  imitation
    firearm and the traumatising of the victims who were  employed  in  the
    sub-post offices at which the appellant perpetrated his offences.  Each
    of the two  sets  of  offences  incurred  a  sentence  of  nine  years'
    imprisonment to run concurrently.

127. The appellant has, it is clear, been  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  an
    extensive period, and the attempts to document and remove him have  now
    taken well over 10 years. And, I accept, that any prospect of effecting
    deportation is remote on the basis of the evidence before me.

128. Under stage 4, I am required to undertake  a  balancing  exercise.   In
    this case, the starting point for  assessing  the  public  interest  in
    removal  is  very  high.  The  appellant  was  sentenced  to  9  years'
    imprisonment. He has not, I accept, been convicted since  his  release,
    but that is not a matter that diminishes to any significant extent  the
    public interest in deporting  a  criminal  whose  crimes  are  of  such
    magnitude as these.

129. The analysis at  this  stage,  and  indeed  at  stage  3,  involves  an
    assessment  of  whether  the  appellant  has  been  co-operating   with
    obtaining documentation. That, in turn, involves assessing his  conduct
    in providing information.  For the reasons set  out  above,  I  am  not
    satisfied, the concession notwithstanding, that he has been candid,  or
    that he has told the whole truth about his background  or  nationality.
    These are factors which I take  into  account,  and  which  I  consider
    militate against him, and, accordingly I consider that he is in  effect
    responsible for his situation.

130. Taking all of these  considerations  into  account,  I  consider  that,
    given  the  very  strong  public  interest  in  this  case,  given  the
    seriousness of the appellant's offending, that the public  interest  is
    not so weakened that the decision under challenge was disproportionate.



131. In reaching that conclusion,  I  have  taken  fully  into  account  the
    limited basis on which the appellant would (or could) be  permitted  to
    live in the United Kingdom as is submitted. I accept he may not be able
    to work, or have  access  to  benefits,  and  all  the  possible  other
    applicable restrictions identified by Mr Goodman.

132. I do not, contrary to Mr Goodman's submissions, accept  that  his  case
    is akin to Mendizabal v France [2006] ECHR 34. On  the  contrary.  That
    case involved a Spanish national (not in dispute) who had  been  living
    lawfully in France for 14 years, and who had free movement rights.  The
    facts are entirely different and distinguishable.

133. Accordingly, for these reasons, the appellant has failed to satisfy  me
    that the decision under challenge, is wrong under the grounds  set  out
    in s 84 (1)(e) or (g)

    Ground (c) "otherwise than in accordance with the law"

134. In considering this ground,  it  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  the
    decision under challenge; it is the decision that the  appellant  is  a
    person to whom section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies. It is
    not in dispute that he is a foreign criminal  and  the  only  exception
    that is in play is Exception 1 set out in section 33 (2) of  that  Act.
    The immigration decision in question is, by  operation  of  section  82
    (3A) not the decision to make a deportation order.

135. Much of the case law on which the  parties  rely  arises  from  actions
    brought by way of judicial review which focus on the  legality  of  the
    deportation order itself, or the decision to make a deportation  order;
    and, consequently, on the legality of detention.

136. What the appellant seeks to do under this ground is  to  challenge  the
    legality of the making (or maintenance) of the deportation order on the
    basis either that the order is  being  used  for  an  improper  purpose
    because it cannot be carried out or is inconsistent with the  statutory
    scheme in place following the implementation  of  the  Immigration  Act
    2016 and the replacement of temporary admission,  he  can  only  be  on
    immigration bail.

137. I do not accept that such a case can be made under this  ground,  given
    its narrow scope.  Further, even were it arguable within the  scope  of
    this grounds, I am not satisfied it is made out in any event.  I do not
    accept the submission that seeking in the circumstances of  this  case,
    seeking to deport the appellant is unlawful, either as contrary to s  6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998 or otherwise nor do I accept  the  premise
    that it is being used as a form of regulating the appellant while he is
    in the United Kingdom.

138. I am not satisfied that on the facts of this case that the  deportation
    order is, on any view, being used to regulate the  appellant;  that  is
    done by the operation of the usual immigration rules. He has  no  leave
    to be here, and his difficulties and the limitations on what he can  do
    flow from that. Thus, on no proper view does the situation here  engage
    Padfield [1968] UKHL 1.

139. As both parties accept, Kaitey is under appeal. Unless and until it  is
    overturned, I consider it is good law, and while not  strictly  binding
    on  me,  I  find  no  good  reason  not  to  follow  it.  Applying  the
    propositions set out at the end of the decision of Laing J (as she then
    was), I conclude that, even if this issue were in scope of the  appeal,
    the decision under appeal was in accordance with the law.




    Ground s 84 (1)(a) - not in accordance with the immigration rules.

140. Finally, and  for  completeness,  I  turn  to  the  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules at paragraphs 390 to 398.  There is no basis on which
    it could be said that the appellant falls within the exceptions set out
    in paragraphs 399 or 399A, and  he  has  been  sentenced  to  9  years'
    imprisonment.  For the reasons set out above  in  assessing  the  other
    grounds of appeal, I conclude that there  are  in  this  case  no  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A. on that basis the decision was  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules.

    Conclusion

141. For the reasons set out  above,  I  consider  that  the  appellant  has
    failed to demonstrate that the decision made was wrong on the basis  of
    any of the grounds set out in section 84 (1) of the  2002  Act,  and  I
    dismiss his appeal in its entirety.




    Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

 3. No anonymity direction is made.

Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Goodman, instructed by Duncan Lewis solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal promulgated on 11 October 2018.

 2. I consider that, in line with Safi and  others  (permission  to  appeal
    decisions) [2018] UKUT 388 (IAC), the grant of permission made by Upper
    Tribunal Judge Grubb should be construed as a grant  or  permission  on
    all grounds, not least because the purported refusal of  permission  on
    ground 3 is, in the light of documents which have now come to  light  (
    and to which I turn next) unsafe.

 3. While this appeal was still in the First-tier Tribunal, directions were
    made to the respondent to produce documents  which  were  not  in  fact
    disclosed until April 2019, well after the  decision  was  promulgated.
    These documents include an internal document which appears to show that
    the appellant had, contrary to the finding of the FtT,  been  compliant
    with attempts to document him.

 4. I am satisfied that: (1) the material could not have been  produced  by
    the appellant until after the hearing; (2) that it would probably  have
    had an important  influence  of  the  result;  and  (3)  is  apparently
    credible.  Accordingly, the test set out in Ladd v  Marshall  [1954]  1
    WLR 1489 is met and I admit the documents produced and set out  in  the
    bundle provided.

 5. It was agreed by the parties that the FtT had failed to  determine  the
    grounds of appeal set out  in  section  84  (1)  (c)  and  (e)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as in force at the date of
    decision in 2013.  Mr Jarvis did not oppose  the  submission  that  the
    findings as to whether the appellant had been compliant  with  attempts
    to document him were unsafe in the light of the new  evidence,  and  it
    was agreed that the decision should be set aside in its  entirety  with
    none of the findings of fact retained.

 6. It was also agreed that in the light of the recent developments,  there
    should be a case management  hearing  on  13  November  2019  at  which
    further directions will be given. In the interim, the respondent is  to
    produce submissions on (a) the effect of the Immigration Act  2016  and
    (b) the nature of the public interest in  making  a  deportation  order
    against someone who cannot in practical terms be deported.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. The decision will be remade in the Upper  Tribunal  on  a  date  to  be
    fixed.

DIRECTIONS

 1. The appeal will be listed for a case management review on  13  November
    2019.

 2. The respondent must by 30 October 2019 serve the submissions  specified
    at [6] above.

 3. The appellant is excused from attending the case management  review  so
    long as he is represented.
