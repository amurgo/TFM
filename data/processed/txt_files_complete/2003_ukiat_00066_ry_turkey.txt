                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:     Mr E Boateng-Addo of counsel, instructed  by  Howe  &
                       Co, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Elks, Home Office Presenting Officer


1.    The appellant, a citizen of Turkey, appeals  with  leave  against  the
    determination of an adjudicator (Mr S Qureshi) sitting in  Cardiff,  in
    which he dismissed the appellant's appeal  on  both  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds against the respondent's decision to refuse him leave to
    enter the United Kingdom after refusing an application for asylum  made
    by him.

2.    The basis on which the appellant sought asylum in the  United  Kingdom
    may be stated shortly.  Prior to his departure from Turkey in September
    2002, he was a member of his local branch of HADEP.  He was in fact the
    leader of the youth section of his local branch.  He had been  detained
    and ill-treated by the Turkish police on two occasions.

3.    The first time was in May 2002 when he was detained  on  suspicion  of
    involvement with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party).  On this  occasion,
    he was detained for four days and ill-treated badly in  custody  before
    being released without charge.  His  second  detention  took  place  in
    August 2002 when the police raided a meeting of the youth section which
    the appellant was chairing at the local HADEP offices.  He was detained
    for one week and ill-treated before being released once  again  without
    charge.  He left Turkey shortly  afterwards  hidden  at  a  lorry.   He
    states that he fears that if he were to be returned to Turkey, he would
    be at risk of being detained and ill-treated on arrival because of  his
    previous involvement with HADEP.

4.    In  his  determination,  the  adjudicator  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds.  His  main  reason  for
    doing so was that he had rejected the  appellant's  evidence  regarding
    his claimed connection with HADEP.  He found in  paragraph  15  of  his
    determination that the appellant  had  no  identified  connection  with
    HADEP, and had never been arrested or detained as claimed.

5.    In particular, at paragraph 10 of his determination,  the  adjudicator
    rejected the appellant's evidence in the  form  of  a  membership  card
    allegedly issued to him by HADEP confirming that he was the  leader  of
    the youth section of his local branch of the party.

6.    The grounds  of  appeal  lodged  on  the  appellant's  behalf  may  be
    summarised as follows:

    1.     The adjudicator erred in rejecting the appellant's  evidence  in
         the form of the HADEP card which was produced by him at the hearing
         before the adjudicator;
    2.     He misdirected himself as to the correct standard of proof  when
         considering the appellant's evidence  regarding  his  claimed  ill-
         treatment whilst in custody;
    3.     He erred  in  his  conclusion  regarding  the  risks  which  the
         appellant would face on return to Turkey as a suspected separatist.

7.    In his submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Boateng-Addo  argued
    that the adjudicator's adverse credibility  findings  were  flawed  and
    unsustainable.   They  were  based  on  a   misunderstanding   by   the
    adjudicator of the evidence which was before him.   The  stamp  on  the
    HADEP card produced by the appellant bore the date "1995" on both sides
    of the card.

8.    However, this was the date on which the appellant's  local  branch  of
    HADEP was founded, not the date on which the appellant  himself  joined
    the party.  The adjudicator had therefore erred by concluding that  the
    date "1995" could not be correct because  the  appellant  was  only  13
    years old at that time.  He submitted that this fact  been  brought  to
    the adjudicator's attention during the course  of  the  hearing  before
    him, but had not been taken into account by  him  in  arriving  at  his
    conclusions.

9.    He also submitted  that  the  adjudicator  had  erred  in  basing  his
    adverse credibility finding, at least in part, on  the  fact  that  the
    HADEP card was not issued to the appellant until he was 20� years  old,
    some 2� years after he joined HADEP. He did not  take  account  of  the
    explanation provided by the appellant during his evidence, namely  that
    the card in question was issued to him when he became head of the youth
    section of his local branch.  It was not his HADEP membership  card  as
    such.

10.   He argued that the adjudicator had also erred in stating at  paragraph
    13 of his determination that if the appellant had been  ill-treated  in
    custody in the manner claimed, it was remarkable that he  had  suffered
    no injuries and did not require  medical  treatment  on  release.   The
    adjudicator did not put his concerns on that  issue  to  the  appellant
    during the course of  the  hearing.   He  should  have  done.   It  was
    dangerous for him to arrive at an adverse credibility conclusion on the
    point without first inviting the appellant to give an explanation.

11.   Finally, as regards ground 3 of the appellant's grounds of appeal,  he
    submitted that the adjudicator had erred in  failing  to  consider  the
    risk to the appellant on return to Turkey as  a  suspected  separatist.
    In support of that submission, he cited  the  recent  determination  of
    this Tribunal in the guideline case  known  as  [2003]  UKIAT  00034  A
    (Turkey).  He invited us to remit the appeal for a fresh hearing before
    another adjudicator.

12.   In his submissions on behalf of the respondent, Mr  Elks  agreed  that
    the issue of credibility was the central issue before the  adjudicator.
    He argued that the  adjudicator's  adverse  credibility  findings  were
    sustainable, and that this Tribunal  should  not  interfere  with  them
    unless they could be to shown to be "plainly wrong or unsustainable" --
    see the judgment of Lord Justice Schiemann  in  Oleed  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2003] INLR 179 at  paragraph  29.   That
    was not case here.

13.   As regards the adjudicator's adverse finding in relation to the  HADEP
    card produced by the appellant, the adjudicator was entitled to  arrive
    at his conclusion  rejecting  the  that  evidence.   As  shown  by  the
    adjudicator's record of  proceedings,  the  point  regarding  the  date
    "1995" stamped on both sides of card had  been  put  to  the  appellant
    during his oral evidence.  He had failed to give  the  explanation  now
    put forward on his behalf, namely that "1995" was the date on which his
    local branch of HADEP was founded, not the date  on  which  he  himself
    became a member of the party.  In the absence of  that  or  some  other
    credible explanation, the adjudicator had had no  alternative  save  to
    arrive at his conclusion that the card was not evidence  on  which  any
    reliance could be placed.

14.   There was no certified  translation  of  the  HADEP  card  before  the
    adjudicator at the time of the hearing as required under the  Procedure
    Rules.  Indeed, there is still no  certified  translation  in  evidence
    before this Tribunal as required by  the  Procedure  Rules.   It  would
    therefore have been properly open  to  the  adjudicator  to  refuse  to
    receive the HADEP card in evidence.  He had not done so.

15.   He cited the starred determination of this Tribunal in  Tanveer  Ahmed
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] INLR 345.  In light
    of that authority, he submitted  that  it  was  properly  open  to  the
    adjudicator to make his adverse credibility finding regarding the HADEP
    card.

16.   As regards the second ground raised by the appellant  in  his  grounds
    of appeal, namely the issue of medical treatment, he pointed  out  that
    this was an issue which had been raised expressly by the respondent  at
    paragraph 13 of his reasons for refusal letter.  It was therefore not a
    matter which should have taken the appellant or his  representative  by
    surprise at the hearing before  the  adjudicator.   He  invited  us  to
    dismiss the appeal.

17.   In reply, Mr Boateng-Addo  submitted  that  the  adjudicator  had  not
    rejected the HADEP card in terms in his determination.   He  reiterated
    that the  adjudicator  should  have  put  his  concerns  regarding  the
    appellant's evidence to him during the hearing so as to enable  him  to
    give his explanation in response to those concerns.

18.   As stated  above,  the  appellant's  challenge  to  the  adjudicator's
    determination is based on three separate grounds.   We  will  therefore
    deal with each of them in turn.

19.   The first of those grounds is that the  adjudicator  erred  in  basing
    his adverse credibility finding, at least in part, on the  date  "1995"
    stamped on the appellant's HADEP card.   The  adjudicator's  record  of
    proceedings discloses that this is an issue which  was  raised  by  him
    with the appellant  during  the  course  of  his  oral  evidence.   The
    relevant section of the record of proceedings reads as follows:


      Q. When join HADEP?
      R. About 5 yrs - Dec '97
      S. Stamp on memb. card says "1995".  Is that right?
    A.     Yes
    Q.     But you wd be aged 13 then
    A.     No - I was given the card when I was leader  of  youth  section.
         The card was issued to me when I was elected youth leader in  March
         2002
    Q.     Does memb. card usually not state date of issue?
    A.     When I joined in 1995 I was too young so I cd not have a card  -
         only have card when you become a member aged 18.  Bec  this  was  a
         small town the appn. was sent to Ankara - they look into it - takes
         months, even longer before issuing card
    Q.     Did you become  member at 18?
    A.     No - I cannot remember when I became member.

20.   It is clear from that part of  the  record  of  proceedings  that  the
    question of the date "1995" on the HADEP card was expressly put to  the
    appellant during the course of his oral evidence.  He therefore had the
    opportunity to offer the explanation which has now been put forward  on
    his behalf, namely that it represented the  date  on  which  his  local
    branch of HADEP was founded, not the date on which he himself became  a
    member of the party.  He did not do so.

21.   In the absence of that or some other  plausible  explanation,  it  was
    properly open to the adjudicator to arrive at the conclusion  that  the
    HADEP card was not evidence to which he  was  prepared  to  attach  any
    weight.  The  submission  made  on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  the
    adjudicator  erred  in  arriving  at   that   conclusion   is   clearly
    unsustainable.

22.   The second ground is that the adjudicator erred  in  arriving  at  his
    conclusion at paragraph 13 of his determination in relation to the ill-
    treatment to which the appellant was, he claimed, subjected  whilst  in
    police custody.  It is  argued  on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  the
    adjudicator misdirected himself  by  applying  the  wrong  standard  of
    proof.  Once again, we disagree.

23.    It  is  clear  from  paragraph  13,  read  in  the  context  of   the
    determination is a whole, that the adjudicator  was  concerned  by  the
    appellant's evidence that he had been subjected to ill-treatment whilst
    in police custody on two separate occasions, but  had  not  needed  any
    medical treatment  following  his  release  on  either  occasion.   The
    adjudicator concluded at paragraph 13, "Whilst  the  appellant  is  not
    expected to adduce medical evidence, it is reasonable to infer that  if
    he did not need any medical treatment, perhaps he was not  tortured  as
    alleged" (our emphasis).

24.   That is a conclusion which was properly open  to  the  adjudicator  on
    the evidence.  During the course of his  submissions,  Mr  Boateng-Addo
    argued that the adjudicator was under an obligation to put his concerns
    regarding that part of the appellant's evidence expressly to him so  as
    to enable him to address those concerns, if  he  could.   We  disagree.
    Whilst it is not an  authority  which  is  technically  binding  on  an
    adjudicator sitting outside Scotland, nevertheless the judgment of  the
    Outer House of the Court of Session in Mehmet Koca v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department (22 November 2002) is persuasive  authority  to
    the contrary.  As stated by Lord Carloway in his Opinion  at  paragraph
    36:

         "For these reasons, I hold that there was no  obligation  upon  the
         Adjudicator to put the HADEP discrepancy to the  petitioner  either
         at the stage of examination or submission.  Its  full  significance
         may not have even have (sic) been recognised by her  at  that  time
         but whether that is so or not, it remains the case that a court  or
         tribunal is not obliged to reveal what it might be thinking  during
         the course of  a  hearing  so  that  parties  can  make  additional
         comments on that thinking.  Nor is it bound to disclose, in advance
         of the announcement of its decision, how its reasoning  process  is
         developing with a view to affording parties yet another  chance  to
         address that".

25.   We agree.  It was for the appellant himself,  and  the  representative
    [not Mr Boateng-Addo] who appeared for him before the  adjudicator,  to
    present his case in the best possible light from his point of view.  It
    was no part of the adjudicator's responsibility to  point  out  to  the
    appellant or his representative any actual or perceived  weaknesses  in
    the appellant's evidence.  The second ground  on  which  the  appellant
    bases  his  challenge  to  the  adjudicator's  determination   is   not
    sustainable.

26.   We now turn to the  third  ground,  namely  the  submission  that  the
    adjudicator erred in his consideration of the risks which the appellant
    would face on return to Turkey as a suspected separatist.  In light  of
    the adjudicator's finding at paragraph 15 of his determination that the
    appellant had no identified connection with HADEP,  and  had  not  been
    arrested, that is not an issue on which he was  necessary  for  him  to
    arrive at any conclusion.  It was predicated on the assumption that the
    appellant would be returning to Turkey as a suspected  separatist.   It
    was  the  adjudicator's  conclusion  that  he  was  not  one.   In  the
    circumstances, consideration of the risks which a suspected  separatist
    would face on return was not a relevant issue.  Once again,  the  third
    ground on which the appellant relies is unsustainable.

27.   Read as  a  whole,  it  is  clear  from  the  determination  that  the
    adjudicator gave careful consideration to the evidence which was before
    him.  Having done so, he made clear findings of fact  on  the  material
    issues.  In particular,  he  rejected  the  whole  of  the  appellant's
    account.

28.   He gave proper, intelligible and  adequate  reasons  for  arriving  at
    those findings.  They are findings which were properly open to  him  on
    the evidence before him.  There is no arguable  basis  for  interfering
    with his findings and conclusions.

29.   This appeal is dismissed.
