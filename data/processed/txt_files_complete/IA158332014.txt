                                     and

                                     J S
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by McGlashan
Mackay,     Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The SSHD appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge J
    C Grant-Hutchison, allowing the appeal of Mr S "to the  limited  extent
    of remitting the case back  to  the  respondent  to  fix  a  period  of
    discretionary leave".

 2. At first sight, there are aspects of the determination which  might  be
    open to debate, but matters became clear on reference  to  the  judge's
    record of proceedings.  The outcome  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    agreed between the parties.  It seems that the  author  of  the  SSHD's
    grounds was apparently not aware of that,  nor  had  Mrs  O'Brien  been
    provided with a file record.

 3. It is unfortunate that the solicitors for Mr S did not raise the  point
    by way of a  Rule  24  response,  which  might  have  led  to  a  rapid
    resolution.

 4. Mrs O'Brien acknowledged that the SSHD is not practically prejudiced in
    any event by the outcome in the First-tier Tribunal.  She did not  wish
    to withdraw the appeal in light of the record, there  being  a  "policy
    issue" about the extent to which substantive Article 8 matters are  apt
    to be considered on an appeal under the EEA Regulations.

 5. We are unable to find error of law in  a  determination  which  reaches
    exactly the result envisaged by both parties.  The determination  shall
    stand.

 6. An anonymity order remains in place.
