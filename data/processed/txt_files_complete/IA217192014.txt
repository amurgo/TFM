Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Uppal, instructed by Glen Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Ms Surana is a citizen of India whose date of birth is recorded  as
    17th October 1985.  On or about 6 January 2014, she made application to
    the Secretary of State for variation of her  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom but on 1st May 2014 a decision was made  to  refuse  the
    application and to remove her  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   In
    issue was whether the Respondent had met the requirements of 276B of HC
    395, the ten year long residence Rule.

 2. Ms Surana first entered the United Kingdom on 13th September 2001.   At
    that time she had entry clearance with limited leave until 31st  August
    2003 but thereafter, although there were periods of  absence  from  the
    United  Kingdom,  she  made  in-time  applications  for  extension   or
    variation of leave.

 3.  When  the  application  came  before  the  Secretary  of   State   for
    consideration Ms Surana needed to establish not  only  that  there  had
    been at least ten years'  continuous  long  residence  as  required  by
    276B(i)(a)  but  that  the  "continuous  residence"  fell  within   the
    definition at 276A(a) which provides:

         "'Continuous residence' means residence in the United  Kingdom  for
         an unbroken period, and for these purposes a period  shall  not  be
         considered to have been broken where an applicant  is  absent  from
         the United Kingdom for a period of six months or less  at  any  one
         time, provided that the applicant in question has existing  limited
         leave to enter or remain upon their departure and return, but shall
         be considered to have been broken if the applicant...

         (v)  has spent a total of more than eighteen months absent from the
             United Kingdom during the period in question."

 4. It is common ground in this case that there was an earlier period  when
    were a calculation of a ten year continuous  period  made  there  would
    have been an offending period of absence  in  excess  of  the  eighteen
    months as set out in the Rule above and it is common ground  that  that
    was the situation which appertained at the time when the  Secretary  of
    State considered this application.  However,  as  Mr  Wilding  for  the
    Secretary of State rightly points out, paragraph 276B does not have  an
    inbuilt timetable and by the time the appeal came before Judge Bird  on
    12th January 2015, working backwards, Ms Surana, was in  fact  able  to
    demonstrate the requirements of the Rule.

 5. What happened in this case was that the judge for reasons which are not
    at all clear made reference to Section 3C leave as  if  that  were  the
    determining factor.  It may be that she has expressed herself badly and
    that in fact she intended to explain that by the time  the  matter  was
    before her the requirements of the Rules had been met.  Be that  as  it
    may, not content with the decision of the judge  to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules the Secretary of State sought permission by
    notice dated 20th February 2015 to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that there had been an absence in excess of  eighteen  months  in
    the ten year period being contended for at the time of the  application
    and that the way in which the judge expressed  herself  demonstrated  a
    material error of law because 3C leave could not override  the  periods
    of absence.  On 14th April 2015 permission to  appeal  was  granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davies.

 6. As  I  have  already  indicated  the  matters  in  fact  have  resolved
    themselves.  Mr Wilding accepts that by the time the matter came before
    Judge Bird any error of approach or lack of clarity  in  expression  is
    not material because Ms Surana was able to demonstrate that she met the
    requirements of the Rule, and even if that is not so she is now because
    "3C leave" continues to operate and is relevant in the  calculation  of
    the continuous period.

 7. I am particularly grateful to Mr Wilding for  his  assistance  in  this
    matter.  Ms Surana's passport was not before the Upper Tribunal.   That
    is with the Secretary of State but there was a schedule in Ms  Surana's
    bundle setting out the dates.  Mr Wilding considered that  schedule  in
    advance of the hearing and it was through his  diligence  that  it  was
    possible to deal with this matter so swiftly.

 8. In all the circumstances, although there is an error of law, it is  not
    material.  Were I to re-make the decision  in  any  event  I  would  be
    upholding the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.  For the avoidance  of  doubt
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.
