                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Ojo, C W Law solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
   (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal  or  a
   Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or  any  form  of
   publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellants
   in this determination identified  as  FJR.  This  direction  applies  to,
   amongst others, all parties. Any failure to comply  with  this  direction
   could give rise to contempt of court proceedings




         1. By a decision promulgated on  12th  December  2018,  First-tier
            Tribunal judge Watson dismissed the appeal  of  all  appellants
            against the decision, dated 8th  February  2018,  of  the  SSHD
            refusing their human rights claim.  Permission  to  appeal  was
            granted on 18th January 2019 and thus came before me.


         2. The 5th claimant (HU/05433/2018) is now a British  Citizen  and
            is therefore not liable to  removal.  His  appeal  against  the
            SSHD's decision no longer forms part of these appeals.

         3. In his decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  states,  in
            determining whether it is reasonable for  the  British  Citizen
            child to leave the UK:

             "30. I have taken into account the fact that  the  adults  are
            overstayer and seem to be  without  any  reasonable  cause  for
            failure to comply with Immigration Rules. All private life  has
            been  established  whilst  here   with   precarious   stay.   I
            acknowledge the considerable  public  interest  in  maintaining
            effective immigration controls.
             ....
             32. Having considered the case in the round  I  find  that  is
            reasonable to expect the children to  leave  the  UK....I  find
            that the interest of the children do not outweigh the  need  to
            control  public  expenditure  and   enforce   the   immigration
            rules..."


         4. As acknowledged by Ms  Aboni,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
            failed  to  properly  consider  and  apply  s117B(6)   of   the
            Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  such  that  the
            decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside  to  be
            remade.


         5. When I set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal, s.12(2)
            of the TCEA 2007 requires me to remit the  case  to  the  First
            tier with directions or remake it for  ourselves.  The  factual
            findings directly relevant to any finding under  s117B(6)  have
            not been made.

         6. The  Practice  Statement  dated  25th  September  2012  of  the
            Immigration and Asylum Chamber First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper
            Tribunal states:


                  7.2 The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion  to
                         proceed  to  re-make  the  decision,   instead   of
                         remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
                         unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

                  (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party
                  before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other
                  opportunity for that party's case to be put to and
                  considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

                  (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding
                  which is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal
                  to be re-made is such that, having regard to the
                  overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit
                  the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


         7. The extent of the evidence to be heard and  the  judicial  fact
            finding required in this appeal is such that having  regard  to
            the overriding objective it is appropriate to remit this appeal
            to the First-tier Tribunal.  Both  parties  concurred  in  this
            decision.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision and remit the appeal to be heard afresh by the
    First-tier Tribunal.

    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).



                                    Date 15th April 2019
