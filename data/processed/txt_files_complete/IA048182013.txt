                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Fiona Kempton), sitting at Hatton Cross on 23 July,  to
    a tier 1  migrant appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born 11  June  1977.
    The judge had dismissed the appeal, both on the general ground for  the
    decision (paragraph 322  (1A):  false  documents  submitted),  and  the
    substantive one (paragraph 245C (b) (c): previous earnings not shown).

 2. The main evidence relied on by the presenting officer before the  judge
    had been a witness statement by Catherine McGovern of  HM  Revenue  and
    Customs. The second page named, 'Megan Employment Solutions', as one of
    a number of firms for whom no Revenue records  "...  demonstrated  that
    they had taken part in any legitimate trade". Unfortunately the  second
    page had not appeared in the Home Office bundle before  the  judge,  no
    doubt because that had been copied one-sided; and the judge refused the
    presenting officer permission to put in the full version.

 3. Even so, the judge ruled that the application had been rightly  refused
    under paragraph 322 (1A); but only by reference  to  the  evidence,  or
    lack of it, adduced by the appellant himself:  as  the  Upper  Tribunal
    permission judge pointed out, this effectively reversed the  burden  of
    proof, which lay on the Home Office on this point. Mr  Deller  conceded
    that the judge's decision on this point could not be supported  on  the
    material before her.

 4. On the substantive ground, the burden of proof of  course  lay  on  the
    appellant, and, though the judge's  decision  on  this  point  was  not
    challenged in the grounds of appeal to this Tribunal,  its  correctness
    or otherwise remained a live issue before  me.  The  letters  from  the
    Revenue produced by the appellant (paragraphs 56 -  63  of  his  bundle
    before the judge), apparently confirming payment of tax by him  through
    PAYE in the course of his employment with Megan, needed  to  be  tested
    against what Miss McGovern had said in her witness  statement.  However
    the judge had disabled herself from doing so by  refusing  to  admit  a
    full copy of the statement.

 5. I ruled that the decision on this substantive point would need to be re-
    made: if the appellant had been able to  produce  documentary  evidence
    there and then that he had actually received the money  as  he  claimed
    from Megan, that might have settled it  there  and  then.  However,  he
    claimed, through  Miss  Khan,  that,  despite  the  size  of  the  sums
    involved, amounting to over ï¿½60,000 in 2010 - 11, he had been  paid  in
    cash. He offered to produce evidence of cash transfers he had made from
    the proceeds; but this was not in the bundle which had been  filed  and
    served,  and  was   clearly   going   to   require   further   detailed
    investigation.

 6. Another item of evidence  which  was  also  going  to  require  further
    investigation was Miss McGovern's statement itself. Mr Deller helpfully
    drew my attention to what had been  said,  not  only  about  this  very
    statement, but about its  reference  to  Megan,  by  Michael  Kent  QC,
    sitting as a deputy judge of the High  Court,  in  Zubair  [2013]  EWHC
    (Admin) 1824. The  deputy  judge  had  reached  conclusions  about  the
    statement at paragraphs 52 - 58, which resulted  in  his  quashing  the
    decision to curtail the claimant's leave, which had  been  based  on  a
    similar paragraph 322 (1A) point  to  that  relied  on  in  this  case.
    However, it should be clearly understood that  what  the  deputy  judge
    said about the statement applied in that context  only,  and  there  is
    nothing in his decision to suggest that he intended to rule out its use
    in deciding appeals on substantive grounds, where the burden  of  proof
    is on the appellant.

 7. Nevertheless, it would clearly  be  in  the  public  interest  for  the
    Revenue, through Miss McGovern or  any  other  responsible  person,  to
    clarify exactly what evidence her statement had been based on, so  that
    judges, especially those of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber) could in future have a clear idea of how far they could
    rely on it. So there will  be  a  fresh  hearing,  on  the  substantive
    paragraph 245C ground only, before another first-tier judge, for  which
    both the appellant and the Home Office will be free to file  and  serve
    any further evidence they wish to show whether or not  the  appellant's
    claimed employment with Megan was genuine or not.

Appeal against paragraph 245C  decision  allowed:  decision  to  be  re-made
after hearing in First-tier Tribunal  at  Hatton  Cross,  not  before  Judge
