                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Respondent

 1. The Respondent to whom I shall refer as the Applicant, is a citizen  of
    India born on 3 January 1991.  On 28 October 2013 in India she  married
    Ajit Singh, a British citizen born on 21  February  1977,  who  is  her
    Sponsor.

 2. On 7 December 2013 she applied to the Appellant  (the  ECO)  for  entry
    clearance under paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules as the  wife  of
    her Sponsor.

The Decision and Appeal

 3. On 5 March 2014 the ECO refused  the  Applicant  entry  clearance.   He
    noted the age difference between the  Applicant  and  her  husband  and
    referred to the lack of evidence of any  contact  between  their  first
    meeting and their wedding some nine months later.  He  also  noted  the
    lack of evidence of contact  between  the  Applicant  and  the  Sponsor
    during the month between the wedding  and  her  application  for  entry
    clearance. There was no challenge to the wedding but  the  ECO  doubted
    the marriage relationship was subsisting or that they intended to  live
    together permanently as husband and wife. He also referred to the  lack
    of evidence that the Sponsor was supporting the Applicant or that  they
    had shared finances.

 4. The ECO considered the Sponsor's claimed income had been "contrived for
    the purpose  of  meeting  the  financial  requirement"  and  found  the
    Applicant had not shown the Sponsor met the requisite income  threshold
    requirement under Appendix FM and  referred  to  the  then  outstanding
    appeal in R (MM Lebanon and others) v SSHD[2014] EWCA Civ.985.

 5. On 3 April 2014 the Applicant lodged notice of appeal under Section  82
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  amended  (the
    2002 Act).  The grounds of appeal address the ECO's concerns about  the
    inaccuracy or inadequacy of information about the Sponsor.

 6. On 7 August 2014 the Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the  decision  of
    the ECO and upheld it.  He did not doubt the validity of  the  marriage
    but referred to the lack of  contact  between  the  Applicant  and  her
    Sponsor.  He detailed the ECO's attempts to contact the Sponsor at  his
    place of employment and the failure of the Sponsor to provide  evidence
    that he had been in India between February and March 2014.   He  upheld
    the decision to refuse entry clearance.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 7. By a decision promulgated on 30 November 2014 a panel of the First-tier
    Tribunal (the FTT)  comprising  Judges  N  J  Osborne  and  A  Barcello
    dismissed the  Applicant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  but
    allowed it on human rights grounds by way of reference to Article 8  of
    the European Convention.  The FTT found that the evidence which he  had
    provided included bank statements that did  not  reflect  or  show  his
    monthly income because until October 2014 he had  been  paid  in  cash.
    The FTT also noted that the Sponsor had not been paid during  the  time
    he had been in India.  Nevertheless at paragraphs 18-21 of its decision
    the FTT found the Sponsor did in fact earn in excess of  the  threshold
    minimum of �18,600, had savings in excess of �18,500 and was in secure,
    well-established gainful employment  which  it  said  made  it  "wholly
    disproportionate  to  expect  the   Appellant   to   make   a   further
    application".

 8. On 16 January 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pooler granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal on the basis that the FTT had failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for concluding the decision was  unjustifiably  harsh,
    in particular why the Sponsor should not join the Applicant in India or
    the Applicant should not submit a fresh application.  The FTT  arguably
    had mis-directed itself by referring to the  judgment  in  Chikwamba  v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 which was not relevant to an out of country  spouse
    reunion appeal.

The Upper Tribunal Error of Law Hearing

 9. The Sponsor was present at the hearing although he took no active  part
    in it.  For the ECO Mr Tarlow relied on the grounds for appeal  in  the
    ECO's permission application.  It was not disputed the Applicant  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules; the only issue was  Article  8
    and initially whether the FTT's consideration of the  Article  8  claim
    contained a material error of law.

10. The FTT had erred in using Article 8  as  a  means  to  circumvent  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It had not considered  why  the
    Sponsor could not live in India where he  had  been  born  or  why  the
    decision of the ECO was disproportionate to the need to maintain proper
    immigration control.  As had been stated in the permission to appeal of
    16 January 2015 the judgment in Chikwamba was not relevant.  The upshot
    was that the FTT's findings were unsafe and the decision should be  set
    aside and remade.

11. For the Applicant Mr Jaisri submitted the  grounds  for  permission  to
    appeal pre-dated the  judgment  in  MM  (Lebanon)  which  the  FTT  had
    referred to at paragraph 5(iv) of its decision.  The  core  reason  for
    the grant of permission to  appeal  appeared  at  paragraph  4  of  the
    permission which stated:-

         It is arguable that the Tribunal failed to  give  adequate  reasons
         for that finding and failed to consider whether the ...... for that
         finding (that the Sponsor had earnings in  excess  of  the  minimum
         threshold required by the Rules) and failed to consider whether the
         Sponsor could join the Appellant in India.  It is less likely  that
         the Tribunal misdirected itself  by  referring  to  Chikwamba;  but
         since permission is to be granted all grounds may be argued.

    The FTT had before it the evidence of the Applicant  and  the  Sponsor.
    The validity of their marriage had  been  conceded.   The  FTT  had  at
    paragraph 17 properly addressed the Kafkaesque suggestion  that  having
    made findings in favour of the Applicant in relation to  the  Sponsor's
    income and savings it was not appropriate to require the  Applicant  to
    make a fresh application  to  the  ECO  supported  by  the  documentary
    evidence required by Appendix FM-SE.  References to  the  need  for  an
    Applicant to show some degree of exceptionality before  the  FTT  might
    consider a  claim  under  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  as
    suggested by the determination in Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  640  or  in  R
    (Nagre) v SSHD  [2014]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  were  no  longer  necessary
    following the judgment in MM (Lebanon).

12. Mr Jaisri concluded the FTT had dealt adequately with the other  issues
    and that the decision contained no material error of law.

13. In response Mr Tarlow properly  accepted  that  those  grounds  of  the
    application for permission to appeal based on learning from  R  (Nagre)
    were no longer appropriate but nevertheless the FTT had failed to  give
    adequate reasons to support its conclusion that the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance  was  disproportionate  to  the  need  to   maintain   proper
    immigration control and why the  Sponsor  could  not  settle  with  the
    Applicant in India or the Applicant make a further application now that
    she had the documentation to meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

Consideration of the Error of Law Appeal

14. I took time to consider whether the FTT's decision disclosed a material
    error of law such that it should be set aside in whole or in part.   At
    paragraph 7 of its decision the FTT had incorrectly  stated  that  "The
    point in time which we had to consider the relevant  facts  for  issues
    under Article 8 of the ECHR in relation to human rights is the date  of
    the hearing".  This  is  a  material  error  of  law.   Section  85A(2)
    remained in force at the date of the decision  under  appeal,  5  March
    2014.  Thus the FTT had considered the evidence at the wrong date  when
    it had made its findings at paragraph 21 of its decision.

15. Both Chikwamba and R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27  were  expulsion
    cases and the FTT did not consider the proportionality of  the  refusal
    of entry clearance to whatever  might  be  the  State's  obligation  to
    foster family life: see Shamim Box [2002] UKIAT 02212 and also  to  the
    legitimate public objective of the maintenance  of  proper  immigration
    control.

16. The FTT had stated at paragraph 20 of its  decision  that  it  did  not
    consider the appeal to  have  merited  consideration  under  Article  8
    because it was a "near miss" and had not taken account of the  need  to
    have a set of Rules governing immigration control and  the  maintenance
    of such Rules even if it caused hardship in certain cases and  why  any
    hardship caused to the Applicant remained disproportionate to the  need
    to maintain immigration control.  For these reasons I found  the  FTT's
    decision contained a material error of law such that it should  be  set
    aside.

The Upper Tribunal Substantive Reconsideration

17. Both parties  confirmed  that  the  substantive  reconsideration  could
    proceed immediately since it would consist only of submissions.

18. Mr Jaisri submitted there was family life at the date of  the  decision
    so that Article 8 was engaged.  The issue of the disproportionality  of
    the ECO's refusal of entry clearance had to be considered in the  light
    of the delay and cost in the event that the Applicant  had  to  make  a
    fresh application leading to a  new  decision  and  the  appeal  should
    therefore be allowed.

19. Mr Tarlow relied on the  reasons  given  by  the  ECO  subject  to  the
    concessions contained in the Entry Clearance Manager's review.  The ECO
    had  been  right  to  refuse  entry  clearance  because  there  was   a
    responsibility to maintain immigration control and the  State  in  part
    sought to achieve this by requiring Applicants  to  meet  the  relevant
    provisions of the Immigration Rules including Appendices FM and  FM-SE.
    Paragraph 11(iii) of the decision appeared not to  have  taken  any  of
    this into account.  The Sponsor needed to have sorted out and  provided
    the requisite records to establish that he  met  the  minimum  earnings
    requirement of the Immigration Rules in accordance with those Rules and
    these requirements could not be circumvented by relying on Article 8 of
    the European Convention.

20. It was accepted that the marriage of the Applicant and the Sponsor  was
    genuine and subsisting but nevertheless there was  no  reason  why  the
    Sponsor could not settle in India  or  the  Applicant  make  a  further
    application now that it would appear the Sponsor is in  a  position  to
    provide the requisite documentary evidence to support his  earnings  in
    compliance with the Immigration Rules.  Mr Jaisri had nothing to add by
    way of further submissions.

Findings and Consideration

21. The Applicant had no  legitimate  expectation  she  would  be  able  to
    establish her private and family life with the Sponsor  in  the  United
    Kingdom unless she could satisfy the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Article 8 of the European Convention does  not  impose  on  the
    State an obligation to recognise a non-national's choice of  where  she
    might establish her matrimonial home.  Although there is a duty on  the
    State to foster family life the ECO's decision does not constitute  any
    interference with the manner in which the Applicant and the Sponsor had
    conducted their private and family life prior to the decision.  In such
    circumstances I do not find that the  obligation  of  the  State  under
    Article 8(1) has been engaged by the circumstances of the Applicant and
    the Sponsor.

22. The Applicant has accepted she cannot  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Rules are in place to enable the State to  maintain  proper
    immigration control.  Inability to comply with the requirements of  the
    Rules does mean that applications like that of the Applicant leading to
    the decision under  appeal  will  fail  for  minor  or  non-substantial
    reasons and may result in  the  Applicant  having  to  make  a  further
    application which will necessarily result in the payment of  additional
    fees and delay.  There was no evidence before me to show that the delay
    which a further application would occasion would be substantial or have
    any seriously deleterious effect on the Applicant or the Sponsor  other
    than requiring them to continue their married life in the  same  manner
    as heretofore when they had, doubtless, expected to be  able  to  share
    their married life in the United Kingdom at an earlier date.

23. Notwithstanding the FTT's assertion at paragraph  20  of  its  decision
    that they were not treating the Article  8  appeal  as  a  "near  miss"
    appeal, in the light of the absence  of  any  other  evidence  to  show
    hardship or unreasonableness, the FTT's treatment of  the  claim  under
    Article 8 is in effect allowing the use of Article 8 to allow  a  "near
    miss" appeal.

24. For these reasons the ECO's appeal is allowed with the effect that  the
    appeal  of  the  Applicant  against  refusal  of  entry  clearance   is
    dismissed.

Anonymity

25. There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal I find none is warranted.

Notice of Decision

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law  such
    that it is set aside and the following decision is substituted:-

    The appeal  of  the  Applicant  against  the  ECO's  refusal  of  entry
    clearance is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on human  rights
    grounds.
