Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Bhuiyan, sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 14 October 1979.   She
    applied for an entry clearance to enable her to join her  husband,  the
    sponsor, whom she married in Bangladesh on 7 April 2014.   Her  sponsor
    is a British citizen.  She made the application on 8 April  2014.   The
    application was refused on 3 August 2014.

2.   The appellant initially came to this country on a visit  visa  in  2005
    but left for Bangladesh on 13 March 2008.

3.   In the refusal decision the Entry Clearance Officer  took  issues  with
    the relationship between the  parties  and  whether  the  marriage  was
    valid.  In addition points were taken on the financial aspects  of  the
    Rules.  The Appellant appealed and her appeal came before a  First-tier
    Judge on 2 October 2015.  Having  heard  from  the  sponsor  the  judge
    resolved the credibility issues in favour of the parties and found that
    the relationship between them was genuine and subsisting and that  they
    intended to live together permanently in the United Kingdom and further
    that the marriage was valid.  There has been no cross-appeal from  that
    aspect of the decision.

4.   The judge dismissed the appeal because he was not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had produced the specified evidence to comply  with  Appendix
    FM-SE.  He reached his conclusions on this  aspect  for  the  following
    reasons:

         "56. It was further said that the appellant  and  the  sponsor  had
             failed to supply the  necessary  financial  information.   The
             sponsor is required to show a gross annual income  of  �18,600
             at least.

         57.  The application was dismissed because wage  slips  covering  a
             period of six months prior to the date of application had  not
             been supplied it was said that the last wage slip was dated 28
             February 2014 and was not within the last  28  days  from  the
             date of application which is stated  by  the  entry  clearance
             officer to be 16 April 2014.

         58.  It was further said that a letter from the sponsor's  employer
             had not been submitted.  Equally, bank statements for the same
             period had not been supplied.

         59.  Appendix FM - SE sets out the financial requirements  and  how
             they must be proved.

         60.  Appendix FM-SE A1(1) provides that:

                  'Where this Appendix requires  the  applicant  to  provide
                  specified evidence relating to a period  which  ends  with
                  the date  of  application,  that  evidence,  or  the  most
                  recently dated part of it, must be dated no  earlier  than
                  28 days before the date of application.'

         61.  Appendix FM-SE Rule A1 2 deals with  what  documents  must  be
             provided in respect of salaried employment, this provides

                  'In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where
                  paragraph 9 applies), all of the following  evidence  must
                  be provided:

                  (a)  Payslips covering:

                      (i)  a period of  6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                           application if the person has  been  employed  by
                           their current employer for a least 6 months  (and
                           where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix  does  not
                           apply); or

                      (ii) any period of salaried employment in the  period
                           of 12 months prior to the date of application  if
                           the person has been  employed  by  their  current
                           employer for less than 6 months (or  at  least  6
                           months but the person does not rely on  paragraph
                           7 13(a) of this Appendix), or  in  the  financial
                           year(s) relied upon by a self-employed person.

                  (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips
                      at paragraph 2(a) confirming:

                      (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

                      (ii) the length of their employment;

                      (iii)    the period over which they have been or were
                           paid the level  of  salary  relied  upon  in  the
                           application; and

                      (iv) the type of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term
                           contract or agency).

                  (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding  to  the  same
                      period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a),  showing
                      that the salary has been paid into an account in  the
                      name of the person or in the name of the  person  and
                      their partner jointly'

         62.  The sponsor was at pains to explain his financial position  to
             the entry clearance officer and submitted the explanation that
             appears at page 378 together with the  documents  that  follow
             that explanation.

         63.  Until 27 February 2014 the sponsor was employed by HM  Revenue
             and Customs his last position being security officer.   On  28
             February 2014 he accepted employment with the Home  Office  as
             an intelligence assistant  on  a  salary  which  he  said  was
             �22,515.  His salary with HMRC was stated to be �18,595  which
             with allowances totalled �23,585 in all.

         64.  At the date of  the  application  the  sponsor  had  not  been
             employed by his current employer,  the  Home  Office,  for  at
             least six months.  It would follow that he is able  to  supply
             payslips covering any period of  salaried  employment  in  the
             period of 12 months prior to the date of application under sub-
             paragraph 2(a)(ii) as set out above.

         65.  The payslips that he provided were issued by HMRC and were for
             the months of September, October, November and  December  2013
             and January and February 2014.  I therefore find that  he  has
             complied with Rule 2(a)(ii).

         66.  The bank statements that he submitted cover the  corresponding
             period and show his salary being paid into that account.   See
             for example page 468.  I therefore  find  that  personal  bank
             statements have been provided as required.

         67.  The sponsor also provided a letter from HMRC dated 12 November
             2013 confirming his employment as a security guard.   Attached
             to it is a copy of his terms of employment.

         68.  At page 384 it confirms his annual rate  of  pay  is  �18,595.
             Although  it  indicates  that  the  appellant   will   receive
             additional payments and an annual attendance allowance it does
             not say what these are  and  how  they  are  calculated.   The
             letter does not, therefore,  properly  confirm  the  sponsor's
             gross salary.  Nor does it confirm the period over  which  the
             sponsor has been paid no does it confirm the level  of  salary
             relied upon in the application.  On the face of it,  from  the
             letter  the  appellant  is  5  pounds  short  of  the  minimum
             financial requirement that he has to show.   The  letter  does
             not confirm the length of his employment although  this  could
             be calculated from the other documents supplied.

         69.  I therefore find that the appellant  has  not  complied  fully
             with the financial requirements set out in Paragraph  2(b)  in
             that the letter from the employer does not confirm all of  the
             information  required  and  in  particular  the   confirmation
             required by Rule 2(b)(iii).

         70.  The entry  clearance  officer  refers  to  the  need  for  the
             documents to be dated no earlier than 28 days before the  date
             of application, presumably having in mind FM-SE A1(1) which  I
             have set out above.

         71.  However in this case the appellant is not required to  provide
             specified evidence relating to a period which  ends  with  the
             date of application.  This is because he has changed employers
             and any period of salaried employment  in  the  period  of  12
             months prior to the date  of  application  is  acceptable.   I
             therefore do not consider that the letter from  the  sponsor's
             employer, namely HMRC who issued the payslips, should also  be
             dated within 28 days of the date of application.  However,  in
             any event, I find that the appellant has failed to provide the
             specified financial  information  namely  a  letter  from  his
             employer dealing with all the  information  required  by  Rule
             2(b).

         72.  There  is  no  near  miss  principle  in  complying  with  the
             financial evidence rules.  The appellant suggests  that  there
             should be some evidential flexibility however the rules do not
             in this instance allow evidential flexibility.  The  appellant
             has submitted a specified document namely a  letter  from  his
             employer but it fails to deal with all aspects.   The  missing
             information is  not  verifiable  from  other  documents.   The
             payslips show the appellant is receiving variable sums, it  is
             not possible to work out what  the  appellants  annual  salary
             necessarily is.  There could be some  variation.   To  show  a
             gross income of �18,600 or more the sponsor depends  upon  the
             payment of an annual attendance allowance which is a variable.
              Page 382 suggest that this is variable depending  upon  shift
             rotas.  Without that, the payslips show a  monthly  salary  of
             �1,549.58 which equates  to  the  sponsors  stated  salary  of
             �18,595 per annum.

         73.  It follows that the appellant has failed to provide all of the
             specified financial  evidence  and  has  not  shown  that  the
             financial requirement of �18,600 gross annual income is met.

         74.  Although I have taken issue with some of the  entry  clearance
             officers findings I find  that  the  decision  to  refuse  the
             application under the rules is correct.

         75.  I have found that the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM
             are not satisfied and  therefore  the  appeal  cannot  succeed
             under the Immigration Rules.

         76.  The primary reason for finding that the financial requirements
             are not satisfied, is the failure  to  provide  an  employer's
             letter containing all the specified information,  which  means
             that paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE is not satisfied.  I do not
             find that it has been proved by the  production  of  specified
             evidence, that the Sponsor had an annual income in  excess  of
             �18,600."

    The judge then went on  to  consider  Article  8  and  found  that  the
    respondent's decision was not disproportionate.

5.   The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  and  permission  to
    appeal was granted by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  26  February  2016.
    There was a respondent's response on 3 March 2016 disagreeing with  the
    appellant's grounds and pointing out that the draftsman of the response
    had not had sight of certain documents referred to in the grounds.

6.   At the hearing before me the sponsor  said  that  in  addition  to  the
    letter from the Inland Revenue he had also placed before the respondent
    a letter from the Home Office dated 6 March 2014 giving his  salary  of
    �22,515 per annum.

7.   Mr Bramble helpfully reviewed the material that had  been  put  in  for
    the Entry Clearance Officer.  It was noted that  the  First-tier  Judge
    did not have a respondent's bundle.  The judge had resolved some of the
    concerns in favour of the appellant for example at paragraph 64 of  the
    decision as well  as  paragraph  66.   Mr  Bramble  accepted  that  the
    applicant's claim to have lodged the letter from his current  employers
    appeared to be supported by the  material  put  forward.   It  did  not
    appear that this particular document had been taken into account by the
    First-tier Judge.  On the balance of probabilities it appeared that the
    specified documents had been put forward.  It  was  to  be  noted  that
    there was continuity of employment between the  appellant's  employment
    with HMRC and the Home Office and the fact  that  the  previous  salary
    fell only �5 short of the requirement.  It was open to  the  respondent
    to consider all the documents submitted if the submitted  documentation
    did not contain all the specified evidence.  The First-tier  Judge  had
    plainly not  been  assisted  by  the  absence  of  a  bundle  from  the
    respondent.  In the light of these points Mr Bramble submitted that the
    appellant got home as he put it.

8.   In the light of the helpful submissions  and  concessions  made  by  Mr
    Bramble I find that the  appellant's  appeal  should  be  allowed.   It
    appears that on any view the sponsor was only �5 short of the  required
    salary in his  previous  employment  and  in  respect  of  his  current
    employment with the Home Office his salary is well above what the Rules
    require.  In the light of Mr Bramble's very helpful  concession  it  is
    not necessary for me to set out at any length the reasons  for  finding
    that the First-tier Judge materially erred in law.  As I have said, the
    First-tier Judge was plainly not assisted by the fact that there was no
    respondent's  bundle.   I  have  had  the  benefit  of   Mr   Bramble's
    submissions and observations.  It is clear for the reasons given by him
    that the appellant succeeds in relation to the  financial  requirements
    and I allow the appeal on that ground also.

9.   I remake the decision:

     Appeal allowed.


ANONYMITY

The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal  any  fee  paid  by  the  appellant  should  be
returned.
