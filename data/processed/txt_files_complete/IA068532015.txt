                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of China born on 18th September 1989 and she
    appeals with permission from  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Eshun  against  a
    decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Geraint  Jones  QC.   He
    dismissed her appeal under the Immigration Rules against a decision  of
    the respondent refusing  her  leave  to  remain  further  to  paragraph
    245DD(b) with reference  to  Appendix  A  paragraphs  35  to  53.   The
    appellant  had  failed  to  provide  specified  evidence   further   to
    paragraphs 41-SD and 46-SD of Appendix A.  Paragraph  36,  table  4  of
    Appendix A, sets out the requirements for leave to remain  (as  at  the
    date of the respondent's decision.

|his  application, has been continuously engaged in     |               |
|business activity which was not, or did not amount to, |               |
|activity pursuant to a contract of service with a      |               |
|business other than his own and, during such period,   |               |
|has been continuously:                                 |               |
|(1)  registered with HM Revenue & Customs as self-     |               |

|(iv)   since before 11 July 2014 and up to the date of |               |

|skilled to National Qualifications Framework level 4 or|               |
|above, as stated in the Codes of Practice in Appendix  |               |
|J, and provides the specified evidence in paragraph    |               |
|41-SD.  "Working" in this context means that the core  |               |
|service his business provides to its customers or      |               |
|clients involves the business delivering a service in  |               |
|an occupation at this level.  It excludes any work     |               |
|involved in administration, marketing or website       |               |
|functions for the business, and ...                    |               |


 2. The specified documents with reference to (d)(iii) above are set out in
    paragraph 41-SD and in particular refer to 41-SD(e)(iii) as follows:

         "(iii)   One or more of the following specified documents  covering
             (either  together  or  individually)   a   continuous   period
             commencing before 11 July 2014 up to  no  earlier  than  three
             months before the date of his application:

             (1)  advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
                  online advertising, that has  been  published  locally  or
                  nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the name  of
                  the business if applicable)  together  with  the  business
                  activity,  or  where  his  business  is  trading   online,
                  confirmation of his ownership of the domain  name  of  the
                  business's website.

             (2)  article(s) or online links to article(s) in  a  newspaper
                  or other publication showing the applicant's name (and the
                  name of the business  if  applicable)  together  with  the
                  business activity.

             (3)  information from a trade fair, at which the applicant has
                  had  a  stand  or  given  a  presentation  to  market  his
                  business, showing the applicant's name (and  the  name  of
                  the business if applicable)  together  with  the  business
                  activity, or

             (4)  personal registration with a UK trade body linked to  the
                  applicant's occupation; and ..........."

 3. Challenge was made to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision  on  the
    basis that the appellant had submitted 20 different items  of  evidence
    of marketing to the respondent in support of her application  including
    business cards, orders and further orders for such cards,  confirmation
    of bookings to attend networking  events  and  tradeshows,  a  contract
    dated  13th  May  2014,  online  printouts  from  her  website,  online
    printouts from her advertising of her  interpreting  service  from  her
    website and from 'Yell' (dated 4th August  2014)  and  contracts.   The
    appellant advanced that  the  judge  had  erred  in  finding  that  the
    advertising material had to be 'meaningful', and erred in finding  that
    the business cards combined with the attendance  at  networking  events
    was not advertising and marketing, and that the re-ordering of business
    cards  was  not  referable  to  any  time  period  and  thus  that  the
    advertising material was not referable to any time period.

 4. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  stated  that  the  appellant's  bundle
    contained various documents  between  pages  8  to  22  but  which  was
    documentary evidence that was not available to the  respondent  at  the
    time when the application was decided.  The judge found at paragraph  7
    of his decision, that the appellant's witness  evidence  was  that  she
    attended various networking events in April, May and July 2014 and that
    "at such events she handed out business cards with such enthusiasm that
    it was necessary for her to purchase and pay  for  a  second  batch  of
    business cards as evidenced by the invoices for such business cards  at
    pages 118 and 120."  The judge concluded that "whilst it might well  be
    that such events could present an opportunity to discuss one's business
    with others and/or to network (as it is called) they are not  documents
    evidencing the appellant engaging in business on her own account."   At
    paragraphs 8 to 11 the judge set out the following

         "8.  It was submitted that the documents at pages 82 - 93  evidence
             the appellant engaging in business on her own  account,  as  a
             translator.  Page 82 is an invoice dated 11 June 2014  and  at
             page 83 appears an invoice dated 05 June 2014.  There are then
             specimen agreements  or  contracts  for  translation  services
             before one gets to a document dated 02 June 2014 which, on its
             face, is an "Interpretation Agreement."   No  invoices  issued
             further to any services being provided  under  that  agreement
             have been adduced.

         9.   The appellant entered into an agreement for website design  on
             13 May 2014 and evidence discloses that the website went  live
             on 09 July 2014, some five weeks or  so  after  the  appellant
             made her application.

         10.  The appellant applied under the provisions in (d) of Table  4.
             Accordingly she had to provide one or more of  the  'specified
             documents' set out in Appendix A covering a continuous  period
             commencing before 11 July 2014 up to  no  earlier  than  three
             months before the date of her application.  One such  document
             could  be  advertising  or   marketing   material   (including
             printouts of  online  advertising)  that  has  been  published
             locally or nationally, showing the applicant's name and/or the
             name of the business if applicable, together with the business
             activity.  In  my  judgment  the  respondent  was  correct  to
             conclude that the business card relied upon by  the  appellant
             did not satisfy that requirement.

         11.  The appellant did not provide any articles or online links  to
             articles  showing  the  appellant's  name   and/or   business,
             together  with  the  appropriate   business   activity.    The
             appellant produced no documents showing any involvement  at  a
             trade fair and no evidence of any personal registration with a
             United  Kingdom  trade  body  linked  with   the   applicant's
             occupation."

 5. At paragraph [13] the judge added

             'the appellant has relied primarily upon  the  fact  that  she
             purchased business cards and the fact that she made  a  second
             purchase from which it can be inferred that she  had  used  up
             the earlier supply.  That evidence is  not  referable  to  any
             particular time period.  It seems probable that the  appellant
             was preparing to advertise  her  proposed  business  but  that
             prior to her making her application she had not advance to the
             stage of meaningful marketing or  advertisements  through  the
             time period, of a type specified in Appendix A'.

 6. The grounds for application for  permission  to  appeal  advanced  that
    Appendix A and paragraphs 41-SD did  not  demand  inclusion  of  online
    print-outs in support of an application and the judge's finding thereon
    was clearly erroneous.  It was submitted  that  the  phrase  "including
    print-outs of online advertising" was just an example of  the  sort  of
    material that could be sent in support  of  an  application.   In  this
    instance leaving aside the evidence  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    website she sent proof of repeated purchasing of business  cards  at  a
    time when she was attending various  networking  events  and  contracts
    and/or invoices for work that she had  obtained  as  a  result  of  her
    promoting her business at these events.

 7. In conclusion, I find the term 'meaningful' is not found  within  41-SD
    and this would appear to be a rather unspecific term.  Even  if  it  is
    not correct that the judge  has  read  in  a  stricter  requirement  in
    relation to the marketing material, the business card  must  have  some
    meaning in order to be a business tool at all and it cannot be said  to
    have no  marketing  value  or  it  would  not  have  adopted  the  wide
    international  use  that  it  has.   The  business  card   showed   the
    appellant's name  and  could  be  dated  by  the  invoices  which  were
    presented to the Secretary of State and could be relied on  to  satisfy
    the requirement.  As Mr Haywood submitted by virtue  of  the  documents
    which were dated prior  to  11th  July  2014  and  which  included  the
    invoices it was clear that the appellant had been continuously  engaged
    in business activity since prior to that date and  the  contract  which
    she provided in her appellant's bundle at Section 5 and which Mr Walker
    confirmed were before the Secretary of State prior to the making of the
    decision showed invoices for her interpreting service  dated  5th  June
    2014 and an interpretation agreement dated 2nd June 2014.   This  would
    comply with the requirements of Table 4(d)(iv) and the requirement  for
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).  I note that the Secretary of  State  accepted
    in her decision letter that the appellant had been continuously engaged
    in an occupation (that is interpreting and translating) since prior  to
    11th July 2014.   The  only  point  of  contention  was  the  marketing
    material. The appellant did produce a  contract  and  this  was  not  a
    ground of refusal.

 8. The fact that the appellant did not  provide  any  articles  or  online
    links to articles was not a requirement.  The  requirements  under  41-
    SD(iii) are in the alternative. I note  on  the  application  that  the
    appellant  had  indicated  that  she  had  included  twenty   different
    marketing materials in her bundle presented to the Secretary  of  State
    although the writing is very unclear on the photocopy presented to  the
    judge.  It is clear from the documentation that the  appellant  set  up
    this business on 30th May 2014 with Companies House as there is  online
    documentation to that effect.

 9. Mr Walker provided on behalf of the Secretary of State a  copy  of  the
    appellant's business cards and noted that the invoices were  dated  6th
    May 2014 and 20th  July  2014  and  16th  July  2014  were  before  the
    Secretary of State.

10. On the evidence provided I accept that there was provision of  evidence
    of marketing material which was referable to dates and that  the  judge
    made a mistake of fact by concluding that the purchasing, using up  and
    re-purchasing of business cards was not  referable  to  any  particular
    time period.

11. At the hearing before me Mr Walker conceded that with all the  material
    supplied to the Secretary of  State  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been
    complied with.

12. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007 and  I allow the appeal.





Order

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because the documentation supplied was not easily  assessed  with  reference
to the Rules.
