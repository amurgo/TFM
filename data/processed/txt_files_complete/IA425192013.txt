Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, a Nigerian national, appeals to the Upper Tribunal  from
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Wellesley-Cole  sitting
    at Taylor House on 26 November 2014) dismissing the appellant's  appeal
    against the decision by the Secretary of State on 19 September 2013  to
    refuse to issue him with a residence card as confirmation of a right to
    reside under European Community law as an  extended  family  member  of
    Vincent Goodluck Uzoma, a dual Nigerian and Austrian national.  In  his
    application form, the appellant said they were related as cousins.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that the appellant requires to be accorded anonymity for these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The grounds of refusal were that the appellant  had  not  provided  any
    evidence of his dependency on his EEA national  sponsor  at  any  time,
    either in Nigeria or in the United Kingdom.  So it had been decided  to
    refuse to issue the confirmation  that  he  sought  with  reference  to
    Regulations 8(2)(a) and (c) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 3. Both parties were legally  represented  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Wellesley-Cole.  The judge received oral evidence  from  the  appellant
    and his sponsor ("Uncle Vincent"), and her attention  was  directed  to
    various documents in the appellant's bundle, which included  a  tenancy
    agreement purportedly made on 28 May 2008 between Mr  Omashon  Omorogbe
    (the landlord) and the sponsor (the tenant).  The agreement was  signed
    by the landlord, but not by the tenant.  The  agreement  related  to  a
    tenancy at an address in Benin City for a term of two years.

 4. In his oral evidence, the appellant said he was one of seven  siblings,
    and that his uncle Vincent had been financially supporting him since he
    was a toddler, sending him money through his older brother Peter  Uzoma
    (who continued to live in Benin City, according to  an  affidavit  that
    Peter Uzoma had made in Benin City on 3 July 2014).  When  he  finished
    his education in Nigeria, he wished to do a  masters  degree,  and  for
    that purpose he had arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 May 2010 with a
    student visa.  On arrival, he  had  enrolled  at  the  London  Business
    School  in  Woolwich  and  had  started  a  postgraduate   diploma   in
    administrative management, being supported by Uncle Vincent every  step
    of the way.

 5. In cross-examination, he was asked about the money transfer receipts at
    pages 40 to 48 of the bundle showing remittances from Uncle Vincent  to
    Uncle Peter in Nigeria.  He said that Uncle Peter had passed on to  him
    the cash sent by Uncle Vincent.  He used this money to pay  his  school
    fees at university where he  did  a  diploma  and  a  BA  in  political
    science.  He was referred to  Uncle  Vincent's  witness  statement,  in
    which the sponsor said that on his annual visits to Nigeria he  usually
    took money with him to give to the appellant, or he sent money  to  the
    appellant via money transfer,  or  through  close  family  and  friends
    returning to Nigeria when he was in the UK.  The appellant said it  was
    true that other people had taken money from Uncle Vincent  to  give  to
    him in Nigeria, but he did not know, "who they are".

 6. In cross-examination, the sponsor could not say why the  appellant  had
    only produced his Barclays Bank statements for 2012 and 2013,  although
    he had come here in 2010.  He also did not know why he had not produced
    evidence of his own bank statements prior to 2012.

 7. He was present when the 2008 tenancy agreement was signed.  It was  put
    to him there was no  signature  from  him  on  the  agreement,  and  he
    answered that the tenant did not always sign.

 8. In her closing submissions on behalf of the respondent, the  presenting
    Officer submitted that there was no  corroborative  evidence  that  the
    appellant was supported by his uncle.  There was a serious  discrepancy
    about the amount he claimed he gave  the  appellant  in  the  UK.   The
    appellant said it was �30 to �50 a month, whereas his uncle said it was
    �300 to �400.  Nor was there anything before the Tribunal indicative of
    what was in the appellant's account prior to 7  December  2012.   There
    were no bank statements prior to  that  date  evidencing  transfers  of
    money or cash deposits.  She asked that the judge give little weight to
    the tenancy agreement, as an undated stamp was appended to it.

 9.  In  reply,  Ms  Bustani  for  the  appellant   submitted   there   was
    corroborative evidence in the form of  the  money  transfers  to  Uncle
    Peter and Uncle Peter's affidavit.  There was dependency prior  to  the
    appellant coming to the UK from 2006 onwards when money was  sent,  and
    the uncle had attested to that.  They were living in the same household
    in the UK and on the balance of probabilities  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements prior to coming here.

10. In her subsequent decision, Judge Wellesley-Cole extensively  rehearsed
    the  evidence  in  paragraphs  [5]  to  [12],  summarised  the  closing
    submissions made by the representatives in paragraphs  [13]  and  [14],
    before going on to make her findings of  fact  at  paragraphs  [15]  to
    [17], which I reproduce below.

    15.  As part of my assessment of this EEA dependency Appeal  under  the
         Regulations, I have taken into account the oral testimony  of  both
         the Appellant and his uncle along with the Respondent's bundle  and
         the Appellant's.  Considering matters sequentially,  in  accordance
         with Regulation 8 of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  he
         would have to make out that he was an extended  family  member  who
         resided as part  of  the  household  the  EEA  national  and  under
         Regulation 8(2) satisfies  the  condition  he  was  residing  in  a
         country other than the United Kingdom was dependent upon the EEA or
         was a member of his household.  What was before me was the  tenancy
         agreement in the Appellant's bundle dated 24 May 2008 in Benin City
         Nigeria, signed not  by  the  landlord.   As  Ms  Pountney  rightly
         observed the stamp referred to was not  dated  and  even  though  I
         could accept the tenant may not sign may not these  copies,  as  it
         was not the stamp of solicitors who prepared it which was not dated
         leaves me to place limited weight on it as a legal  document  which
         confirmed that the Appellant was living in the  same  household  as
         his sponsoring uncle Vincent Goodluck's home.  A curious aspect  of
         page 33 of this tenancy agreement was sub-section (2)  which  reads
         as follows:-

             "The tenant Mr. Vincent Goodluck Uzoma is the uncle of Chinedu
             Patrick Mordi who is dependent  on  him.  The  former  is  now
             letting the (3) bedroom flat on the latter's  behalf  and  for
             his use and the  control  lies  with  the  former  Mr  Vincent
             Goodluck Uzoma."

    16.  I regard this as self-serving and not usual  term  and  conditions
         set out in a lease indicative of the fact that this may  have  been
         introduced to bolster this matter on Appeal.  Not only was there no
         other supporting evidence  to  confirm  that  the  Appellant  lived
         there, but the remittances were  from  Mr  Goodluck  Uzoma  to  his
         brother Peter which does not necessarily mean that  they  were  for
         the maintenance of the Appellant.  I therefore again place  limited
         weight on those remittances, the Appellant after all was a  student
         at the time.  Nor do I place weight on  the  affidavit  from  Peter
         Uzoma the Appellant's uncle sworn on 3 July 2014, exhibited at page
         37A.  This is a self-serving document as there  is  no  independent
         evidence in the form of utility bills or  any  other  paperwork  to
         prove that there was financial dependency or that the Appellant was
         living in the same household  as  his  uncle.   Having  taken  into
         account the submissions and looking at this matter in the round  in
         relation to the earlier periods in Nigeria I find that he  has  not
         made out his case as the evidence is too  thin  and  unsatisfactory
         that he was dependent on his family member that is his EEA national
         uncle in Nigeria that is prior to coming to this country.

    17.  In relation to the period when he came to the  United  Kingdom  in
         2010 as a student, I accept that he probably is  dependent  on  his
         Sponsor here, although there were one  or  two  evidential  hiccups
         when there was a significant discrepancy between how much his uncle
         said he maintained him in that he received �300  to  �400  and  the
         Appellant saying it was for a bus pass and  probably  �20  or  �30.
         Whilst not necessarily fatal, it does appear according  to  the  T-
         Mobil phone bill that he lives with his uncle  there  who  supports
         him and his uncle earns �36,000 a year which equates to  just  over
         �2,000 net a month.  His uncle came to court and gave evidence  and
         whilst he was credible in respect of this latter  period,  that  is
         the UK period, there were more difficulty over the earlier Nigerian
         period.  Nor was the Appellant himself entirely straightforward  in
         this regard, admitting at one stage he was in a  hostel.   It  begs
         the question why there was no independent evidence to  support  his
         contention that his uncle maintained him in Nigeria.  On that basis
         therefore this Appeal does not  succeed  because  of  the  lack  of
         evidence of the earlier period supporting his  nephew  in  Nigeria.
         For the above cited reasons therefore his Appeal  does  not  fulfil
         the requirements of Regulation  8  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006.



The Application for Permission to Appeal

11. Ms Bustani settled the appellant's application for permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.  She submitted that  the  judge  had  materially
    erred in law in not making clear credibility findings in respect of the
    two witnesses who had attended before the Tribunal.  The judge  made  a
    positive finding of credibility in respect of  the  sponsor's  evidence
    regarding the period after the appellant came to the UK,  and  yet  had
    failed to provide any clear finding and/or reasoning for not  accepting
    the same  witness'  evidence  in  respect  of  the  period  before  the
    appellant came to the UK (paragraph 7 of the grounds).

12. The judge had been wrong to  characterise  the  tenancy  agreement  and
    Peter Uzoma's  affidavit  as  self-serving,  rather  than  constituting
    independent evidence (paragraphs 8 and 9 of the grounds).

13. The judge's observation in paragraph [16] that the remittances from the
    sponsor to his brother Peter did not "necessarily" mean that they  were
    for the maintenance of the appellant disclosed an error of law  as  the
    judge had thereby  applied  a  higher  standard  than  the  balance  of
    probabilities in determining whether or not the appellant was dependent
    on the sponsor while he was living in Nigeria.

The Initial Refusal of Permission

14. On 24 June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  refused  permission
    to appeal, observing inter alia as follows:

         Overall, the grounds amount  to  no  more  than  disagreement  with
         findings that the judge was clearly entitled  to  make -  for  the
         valid reasons that she gave.  Indeed, given  the  evidence,  it  is
         difficult to think that any First-tier Tribunal  Judge  would  have
         concluded that this appeal should have succeeded on any basis.

The Eventual Grant of Permission

15. On a  renewed  application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted permission  to  appeal
    on 27 August 2015 for the following reasons:

    1.   The renewed grounds amplify but otherwise continue  to  rely  upon
         the original grounds submitted in support of the first  application
         for permission to appeal, and also challenge the reasoning  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge who refused such permission.

    2.   Without wishing to unduly raise the Appellant's hopes, I  am  just
         persuaded  that  this   renewed  application  in  particular   with
         reference to paragraphs 7 to 10 of the grounds in  support  of  the
         first  application,  demonstrates  that  the  original   First-tier
         Tribunal Judge may have made an error of law  in  failing  to  give
         adequate reasons for her findings on material  matters  and  raises
         arguable issues as to whether the Judge  was  entitled  in  law  to
         reach the conclusions that she did for the reasons given.

    3.   I have concluded in the circumstances, that permission  to  appeal
         should be granted in respect of all of the grounds.

The Rule 24 Response

16. On 9 September 2015 John Parkinson of Specialist Appeals  Team  settled
    the Rule 24 response opposing the appeal.  In summary, it was submitted
    that  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  directed  herself
    appropriately:

    3.   The judge has given clear reasons for finding that  the  appellant
         was not, as claimed, a dependent of his uncle  in  Nigeria.  It  is
         clear that the judge considered that sme of the evidence  was  self
         serving and that certain  evidence  was  produced  to  bolster  the
         claim.  Paragraph 15 and 16 refer. The  judge  concludes  that  the
         evidence is too thin and unsatisfactory to make out the appellant's
         claim.

    4.   The judge in reaching this conclusion has  correctly  applied  the
         self direction  on  burden  and  standard  of  proof  contained  in
         paragraph 3.

    5.   The reasoning of the judge is clear and  cogent  and  no  material
         error in law is demonstrated. The grounds are an argument with  the
         decision.

The Error of Law Hearing

17. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Allen developed the arguments raised in the grounds of  appeal.
    She submitted that it was procedurally unfair for the judge to draw  an
    adverse inference from sub-Section 2 of the tenancy agreement quoted by
    her at the end of paragraph [15],  without  giving  the  appellant  the
    opportunity to put in  evidence  to  explain  the  background  to  this
    clause, if necessary by granting an adjournment.  In reply,  Ms  Holmes
    adopted the same position as that taken by her colleague in the Rule 24
    response.

Discussion

18. Contrary to what is alleged in the grounds,  the  judge  made  a  clear
    finding that the appellant had not discharged  the  burden  of  proving
    that he had been a dependant of his EEA national sponsor  when  he  was
    living in Nigeria.  I refer to the end of  paragraph  [16],  where  the
    judge found that the appellant had not  made  out  his  case,  "as  the
    evidence is too thin and unsatisfactory".

19. In making this finding, the judge was not applying too high a  standard
    of proof.  She gave the correct self-direction as  to  the  appropriate
    standard of proof at paragraph [3]  of  her  decision.   Moreover,  her
    approach to the assessment of the evidence was entirely  in  line  with
    some pertinent observations on this topic which have been made  by  the
    Upper Tribunal.

20. In Ihemedu (OFMs - meaning) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT  00340  (IAC)  Senior
    Immigration Judge Storey, as he then was, gave the  following  guidance
    which is quoted at sub-paragraph 2 of the head note:

         An important consideration in the context of an OFM/extended family
         member case is that if a  claimant  had  come  to  the  UK  without
         applying for a family permit from abroad ..., this will  mean  that
         the  UK  authorities  have  been  prevented  from  conducting   the
         extensive examination of the  individual's  personal  circumstances
         envisaged by Reg 12(3) and in the course  of  such  an  examination
         check the documentation submitted.  If an applicant chooses not  to
         apply from abroad for a family permit under  Reg  12  of  the  2006
         Regulations, thereby denying the UK authorities an  opportunity  to
         check documentation in the country concerned, he cannot expect  any
         relaxation in the burden of proof that applies to him when  seeking
         to establish an EEA right (my emphasis).

21. In the same case, Judge Storey noted  at  paragraph  [4]  that  Article
    10(2)(e) of the Citizens Directive stipulated  that  in  cases  falling
    under Article 3(2)(a), which deals with OFMs, applicants  must  produce
    "a document issued by the relevant authority in the country  of  origin
    or country from which  they  are  arriving  certifying  that  they  are
    dependants or members of the household of the union citizen ...".

22. The same observation was made in Moneke (EEA -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]
    UKUT 00341 (IAC) at paragraph [42]:

         We note further that Article 10(2)(e)  of  the  Citizens  Directive
         contemplates documentary evidence.  Whether dependency  could  ever
         be proved by oral testimony alone is not something that we have  to
         decide in this case, but Article 10(2)(e)  does  suggest  that  the
         responsibility is on the applicant  to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of
         State by cogent evidence that is in part documented  (my  emphasis)
         and can be tested as to whether the level of material support,  its
         duration and its impact upon the applicant combined  together  meet
         the material definition of dependency.

23. In this case, there was no documentary evidence of remittances from the
    sponsor to the claimant in the period 2006 to 2010 (or of the  claimant
    being funded by the sponsor in the period 2010 to 2012).  The disclosed
    remittances were remittances from the  sponsor  to  his  older  brother
    Peter.  The affidavit from Peter Uzoma did not  constitute  independent
    documentary evidence. It constituted oral testimony being  given  at  a
    distance by a family member whose evidence could not be tested in cross-
    examination.

24. It was open to the judge to find that the appellant had not  discharged
    the burden of proving prior financial dependency on  the  sponsor,  for
    the reasons which she gave.

25. The appellant also sought to rely on the tenancy agreement  purportedly
    entered into between the sponsor and a landlord in Benin  City  in  May
    2008 in order to show  that  he  had  been  a  member  of  his  uncle's
    household in Nigeria between 2008 and his arrival in the United Kingdom
    in 2010.  But the tenancy agreement had not been signed by the sponsor,
    even though he claimed to have been  present  when  the  agreement  was
    signed by the landlord, and the authentication stamp apparently made by
    a local solicitor did not have a date on it.  So it  was  open  to  the
    judge not to attach weight to the tenancy agreement for these  reasons,
    and also because in her judgment the sub-clause quoted by  her  at  the
    end of paragraph [15] was unusual and self-serving, and, "may have been
    introduced to bolster this  matter  on  appeal".   As  the  judge  also
    observed, there was no other supporting evidence (such as utility bills
    or official correspondence addressed to the appellant) which  confirmed
    that the appellant had actually lived at the address referred to in the
    tenancy agreement.

26. I accept that the judge's observation in the middle of  paragraph  [16]
    that the appellant was, "after all a student at the time" appears to be
    a non-sequitur.  For the fact that the appellant was a student  at  the
    time would mean that he was likely to require financial support.  But I
    do not consider  that  this  non-sequitur  undermines  the  sustainable
    reasons which the judge gives for finding that the  appellant  has  not
    discharged the burden of proving that it  was  Uncle  Vincent  who  was
    supporting him financially while he was a student in Nigeria.

27. The same applies to the judge's finding  at  paragraph  [17]  that  the
    appellant was not himself entirely  straightforward  on  the  issue  of
    prior dependency/prior membership of his uncle's household,  "admitting
    at one stage he was in a hostel".  On analysis, this  is  also  a  non-
    sequitur, as in the period when the appellant admitted to  being  in  a
    hostel, he would not have been a member of  his  uncle's  household  in
    Nigeria.  The issue which the judge had  to  resolve  was  whether  the
    appellant had moved out of a student hostel and had become a member  of
    Uncle Vincent's household in Nigeria from 24 May  2008.   However,  the
    judge gave adequate reasons in paragraphs [15]  and  [16]  for  finding
    that the appellant had not  made  out  this  case  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, and what she says in paragraph [17] does  not  undermine
    the reasons which she has given earlier for  finding  that  the  appeal
    should not succeed, "because of the lack of  evidence  of  the  earlier
    period [of the uncle] supporting his nephew in Nigeria".

Notice of Decision

28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law,  and  the  decision  stands.   Accordingly,  this  appeal  by  the
    appellant to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

29. No anonymity direction is made.
