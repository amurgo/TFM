Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Alam, Counsel, instructed by J Stifford Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in the original appeal is a citizen  of  Bangladesh  born
    on 21 January 1989.  The appeal is by the Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department.  However, for the sake of convenience I shall refer to
    the parties in the designations they were referred to before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

2.   The respondent appeals against the  decision  of  Judge  Sweet  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in a  decision  promulgated  on  29  February  2016
    allowing his appeal under paragraph 345ZX and 322(3) of the Immigration
    Rules.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    P J M Hollingworth on 9 August 2016 stating  that  there  had  been  an
    arguable error of law in respect to the reasoning set out by the  judge
    when he accepted that the appellant had not started the  course.   This
    was on the basis that the judge found the appellant to  be  a  credible
    witness.  The judge did not sufficiently engage with  the  evidence  of
    the appellant's record interview  submitted  by  the  respondent.   The
    permission judge stated that there is arguably an insufficient analysis
    of the issue which was whether the appellant was studying during his 3C
    leave in contravention of the Immigration Rules.

4.   The respondent had refused  the  appellant's  application  pursuant  to
    322(3) of the Immigration Rules, which states that a failure to  comply
    with any conditions attached to the grant of leave to enter  or  remain
    is a ground on which an application should normally be refused.

5.   Judge Sweet in his decision made the  following  findings.   He  stated
    that the burden of proof is on the appellant and the civil standard  of
    balance of probabilities applies.  He stated  that  the  appellant  was
    interviewed by video link on 13 February 2015 and appears to have  said
    in his answers to questions 20 to 24  of  the  interview  that  he  had
    indeed started his course of study.  In his oral evidence as well as in
    the grounds of appeal and witness statement,  the  appellant  submitted
    that he had not actually started the course but merely gave  the  dates
    of the course. The appellant also alluded to the fact that he would  be
    doing three modules out of eleven modules and that he would attend  the
    course on Tuesdays and Wednesdays each week. The appellant states  that
    he only attended an orientation session of the course because he  would
    not be allowed to start the course without the appropriate  visa.   The
    judge found that taking  all  the  facts  into  account  including  the
    appellant's oral evidence, which  he  found  to  be  credible,  he  was
    prepared to accept that the appellant had not started  the  course  and
    the answers he gave at the interview reflected  a  misunderstanding  on
    his part as to the questions. The judge allowed the appellant's  appeal
    stating that given the appellant's college  is  no  longer  has  highly
    trusted status, he will need to find an alternative sponsoring college.

 6. The respondent's grounds of appeal  state  the  following.   The  judge
    accepted the appellant's oral evidence, grounds of appeal  and  witness
    statement in which the appellant claimed that he did not state that  he
    had started his course but merely gave the dates of  the  course.   The
    respondent heavily relies on paragraph 9 of the decision  which  stated
    that the appellant had not  provided  any  evidence  that  he  had  not
    started his course. More importantly, the appellant had not  challenged
    the contents of the interview where the appellant clearly  stated  that
    the appellant had in fact  stated  that  he  had  started  his  course.
    Therefore,  the  appellant  was  studying  during  his  3C   leave   in
    contravention to paragraph 245ZW(c)(iv) of the Immigration Rules

 7. At the hearing I heard submissions from  both  parties  as  to  whether
    there was  an  error  of  law  in  the  decision.   Ms  Weller  in  her
    submissions emphasised the interview record where it is clear that  the
    appellant had said that he had already started studying and  the  judge
    did not give adequate analysis for why he thought  that  the  appellant
    had mistaken the questions at the interview.

 8. Mr  Alam  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  said  that  this  is  a  mere
    disagreement with the decision of the judge and no  material  error  of
    law has been established.  He argued that there was sufficient evidence
    before the judge, both oral and documentary, upon which he was entitled
    to come to the conclusion that he did.  The interview was by video link
    and the appellant did indeed challenge the  interview  in  his  witness
    statement.

Decision as to whether there is an Error of Law in the Determination

 9. The application was refused under  paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration
    Rules on the basis that there was a failure by the appellant to  comply
    with the conditions  attached  to  the  grant  of  leave  in  that  the
    appellant started his course during his 3C leave when he knew it was in
    contravention of the conditions attached to his 3C leave.

10. The issue in this appeal which the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  had  to
    consider was a fairly narrow one and  that  is  whether  the  appellant
    started his course when he had no permission to do so as he was  on  3C
    leave.

11. Although this issue was not raised before me by either party I take  it
    as a Robinson obvious point that the judge  did  not  set  out  in  his
    decision that the burden of proof is upon the respondent to  the  civil
    standard of a balance of probabilities, to show that the appellant  had
    started his course during his 3C leave. The judge, when  he  stated  at
    paragraph 11 that the burden of proof is on the appellant and the civil
    standard of the balance of probabilities applies, did not take  a  step
    by step approach to this appeal. The first step was to  decide  whether
    the respondent had proved to the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant had started studying during his 3C leave and then  go  on  to
    consider the appellant's explanation and evidence  for  that  evidence.
    Had the judge followed this step-by-step approach, perhaps he would not
    have made the error of law that he did.

12. The respondent provided the appellant's interview record to satisfy her
    burden of proof.  Ms  Weller  referred  me  to  the  interview  record,
    especially to questions 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 where the answers of  the
    appellant make it quite clear that  he  had  already  started  studying
    during his 3C leave.

13. The judge  however  in  his  decision  at  paragraph  11  accepted  the
    appellant's oral evidence that the answers he  gave  at  the  interview
    reflected a misunderstanding on his part as to the questions. The judge
    accepted this evidence because he found the appellant to be a  credible
    witness at the hearing.  The judge  however  had  a  responsibility  to
    engage and analyse the respondent's evidence sufficiently in  order  to
    come to that conclusion.  Had he done so, he would have found that  the
    appellant gave unequivocal  answers  such  as  that  there  are  eleven
    modules in the course and he is doing three already and  he  sets  them
    out as developing business management and leadership skill and personal
    development and strategic management.

14. The appellant also said at his interview that he travels by Tube and it
    takes 40 to 45 minutes to get to his college he specified that he takes
    the District Line and then changes to Central Line to Oxford Circus and
    Bakerloo Line, which goes to Wembley Central, and then  it  is  a  two-
    minute walk to the college. He further said that it costs him �3.10 one
    way but that it depends on the time that he goes to  college.   To  the
    question how many hours per week and which days of the week he studies,
    the appellant stated "Tuesday 9 to 12 and 1 to 4, Wednesdays 10 to  1".
    These answers clearly needed analysis by the judge  because  there  are
    very specific. The Judge also failed to  consider  that  the  appellant
    said that he has already paid  fees  of  �2,220  from  fees  of  almost
    �3,000. The judge did not consider the credibility of  the  appellant's
    claim that he has already paid �2,200 college fees when he did not have
    permission to study in this country. On the facts  of  this  case,  the
    judge's decision can be said to be perverse.

15. One of the issues raised by the respondent was that the  appellant  did
    not provide evidence from the college, which he could have at the  time
    that the appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal, and that the judge
    would have been entitled to draw an adverse inference from the lack  of
    evidence which could have been easily obtainable.

16. The judge has fallen into a material error of law by not resolving  the
    conflict between what he  considers  to  be  the  appellant's  credible
    evidence at the hearing and  the  interview  record  submitted  by  the
    respondent.

17. I therefore find that the judge has made a material error of law in the
    decision and I set it aside.

     Remaking of the decision

18. I heard oral evidence from the appellant, which I summarise.   He  said
    he knows how he would travel to the college is because when he went  to
    get his CAS letter he went to the college.  He merely gave  an  outline
    of what the course was going to be.   He  did  not  get  evidence  from
    Morden because they lost their licence.

19. In cross-examination he gave the following evidence.  Asked when did he
    go to get a  letter  from  the  college,  the  appellant  said  at  the
    beginning of 2016.  It was put to him that the refusal letter was dated
    March 2015 and why did he wait until 2016, which was one year later  to
    which there was no answer. The appellant was asked that at question 20,
    he had said that he had started three modules what exactly did he  mean
    to say. The appellant said he had meant to say that the  three  courses
    had started and he would have done them when he got his visa.   It  was
    put to him that he said at the beginning of the interview that  he  was
    asked whether he had started his course he had said yes.  He said maybe
    he thought whether his course  had  started  or  not,  not  him  having
    started the course.  He did his orientation in June or July  2014.   At
    the orientation they only gave the outline of what the course was going
    to be.  In answers for me he said that he has been to  his  college  on
    three occasions.  In questions arising was about what  exactly  was  in
    the orientation and he said it insisted of telling  the  students  what
    the course was going to say.

20. I heard submissions from both parties and their full notes  are  in  my
    Record of Proceedings.

My Findings

21. This appellant's application was refused under paragraph 322(3) of  the
    Immigration Rules, in that he  failed  to  comply  with  the  condition
    attached to his grant of leave and that an application should  normally
    be refused. The features of the general grounds for refusal in  Part  9
    of the Immigration Rules were considered by the Asylum and  Immigration
    Tribunal in JC (Part 9 HC395 - burden  of  proof)  China  [2007]  UKAIT
    00027 ('JC').  Part  9  of  the  Immigration  Rules  contains  'general
    grounds' for the refusal of entry clearance, leave to enter or  remain.
    The applicant is not showing why he  qualifies;  rather  the  decision-
    maker is seeking to show why the applicant is, or should  normally  be,
    disqualified.  (See JC, paras. 8, 10 and 14.)

22. The respondent alleges that the appellant started his course  of  study
    during his 3C leave. The evidence provided by the  respondent  to  show
    that the appellant was studying during  his  3C  leave  came  from  the
    interview given by the appellant by video link.   I  now  consider  the
    respondent's evidence which is the appellant's interview  to  determine
    whether the respondent has  discharged  her  burden  of  proof  on  the
    balance of probabilities.

23. At the beginning of the interview the  appellant  was  asked  what  the
    start date of the course was to  which  he  replied  August  2014.  The
    appellant was specifically asked the question "have  you  started?"  To
    which he replied "yes".  At  question  20,  he  was  asked  "could  you
    provide an overview of the current course?  How many modules does  this
    course have?"  The appellant said "it's like  eleven  modules  so  far.
    I'm doing three already" (emphasis mine).  At question 21 the  question
    but to the appellant was "how does it relate to your previous  course?"
    The appellant replied, "the previous course I've done is  business  law
    and control management because it's similar subjects and my  background
    was commerce before".  At question 55, he was asked, "where will you be
    studying?" he said "3D Morden College" and question 23 was "how do  you
    travel to your place of study?  What route do you take?  How long  does
    it take?  How much does it cost?"  The appellant  said  "just  by  Tube
    like 45, 40 / 45 minutes.  I take  the  District  Line  and  change  to
    Central Line to Oxford Circus to Bakerloo Line and it goes  to  Wembley
    Central and then two-minute walk.  �3.10 one way, it  depends  on  what
    time".  At question 24, he was asked, "how many hours per week  do  you
    study?", the appellant said "Tuesday s 9 to 12 and 1 to  4,  Wednesdays
    10 to 1".  At Question 25 he was asked, "how much  have  you  paid  for
    this course?", he said so far he  has  paid  "�2,200  total  is  almost
    �3,000".

24. The appellant's explanation at the hearing for those very clear answers
    was that he had not started the course because he did not have  a  visa
    and his answers were a clear misunderstanding.  He  said  that  he  was
    giving answers based on what he would have done  when  he  started  the
    course and not that he had already started the course.

25. I find nowhere in the interview has it been recorded that the appellant
    said that he has not started his course because he  did  not  have  his
    visa.  I have set out the answers to the questions which  very  clearly
    indicate that the appellant had started his course.  He said he started
    his course in August 2014.  He answered unequivocally to  the  question
    whether he has started and he said yes, he has started.  The  appellant
    also said that he has paid �2,200.  No explanation has been forthcoming
    as to why he would pay this amount of money even  before  he  had  been
    granted his visa to study in this country. There is also no explanation
    for why the college would be allowed to attend the orientation  without
    having being enrolled in the course and having a visa to study in  this
    country. This evidence goes to his credibility into the credibility  of
    this claim that he had not started his studies.

26. The appellant did not provide any other evidence  other  than  his  own
    evidence that he has not started his course  of  study  during  his  3C
    leave.  His evidence was that he tried to get a letter at the beginning
    of 2016 and he could not  because  the  college  had  closed.   At  the
    hearing the appellant gave no credible explanation for why he  did  not
    immediately attempt to obtain  a  letter  from  the  college  after  he
    received the respondent's reasons for refusal  letter  in  March  2015,
    which raised the issues.  The appellant must have been aware  that  the
    reasons for refusal letter makes serious allegations against him and it
    would be expected that he  would  try  and  obtain  evidence  from  the
    college and his evidence is that he did not even attempt to  do.  I  am
    therefore entitled to draw an adverse  inference  for  the  appellant's
    failure to even attempt to  provide  evidence  which  would  have  been
    easily obtainable at the time.

27. I therefore find that the respondent has satisfied her burden of  proof
    in that she has demonstrated that the appellant was studying during his
    3C course and his application  falls  to  be  refused  under  paragraph
    322(3) of the Immigration Rules.  Mr Alam stated  that  the  respondent
    has a discretion and could have exercised her  discretion  differently.
    It would be a matter for the Secretary of State to have  exercised  her
    discretion differently but in the  appellant's  case,  I  find  it  was
    properly exercised for all the reasons that I have already set out.

28. I therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal pursuant to paragraph 322(3)
    of the Immigration Rules.
