Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Gajjar, of Counsel, instructed by M-R
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and background facts:

 1. The appellants are nationals of  Pakistan.  The  first-named  appellant
    (hereafter referred to as the first appellant), born on [  ]  1986,  is
    the principal appellant. The second appellant is her husband, born on [
    ] 1982. The third and fourth appellants are their minor son (born on  [
    ] 2009) and minor daughter (born on [ ] 2010) respectively. The second,
    third and fourth appellants are said to  be  dependants  in  the  first
    appellant's appeal, although, for the reasons given at para  39  below,
    the second appellant could not have succeeded  in  his  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal (hereafter the "FtT") irrespectively of the outcome
    of the other appeals.

 2. The appellants have been granted permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the FtT Petherbridge (hereafter
    the "judge")  who,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  7  January  2016,
    dismissed their appeals against a decision  of  the  respondent  of  21
    March 2015 to refuse to issue residence cards to  the  first  appellant
    and her dependants as confirmation of  their  rights  of  residence  as
    extended family members of the first appellant's brother, a Naveed  [A]
    (hereafter the sponsor), a British citizen.

 3. The appellants' case before the judge may be briefly stated as follows:

    (i)    The sponsor had exercised  Treaty  rights  in  the  Republic  of
         Ireland. Accordingly, he was to  be  treated  as  an  EEA  national
         exercising Treaty rights pursuant to the principle  established  in
         the judgment of the then European  Court  of  Justice  in  Surinder
         Singh ([1992] EUECJ C-370/90, 7 July 1002).

    (ii)    They  are  extended  family  members  of  the  sponsor   within
         regulation  8  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2006, as amended (the "EEA regulations").

    (iii)  They are entitled to benefit  from  the  principle  in  Surinder
         Singh. In this regard, the appellants relied upon the  decision  of
         the  Upper  Tribunal  (Haddon-Cave  J  and  Upper  Tribunal   Judge
         Kopieczek) in SSHD v Cain (appeal number: IA/40868/2013)  which  is
         an unreported decision.

 4. In Cain, the Upper Tribunal decided that the Surinder  Singh  principle
    extended to someone who was in a durable relationship with the  British
    citizen exercising Treaty rights in  a  Member  State  other  than  the
    United Kingdom. Since those in  a  durable  relationship  are  extended
    family members under regulation 8,  the  appellants  contend  that  the
    Surinder Singh principle also applies to other categories  of  extended
    family members.

 5. Any party who wishes to rely upon an unreported decision of  the  Upper
    Tribunal must comply with para  11  of  the  Practice  Directions.  The
    decision in Cain was handed to the judge at the hearing. The Presenting
    Officer objected to it being relied upon  at  the  hearing  before  the
    judge. Before me, Mr Gajjar accepted that the Practice  Directions  had
    not been complied with.

 6. At the hearing before me, Mr Wilding informed me that the President  of
    the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) has decided to make
    a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union  ("CJEU")  on
    the question whether the Surinder Singh principle extends to those in a
    durable relationship although the  precise  question(s)  had  not  been
    formulated as at the date of the hearing before me.

 7. Regulation 9 of the EEA Regulations was intended by  the  Secretary  of
    State to give effect to the Surinder Singh principle. Regulation  9  is
    set out below, as are regulations 7 and 8 which define  family  members
    and extended family members.

 8. Whilst I quote the relevant part of the judge's assessment below, it is
    fair to say, in brief, that he did not accept that  the  dependency  of
    the first appellant on the sponsor was genuine. He found  that  it  was
    dependency of choice rather than need and that the first appellant  and
    the sponsor had  contrived  together  so  as  to  be  seen  to  satisfy
    regulation 8(2). He found that they  had  made  a  blatant  attempt  to
    contrive a  situation  to  enable  the  first  appellant  to  obtain  a
    residence card in reliance upon the principle in Surinder Singh. He did
    not consider whether, for  the  purposes  of  regulation  9(2)(c),  the
    sponsor had transferred the centre of his life to Ireland.

 9. No issue was taken before the judge or  me  as  to  whether  regulation
    9(2)(c) sets a stricter  test  than  is  required  or  permitted  under
    European law, as interpreted in the judgment in Surinder Singh.

Background

10. The first appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 12  November  2013
    on a visit  visa,  which  expired  on  27  December  2013.  The  second
    appellant entered the United Kingdom on 30 June 2013 on a  visit  visa,
    which expired on 30 June 2015. The third  and  fourth  appellants  both
    entered the United Kingdom on 12 November 2013 on  visit  visas,  which
    expired on 30 December 2013.

11. The first appellant made her application for a residence card on behalf
    of herself and her dependants on 27 November 2014, although the judge's
    decision also states that the second appellant applied for a  residence
    card on 2 December 2015.

12. The evidence before the judge was that the sponsor went to  Ireland  in
    December 2013. He obtained a job there. The  first  appellant  and  the
    sponsor's wife joined him in Ireland in July 2014. They stayed with him
    at his address [Dublin].

13. There was a letter from the sponsor's  employer  in  Ireland,  Ultimate
    Fix, dated 8 October 2014 which confirmed that he worked for them  from
    28 April 2014 until  19  September  2014.  This  letter  describes  his
    employment as "Full-time - Permanent". The evidence  before  the  judge
    did not include a contract of employment.

14. On 15 October 2014, the entire family returned to the  United  Kingdom.
    At some point in the period in between, it appears that  the  remainder
    of the first appellant's family had joined her in Ireland.  There  were
    wage slips showing payments of wages to the sponsor  from  2  May  2014
    until 19 September 2014. There was a P45 showing that he  stopped  work
    on 22 September 2014.

15. Upon their return to the United Kingdom, the sponsor, his wife and  the
    appellants lived at [32 ... Thornton Heath], which was the same address
    at which they lived prior to their departure for Ireland. The  evidence
    before the judge was that the sponsor had lived at this  property  from
    at least 2012. There was no evidence before the  judge  as  to  whether
    this property was owned or rented by the sponsor or why  it  was  still
    available for their occupation upon their return from Ireland.

16. The judge had documentary evidence of remittances from the  sponsor  to
    the first appellant. The judge set out the evidence before him  of  the
    financial support the first appellant received from  the  sponsor  both
    whilst she was in Pakistan and he in the United Kingdom and when he was
    in Ireland and she in the United Kingdom, at para 20, as follows:

         "(1)     The first record of these money transfers  is  that  dated
             the 13 July 2013  when  a  sum  of  �300  (44,738.94  Pakistan
             Rupees) was sent by [the sponsor] to the [first appellant]  in
             Pakistan.

         (2)      On the 13 August 2013, there was a sum of �479.28  (75,000
             Pakistan  Rupees)  sent  by  [the  sponsor]  to   the   [first
             appellant] in Pakistan.

         (3)      On the  10  September  2013,  a  sum  of  �555.32  (90,000
             Pakistan Rupees) was sent  by  [the  sponsor]  to  the  [first
             appellant] in Pakistan.

         (4)      On the 15 June 2014, there was a sum of  750  Euros  (�579
             Sterling) sent by [the sponsor] to the  [first  appellant]  at
             [30 ... Thornton Heath] and on the 05 September 2014 a further
             sum of 507.20 Euros (�401) was sent by [the  sponsor]  to  the
             [first appellant] at the same address.

         (5)      There is also a Moneygram receipt of the 30 April 2014  of
             a sum of 45,051 Pakistan Rupees being sent by [the sponsor] to
             Shamim Begum, the mother of both the [first appellant] and the
             Sponsor."

17. The judge also had a copy of the first appellant's application of  June
    2013 for entry clearance as a visitor in which she said (questions  71-
    77) that her husband supported her financially. In oral evidence before
    the judge, she explained that  her  husband  had  an  oil  distribution
    business in Pakistan which deteriorated to the extent that  he  was  no
    longer able to financially support her as a result of a bad debt.

18. In his witness statement that was before the judge,  the  sponsor  said
    that, from January 2014, he worked on a commission basis with  Ultimate
    Fix in Dublin. However, from 28  April  2014,  he  was  placed  on  the
    company's PAYE, earning commission in addition, which he said was  paid
    in cash. Towards August/September 2014, he was  told  by  his  employer
    that he was thinking of placing him back to being paid on a  commission
    basis only. The sponsor said that this raised concerns in his mind.  He
    said that he looked for other job opportunities in Ireland but his wife
    had changed her mind and wished to return to the United Kingdom as  she
    could not find "a better job opportunity". They  therefore  decided  to
    return to the United Kingdom.

19. As far as I can see, there was no documentary evidence before the judge
    that showed that the sponsor had looked for other jobs  in  Ireland  or
    that his wife had sought employment in Ireland.

20. There were electricity bills in respect of the supply of electricity to
    the  sponsor's  accommodation  which  show  that  he  was  paying   for
    electricity from a period that commenced before 28  January  2014,  the
    date on which the period in relation  to  the  first  electricity  bill
    began. There were copies of bank statements with Allied Irish bank from
    11 March 2014 to 18 August 2014,  an  amended  tax  credit  certificate
    dated 20 May 2014, three Barclays Bank  statements  and  two  Santander
    Bank statements (dated 3 November 2014, 13 September 2013, 17 September
    2012, 16 July 2013 and 13 December 12013) addressed to him at  [32  ...
    Thornton Heath].

21. There was evidence before  the  judge  that  the  first  appellant  had
    enrolled on a one-week English language course (from 2 October 2014  to
    9 October 2014) and successfully obtained  from  Waltham  International
    College an Entry Level Certificate  in  ESOL  International  (Entry  3)
    (CEFR B1).

Regulations 8 and 9 of the EEA Regulations

22. Regulations 7, 8 and 9 of the EEA regulations (insofar as relevant  for
    the purposes of the instant case) read:

         Family member

         7. (1)   Subject to  paragraph  (2),  for  the  purposes  of  these
             Regulations the following persons  shall  be  treated  as  the
             family members of another person-

                  (a)  his spouse or his civil partner;

                  (b)  direct descendants of his, his spouse  or  his  civil
                  partner who are-

                      (i)   under 21; or

                      (ii)  dependants of his,  his  spouse  or  his  civil
                      partner;

                  (c)  dependent direct relatives in his ascending  line  or
                  that of his spouse or his civil partner;

                  (d)  a person who is to be treated as the family member of
                  that other person under paragraph (3).

         Extended family member

         8. (1)   In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
             person who is not a family member of  an  EEA  national  under
             regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who   satisfies   the
             conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national,  his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner and-

                  (a)  he person is residing in a  country  other  than  the
                  United Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA  national  or
                  is a member of his household;

                  (b)  the person satisfied the condition in  paragraph  (a)
                  and is accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom
                  or wishes to join him there; or

                  (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),
                  has joined the EEA national  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
                  continues to be dependent upon him or to be  a  member  of
                  his household.

             (3) ...

             (4) ...

             (5) ...

             (6) In these Regulations "relevant  EEA  national"  means,  in
             relation to an extended family member, the EEA national who is
             or whose spouse or  civil  partner  is  the  relative  of  the
             extended family member for the purpose of paragraph  (2),  (3)
             or (4) or the EEA national who is the partner of the  extended
             family member for the purpose of paragraph (5).

         Family members of British citizens

         9. (1)   If the conditions in paragraph (2)  are  satisfied,  these
             Regulations apply to a person who is the family  member  of  a
             British citizen as if the British citizen ("P")  were  an  EEA
             national.

             (2) The conditions are that-

                  (a)  P is residing in an EEA State as a  worker  or  self-
                  employed person or was so residing before returning to the
                  United Kingdom;

                  (b)  if the family member of P  is  P's  spouse  or  civil
                  partner, the parties are living together in the EEA  State
                  or had entered into the marriage or civil partnership  and
                  were living together in the EEA State before  the  British
                  citizen returned to the United Kingdom; and

                  (c)  the centre of P's life has  transferred  to  the  EEA
                  State where P resided as a worker or self-employed person.



             (3) Factors relevant to whether the centre  of  P's  life  has
             transferred to another EEA State include-

                  (a)  the period of residence in the EEA State as a  worker
                  or self-employed person;

                  (b)  the location of P's principal residence;

                  (c)  the degree of integration of P in the EEA State.

             (4) Where these Regulations apply to the family member of P, P
             is to be treated as holding a valid passport issued by an  EEA
             State for the purpose of the application of regulation  13  to
             that family member."

The judge's decision

23. The judge's reasons for dismissing the appeals are set out at paras 40-
    56 of his decision which I shall now quote:

         "Findings and decision

         40.      The [first appellant] and her husband and two children are
             all citizens of Pakistan.  The family travelled to the  United
             Kingdom in November 2013  having  been  granted  visit  visas.
             The visit visas of the [first appellant] and her two dependent
             children expired on the 27 December 2013.  No attempt was made
             by the [first appellant] and her  two  dependent  children  to
             return to Pakistan in accordance with the terms of the visa.

         41.      The [first appellant's] husband had his  own  visa,  which
             did not expire until 2015.  He is said  to  have  had  an  oil
             distribution business  in  Pakistan  that  was  said  to  have
             financially failed in November 2013, being the reason that the
             [first appellant] and her dependants decided not to return  to
             Pakistan.

         42.      There is no evidence  of  the  [first  appellant]  husband
             having any business in Pakistan.  There is no evidence of  any
             financial failure of such a business.  The business  was  said
             to have been failing since the summer of 2013, but at  a  time
             when  the  [first  appellant's]  husband,  the  owner  of  the
             business, was in the United Kingdom.

         43.      The [first appellant] in her visit visa application, which
             was made in June 2013, did not give any  indication  that  she
             would be financially dependent on her Sponsor,  Naveed.    The
             opposite is, in fact, the case if one looks at  the  responses
             to questions 71 to 77 of the application in which she  clearly
             states that  it  is  her  husband  who  would  be  financially
             supporting her to come to the United Kingdom.   She  does  say
             that it was her intention to stay with  her  brother,  Waheed,
             whilst in the United Kingdom, but  his  address  is  different
             from that at which the [first  appellant]  was  said  to  have
             resided at in the United Kingdom when she received monies from
             the Sponsor sent to her from him in the Republic  of  Ireland.



         44.      No consideration would appear to have  been  made  to  the
             [first appellant] and her family returning to Pakistan  to  be
             financially supported by the Sponsor  there  rather  than  him
             having to support them in the United Kingdom.

         45.      The [first appellant] cannot succeed in  this  application
             on the basis that her Sponsor is a British Citizen  unless  it
             can be shown that the Sponsor is entitled to be treated as  an
             EEA national - non-British - if he can show that his centre of
             interest has removed from the United Kingdom to  the  Republic
             of Ireland.

         46.      For this there is evidence of the Sponsor's employment  in
             Ireland by way of a letter dated the 17 December 2015 at  page
             16 of the Appellant's bundle from Ultimate  Fix  from  the  28
             April 2014 until the 19 September 2014 showing his address  in
             Dublin as being Flat 7, 20 Longwood Avenue, Dublin 8.

         47.      The [first appellant] has sought to argue that her  appeal
             falls to be allowed following Surinder Singh  (C-370/90),  but
             that judgement [sic] does not apply to extended family members
             such as is  the  case  with  the  [first  appellant]  and  her
             dependants.

         48.      It seems to me that this has been a blatant attempt by the
             [first appellant] with her Sponsor to contrive a situation  to
             enable the [first appellant] to obtain  a  Residence  Card  by
             relying on the Surinder Singh  principle  showing  the  [first
             appellant] and her family joining the Sponsor in the  Republic
             of Ireland where it is not disputed that he  worked  and  then
             returning to the United Kingdom.   I do not consider that that
             artificial contrivance, which I believe it to have  been,  can
             qualify  the  [first  appellant]  and  her  dependants  for  a
             Residence Card.

         49.      If the [first appellant] is to succeed, she can only do so
             relying on Regulation 8 (2) of the 2006 Regulations.

             ...

         50.      I find the evidence to be very clear and unambiguous  that
             the [first  appellant],  her  husband  and  her  brother  have
             conspired  together  so  as  to  be  seen  to  be   satisfying
             Regulation 8 (2) of the Regulations.

         51.      To do so, the [first appellant] had to show that she could
             satisfy Regulation 8 (2) (a) and in this respect  her  brother
             moved to the Republic of Ireland where it is accepted that  he
             obtained employment and then invited the [first appellant]  to
             join him there where they resided for about two months.

         52.      In doing that the [first appellant] was  seeking  to  show
             that she resided with the EEA national (her brother) upon whom
             she claims to have been dependent in a country other than  the
             United  Kingdom.   No  reason  was  advanced  by  the   [first
             appellant] as to why it was necessary for her and  her  family
             to go to the Republic of Ireland when it was  shown  that  she
             had received financial support from her Sponsor whilst she was
             living in the United Kingdom - see paragraph 20 (4) ante.

         53.       I  do  not  consider  the  short  time  that  the  [first
             appellant] stayed  in  the  Republic  with  the  EEA  national
             satisfies the requirement of Regulation 8 (2) (a) where it has
             been contrived for the purposes of seeking to  take  advantage
             of  the  Regulations,  especially  where   the   evidence   of
             dependency, the other limb of Regulation 8 (2)  is  so  flawed
             for the reasons I have set out above.

         54.      The Directive 2004/EC/38, the Council Directive, sets  out
             the meaning of dependency stating that it was not the same  as
             mere receipt of some financial assistance  from  the  Sponsor.
             As  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  plain  in  SM  (India)  ....
             dependency means dependency in the sense used by the Court  of
             Justice in the case Lebon...."there is also now the  Court  of
             Justice ruling in the case of SSHD v Islam and Another  [2012]
             EUECJ C-83/11) made in response to the order of  reference  by
             the Upper Tribunal in the case of MR and Others (EEA  extended
             family members) Bangladesh [2010] UNITED KINGDOM UT 449  where
             the Court made it clear that dependency had to be genuine, not
             contrived and that its interpretation had to  be  informed  by
             the principle of effectiveness."

         55.      Because of my earlier finding of the means  by  which  the
             [first appellant] has claimed to have  the  advantage  of  the
             principle in Surinder Singh,  which  I  have  found  to  be  a
             contrivance and an abuse, it follows that  I  must  also  find
             that the [first appellant's] reliance upon the Sponsor is  one
             of choice rather than need.

         56.      There is no reason in my view why  the  [first  appellant]
             and her family could not return to Pakistan and be financially
             supported by the Sponsor.  Whilst I  accept  that  the  [first
             appellant] and the Sponsor are related as claimed,  I  do  not
             accept that there is any evidence of the [first appellant] and
             her Sponsor being members of the same household of  which  the
             Sponsor was the main householder or  prior  dependency.    The
             only evidence of any money having  been  sent  to  the  [first
             appellant's] mother being after the [first appellant]  herself
             came to the United Kingdom."

The grounds and the grant of permission

24. The grounds contend, in summary, as follows:

    i)     (Ground 1) The judge made a material error of fact, in that, the
         address of the first appellant's brother, Waheed, was the  same  as
         the address recorded in  the  money  transfer  receipts  the  judge
         mentioned at para 43, i.e. [32 ... Thornton Heath].

    ii)    (Ground 2) The judge erred  at  para  44  because  there  is  no
         requirement to show  that  consideration  had  been  given  to  the
         possibility of the appellants returning to Pakistan to be supported
         by the sponsor as opposed to him having  to  support  them  in  the
         United Kingdom. In the alternative, any such requirement  would  be
         contrary to the  free  movement  principle  on  which  EEA  law  is
         founded.

    iii)   (Ground 3) Para 44 also shows that the judge had  accepted  that
         the sponsor supports the appellants in the  United  Kingdom,  which
         conflicts with his finding at  paragraph  50  that  the  appellants
         "conspired together so as to be seen to  be  satisfying  regulation
         8(2) of the EEA Regulations".

    In addition, ground 3 contends that, given that the  issue  of  whether
    the Surinder Singh principle extends to  extended  family  members  was
    moot at best prior to the promulgation of the Upper Tribunal's decision
    in Cain on 17 October 2014 and that the first appellant had joined  the
    sponsor in Ireland before Cain was  promulgated,  the  judge's  finding
    that the first appellant had contrived with the sponsor  to  rely  upon
    the Surinder Singh principle was speculative and/or perverse.

25. In granting permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, a judge of  the
    Upper Tribunal Judge raised the following issues:

    i)     Whilst the judge reached findings to  which  he  was  unarguably
         entitled on the evidence as to prior  dependency  under  regulation
         8(2)(a), it was arguable that he erred in taking  into  account  at
         para 52 the motivation of the appellants when  considering  whether
         it could be said that the appellants were members of the  brother's
         household for the proposes of regulation 8(2)(a).

    ii)    Whilst the judge's finding that the appellants and  the  sponsor
         had  engineered  their  period  of  residence  in  Ireland   as   a
         contrivance to gain an EU law right of residence may well have been
         open to him, it is arguable that this is not a reason to find  that
         the appellants could not meet the requirements of regulation 8(2).

Submissions

26. Mr Gajjar accepted that, pursuant to the judgment of the CJEU in O &  B
    v Minister voor Immigratie, Integratie en  Asiel  (C-456/12,  12  March
    2014), the judge was entitled to consider whether  the  appellants  had
    contrived to bring themselves  within  the  Surinder  Singh  principle.
    However, he drew my attention to the fact that the judge had omitted to
    consider whether the sponsor had transferred the centre of his life  to
    Ireland. The sponsor had lived in  Dublin  for  ten  months  which,  he
    submitted, was  beyond  the  minimum  period  of  3  months  considered
    sufficient in O & B. He submitted that  the  sponsor's  employment  was
    genuine whereas O & B made it clear that employment in the Member State
    was not necessary. He  drew  my  attention  to  the  sponsor's  witness
    statement in which he confirmed that he had transferred the  centre  of
    his life to Ireland.

27. Mr Gajjar submitted that, if  the  judge  had  considered  whether  the
    sponsor had transferred the centre of his life  to  Ireland,  he  might
    have made a different decision on the appeal.

28. At my request, Mr Gajjar took me to the evidence relied upon before the
    judge to show that the sponsor had transferred the centre of  his  life
    to Ireland. This is set out above. In addition, Mr Gajjar  informed  me
    that his instructions (there was no  evidence  on  these  points)  were
    that:

    i)     The sponsor and his wife do not have children.

    ii)    The sponsor's bank account with Allied Irish  Bank  was  set  up
         before he went to Ireland.

    iii)   The sponsor's brother, Waheed, continued to live in the property
         at [32 ... Thornton Heath], during the period that  the  appellants
         and the sponsor lived  in  Dublin.  The  first  appellant  and  the
         sponsor's wife lived at this property until  July  2014  when  they
         joined the sponsor in Ireland.  The  property  was  kept  open  and
         remained available when they and the sponsor returned to the United
         Kingdom in October 2014 but there was no evidence before the  judge
         as to why the property was still available.

    iv)    In November or December 2014, the  sponsor,  his  wife  and  the
         appellants moved to [6 ... Thornton Heath].

29. Although the second appellant's relationship with the sponsor  did  not
    fall within the  terms  of  regulation  8,  Mr  Gajjar  submitted  that
    regulations 8 and 9 should be read purposively. It would  be  illogical
    for a biological sibling - i.e. the first appellant -  to  succeed  but
    not her spouse.

30. Mr Gajjar submitted that the judge's finding, that the sponsor and  the
    appellants had contrived their circumstances  so  as  to  benefit  from
    Surinder Singh, is rebutted by the fact that the sponsor went  to  live
    in  Ireland  in  December  2013  whereas  the  decision  in  Cain   was
    promulgated on 17 October 2014.

31. In response, Mr Wilding submitted that the second appellant  could  not
    succeed in his appeal and therefore any error could not be material  in
    his appeal, given that he is not a  relative  of  the  sponsor  or  the
    sponsor's wife.

32. In relation to the remaining  appellants,  Mr  Wilding  said  that  the
    Secretary of State's position is that the Surinder Singh principle does
    not extend to extended  family  members.  However,  in  any  event,  he
    submitted that the judge did not err in  making  his  findings  on  the
    issue of dependency. The appellants had not established that they  were
    genuinely dependent on the sponsor.

33. Mr Wilding submitted that, in any event, the judge was entitled to find
    that the appellants had contrived their circumstances  artificially  so
    as to come within the Surinder Singh principle.  Furthermore,  even  if
    this was wrong, any  error  was  not  material  given  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence of the  sponsor's  integration  in  Ireland.  For
    example, he said that the bank statements showed that  there  were  six
    ATM withdrawals by the sponsor over a three-month period and two direct
    debits.

34. Finally, he reminded me  that,  given  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision
    Ihemedu (OFMs - meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340 (IAC) and  the  fact
    that the Secretary of State had not  considered  the  exercise  of  her
    discretion under regulation 17(4), the most that the  appellants  could
    have hoped for was for the decision to be found not in accordance  with
    the law for the Secretary of State to  consider  the  exercise  of  her
    discretion under regulation 17(4).

35. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

36. In my view, the judge appears  to  have  conflated  his  assessment  of
    whether, as a matter of fact, the  appellants  were  dependent  on  the
    sponsor for the purposes of  regulation  8(2)  and  his  assessment  of
    whether  they  had,  in  conjunction  with  the  sponsor,  artificially
    conspired to create the circumstances so as to bring themselves  within
    the Surinder Singh principle.  For the  purposes  of  regulation  8(2),
    dependency by choice is not precluded. However, in  the  assessment  of
    whether an individual has contrived his or her circumstances  in  order
    to benefit from EEA law,  the  absence  of  a  proper  reason  for  the
    dependency may be relevant  in  deciding  whether  the  individual  had
    contrived to artificially bring about a set of circumstances so  as  to
    benefit from EEA law contrary to O & B.

37. It would therefore have been more helpful if the judge  had  considered
    first, whether the appellants  satisfied  the  definition  of  extended
    family member in regulation 8(2) reminding himself at this  point  that
    he was considering whether the dependency existed as a matter  of  fact
    before turning to consider the sponsor's motive in going to Ireland and
    the appellants' motive in becoming dependent on the sponsor and  moving
    to Ireland.

38. However, any error in the judge's approach is not material for  reasons
    which I will now give.

39. The second appellant could not have succeeded in  his  appeal  whatever
    the position in relation  to  the  other  appellants  because,  on  any
    legitimate view, he cannot bring himself within regulation 8(2).  He is
    not related to the sponsor or the sponsor's wife. Accordingly,  on  any
    legitimate view, he is not an extended family member.

40. I  reject  Mr  Gajjar's  submission  that  regulation  8(2)  should  be
    interpreted so as to include the second  appellant.  This  would  be  a
    significant widening  of  the  definition  of  extended  family  member
    requiring an interpretation which  effectively  does  violence  to  its
    wording. Mr Gajjar did  not  suggest  that  regulation  8(2)  does  not
    correctly transpose the relevant provision in Directive 2004/38/EC.  In
    cases where an extended family member does succeed under  the  Surinder
    Singh principle, assuming for present purposes that the Surinder  Singh
    principle is available to extended family members, the  spouse  of  the
    extended family member would be able to rely  upon  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR.

41. In relation to the remaining appellants, the  fact  is  that  there  is
    simply no  authority  for  the  proposition  that  the  Surinder  Singh
    principle applies to extended family members. Cain is  not  a  reported
    decision, although of course I give due deference to the decision given
    that the panel that heard that case included Haddon-Cave J.

42. However, even if the Surinder Singh principle is available to  extended
    family members, the judge was fully entitled in my  judgement  to  find
    that the appellants and the  sponsor  had  artificially  contrived  the
    circumstances so as to bring the appellants within the  Surinder  Singh
    principle. It is plain from para 40 onwards of his decision,  that  the
    judge considered the evidence before him very carefully. He plainly had
    difficulties with the first appellant's explanation of the reasons  why
    she said her husband financially supported her when she made her  visit
    visa application, noting that there was no  evidence  that  the  second
    appellant did have an oil distribution business in Pakistan or that the
    business floundered. In assessing the credibility  of  the  explanation
    that these  were  the  reasons  why  the  appellants  were  financially
    dependent on the sponsor, the judge was entitled to take  into  account
    the fact that it appeared that no consideration had been given  to  the
    possibility of the appellants returning to  Pakistan  and  the  sponsor
    financially supporting them by remitting funds from the United Kingdom,
    as it was said he had done previously when the second appellant was  in
    Pakistan,  especially  given  that,  as  the  judge  noted,  the  first
    appellant and her two children overstayed their  visit  visas.  He  was
    entitled to take into account the fact that  no  explanation  had  been
    given why it was necessary for the first appellant and her family to go
    to Ireland when it had been shown  that  the  sponsor  had  financially
    supported them whilst they were living in the United Kingdom.

43. I acknowledge that Cain was promulgated in August 2014  by  which  time
    the sponsor had already started his employment in Ireland and the first
    appellant had joined him there.  However,  this  does  not  preclude  a
    finding that they did artificially bring about a set  of  circumstances
    so as to attempt to argue that the principle in Surinder  Singh  should
    apply to them. The  appellant  in  Cain  made  her  application  for  a
    residence card on 6 June 2013 (para 3 of the  judgment  in  Cain).  The
    possibility of the Surinder Singh principle being extended  to  include
    someone in a durable relationship was plainly  known  to  her  in  June
    2013. There is no reason to suppose that it had not  been  more  widely
    speculated upon in the legal fraternity then. The fact  that  the  Cain
    judgment was promulgated in August 2014 is at best a neutral point.

44. In my judgement, the judge was fully entitled to reach his finding that
    the sponsor and  the  second  appellant  artificially  contrived  their
    circumstances so as to bring the appellants within the  Surinder  Singh
    principle, for the reasons he gave.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I
    have  considered  the  written  grounds  and  the  grounds  upon  which
    permission was granted. I reject the written grounds  for  the  reasons
    given below. The grounds upon which permission was given conflated  the
    dependency issue with the abuse issue which was not helped by the  fact
    that the judge did not consider the two issues separately,  as  I  have
    explained above.

45. There is simply no substance  in  the  written  grounds.  Ground  2  is
    misconceived.  The  judge  was  entitled  to   consider   whether   any
    consideration had been given  to  the  possibility  of  the  appellants
    returning to Pakistan in reaching his finding, on  the  evidence  as  a
    whole,  as  to  whether   they   had   artificially   contrived   their
    circumstances in an attempt to bring  themselves  within  the  Surinder
    Singh principle.

46. Ground 3 conflates the issue as to whether the dependency existed as  a
    mater of fact for the purposes of regulation  8(2)  and  the  issue  of
    abuse, as explained above.

47. In relation to ground 1, any misapprehension of  the  evidence  on  the
    part of the judge is not material to the outcome  given  the  remaining
    reasons that the judge gave for his finding that the  sponsor  and  the
    first  appellant  artificially  contrived  the  circumstances  of   the
    appellants in an attempt  to  bring  them  within  the  Surinder  Singh
    principle.

48. Mr Gajjar submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  engage  with  the
    evidence as to the sponsor's integration, evidence to which he referred
    me at my request and which I have summarised above. However,  the  fact
    is that judges are not required to refer to all of the evidence  before
    them. The evidence to which Mr Gajjar referred me was very  limited  in
    nature. Any individual who has accommodation in  any  country  is  very
    likely to have to pay for the use of electricity. Thus, the  fact  that
    the sponsor had electricity bills in his name is not  weighty  evidence
    of integration, on any legitimate view. Likewise, the fact that he  had
    a bank account. Indeed, Mr Gajjar's instructions were that the  sponsor
    opened his bank account with Allied Irish  Bank  when  he  was  in  the
    United Kingdom.

49. The judge was plainly aware that the sponsor had a job in  Ireland  and
    worked there for some months. There is  no  reason  to  think  that  he
    failed to take that into account in reaching his findings of fact.

50. However, what is significant is the fact that there were  several  gaps
    in the evidence, gaps which, bearing in mind that burden  of  proof  is
    upon the appellants, are telling. Specifically:

    i)     There was no evidence before the judge of any links developed by
         the sponsor with members of the community in Ireland.

    ii)    There was  no  documentary  evidence  of  any  attempts  by  the
         sponsor's wife to look for jobs in Ireland. Her inability to obtain
         employment was given as one reason for the sponsor,  his  wife  and
         the appellants returning to the United Kingdom.

    iii)   There was no documentary evidence of  the  sponsor  looking  for
         alternative employment in Ireland.

    iv)    There was no evidence as to whether the sponsor owned or  rented
         the accommodation he lived in prior to leaving  for  Ireland.  This
         notwithstanding  the  fact  that  regulation  9(3)(b)  specifically
         refers to the location of the EEA national's  principal  residence.
         If, for example, the property was owned by the sponsor, whether  he
         had put it on the market for sale after  his  wife  and  the  first
         appellant joined him in  Ireland  in  July  2014  would  have  been
         relevant. On the other hand, if it was rented by him,  evidence  as
         to why it made financial sense for Waheed to continue living  in  a
         property that had accommodated four or five  adults  (depending  on
         whether Waheed also lived at the property prior  to  the  sponsor's
         departure for Ireland) and two  children  prior  to  the  sponsor's
         departure for Ireland.

    Absent such  evidence,  the  appellants  placed  before  the  judge  no
    explanation why  the  sponsor's  former  residence  in  Thornton  Heath
    remained available to him and the  appellants  in  September  2014  and
    thus, they placed no evidence before the judge to  establish  that  the
    sponsor's principal place of residence  during  his  absence  from  the
    United Kingdom was in fact his address in Dublin.

51. I have concluded that, on the whole of the evidence that was before the
    judge and given the significant gaps in the evidence, any judge of  the
    FtT was bound to have concluded,  on  any  legitimate  view,  that  the
    sponsor and  the  first  appellant  had  artificially  contrived  their
    circumstances in an attempt to bring the appellants within the Surinder
    Singh principle. Accordingly, the failure of the judge to  engage  more
    fully with the evidence before him, which would have included the  gaps
