Representation:
For the Appellant:         Mr P Armstrong, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondents/Claimants:      Miss Manjit Dogra, Counsel instructed
                               by Immigration and Work Permit Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer from the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Shamash
    sitting at Taylor House on  14th  July  2014)  allowing  on  Article  8
    grounds the claimants' appeals against the refusal of  entry  clearance
    as family visitors.  The First-tier Tribunal does not make an anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that such a direction is warranted for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Both claimants are nationals of Bangladesh.   The  first  claimant  was
    born on 5 October 1953, and the second claimant was born on 10 February
    1997.  The first claimant is the mother of the second claimant.  As she
    is the main claimant, I shall hereafter refer to her  as  the  claimant
    save where the context otherwise requires.

 3. On 27 July 2013 each of them applied for entry clearance  in  order  to
    undertake a two month family visit.  In her  application  the  claimant
    said that she was widowed, and that she had one dependent child, namely
    the second claimant.  Her son-in-law and UK sponsor was  going  to  pay
    for her travel to the United Kingdom and to meet all her expenses there
    such as accommodation and food.  She received money from  her  daughter
    and son-in-law in the UK for family cost purposes.  As evidence of  her
    savings, she was attaching her bank statement.

 4. Her daughter her was Jesmin Begum, whose date of birth  is  10  October
    1984.  She was a British national, and her husband  was  self-employed.
    She had last seen her daughter in Bangladesh in 2010.  Her daughter and
    son-in-law, who lived in Ely, had three children.  These were her close
    family members in the UK.  She was also hoping to  see  her  son,  Raju
    Ahmed, who was also a British citizen.

 5. On 12 August 2013 an Entry Clearance Officer in Dhaka gave his  reasons
    for refusing the claimant's application.  He said it was reasonable for
    him to consider her personal and economic circumstances as part of  his
    overall assessment of her application and her  intentions  in  the  UK.
    She submitted a bank account statement that showed a balance of  �2,557
    sterling equivalent as of 5 March 2013, and she stated that  this  bank
    statement reflected her savings.   There  was  no  documentary  support
    demonstrating the origin of the funds that were present in this account
    in March 2013, so he was not satisfied these funds  were  available  to
    her for exclusive use.  She  provided  no  evidence  of  her  financial
    circumstances in Bangladesh, and this led him to doubt  her  intentions
    of visiting the UK at this time.  She was a widow  and  claimed  to  be
    supported by her family in the UK.  He was not satisfied that her  ties
    were such that she intended to leave the UK on completion of her visit.
    He refused the application under subparagraph (i) and (ii) of paragraph
    41.  Ashfak Ahmed was refused in line with his mother.   Both  of  them
    were informed that their right of appeal was  limited  to  the  grounds
    referred to in Section 84(1)(c) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

 6. In her grounds of appeal, the claimant said she is entitled to  a  full
    right of appeal as her daughter was her sponsor and she wanted  to  see
    her daughter and family.  The refusal decision was  unreasonable.   She
    had enough landed property from which sufficient income  was  generated
    to maintain and accommodate herself in Bangladesh.  The ECO had  failed
    to examine the application form which clearly stated that she would  be
    bearing the costs of travel, not her UK sponsor.

 7. On 7 January 2014 an Entry  Clearance  Manager  gave  his  reasons  for
    upholding the refusal decisions.  The claimants were not entitled to  a
    full right of appeal.  All rights of appeal had been removed on 25 June
    2013, and so the ECO was correct in granting the  claimants  a  limited
    right of appeal.  The claimants had not stated in the grounds of appeal
    why they believed their human rights had been breached.  In  any  event
    the claimants had not seen their relatives in the UK since 2010, and so
    he was satisfied that the modest degree of family life that had existed
    in recent  years  would  continue,  and  would  not  be  prejudiced  or
    diminished by refusing them entry clearance.  The claimants had  strong
    family ties in the UK with five children/siblings living there and  had
    shown limited  evidence  of  their  circumstances  and  commitments  in
    Bangladesh.  Given their reliance on family in the UK for  support  and
    their strong family ties in the UK, he was not satisfied the  claimants
    had shown that their circumstances were such  that  they  were  genuine
    family visitors or that they intended to leave the UK.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appeals of the appellants came  before  Judge  Shamash  sitting  at
    Taylor House on 14 July 2014.  Mr  Islam  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    claimants, and there was no  appearance  by  a  Presenting  Officer  on
    behalf of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   The  judge  received  oral
    evidence from Mr Shahid, the claimant's son-in-law.  He said it  was  a
    genuine application and one where the claimant's right to  family  life
    would be denied if she was not allowed to  enter  the  United  Kingdom,
    bearing in mind the close family  relationship.   There  were  a  large
    number of family members living  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  it  was
    impracticable for the sponsors all to go to Bangladesh.   It  was  very
    important for the family to be reunited  in  the  United  Kingdom.   He
    lived in a four bedroom  house  and  he  had  a  business  running  two
    restaurants.  The balance in the  claimant's  bank  account  of  �2,557
    reflected income from land and selling crops.

 9. Following the hearing the judge received crop receipts  for  both  2013
    and 2014.  She also received a letter from Sylhet Science College which
    confirmed that the second claimant continued to study there.

10. In his subsequent determination, the judge said at paragraph 20 that if
    he had been entitled to decide this matter under the  Rules,  he  would
    have found that the claimants met the Rules.  Now  that  there  was  no
    right of appeal against  refusals,  it  was  incumbent  upon  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer to exercise care and diligence and to ensure  against
    prejudice and/or swift decisions.  Although the evidence was not before
    the Entry Clearance Officer, he had seen evidence of significant assets
    in Bangladesh.  He also heard oral evidence to that effect.  The  judge
    continued in paragraph 23:

         The sponsor told me that for the family to visit  Bangladesh  would
         be impossible.  For the large family settled in different parts  of
         the  world,  particularly  in  the  United  Kingdom.    The   first
         [claimant] is a mother and it is important for her to  be  able  to
         see her children and for her youngest son, the  second  [claimant],
         to spend time with his adult brothers and sisters.  It appears that
         refusing this application would result in an interference of family
         life which would not be  in  accordance  with  the  law.   Such  an
         interference is not justifiable because the  [claimants]  meet  the
         Rules.  In short, the decision is  not  proportionate  because  the
         [claimants] have established that they meet the Rules.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. On 1 October 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew  granted  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that the judge erred  in  law  in  his  approach  to
         Article 8 in that he did not consider in the first instance whether
         Article 8(1) was met, in view of the lack of dependence between the
         Sponsor and the [Claimants].  Further,  he  did  not  identify  any
         arguably good grounds for considering matters outside the Rules.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. After hearing submissions  from  both  parties  on  the  error  of  law
    question, I ruled in the Entry Clearance Officer's favour.  My  reasons
    for finding an error of law are set out below.

13. For the purposes of remaking the decision,  I  invited  Miss  Dogra  to
    tender Mr Abu Shahid as a witness.  In his witness  statement  dated  4
    July 2014 he said that he had sponsored the claimants because they  had
    not seen them for a  long  time  and  they  could  not  visit  them  in
    Bangladesh.  This was because  of  his  business  commitments  and  his
    children's education.

14. In his oral evidence, he said that he had three children who ranged  in
    age from 9 to 2.  He owned and ran two restaurants.  He had  a  manager
    in one of  them,  but  he  did  not  employ  a  manager  in  the  other
    restaurant.  This was because it was difficult to get  staff.   He  had
    not had a holiday for five years.  He had not advertised for a manager.
     It was put to him that his wife and children could at least go out  to
    Bangladesh for a family visit during the school holidays.  He said that
    his wife also helped in the restaurant, and she  could  not  travel  at
    present, because she was not feeling well.  She suffered from headaches
    and depression.

15. His mother-in-law had four other children in the UK.  Her  three  other
    daughters here were not working.  Her eldest son ran a restaurant.  She
    did not think that the other children had gone back to see their mother
    in Bangladesh recently, but he did not know why.

16. In his closing submissions on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer, Mr
    Armstrong submitted that the sponsor had �26,000  spread  over  various
    bank accounts, and it was simply a matter of choice for him not  to  go
    with his family to visit the claimants.  There was no medical  evidence
    to support the proposition that his wife was unfit to travel.   A  trip
    to Bangladesh would do her some good.

17. In reply,  Miss  Dogra  submitted  that  it  was  likely  that  it  was
    impractical for the claimant's other children in the UK to visit her in
    Bangladesh.  It was illogical  to  apply  a  test  of  dependency  when
    considering Article 8(1) in the context of a family visit visa  appeal,
    when this would be in direct conflict with the  applicable  Immigration
    Rules where dependency would negate the assumption  that  an  applicant
    was a genuine visitor.  What was required was an  analysis  of  whether
    the applicants had a family life within the context of applying  for  a
    family visit visa.  She submitted the  evidence  established  that  the
    claimants had a family life for the purposes of  Article  8(1)  of  the
    ECHR.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

18. In paragraph [21] of Muse & Ors v Entry Clearance Officer  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ  10  Lord  Justice  Toulson  acknowledged  that  the  case  law  at
    Strasbourg and in the UK placed a high value on the ability of families
    to live together: and it was well established that in this regard there
    is both a positive and a negative obligation under Article 8.

19. At paragraph [22] he said that the principle enunciated by Lord Bingham
    in paragraph 20 of Huang [2007] UKHL 11  drew  no  distinction  between
    refusal of leave to enter and refusal of  leave  to  remain.   However,
    that was not to say that, in the  application  of  the  principle,  the
    question of proportionality  between  proper  immigration  control  and
    proper respect for family life need be answered in the same way:

    (a)  in a case of refusal of entry which is sought for the  purpose  of
         family reunion; and

    (b)  in a case of removal which would break up a family.

    Each case has to be considered on its own facts.

20. At paragraph [23], he observed that the trauma of breaking up a  family
    and thereby rupturing family ties may be significantly greater than the
    effect of not facilitating the reunion of a family whose  members  have
    become accustomed to living apart following a decision by part  of  the
    family to live elsewhere.

21. At paragraph [24] he held that where entry is sought for the purpose of
    family  reunion,  the  Immigration  Rules,  laid   before   Parliament,
    represent an attempt by the government to strike a fair balance between
    respect  for  family  life  and  immigration  control,  which  includes
    economic  considerations.   It  is  within  the   state's   margin   of
    appreciation to set those Rules and as a  matter  of  generalities  the
    requirements are proportionate.  But the Rules are  the  beginning  and
    not the end of the matter.  The authorities provide examples  of  cases
    which fall outside the Rules where the positive obligation of the state
    under Article 8 requires the giving of leave to enter.  Such cases  are
    often difficult and require close analysis of the facts.

22. As was held in Muse v Entry Clearance Officer, although the five  point
    Razgar test was formulated in the context of removals, it  should  also
    be applied in exclusion cases.  Judge  Shamash  erred  in  law  in  not
    asking himself the question whether the interference consequential upon
    the refusal decisions was of sufficient seriousness to  engage  Article
    8(1), and he did not engage with the reasons given in  the  ECM  review
    for answering questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test in the negative.

23. However, I find that there is no merit in  the  case  advanced  in  the
    grounds of appeal that an Article 8 assessment in a family  visit  visa
    appeal  should  only  be  carried  out  where  there   are   compelling
    circumstances not recognised by the Rules, following MF Nigeria  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192 and Gulshan 2013 UKUT 00640 (IAC).  Unlike an application
    for entry clearance for  the  purposes  of  settlement,  there  are  no
    provisions in Appendix FM which bite  upon  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a family visitor.  So the Gulshan/Nagre methodology cannot
    apply, and following MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ  985  at  [134],  the
    discretion of the judicial decision-maker assessing an Article 8  claim
    outside the rules is much wider.  With a family visit visa appeal,  the
    judicial decision-maker is at the opposite end  of  the  spectrum  from
    deportation, where there is undeniably a complete code within the Rules
    governing the deportee's rights under Article 8.  The decision-maker is
    at the opposite end of the spectrum because there is  no  human  rights
    code at all in a family visit visa case.

The Remaking of the Decision

24. I refer to the five point Razgar test.  There is a substantial body  of
    jurisprudence  confirming  the  principle  that  family  life  is   not
    established for  the  purposes  of  Article  8(1)  unless  there  is  a
    relationship of dependency and, where adults are  concerned,  that  the
    ties between them go beyond normal emotional ties.

25. Miss Dogra submits that to impose such a  threshold  requirement  in  a
    family  visit  visa  appeal  is  unfair  because  the  requirement   of
    dependency is antithetical to the requirements of paragraph 41.

26. I accept that where an applicant  asserts  a  financial,  emotional  or
    physical dependency on the UK sponsor, this is likely to make  it  more
    difficult for the applicant to demonstrate that he or she satisfies the
    requirements of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph  41.   However,
    the Rules do not in terms debar applicants who are dependants on  a  UK
    sponsor, and so the  Kugathas  dependency  criteria  are  not  directly
    antithetical to the requirements of paragraph 41.

27. It is however true that imposing  a  requirement  of  dependency  in  a
    family visit appeal is likely to be an insurmountable obstacle  in  the
    vast majority of cases, thus rendering the Article  8  appeal  right  a
    nugatory one for meritorious claimants save insofar as they can rely on
    favourable findings of fact in the Article 8 appeal to buttress a fresh
    application under the rules.

28. Even on a generous interpretation of family life for  the  purposes  of
    Article 8(1), I find that the claimants have not shown that questions 1
    and 2 of the Razgar test should be answered in their favour.   Although
    the claimant said in her application that she was financially dependent
    on her daughter and son-in-law, in his oral evidence Mr  Shahid  denied
    that this was the case.  He denied sending any money to his  mother-in-
    law for the purpose of providing additional financial support  to  her.
    He explained that she lived not only with her dependent son,  but  also
    with two older sons who were financially independent and thus  able  to
    provide adequate financial support to the claimants without needing  to
    obtain extra financial support from him.

29. The significance of the sponsor's evidence in this topic  is  not  only
    that it negates the proposition that the claimant is wholly  or  mainly
    financially dependent on family in the UK, but it also casts  doubt  on
    the strength of the asserted family ties.   For  if  the  claimant  was
    regularly in communication with her  daughter  and  son-in-law  in  the
    United Kingdom, she would not have mistakenly represented that she  was
    financially dependent on them.

30. As submitted by Mr Armstrong,  it  has  also  not  been  satisfactorily
    established that at the date of decision  it  was  impossible  or  very
    difficult for the sponsor and his family  to  visit  the  claimants  in
    Bangladesh.  The sponsor clearly has the financial  resources  to  fund
    such a visit, and even if he chose not to  go  himself,  there  was  no
    reason why his wife and  children  could  not  have  travelled  out  to
    Bangladesh for a visit during the school holidays.

31. The claimant has five children in the UK and three children living with
    her in Bangladesh.  In her application form  she  only  identified  the
    sponsor and his immediate family as her "close"  family  members  here.
    Furthermore, the only other family member whom she  proposed  to  visit
    was her elder son.  She did not apparently propose to visit any of  her
    other three daughters living here.

32. In case I am wrong to find that Article 8(1) is not  engaged,  I  shall
    consider the remaining questions in the  Razgar  test.   In  answer  to
    question 3, I see no reason to disturb the favourable findings made  by
    Judge Shamash as to the claimants' compliance with the requirements  of
    paragraph  41.   So  the  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules.

33. However, I find that the  decision  was  in  accordance  with  the  law
    because on the evidence available to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
    the Entry Clearance Manager, the claimants had not shown that they  met
    the requirements of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of  paragraph  41.   The
    fact that the claimants were able successfully to deploy  post-decision
    evidence so as to show that in retrospect they met the requirements  of
    the Rules does not change the fact  that  the  refusal  decisions  were
    lawful at the time that they were issued.

34. I find that the above consideration is determinative of the question of
    proportionality, having regard to Section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act which
    provides that the maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
    the public interest.

35. It remains open to the claimants to make a fresh application for  entry
    clearance as  family  visitors,  relying  on  the  additional  evidence
    deployed in their Article 8 appeal (and the favourable findings of fact
    made by Judge Shamash) to show that they meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules.



Decision

36. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the claimants' appeals on Article 8  grounds  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as family visitors are dismissed.
