Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Cronin, Counsel instructed by Wesley Gryk,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form
    of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the
    appellant. This direction applies to, amongst others, all  parties.  Any
    failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
    court proceedings. We make this order because  the  case  turns  on  the
    rights of a small child who is entitled to privacy.

 2. This is an appeal by a citizen of the  United  States  (who  is  also  a
    citizen of Colombia) against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing her appeal against the decision of the respondent on 29 April
    2014 to refuse her leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  give
    directions for her removal to the United States of America.

 3. This is a case where there are many slightly unusual features which  can
    serve to detract from the points that matter.   Although  we  have  been
    careful to consider all of the  evidence  before  us  it  would  not  be
    helpful to refer to everything and might add to the confusion which,  we
    find, has probably frustrated the proper examination of the case.

 4. The respondent gave the appellant a  "Notice  of  Refusal  of  Leave  to
    Enter".  The confusion began almost immediately.  It said:

         "You have sought leave to enter the United Kingdom  for  settlement
         but you are required to be  in  possession  of  a  valid  UK  entry
         clearance for this purpose and you hold no  such  entry  clearance.
         You have an appeal pending against refusal by the  Home  Office  to
         grant you permission to remain in the UK as  the  dependant  of  an
         EU/EEA national but there is no provision in the Immigration  Rules
         for you to gain entry to  await  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.   I
         therefore refuse you entry."

 5. The notice indicated that the right of appeal was  limited  because  the
    appellant did not have entry clearance for the  purpose  for  which  the
    application for leave to enter was made and the appeal  was  pursued  on
    human rights grounds only.  The Secretary of State did not  certify  the
    case as clearly unfounded.

 6. The notice explaining the decision is dated 8 November 2014 and although
    it begins by reciting, correctly, the summary of the decision  mentioned
    above in paragraph 1, in what purports to be the explanatory  statement,
    it refers to the appeal  against  "the  decision  of  the  Border  Force
    Officer to cancel  leave  to  enter  on  29/04/14  at  Heathrow  Airport
    Terminal 3."  As far as we can see there has never been  a  decision  to
    cancel leave to enter in this case.  The appellant  entered  the  United
    Kingdom in August 2011, possibly as a visitor, but intending  to  remain
    as a student  if  that  were  permissible.   She  made  a  "transfer  of
    conditions" application with the result that she had leave to remain  as
    a student until 30 January 2014. That leave has not been extended.

 7. She became attracted  to,  entered  into  a  relationship  with,  became
    pregnant by and married a man working in London who was a joint  citizen
    of the United Kingdom and of the Republic of Ireland.  They  married  on
    15 November 2012.

 8. The appellant deferred her studies for the year and their  child  E  was
    born in Londonderry on 16 March 2013.  It follows that the  child,  like
    his father, has British and Irish nationality.

 9. On 6 February 2013 the appellant applied for an EEA residence card based
    on her marriage to an EEA  (in  this  case  Irish)  national  exercising
    treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  The application was refused on  29
    August 2013 (the appellant says wrongly) because the appellant's husband
    is a British national and therefore (according to the respondent) not an
    EEA national for the purpose of the Regulations.

10. It is plain beyond argument under Rule 25(4) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 that  "a  pending  appeal  is  not  to  be  treated  as
    abandoned solely because the appellant leaves the United Kingdom."

11. However it is also plain that appealing a decision on EEA  grounds  does
    not improve a person's right to be in the United Kingdom.  There  is  no
    question, for example, of leave being continued by  Section  3C  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 because the person making an EEA application is not
    applying to vary her leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.   She  is
    asserting a right and that does not depend on her having permission.

12. The appeal against the refusal to issue a residence card was  heard  and
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Gillespie  in  a  determination
    dated 17 September 2014.  We are not here to  criticise  that  decision.
    In summary Judge Gillespie accepted that the appellant's husband was not
    an EEA national but a British national.  Ms Cronin has indicated  before
    us that the appellant does not accept that that is a  correct  decision.
    If that is the appellant's position then it is open to her to pursue  an
    appeal (although that would surely be out of time  by  now)  or  make  a
    fresh application.  We note that she disagrees with  the  decision.   We
    can take it no further.

13. Perhaps more significantly for present  purposes  is  Judge  Gillespie's
    consideration of the claim with reference to Article 8 of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.  He noted that the appellant  had  not  been
    removed and could make an application  on  human  rights  grounds  which
    could be decided.  Importantly  Judge  Gillespie  did  not  decide  that
    either the appellant's removal or  that  refusing  the  appellant  entry
    clearance  as  a  wife,  was  consistent  with  the   United   Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.
    He deliberately, and with respect, quite possibly correctly, declined to
    take the matters further on the case before him.

14. According to the explanatory statement  the  appellant  was  interviewed
    and said that she had not considered her  immigration  status  when  she
    married.  She was responding to the fact that she was pregnant.  She did
    not inform the respondent that she had married.

15. She was living on her husband's income as  an  artist,  her  own  income
    from her part-time work and a grant from the government  of  the  United
    States of America.

16. The explanatory statement shows the Secretary of State was  particularly
    concerned that the appellant  had  not  satisfied  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 24 of HC 395 requiring a  person  seeking  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom to have obtained entry clearance.   The  appellant  could
    not satisfy the Rules and should not be treated as if she were  able  to
    satisfy the Rules.

17. At paragraph 15 in the refusal letter the Secretary of State  refers  to
    the child being ill.  This is a mistake.  It  is  not  absolutely  clear
    what led to the points being taken but  it  is  clear  that  the  points
    should not have been taken and we draw attention to this  only  to  make
    plain that we have otherwise ignored it.

18. The Secretary of State referred to Appendix FM of HC 395  and  expressed
    the view that it "would be reasonable to expect the appellant  to  leave
    the  United  Kingdom  with  [her  child]  until  her   entry   clearance
    application had been concluded."

19. The letter then explained that it was not a matter for the Secretary  of
    State that the appellant had been given wrong advice (assuming  that  to
    be the case) by her earlier solicitors.  The fact is that  she  was  not
    allowed to remain in the United  Kingdom.   The  letter  said  that  the
    appeal would be deemed to have been abandoned under  Section  104(4)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   That  assertion  was
    wrong  but  the  concluding  part  of  the  paragraph  "the  appellant's
    expectation to be allowed to re-enter the United Kingdom on the pretence
    that she has an outstanding appeal is an unrealistic one" is  a  correct
    summary.

20. The letter then refers  to  the  appellant's  husband  (described  as  a
    "partner") having a child from a previous relationship.  It is not clear
    if that in fact is right but nothing turns on it.  Again  the  Secretary
    of State seemed to be taking a wrong point.

21. Under the heading "in Grounds 4 and 5" the respondent  makes  pejorative
    comments that are not justified.  The respondent says:

         "It is accepted that the appellant may have enjoyed  some  form  of
         family and private life in the United Kingdom as a  result  of  the
         time that she spent in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 Student.  Her
         right to family life has been afforded to her as a  consequence  of
         her  non-compliance  with  the  conditions  of  her  entry  and  by
         breaching the Immigration Rules by getting married  in  the  United
         Kingdom without having the appropriate entry  clearance  to  enable
         her to do so.  She now appears to be attempting to  circumvent  the
         Immigration Rules yet again by not  acquiring  an  entry  clearance
         prior to her arrival so that she could remain in the United Kingdom
         as the spouse of a person who is present and settled in the  United
         Kingdom.  It is accepted that the appellant has a child  who  is  1
         year and 9 months of age who is both a British citizen and an Irish
         national.  It is considered that the severity and the  consequences
         of this interference occasioned by the  appellant's  removal  would
         not be  such  as  to  cause  the  decision  to  remove  her  to  be
         disproportionate to the Secretary  of  State's  legitimate  aim  of
         maintaining  an  effective  immigration  control,  as  pursuant  to
         Article 8(2) of the ECHR.  The appellant would qualify for a spouse
         entry clearance in America that would then enable her to  join  her
         husband  once  she  has  obtained  the  mandatory  entry  clearance
         required.  Her son E could also return to America with her  causing
         minimal  disruption  to  their  family  life.   The  appellant  has
         circumvented the entry clearance requirements when she got  married
         in the United Kingdom whilst here as a student and  should  not  be
         allowed to profit from doing so again.  The Immigration  Rules  are
         in place to be adhered to by all of those persons who  are  subject
         to immigration control and the appellant should not be seen  to  be
         treated any differently."

22. The penultimate paragraph says:

         "This matter is simple,  the  appellant  was  required  to  have  a
         mandatory entry clearance as the spouse of  a  person  present  and
         settled in the United Kingdom as she did not have one thus did  not
         qualify for leave to enter the United  Kingdom.   Any  interference
         caused to the appellant's rights to  private  and  family  life  by
         requesting  that  she  return  to  America  in  order  to  get  the
         appropriate entry  clearance  required  for  entry  to  the  United
         Kingdom  is  an  interference  that  is  not   considered   to   be
         disproportionate to the Secretary  of  State's  legitimate  aim  to
         maintaining the effective immigration control".

23. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   She  was  well-
    supported by friends and family members but also  by  acquaintances  who
    testified to the private and family life that had  been  established  in
    the United Kingdom.

24. However at paragraph  88  of  his  decision  the  judge  said  that  the
    Presenting Officer's:

         "... key argument was that the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  had
         already been determined by  Tribunal  Judge  Gillespie  some  three
         months earlier on 21 August 2014.  He dismissed the Article 8 claim
         and therefore Devaseelan applied."

25. The judge was clearly impressed with the  evidence  that  he  heard  and
    concluded that there:

         "... is a strong family unit and there exist strong  bonds  between
         all family members".

26. He  also  recognised  strong  friendships  had  been  established.   The
    appellant had temporarily suspended her studies in  the  United  Kingdom
    but that was because of her pregnancy as was her temporary relocation to
    the Republic of Ireland.

27. The judge  accepted  that  the  appellant's  husband  works  as  an  art
    technician and also undertakes commissions and said at paragraph 91(vi):

         "He has spent many years building up his reputation and contacts in
         this country and that all this would  be  jeopardised  if  he  were
         expected to relocate to the United States.  I am  further  prepared
         to accept that even if he moved to the United  States  temporarily,
         that there would still be some damage to  his  career  through  his
         absence from the United Kingdom."

28.  He  also  recognised  the  appellant's  child  had   established   some
    significant private and family life outside the home.   Particularly  he
    had settled in  a  nursery  and  was  taking  part  in  "extracurricular
    activities designed for small children and that he has made a number  of
    friendships."

29. He also accepted the appellant had been given bad advice before  leaving
    the United Kingdom to return to America.

30. The judge had said at paragraph 92 that it was not practicable  for  the
    appellant's husband to relocate to the United  States  even  temporarily
    because of the material detriment it  would  bring  to  his  career  and
    maintaining his family.  He also found it not practicable to expect  the
    appellant to leave her  young  British  national  child  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He noted, unsurprisingly, that the appellant's  husband  would
    have difficulty raising the child on his own and meeting  his  extensive
    work commitments.

31. The judge purported to address his mind to Section 55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

32. However he found that the appellant's husband did  not  earn  sufficient
    money to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   The  judge
    decided that the appellant had to show her husband earned �22,400, for a
    partner and young child but that the appellant's husband  received  only
    �12,000 as a grant plus other payments.  He had not produced evidence in
    the way required by the Immigration Rules.  At paragraph 102  the  judge
    found it was reasonable to expect the British national  child  to  leave
    the United Kingdom.  It goes on:

         "The appellant has established a family and  private  life  in  the
         United Kingdom in circumvention of the Immigration Rules.  She  has
         close family in the United States,  which  she  has  visited  on  a
         number of times since her arrival in the United Kingdom.   Her  son
         is very young.  He was born in March 2013 and is less than 2  years
         old.  I accept that one of the reasons why the appellant has  found
         herself in her current predicament is poor legal  advice  given  to
         her in  the  past.   However,  as  indicated  above,  there  is  no
         discretion within the Immigration Rules which an appellant may rely
         upon where they have been the victim of poor legal advice".

33. The judge then expressed the view that  there  were  no  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to stop the appellant's husband leaving the United Kingdom to
    be with his family even though it would involve some degree of hardship.

34. At paragraph 115 the judge decided that  Judge  Gillespie  had  made  no
    finding on the Article 8 grounds.

35. The judge went on to remind  himself  of  Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  and  Section  117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  judge  directed
    himself that  the  starting  point  is  to  decide  if  the  appellant's
    application  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.   He   concluded,
    correctly, that it does not.  He then had to ask himself if  there  were
    good reasons such as compelling circumstances to make a decision outside
    the Rules and he decided that there were not.  At paragraph 121 he said:

         "I accept that the appellant has been  the  victim  of  poor  legal
         advice in the  past.   Nevertheless,  this  is  a  case  where  the
         appellant has established a family and private life in this country
         through circumventing the Immigration Rules.  There is  nothing  to
         prevent her from returning to the  United  States  with  her  young
         child and applying for the appropriate entry  clearance.   I  fully
         accept that her husband will not be able to return with her due  to
         his work commitments in the United Kingdom and that there  will  be
         temporary interference in the family and private  life  which  they
         enjoy.  However, even taking into account all of the factors  which
         she cites (including the impact  separation  would  have  upon  her
         young child in not being able to see his  father  every  day),  any
         interference would  be  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of
         immigration control."

36. We agree with Ms Cronin that the First-tier Tribunal  clearly  erred  in
    law.  An immediate  and  obvious  concern  is  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    repeating the error of the Secretary  of  State  in  deciding  that  the
    appellant had done something manipulative or improper  in  entering  the
    United Kingdom as a student and marrying.  There is nothing in the Rules
    that prevents her from marrying.  The interruption in the studies  as  a
    result of the pregnancy did not result in her leave being curtailed  and
    was an excuse clearly accepted by her college.  She returned to study.

37. Further, although we do not think this is a strong point, we agree  that
    the suggestion (it does not appear to be a finding)  that  the  mistaken
    belief that the appellant abandoned her appeal against the EEA  decision
    when she left the United Kingdom has been used to add to the  idea  that
    she has behaved improperly.  She did not abandon her appeal by operation
    of law or at all. We emphasise that we do not see this as a major  plank
    in the judge's reasoning but to the extent it is relevant it is a  point
    used against the appellant and it is a bad point.

38. We also accept that the judge was wrong  to  talk  about  the  financial
    requirements of earning �22,400.  That, we think, would be  the  correct
    sum for bringing in a foreign national child and wife.  The  appellant's
    child is a British national and does not  have  to  meet  any  financial
    requirements.  He is entitled to be in the United Kingdom.

39. We find that the Tribunal should have  considered  EX.1.  The  appellant
    was given temporary admission in April 2014  and  so  had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom continuously for more than 6 months by December 2014 when
    the First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal. She might be able  to  satisfy
    the requirements of E-LTRP.2.2 if she could come within EX.1.

40. The material part of EX.1 is EC.1.(a)(ii) which provides that:

         "... it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
         UK".

41. We do not agree that the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  finding  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles in the path  of  the  appellant's
    husband joining the family in the United States of America.  There  were
    difficulties which the judge recognised.  "Insurmountable obstacles" has
    to be construed in a realistic way rather than a strict way  but  it  is
    more than simply inconvenience.  The fact  is  that  although  it  would
    cause financial hardship and a disruption to the career the  appellant's
    husband could join the family in America. The Tribunal was  entitled  to
    find that the degree of hardship involved on his removal did not  amount
    to "very serious hardship" for the appellant or her husband.

42. Section 117B of the 2002  Act  most  certainly  has  to  be  considered.
    Indeed it is a statutory requirement and is weightier  than  the  Rules.
    This illuminates the  public  interest  in  Article  8  cases.   Section
    117B(6) is plainly relevant.  It states:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom."

43. Clearly there is a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  here.
    The question we have to ask ourselves here, as when considering EX.1, is
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

44. The child is a British citizen.  His father is  a  British  citizen  and
    they live together as a family unit.   Although  they  are  not  weighty
    points the child, even at the tender age of 18 months or so, has started
    to have a life outside the home.

45. We have reminded ourselves of the decision of this  Tribunal  in  Sanade
    and Others (British children - Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT  00048
    (IAC) and its references to the decision of  the  Supreme  Court  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.

46. To say it is generally unreasonable to require a British  citizen  child
    leave his country of  nationality  is  another  way  of  saying  that  a
    person's right to reside in his country of nationality is  something  to
    be respected.  One of the points made in Sanade is  that  unless  it  is
    generally thought unreasonable to expect  a  British  citizen  child  to
    leave the United Kingdom there is a risk of the absurd situation arising
    where a British citizen is in a  less  secure  position  in  the  United
    Kingdom than would be an EEA citizen.

47. There were clear and uncontroversial findings here  that  the  appellant
    is living with her son and husband as a nuclear family unit.

48.  In  the  absence  of  contrary  indications  small   children   benefit
    particularly from the close relationship with their mothers  although  a
    close relationship with both parents is an ideal to be respected.  There
    is every reason to  believe  that  this  is  case  where  the  child  is
    benefitting from a close relationship with both of his parents.

49. We do not doubt that if by reason of some tragedy the appellant were  to
    die then her husband's family would rally round.  Similarly the evidence
    suggests that if the appellant had to return to  the  United  States  of
    America with her child then somehow she manage. She is  resourceful  and
    educated and probably has some  support  there  but  the  fact  that  an
    arrangement can be made to work does  not  make  it  desirable  or  even
    reasonable.

50. We do not see how  we  can  possibly  avoid  concluding  that  the  best
    interests of the child are that he remains in the  United  Kingdom  with
    both his parents unless they decide it is better to go somewhere else.

51. We are satisfied that it is not reasonable to expect the child to  leave
    the United Kingdom.

52. We reach this conclusion without  particular  regard  to  the  financial
    circumstances of the family in the United Kingdom although  we  do  take
    note of the fact that although the Rules  would  not  be  satisfied  for
    readmission  this  is  a  family  that  is  managing  financially.   The
    appellant's husband is in regular work even if he  is  not  particularly
    well-paid (if  we  may  respectfully  comment)  and  the  appellant  has
    resources of her own and an ability to work.

53. We decide this case on the basis that allowing the appellant  to  remain
    would not result in the family being dependent on the state.

54. We reminded ourselves of all the provisions  of  Section  117B.   It  is
    relevant that the appellant is  an  English  speaker  and  well-able  to
    integrate into society (there is an abundance of evidence that from  her
    ability to get work and to study at college).  We find that  they  would
    not be a burden on taxpayers.  It is not a question of a private life or
    relationship formed with a qualifying partner when the person was in the
    United Kingdom unlawfully.  The appellant has never been in  the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully.  Clearly her status has been precarious but this  is
    not a case based on private life.  We  remind  ourselves  that,  in  the
    circumstances we have here, the public interest  does  not  require  the
    person's removal.

55. We do not take this  to  mean  that  there  is  no  public  interest  in
    removing the appellant.  There  is  a  public  interest  in  maintaining
    effective immigration control but it  is  not  a  public  interest  that
    requires removal in all the facts of this case.

56. Before committing ourselves to  this  decision  we  have  sat  back  and
    reflected  because  there  is  an  element  in  it  that  concerns   us.
    Parliament has set out a  code  in  a  serious  and  largely  successful
    attempt to encapsulate the requirements of Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights within the Rules.  Article 8  is  a  flexible
    instrument and it is, we find,  extremely  unlikely  that  it  could  be
    codified in a way that met every  possible  set  of  circumstances  that
    present themselves unless there were large and  undefined  discretionary
    elements within the code.

57. We do understand that in allowing this  appeal  we  allow  a  person  to
    remain in the United Kingdom and they could not satisfy the requirements
    of the Rules for admission because they have not shown  that  they  have
    earned sufficient money and  because  they  are  making  an  application
    within the United Kingdom that should only be made  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.

58. Although the Respondent has taken bad points in the  refusal  letter  it
    correctly  makes  the  point  that  the  appellant  is  seeking  special
    treatment.

59. We have to look at this in another way. We have to look  at  it  bearing
    in mind the best interests of the child.  We have  to  do  that  because
    Parliament says that we must and the obligation under Section 55  is  to
    the extent that there is a gradation in  obligations  greater  than  any
    obligation under the Rules.

60. The suggestion that a small child should be with  its  mother,  if  that
    can possibly be arranged in a way that is consistent with other  policy,
    is wholly unremarkable.  The suggestion that a nuclear family should  be
    respected and upheld if possible is again unremarkable.

61. We also remind ourselves that the case is really about the  child.   The
    child cannot be held responsible for any deficiencies on the part of its
    parents. However we do make the point that this is not a case where  the
    parents have shown disregard for the Immigration Rules.  The worst  that
    can be said about the appellant is that she acted in the mistaken belief
    that she was entitled to return to the  United  Kingdom  to  pursue  her
    appeal.  We do not know precisely what advice was given.  It may be that
    she was told correctly that her appeal would not be abandoned by  reason
    of leaving.  It was not.  It is not a point on which we have to rule.

62. The evidence also showed that the appellant went to  the  United  States
    of America to be with her father who was seriously ill.  The  suggestion
    that the appellant was less than responsible in  becoming  pregnant  and
    marrying without regard to immigration control is hard to resist but  it
    cannot be made out that she has acted cynically.  At worst she  has  not
    given as much thought to things as ought to have been given.

63. As is almost always the case in our experience in appeals that  rely  on
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, we  do  not  allow
    this appeal because of the rights of the appellant,  although  they  are
    significant.  We  allow  the  appeal  because  of  the  rights  of   the
    appellant's British child.  We find that, if the First-tier Tribunal had
    not erred by taking adverse points wrongly  against  the  appellant,  it
    would probably not have made the decision that  it  did.   Certainly  it
    made an unlawful decision because it directed itself wrongly in material
    ways.

Notice of Decision

64. For the reasons given above we aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and we  substitute  a  decision  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant.
