                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  Kenya  born  on  14th  May  1968.   She
    appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Jerromes
    sitting at Birmingham on 23rd February 2015 who  dismissed  her  appeal
    against decisions of the Respondent dated 26th  November  2014.   Those
    decisions were to refuse to vary the Appellant's leave to remain on the
    basis of her private and family life  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  to
    remove her by way of directions.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  28th  August  2009  as  a
    spouse.  On 1st October 2011 she was  granted  discretionary  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom under  Article  8  on  the  basis  of  her
    relationship with her husband Mr. Tony Wilson.  On 3rd October 2014 she
    applied for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis
    of family and private life but this was refused by  the  Respondent  on
    the grounds that she  had  failed  to  provide  sufficient  documentary
    evidence from official sources to show that she was  still  enjoying  a
    family life with Mr. Wilson.  The Respondent was not satisfied that the
    grounds  under  which  the  Appellant  had  previously   been   granted
    discretionary leave still persisted and  the  application  for  further
    discretionary leave was refused.

3.   Furthermore the application was refused under paragraph 322(9)  of  the
    Immigration Rules, a discretionary ground whereby leave should normally
    be refused where an applicant has failed to produce within a reasonable
    time information documents or other evidence required by the Respondent
    to establish a claim to remain under the  Rules.   The  Respondent  had
    written to the Appellant  on  6th  November  2014  to  request  further
    evidence but the required information had not been submitted  within  a
    reasonable time.  The Appellant had thus failed to  provide  sufficient
    evidence to show that  she  was  still  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with her partner and she failed under  Appendix  FM.   She
    failed under the private life provisions of paragraph 276ADE(1) of  the
    Rules.  She had only lived in the United Kingdom for five years.  There
    were no significant obstacles to her reintegration into Kenya.  She had
    spent over half her  life  living  there  and  was  familiar  with  the
    language and culture.

4.   In her appeal against that decision the  Appellant  accepted  that  she
    had separated from her husband Mr Wilson but still  had  her  only  son
    Antony living in the United Kingdom who she  was  extremely  close  to.
    Antony was in a permanent and  long-term  relationship  in  the  United
    Kingdom with a British citizen, Lucy  Barber  and  together  they  were
    planning to start a family.  The Appellant herself was now in  a  long-
    term relationship with  a  British  citizen,  David  Roberts  and  they
    intended to marry as soon as they were able to.  She had  not  answered
    the Home Office letter dated 6th November  2014  because  her  previous
    partner had not informed her of its existence.  Her first knowledge  of
    the letter came with the notice  of  immigration  decision  dated  26th
    November  2014.   There  would  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to   her
    continuing a normal family life with her partner  Mr.  Roberts  outside
    the United Kingdom and it would be unreasonable for her to do so.

The Hearing at First Instance

5.   At the hearing the Judge heard evidence  from  the  Appellant  and  Mr.
    Roberts.  The Appellant's final decision to separate  from  Mr.  Wilson
    was made in August 2014 when the Appellant  moved  out  of  the  family
    home.  The Respondent did not pursue the argument  that  the  Appellant
    had failed  to  provide  information  but  the  Judge  found  that  the
    Appellant could not satisfy the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    in relation to private and family life.  In the absence  of  a  divorce
    the Appellant could not rely on her relationship with Mr. Roberts as he
    was not a partner as defined in GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.  The Judge went
    on to consider whether there were arguably good  grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside the Rules and adopted the five  stage  approach
    required by the case of  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.   Whilst  expressing
    considerable sympathy for  the  Appellant  the  Judge  found  that  the
    Respondent's decisions were proportionate.

6.   At paragraph 21.4 she wrote that the Appellant:

         "... has very successfully  established  herself  in  the  UK  both
         professionally and socially.  Her only son is here and she is in  a
         genuine  and  durable  relationship  with  Mr.  Roberts  a  British
         citizen.  However although  the  disruption  to  her  professional,
         family and social  life  is  regrettable  it  does  not  amount  to
         unjustifiably harsh consequences.  ... I cannot conclude that there
         would be insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant  continuing  her
         relationship with Mr. Roberts if she returned to Kenya; they do not
         currently live as a family and said  in  evidence  that  they  will
         continue their relationship if the Appellant returns to  Kenya  and
         Mr Roberts will assist her to make a fresh  application  for  entry
         clearance.  I cannot conclude that there  would  be  insurmountable
         obstacles to the Appellant continuing her relationship with her son
         Antony if she returns to Kenya; Antony is 22 years of age and lives
         independently of the Appellant.  She can maintain contact with  Mr.
         Roberts, her son and friends by modern communication means."

7.   On the evidence before the Judge  she  could  not  find  that  all  the
    requirements for entry clearance had presently been met  and  therefore
    could not conclude that the only matter weighing  on  the  Respondent's
    side was public policy.  The case thus did not  fall  within  Chikwamba
    [2008] UKHL 40.  This was not a case where the  application  should  be
    considered in country.

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Appellant appealed against that decision  arguing  that  the  Judge
    had failed to consider Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009.  The Sponsor had two children both of  whom  were
    British citizens.  The  Judge  did  not  consider  the  impact  of  the
    decision on them or what their best interests were.  As the Judge found
    the Appellant and Sponsor to be credible the matter  should  have  been
    sent back to the Respondent as the  Appellant  could  provide  evidence
    which would confirm she was in a relationship with her current partner.

9.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  De  Haney  on  20th  May  2015.   In
    refusing permission to appeal he stated that the Grounds of Appeal were
    misconceived.  The children referred to were not the  children  of  the
    Appellant but those of her new partner.  The  Appellant  did  not  live
    with them.  The Respondent  did  not  consider  them  in  the  decision
    because they were not brought to the attention of the Respondent  until
    the appeal.  The Judge had properly set out the law,  her  findings  of
    fact and reasons.  The grounds of onward appeal were nothing more  than
    a disagreement with the Judge's findings and an attempt to reargue  the
    appeal.

10.  The Appellant renewed her application for permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal in longer grounds than had been submitted to the  First-
    tier.  The first ground was that the Judge had misdirected  herself  on
    the  meaning  of  Appendix  FM  which  provided   that   any   previous
    relationship of the applicant or their partner must  have  broken  down
    permanently.  There was sufficient evidence to indicate that  and  that
    she was now in a new relationship with Mr. Roberts.  The  provision  in
    Appendix FM did not refer to a divorce but to the factual circumstances
    of the breakdown.  As the fianc�  of  the  Appellant  Mr.  Roberts  was
    covered in the definition of partner under Section  GEN.1.2(iii).   The
    second ground renewed the  complaint  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    consider Section 55 of the  2009  Act.   The  Appellant  spent  several
    nights a week and weekends at Mr. Robert's  home.   The  issue  of  the
    impact on the children if Mr. Roberts had to follow  the  Appellant  to
    Kenya leaving the children behind had not been considered.

11.  The third ground was that Article 8  had  not  been  applied  properly.
    The Judge had erred in law by  not  evaluating  whether  the  Appellant
    could meet the requirements of entry clearance as a spouse.  The  Judge
    could and should have decided that for herself.  However the Judge  had
    not given weight to the various factors in the decision  which  weighed
    in the Appellant's  favour.   These  were  listed  in  the  grounds  at
    paragraph 16(a) to (m).

12.  The renewed application for permission came on the papers before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Lane on 4th August  2015.   In  granting  permission  to
    appeal he wrote that it was arguable:

         "that the Judge erred by finding  that  the  Appellant  had  to  be
         divorced in order to show that her relationship  with  her  husband
         had permanently  broken  down  as  provided  for  in  E-LTR.1.9  of
         Appendix FM.  It appears that the Judge also  considered  that  the
         Appellant and her new partner could not be fianc�s for the purposes
         of GEN.1.2 whilst the marriage  of  the  Appellant  was  extant;  a
         contrary view was also arguable".

    It appears that the Respondent did not file a Rule 24 response  to  the
    grant.

The Hearing Before Me

13.  On behalf of  the  Appellant  her  solicitor  argued  that  there  were
    different aspects of the case, it was not limited to the provisions  of
    Appendix FM.  The Appellant was refused on  suitability  grounds.   The
    Appellant's immigration status had  been  acquired  under  a  different
    regime decided before the provisions of Appendix FM were introduced  in
    July 2012 and  her  application  for  an  extension  should  have  been
    considered under the same policy.  If anything further was required she
    should have been interviewed.  The Respondent's decision was  thus  not
    in accordance with the law.

14.   Further  there  were  compelling  circumstances  in  this  case.   Her
    previous relationship had ended.  She had arrived in the United Kingdom
    on a spouse visa and completed two years of her probation period.   Due
    to the fact she was not professionally advised she had not  provided  a
    copy of her Life in the  United  Kingdom  test  and  so  only  received
    discretionary leave.  Her discretionary leave ended at the same time as
    her relationship.  When she applied she did not claim she was with  her
    husband, she did not put his name down on the  form  or  say  that  the
    relationship  was  still  subsisting.   The  Judge  had  mentioned  the
    positive points in the Appellant's favour but had gone on to  say  that
    there were no harsh consequences if the Appellant had  to  leave.   The
    Appellant was employed as a teacher and was not a burden on the  State.
    Further the Judge had forgotten to take account of the  fact  that  her
    current partner had two young children and it would  be  difficult  for
    him to go and live with the Appellant in Kenya or uproot the children.

15.  The Appellant was living with her partner's children almost  five  days
    a week.  There were  compelling  reasons  why  this  appeal  should  be
    allowed outside the Rules.  The Appellant was in a relationship with  a
    British citizen and they were in  the  process  of  marrying  once  the
    Appellant's divorce was sorted out.  Her son Antony was living here, he
    was not a UK citizen and his appeal was being decided separately.   The
    Appellant did not have to return to Kenya she had valid leave.  She was
    not an overstayer and had 3C leave at the present time.   Even  if  the
    appeal went against her she could not overstay until after 28 days from
    the end of the appeal process.

16.  In reply for the Respondent it was  argued  that  the  claim  that  the
    Appellant's application for an extension  of  her  discretionary  leave
    should be treated under a pre-2012 regime was not cited in the  grounds
    of onward appeal but should have been raised if  it  was  going  to  be
    aired at the hearing at first instance.  The appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal in this case was only in relation to Appendix FM  and  Article
    8.  There were no material errors in the Judge's decision.   There  was
    no in country switching to  fianc�s.   The  Appellant  must  have  been
    granted fianc�e status already to be able to do that.   The  Judge  had
    conducted a proper balancing exercise.  The Judge  could  not  conclude
    that the entry requirements would be met and in those circumstances the
    case of Chikwamba did not apply, see the Court of  Appeal  decision  in
    Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  There was no evidence in the  Appellant's
    bundle that the financial requirements could be met and there would  be
    no significant interference with the Appellant's private or family life
    by temporary removal whilst she returned to Kenya to  apply  for  entry
    clearance.  She could return and make application from  there.   As  at
    the date of hearing at first instance the Appellant would not have been
    successful under a spouse application.  The appeal was bound  to  fail.
    The Appellant and Mr. Roberts had not been cohabiting at the  time  for
    at least two years.  The Judge had conducted a proportionality exercise
    correctly.  Little weight could be attached to the Appellant's  private
    life.

17.  In conclusion the Appellant's solicitor argued  that  her  case  should
    have been decided under the discretionary leave policy and only then if
    it was not would one go on to  consider  whether  removal  would  be  a
    breach of Article 8.  Nothing of that sort was done and the  Judge  had
    erred by not holding the Respondent's decision to be not in  accordance
    with the law.

Findings

18.  The Appellant applied in this  case  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    provisions of Appendix FM.  To qualify for limited leave to remain as a
    partner the Appellant had to show  that  she  could  meet  all  of  the
    requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2  to  4.2  of  Appendix  FM.   The
    relationship requirements were that  her  partner  must  be  a  British
    citizen living in the United Kingdom, the relationship must be  genuine
    and subsisting and importantly for this case any previous  relationship
    of the applicant (or their partner) must have broken down  permanently.
    The Judge's  view  was  that  the  Appellant  was  caught  between  two
    provisions of the Rules.  She was no longer cohabiting with Mr.  Wilson
    and their relationship was no longer subsisting and therefore she could
    not rely on that relationship under Appendix FM Section E-LTRP.1.7.

19.   On  the  other  hand  the  Judge  found  at  paragraph  20.1  of   her
    determination that the Appellant could not  rely  on  her  relationship
    with Mr. Roberts as he was not a partner as defined  by  Gen.1.2.  This
    defines a partner as either a spouse, fianc� or someone with  whom  the
    Appellant has been living in a relationship akin to  marriage  for  two
    years.  In the absence of a divorce there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    relationship with Mr. Wilson had broken  down  permanently.   That  was
    challenged in the grounds of onward appeal and permission to appeal was
    granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis it  was  arguable  that  the
    Appellant did not have to show she was divorced in order to  show  that
    her relationship with Mr. Wilson  had  permanently  broken  down.   The
    implication was that  other  evidence  besides  a  decree  absolute  of
    divorce might be acceptable  in  establishing  that.   Further  it  was
    arguably wrong that the Appellant and Mr. Roberts could not be  fianc�s
    whilst the Appellant remained married to Mr. Wilson.  No  authority  on
    that particular point was cited in the grant of permission nor  adduced
    to me in argument.

20.  Dealing with the second point first, much turns on  the  definition  of
    fianc�.  If a marriage  is  perceived  as  a  species  of  contract  an
    engagement is a promise to marry.  In these circumstances  the  promise
    made by the Appellant would be made at a time when in fact she was  not
    free to marry because she was already married.  In those  circumstances
    it is difficult to say that one is a fianc�e since one cannot  lawfully
    contract a marriage while one is already  married.   I  appreciate  the
    decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Lane  when  granting  permission  to
    appeal that there is some  ambiguity  in  the  point.  However  in  the
    absence of authority that the Judge was wrong in this case to find that
    the Appellant could not be a fianc�e of Mr. Roberts, I  cannot  discern
    that there is a material error of law in the Judge's  conclusions  that
    for that part of Section GEN.1.2(iii) the application by the  Appellant
    could not show that Mr. Roberts was her fianc� and therefore he did not
    come within the definition of a partner.

21.  This leaves the more difficult issue of the correct  interpretation  of
    Section E-LTRP.1.9 which provides that any previous relationship of the
    Appellant (in this  case)  must  have  broken  down  permanently.   The
    Appellant and Mr. Wilson are still  married.   Their  relationship  has
    broken down in the sense that they are no longer together as  a  couple
    but they are still married.  Again no authority was cited to the  Judge
    at first instance or in the grounds of onward appeal  and  nothing  was
    cited to me in support of the contention that a relationship  can  have
    broken down permanently even if the parties remain married.

22.  In my view that flies in the face of  commonsense,  particularly  given
    the circumstances of this particular case.  At the date of hearing  the
    Appellant and Mr. Wilson had only been separated for some  six  months.
    The  Appellant  had  not  instructed  solicitors  to  commence  divorce
    proceedings; indeed I have seen no evidence that she has yet instructed
    solicitors to commence divorce proceedings. That last point  while  not
    relevant to the issue of an error of  law,  does  confirm  the  Judge's
    doubts that the relationship with Mr. Wilson  could  be  said  to  have
    permanently broken down within the definition  of  Section  E-LTRP.1.9.
    The Judge recorded evidence from the Appellant and Mr. Roberts  of  the
    time they spend  together  and  their  plans  to  spend  Christmas  and
    holidays together.  They were in a relationship but it had  not  lasted
    for at least two years prior to the date of application.   Indeed  even
    if the Judge was wrong in her interpretation of Section E-LTRP.1.9  and
    that the relationship between the Appellant and Mr. Wilson  had  broken
    down permanently,  notwithstanding  that  they  remained  married,  the
    Appellant could still not meet the requirements  of  GEN.1.2(iv).   Mr.
    Roberts was not a partner as he and the appellant had not  been  living
    together for at least two years prior to the date of application.

23.   For  the  reasons  given  by  the  Judge  at  paragraph  20.2  of  her
    determination EX.1 of Appendix FM did not assist the Appellant  as  Mr.
    Roberts could not qualify as a partner and EX.1 was  parasitic  on  the
    relevant Rule (see the case of Sabir [2014] UKUT 63) that EX.1 is not a
    freestanding ground for leave to remain.

24.  That being the case the Judge was correct  in  law  to  find  that  the
    Appellant could not bring herself within the  Immigration  Rules.   Mr.
    Roberts was not a partner within the  definition  of  the  Rules.   The
    matter fell to be determined outside the Rules under  Article  8.   For
    the Appellant to succeed on this basis she had to show that there  were
    compelling reasons why the appeal should be allowed outside the  Rules.
    The Judge considered this matter very  carefully  and  found  that  the
    decision to refuse the application would not  result  in  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences for either the Appellant or  Mr.  Roberts  or  their
    respective families.

25.  The Appellant makes two main arguments against  the  treatment  by  the
    Judge of the case outside Article 8.  The first is that there has  been
    insufficient consideration by either the Respondent or the Judge of the
    impact of Section 55 and specifically the duty  to  consider  the  best
    interests of Mr. Robert's two children.  This point was dealt  with  in
    the refusal at first instance to grant permission  and  noticeably  the
    Upper Tribunal did not specifically grant permission  on  that  ground.
    The Appellant does not live with Mr. Roberts  and  his  children.   She
    spends time with them according to paragraph 15 of  the  determination,
    several nights a week and weekends.  There is no  indication  that  the
    Respondent was put on notice as to the need to take these two  children
    into account but in any event, as Judge De Haney pointed out, they were
    not the Appellant's children and she was not living with  them.  It  is
    difficult to see how their welfare has been  overlooked  in  this  case
    since it would not appear to be relevant.

26.  The second point  made  about  Article  8  is  that  in  some  way  the
    Respondent's treatment of this case was procedurally unfair  since  the
    Appellant's case should have been looked  at  under  the  discretionary
    leave regime and not the post-July 2012 Immigration  Rules.   I  accept
    the point made by the Respondent in this appeal that  this  ground  was
    not raised at first instance nor indeed in the grounds of onward appeal
    but leaving aside the question of jurisdiction I do not  consider  that
    it has merit.  The Respondent is obliged to consider applications under
    the Immigration Rules as they are in force on the date of decision  and
    therefore the Respondent correctly applied the post-July 2012 Rules  to
    this case.  I  was  not  pointed  to  any  instruction  to  Immigration
    Officers or  other  policy  or  concession  that,  notwithstanding  the
    introduction of the  July  2012  Rule  changes,  the  Respondent  would
    continue to treat cases in certain categories  quite  differently  from
    the main scheme.  There was in short no authority for  the  proposition
    that the Respondent had behaved unfairly in this  case  and  I  see  no
    reason to come to that conclusion.  The remainder  of  the  Appellant's
    objections to the Judge's treatment of Article 8 are in my view a  mere
    disagreement with the Judge's conclusions.  As  I  have  indicated  the
    Judge examined all matters very thoroughly and gave cogent reasons  for
    her decision.

27.  The position remains that the Appellant can return to  Kenya  and  make
    an application for entry clearance from there.  There are at present  a
    number of obstacles to a successful application, that she does not have
    a partner who can come within the definition in GEN.1.2  and  that  she
    remains married to Mr. Wilson.  The Judge was correct at paragraph 21.4
    not to conclude that all of the requirements of entry  clearance  would
    otherwise be met or that the only matter weighing on  the  Respondent's
    side was public policy.  There  remains  sufficient  obstacles  to  the
    application being granted such that it is proper for the  Appellant  to
    return to Kenya and apply for entry clearance from there.  No  evidence
    was given to the Judge that this would take an unduly long time and the
    Judge herself did not consider that it would be unduly harsh to  expect
    it, notwithstanding the  disruption  to  the  Appellant's  private  and
    family life in this country.  I do not find therefore  that  there  was
    any material error of law in the Judge's determination and I uphold her
    decision to dismiss the appeal.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.
