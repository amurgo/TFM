                                   Between

                                    [A P]
                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms B Poynor, Solicitor
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Office presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS




    1. The appellant, a citizen of Vietnam born on [ ] 1990 appealed against
       the decision of the respondent, refusing  to  grant  him  asylum  and
       humanitarian protection in the United  Kingdom.  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge, MCall dismissed the appellant's appeal in a decision dated  28
       August 2015.




    2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen
       on 18 August 2017, stating that it is arguable that  there  has  been
       procedural unfairness by the Judge deciding his appeal in his absence
       as the appellant was unaware of the hearing date.




    3. At the hearing it was agreed by both parties that there  had  been  a
       procedural unfairness and therefore a material error of law.




    4. The appellant lodged  his  appeal  on  30  April  2015  by  his  then
       representatives Thomson & Co but claims that on 2 May 2015 he was re-
       trafficked within the United Kingdom. As a result, he claims that  he
       was not residing at his Home Office NASS  accommodation.  He  further
       claims that this was the address where  the  notice  of  hearing  was
       sent, which the appellant did not  receive.  The  appellant  was  not
       aware of the hearing  date  or  that  the  hearing  notice  had  been
       submitted to his previous representatives, Thomson & Co Solicitors.

    5. The permission Judge stated that the appellant will need  to  address
       and provide evidence on the basis on which his permission  to  appeal
       application has been  made.  I  direct  that  the  appellant  provide
       evidence to demonstrate that he did not receive the hearing notice at
       the re-hearing of his appeal.




    6. In the circumstances, I direct that the appeal be placed  before  any
       First-tier Tribunal Judge apart from First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mcall
       for hearing the appeal de novo.



                                               This 5th day of November 2017
Signed by

A Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
