                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr S Hughes (Advocate) instructed by HaqHamilton,
solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

1. We have considered whether any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances and  evidence  we
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Bircher, promulgated on 12 August 2015, which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was  born  on  27  November  1972  and  is  a  national  of
Pakistan. The appellant entered the UK as a student  on  17  May  2009.  The
respondent granted extensions of leave to remain as a student until  2  July
2015, but on 10 December 2014 the respondent curtailed the  grant  of  leave
to remain, so that it expired on 13 February 2015.

4. On 12 February 2015 the appellant applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier
2 (General) Migrant. On 12 March 2015 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the
Appellant's application.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Bircher ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  24  February  2016  Upper  Tribunal
Judge Goldstein gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      "2. This renewed application demonstrates that the First-tier Tribunal
      may have made an error of law in its approach to the  requirements  of
      paragraph 245HD(f) of the  immigration  rules  and  in  particular  to
      paragraphs 76 to 79D of appendix A: attributes, against  the  backdrop
      of the evidence before it, and raises arguable issues  as  to  whether
      the First-tier Tribunal was entitled in law to reach  the  conclusions
      that it did for the reasons given.


      "3. I have thus concluded in the  circumstances,  that  permission  to
      appeal should be granted in respect of all grounds."

The Hearing

7. Mr Hughes, counsel for the appellant, told us that the appellant  accepts
his advice that the appeal had no prospect of success, and sought  leave  to
withdraw the appeal. Mr Matthews, for the respondent,  did  not  oppose  the
application to withdraw the appeal.

8. Mindful of rule 17(2) of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008, we accept withdrawal of the appellant's case. As a result, his  appeal
to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

1st July 2016
