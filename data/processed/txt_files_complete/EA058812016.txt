DECISION AND REASONS





1.	This is the appeal of Mrs Dash against a decision of the Secretary of State refusing to grant her a residence card as an  extended family member of her sponsor.  The matter came before a judge in May 2017 and she concluded in light of Sala [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) that there was no statutory right of appeal against the decision to refuse to grant a residence card to an extended family member.  We now know in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 that Sala was wrong and there is a right of appeal in such a case and accordingly the judge, there is no criticism of her,she was simply following  reported authority, erred in law and the matter will therefore require to be heard by a  different judge at Hatton Cross.



Notice of Decision



The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted for a full hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.



No anonymity direction is made.
