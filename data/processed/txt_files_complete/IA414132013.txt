                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of  Congo  who  was
   born on the 29th April 1993. She appeals, with  permission,  against  the
   dismissal of her appeal by the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Hemmingway)
   from the respondent's decision to  refuse  her  application  for  further
   leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and to  remove  her
   from the United Kingdom.


2. The basis of  the  respondent's  decision  was  that  the  appellant  was
   required to show that she had access to  funds  of  �5,600  throughout  a
   specified period of 28 days, whereas her  father's  bank  account  had  a
   maximum credit balance of only �3,282.36 during that period. However, the
   respondent conceded at the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that
   the account had in fact a balance of around �22,000 during  the  relevant
   period. She nevertheless submitted that the appeal  should  fail  because
   the bank statement was written in the French language and  the  appellant
   had failed to meet the requirement  to  provide  an  English  translation
   thereof. Judge Hemmingway  accepted  that  submission.  Additionally,  he
   found that the appellant had failed to meet the  requirement  within  the
   Rules that the bank statement should "clearly show" that  "the  funds  in
   the account have been at the  required  level  throughout  the  specified
   period". This latter finding was made because, whilst the bank  statement
   had credit and debit columns, it did not have a column  that  showed  the
   running balance. Judge Hemmingway considered that this may have been  why
   the decision-maker misread the statement so as  erroneously  to  conclude
   that the account had insufficient funds during the specified period.


3. The gist of the appellant's application for permission to appeal  to  the
   Upper Tribunal was that the First-tier Tribunal ought to have treated her
   failure to meet the formal requirements of the Rules was  immaterial,  in
   view of the fact that she had submitted documents that were  sufficiently
   clear to show that she had met their substance. Permission to appeal  was
   granted upon a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal  in  terms  that
   are somewhat obscure -


    There is arguably  sufficient  lack  of  clarity  in  the  figures  and
    reasoning in  the  refusal  letter,  as  compared  to  the  documentary
    evidence, to justify further consideration of the matter,  although  it
    may be that that lack of clarity serves only  to  support  the  judge's
    findings ...


   As I do not entirely understand what  that  means,  I  have  confined  my
   consideration in this appeal to the question of  whether  the  First-tier
   Tribunal erred in the manner claimed by the appellant in her  grounds  to
   the Upper Tribunal.


4. Whilst I have great sympathy for the appellant, her situation  is  by  no
   means  uncommon.  Applicants  frequently  fall   foul   of   the   highly
   prescriptive formal requirements of  the  Points  Based  System,  despite
   being able to show that they meet their substance. However, a decision to
   refuse such an application is plainly  "in  accordance  with  immigration
   rules". It follows that the judge was right so to hold in this particular
   case.


5. In the above circumstances, it is always tempting to allow an  appeal  on
   the  basis  that  removal  in  consequence  of  the  decision  would   be
   incompatible with the applicant's right to respect for private and family
   life under Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention for  the  Protection
   of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. However, it is first  necessary
   to recall the cautionary  words  of  Lord  Carnwath  in  Patel  &  Ors  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 -


    It is important to remember that article 8 is not a general  dispensing
    power. It  is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  Secretary  of  State's
    discretion to allow leave to remain outside the  rules,  which  may  be
    unrelated to any protected human right. The merits of a decision not to
    depart from the rules are not reviewable on appeal: section 86(6).  One
    may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for "common  sense"  in
    the application of the rules to graduates who have been studying in the
    UK for some years (see para 47 above). However, such considerations  do
    not by themselves provide grounds of appeal under article 8,  which  is
    concerned with private or family  life,  not  education  as  such.  The
    opportunity for a promising student to  complete  his  course  in  this
    country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself  a  right
    protected under article 8.


6. In this case, Judge Hemmingway noted that the appellant  could  not  have
   had any legitimate expectation that she would be permitted to  remain  in
   the United Kingdom otherwise than in accordance with the requirements  of
   the Immigration Rules. He thus concluded that there  were  no  compelling
   circumstances that merited consideration of the appellant's case  outside
   those Rules. That was a view that was  reasonably  open  to  him  on  the
   evidence, and there was thus no error of law in his consideration of  the
   appellant's rights under Article 8 of the 1950  European  Convention  for
   the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
