Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Khan of Parkview Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss Johnson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Mrs Farza Mudabar, date of birth 14th October 1991, is a
    citizen of Pakistan.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction.  Having  considered  all  of  the  circumstances  I  do  not
    consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 3. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuel promulgated on 13th January 2014.   Leave  to  appeal  was
    granted on 24th February 2014 in the following terms:-

      i) The Appellant seeks  permission  in  time  to  appeal  against  the
         decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge (Judge N Manuel)  promulgated
         on 13th January 2014 whereby it dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal
         against the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  to  refuse  the
         Appellant entry with a view to settlement  as  the  spouse  of  her
         husband  under  Appendix  FM  paragraph  EC-P.1.1  with  particular
         reference to the maintenance requirements.

     ii) The Respondent's bundle contained a number of bank statements  less
         than the requisite amount the Appellant and the Sponsor stated were
         sent  with  the  Appellant's  application.   The  Sponsor  in  oral
         evidence  confirmed  that  the  bank  statements  lodged   in   the
         Respondent's bundle  were  the  ones  which  had  been  lodged  not
         realising that not all of them had been reproduced.  A full set  of
         bank statements for the Sponsor covering the six month period  were
         reproduced in particular with the  Grounds  of  Appeal  before  the
         hearing.  The original bank statements had been returned  with  the
         refusal notice enabling the Appellant to use them again in relation
         to  the  appeal  process.   It  is  arguable  that  the  judge  has
         misdirected herself by  finding  that  not  all  of  the  specified
         evidence was provided with the original application which may  make
         a material difference to the outcome.

    iii) In addition, it is a further arguable error of law that  the  judge
         incorrectly calculated that the Sponsor only earned �18,000 without
         taking into account his increase in salary and overtime in the  six
         month period before the date of the application.

 4. Thus the matter now appears  before  me  as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal to determine in the first instance whether there is a material
    error of law within the determination.

 5. The letter of refusal dated 27th February 2013  appears  to  raise  two
    issues.  Those issues are:-

      i) That the Sponsor had to prove that he had  income  of  �18,600  per
         annum in order to support himself and the  Appellant  in  order  to
         meet the requirements of  the  Rules.   It  was  alleged  that  the
         evidence disclosed that his income was only �18,541 per annum.   In
         order to qualify otherwise it was necessary for the Sponsor and the
         Appellant to show that they had savings  otherwise  of  �16,147.50.
         There was only evidence that they had savings of �7,539.09.

     ii) The Sponsor similarly had  to  produce  the  required  evidence  to
         substantiate his financial circumstances.  That included  the  last
         six wage slips as evidence of the Sponsor's gross income from their
         employment.  Those were specified documents set out in Appendix  FM
         and Appendix  FM-SE  to  support  the  Sponsor's  employment.   The
         Sponsor it was alleged had not provided  the  required  wage  slips
         having provided only five.

 6. With regard to the second issue it was asserted that  the  Sponsor  had
    provided wage slips from May through to October 2012 including  a  wage
    slip for August 2012.  The contention by the ECO was that the wage slip
    for August 2012 had not been included in the documentation.  The  judge
    found at paragraph 14 of the determination that she was satisfied  that
    the Appellant had also provided the wage slips for August 2012 and that
    therefore the requirements in respect of providing the wage  slips  was
    met.

 7. However the judge took points with  regard  to  the  documentation  not
    taken by the ECO.

 8. The first point relates to the personal bank statements submitted.   In
    the documents that were before the judge  there  were  bank  statements
    covering the period of 12th July 2012 to 11th October 2012 rather  than
    6 months bank statements as required by the rules.

 9. The Rules as set out in  paragraph  10  of  the  determination  clearly
    required that bank statements covering the same six month period as the
    wage slips had to be provided.  The bank statements  before  the  judge
    therefore did not cover May and June 2012.  The judge has recorded  the
    evidence relevant to that issue in paragraph 16 of  the  determination.
    It was specifically put to the Sponsor whether or not those  were  "the
    only bank statements" sent to the ECO.  He responded "yes".

10.  As a second point also taken by the judge as set out in  paragraph  21
    the letter from the Sponsor's employer did not confirm  the  length  of
    the Sponsor's employment or the type  of  the  employment  as  required
    under Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2(b).

11. Those were not issues taken by the  ECO  in  the  refusal  letter.   It
    appears at the hearing that  the  Appellant's  representative  did  not
    appreciate the significance of the question put with regard to the bank
    statements.  He believed that all of the bank statements from May  2012
    to 11th October 2012 had been submitted with the application  and  were
    before the Tribunal.  However the Tribunal  only  had  bank  statements
    from 12th July to 11th October 2012.

12. The notes of evidence by the Immigration Judge are on the file.  It  is
    clear at item 4 page 2 of her notes of evidence that the  question  was
    specifically put, "You submitted bank statements- see resps bundle. Are
    these the only ones you sent" . To which  the  reply  was  "Yes".   The
    appellant's bundle dated for the appeal the 5th December 2013 has  bank
    statements going back to April 2012.

13. In re-examination at page 3 question 6 the issue was dealt with by  the
    representative.  When asked whether or not  the  bank  statements  were
    sent for the relevant period it is recorded  that  the  Sponsor  stated
    that he  had  sent  "six  months'  wage  slips  and  six  months'  bank
    statements".

14. The judge also pointed out that no adjournment was sought at that stage
    to address the issue of the failure to provide the  corresponding  bank
    statements.  The judge clearly considered the evidence that was  before
    her.  She had accepted in paragraph 14 that the required wage slips had
    been submitted.  She however went on to consider the matter of the bank
    statements and found that in light of the Sponsor's clear statement  in
    evidence that those were the only bank statements he had submitted that
    an adjournment would in any  event  not  have  assisted  the  Appellant
    because of that clear statement that no other bank statements had  been
    submitted.

15. That with respect seems not to have dealt with the issue raised in  re-
    examination where the Sponsor had specifically stated that he had  sent
    six months' bank statements to correspond to the wage slips.

16. That however does not seem to deal with the  further  matter  that  the
    employer's letter was also defective.  That appears not  to  have  been
    dealt with in any great detail by the letter of refusal or the  Grounds
    of Appeal.  The requirements are clearly set out in paragraph  10  that
    the employer's letter  must  confirm  specific  details  including  the
    length of the employment and the period over which they had  been  paid
    at that rate and the type of employment, part-time etc.  The judge  has
    specifically set out at paragraph  21  that  the  Sponsor's  letter  of
    employment does not contain  the  required  details.   The  Grounds  of
    Appeal do not  appear  to  address  that  basis  for  saying  that  the
    documentation  submitted  with  the  application  did  not   meet   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

17. The Sponsor's letter from his employers is set out at  page  39.   That
    letter in essence confirms the Sponsor's salary and sets how the salary
    is to change from the period of October  2012.   However  it  does  not
    state the length of his employment or  the  nature  of  his  employment
    whether it be permanent, fixed term, contract  or  agency.   The  judge
    within paragraph 21 has specifically noted that that  letter  does  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules. It is for the  Appellant  to  prove
    that she meets all the requirements of the rules and clearly that  does
    not meet the rules.

18. Much was made of the issue of Sections 85 and 85A of the 2002 Act.   It
    was being suggested  that  the  Tribunal  was  capable  of  considering
    documentation submitted not with the application  in  order  to  assess
    whether or not  the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
    However the requirements of Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2  stipulate  that
    an individual has to produce a letter of  employment  setting  out  the
    required details.  The Sponsor's letter submitted with the  application
    did not contain the required details.   With  that  in  mind  for  that
    reason if for no other the  application  by  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed.  The fact that further documents to show that they would  meet
    the requirements of the Rules were put before  the  Tribunal  does  not
    show that they meet the requirements of the Rules.

19. Whilst there may be a point with regard to  whether  or  not  the  bank
    statements were the required bank statements that does  not  alter  the
    fact that the employer's letter did not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  Therefore the application had to  be  refused  on  that  basis.
    Whilst it was a matter that may not have been taken by the ECO it was a
    matter that was evident on the evidence presented  and  the  judge  was
    entitled to find that having given the representative notice  that  the
    issue was being taken the  representative  chose  not  to  adjourn  the
    matter.  Such an adjournment would have been to no  avail  because  the
    documents submitted to the ECO did not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

20. The judge has also considered the issue of any discretion in the policy
    guidance associated with Appendix FM-SE.  The judge found  specifically
    that sub-paragraph 3 may have been applicable in the circumstances,  in
    that in refusing the matter the ECO may have thought that it would have
    been pointless to request any missing documentation as there were other
    grounds for  refusing  the  application.   Accordingly  the  judge  has
    considered the issue of discretion and was entitled to deal with it  in
    a manner that she did.

21. For those reasons if for no other the application had to be  dismissed.
    The consequence  is  that  the  Appellant  will  have  to  make  a  new
    application providing the required documents.

22. With regard to the calculation of the income of the Appellant challenge
    was also made to that.  The Immigration Directorate  Instructions  have
    been submitted to try and assist the points being made.

23. I draw attention to paragraph 5.1.4 in which it is stated  that  salary
    employment will be calculated at the  lowest  level  of  annual  salary
    received during the six month relevant period.  Thus if  an  individual
    has a pay increase within  that  period  that  will  be  discounted  in
    assessing the annual salary.

24. In the present circumstances the  employer's  letter  stated  that  the
    Appellant's employment pay was at a rate of  �18,541  as  from  October
    2012.  However to reach that level there had been a 0.25%  increase  in
    the salary.  Thus in order to calculate the lowest level of salary  one
    had to take off the 0.25% from the salary figure given.  That  resulted
    in a figure of �18,499.

25. Added to that was the overtime payments received by the Sponsor  during
    the relevant period on a six monthly basis then annualised to  increase
    the salary.  Thus in any 6 month period if a person received  a  bonus,
    one would divide that by six and then multiply by twelve.

26. On the basis of the documentation for one period in  June  the  Sponsor
    received �82.80 by way of overtime payment.  It is  the  only  overtime
    payment made within the six month  period.   No  explanation  has  been
    given as to why that overtime payment was  made  but  it  was.   Giving
    effect therefore to the guidance given in the IDIs  the  guidance  with
    regard to overtime is set out in paragraph 5.5.6 and states:-

         "All overtime in salaried employment will be  calculated  based  on
         the approach to income for non-salaried employment. This will be an
         annualised six month average for the overtime which will  be  added
         to the level of gross annual salary."

    As the Sponsor earned �82.80 bonus in June the annualised  figures  for
    bonuses would have been �165.60.  That  added  to  the  existing  basis
    salary of �18,499 would mean that the  gross  salary  for  the  Sponsor
    during the year would be �18,660.25.  Thus the  Sponsor  would  on  the
    basis of the figures indicated meet the maintenance requirements of the
    Rules.

27. It appears that rather than taking the figures indicated the judge  has
    taken the monthly salary at its minimum and then annualised that figure
    in order to come to the Sponsor's annual  salary.   With  respect  that
    clearly is not correct.  It may be  that  there  are  reasons  why  one
    month's salary was lower than the rest.  It may be  that  the  accounts
    department have made a mistake.  However the letter from  the  employer
    clearly states what the annual salary is to be.  It would have been  of
    assistance if some explanation had been given as to why for example May
    had a specifically lower level of income than  other  months.   However
    there seems to be no reason why the judge should  be  annualising  that
    salary figure as the lowest rather than taking  a  statement  from  the
    employer as the basis of the calculation.  It would  have  assisted  if
    the relevant calculations had been set out.  However it does not appear
    that any of the parties had considered  that  an  appropriate  step  to
    take.  That left the judge with an inadequate explanation as to why the
    salary in May was specifically low and  the  judge  took  the  step  of
    calculating the annual income on the  basis  of  that  monthly  salary.
    That would have been arguably  not  in  accordance  with  the  guidance
    given.

28. However insofar as the employer's letter does not meet the requirements
    of the Rules that would be a ground for dismissing this matter  in  any
    event.  The judge has dismissed it for that  reason.   Accordingly  any
    other ground does make no material difference to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal.

29. The matter was thereafter to be considered on the basis of  Article  8.
    However as is evidenced from the cases of Gulshan 2013 UKUT 640,  Nagre
    2013 EWHC 720 and Haleemudeen EWCA Civ 558 the  Immigration  Rules  are
    now Article 8 compliant and  it  would  require  something  exceptional
    within the facts of the case to  consider  Article  8  outside  of  the
    Rules.  The judge has considered Article 8 and given valid reasons  for
    not allowing the appeal on the basis of Article 8.  I do  not  find  in
    the circumstances that  there  are  any  grounds  for  questioning  the
    assessment of Article 8 made by the judge.

30. Accordingly for the reasons set out I find that there  is  no  material
    error of law within the determination and the decision to dismiss  this
    matter on all grounds stands.
