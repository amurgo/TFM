                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JORDAN

                                   Between

                               1) Gift Obuzor
                              2) Eunice Obuzor
                               3) PO (a minor)
                                                                  Appellants
                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
               in relation to the second and third appellants
  pursuant to Rule 17 (5) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008

  1. By a notice sent to  the  parties  of  19  November  2015,  the  first
     appellant's appeal was withdrawn with the  consent  of  the  Tribunal.
     His appeal is no longer before the  Tribunal.   Indeed,  in  a  letter
     dated 29 February 2016, supported by a copy of his passport  with  the
     appropriate vignette, he says he has  settled  status  in  the  United
     Kingdom (indefinite leave to remain).
  2. By letter dated 3 February 2016 (received on 3 March 2016) the  second
     appellant wrote on behalf of her minor daughter, the third  appellant,
     (aged 12, born 16 December 2003)  that  she  wished  to  withdraw  her
     daughter's appeal to enable her  (as  it  is  expressed)  'to  make  a
     premium application based on the ten-year rule'.
  3. By letters each dated 29 February 2016 (received 1 and  2  March  2016
     respectively) the first appellant notified  the  Upper  Tribunal  that
     that he, too, wished to withdraw his daughter's appeal to  enable  her
     'to make a premium application based on the ten-year rule'.
  4. Pursuant to Rule 17(2) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
     Rules 2008, a notice of withdrawal will  not  take  effect  until  the
     Upper Tribunal consents to the withdrawal, which I now give. The third
     appellant's appeal is withdrawn.
  5. In the same letters, it is expressly stated that the second  appellant
     did not wish to withdraw her appeal.  She reserved her right to do  so
     'until I indicate on a later date'.  However, in a  subsequent  letter
     dated 10 March 2016, (received 10 March  2016)  the  second  appellant
     indicated that she, too, wished to withdraw her appeal  so  that  she,
     too, is enabled 'to make a premium application based on  the  ten-year
     rule'.   As I now give my  consent  for  her  to  do  so,  the  second
     appellant's appeal is also withdrawn.

OUTCOME

        1) The first appellant's appeal has been withdrawn;
        2) The second appellant's appeal is withdrawn by operation of  this
           notice;
        3) The third appellant's appeal is withdrawn by operation  of  this
           notice.
        4) There are no longer any of the above appeals  before  the  Upper
           Tribunal.
