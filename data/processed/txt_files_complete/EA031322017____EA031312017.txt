Representation:

For the Appellants:        Mr McTaggart, instructed by Andrew Russell & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants who are nationals of Pakistan aged 67 and 61, have  been
    granted permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Gillespie.  That appeal had been against the Entry Clearance  Officer's
    decision dated 7 March 2017 refusing  their  applications  for  an  EEA
    permit to join their son Awais Khalid (the sponsor), an Irish  national
    living in Northern Ireland.


 2. The Entry Clearance Officer did not accept  that  Awais  Khalid  was  a
    qualified person in accordance with Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.   It  was  acknowledged  the
    appellants had provided evidence of money transfers/bank deposits  from
    the sponsor and that records indicated the  appellants  had  a  monthly
    income of US $1,000 at the time.  There was no evidence of the  tenancy
    for the property in which they lived and a series of cash  deposits  to
    their joint bank account were not consistent with the funds transferred
    by their son.  Although acknowledging that the sponsor had sent  money,
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the appellants  have
    demonstrated that the money paid for their essential needs in Pakistan,
    including food, accommodation and healthcare.


 3. It was conceded by the Entry Clearance Officer at the  hearing  in  the
    FtT that the sponsor is an Irish national (by naturalisation) and  that
    he is exercising treaty rights as a self-employed  person  in  Northern
    Ireland.  After  directing  himself  as  to  the  legal  approach  with
    reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Siew Lian Lim v ECO
    (Manila) [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 and the  Court  of  Justice  decision  in
    Reyes v Migrationsverket 2014/C-423/12, the judge surveyed the evidence
    in some detail  which  included  reference  to  the  first  appellant's
    financial decline.  In short,  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  that  his
    parents have no pension, savings or earnings and are also  required  to
    pay for medical treatment.  All these costs fall to him.


 4. The judge also recorded the documentary  evidence  including  the  bank
    statements before setting out his  conclusions  at  paragraph  38ff  as
    follows:


         "38. I have considered all of the evidence and  am  satisfied  that
             the appellants' sponsor has  been  remitting  regular  monthly
             payments equivalent to about �400 per  month  to  his  parents
             from at least in or about the date of opening of their  Allied
             Bank account on 15 February 2017.  There is  little,  however,
             in the way of evidence predating the ECO's decision.  The bank
             account was not opened until after the  decision.   There  are
             only five Western Union receipts for payments of  �420,  �420,
             �310, �282 and �286 to his mother for the whole of  2016.   He
             and his parents needed a minimum of 60,000 PKR  per  month  to
             survive.


         39.  The tax return apparently evidencing a nil income,  and  again
             after the decision, would suggest that if the first  appellant
             was required to file a tax return,  even  as  someone  without
             income, and did no scrupulously,  evidence  of  his  financial
             decline would be available  from  previous  tax  returns  duly
             authenticated.


         40.  The brothers said their  father  failed  in  business  over  a
             decade ago but there is no evidence to show how  his  fortunes
             deteriorated in that period with the disposal of assets from a
             position of prosperity in the high  value  business  of  steel
             fabrication and construction.


         41.  The two tenancy agreements for their Karachi home are dated  1
             February 2017 and 11 January 2018 and again after the decision
             even though the application records that they have been living
             at this address since 1998 (Q 22 visa application  form).   If
             this is rented property one would expect evidence prior to the
             decision.


         42.  The evidence of Waqis Ali Khalid was vague in  regard  to  the
             sending  of  monies  to  his  parents  and  the  reasons   for
             documentation being destroyed at the time of  his  house  move
             when according to evidence it had in fact been kept.   He  was
             also vague in regard to the  cost  of  his  father's  surgical
             operation and how it was paid for.  His brother  who  was  not
             involved had no such difficulty.  Waqis Ali Khalid has more to
             account for than the sponsor given  that  he  claims  to  have
             supported his parents for a number of years.


         43.  In Miller v Minister of Pensions, Lord  Denning  said  apropos
             the standard of proof in a civil case, "that  degree  is  well
             settled.  It must carry a reasonable  degree  of  probability,
             not so high as  is  required  in  a  criminal  case.   If  the
             evidence is such that the tribunal can say: 'we think it  more
             probable than no',  the  burden  is  discharged,  but  if  the
             probabilities are equal it is not."


         44.  In this case the most that can  be  said  of  the  appellants'
             evidence is that the probabilities are equal and accordingly I
             find they have not proved that they cannot support  themselves
             from their own resources in meeting their basic needs and  are
             genuine dependants of their sponsor."


 5. The grounds of challenge argue:


   i) Irrationality.


  ii) A duty to give reasons (and by implication a failure to do so).


 iii) Mis-application of EU case law on dependency.


 6. In granting permission, First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb considered  that
    it was arguable that the consideration by the  judge  did  not  contain
    adequate reasoned findings.


 7. I proceeded with the hearing whether the First-tier Tribunal had  erred
    in law in the absence of Mr Matthews.  He  had  been  held  up  on  his
    flight from Glasgow.  There was no Rule 24 response and  having  regard
    to the issues in the case, I considered it was not unjust to proceed in
    the absence of  representation  for  the  Secretary  of  State.   After
    hearing submissions from Mr McTaggart I gave my decision to  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  My initial view was the  case
    should be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  in  the  light  of  the
    further findings that would be  needed.   When  this  news  reached  Mr
    Matthews on his arrival, he invited me to allow the appeal on the basis
    of the positive findings reached by the First-tier Tribunal as  to  the
    financial support provided by the appellants' son Awais in the  absence
    of any evidence of other income by the appellants.  Both  parties  were
    content for me to give brief reasons for my decision.


 8. As to the error of law by the First-tier Tribunal, I do not accept that
    its decision was irrational nor that it was appropriate for a challenge
    to be launched on this basis.  The Court of Appeal in R (Iran)  v  SSHD
    as per Brooke LJ made these observations on such a ground being run  in
    the Tribunal as it then was.  Specifically at paragraphs [11] and  [12]
    he observed:

         "11. It may be helpful to comment quite briefly  on  three  matters
             first of all.  It is well known that "perversity" represents a
             very high hurdle.  In Miftari v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 481,  the
             whole court agreed that the word meant what it said: it was  a
             demanding concept.  The  majority  of  the  court  (Keene  and
             Maurice Kay LJJ) said that it  embraced  decisions  that  were
             irrational or unreasonable in the Wednesbury  sense  (even  if
             there was no wilful or conscious departure from the rational),
             but it also  included  a  finding  of  fact  that  was  wholly
             unsupported by the evidence, provided always that this  was  a
             finding as to a material matter.

         12.  We mention this because far too often  practitioners  use  the
             word  "irrational"  or  "perverse"  when  these  epithets  are
             completely inappropriate.  If  there  is  no  chance  that  an
             appellate tribunal will categorise the matter  of  which  they
             make complaint as irrational  or  perverse,  they  are  simply
             wasting time - and, all too often, the taxpayer's resources  -
             by suggesting that it was."


 9. Nevertheless, I am satisfied  that  the  judge  failed  to  provide  an
    adequately reasoned decision for his conclusion that the appellants had
    not proved they could not support themselves from their  own  resources
    in meeting their basic needs or that they were  genuine  dependants  of
    the sponsor.  The judge had made  a  positive  finding  in  respect  of
    current support by Awais at paragraph [38] cited above.  The judge also
    had evidence before him  regarding  the  collapse  of  the  appellants'
    fortunes in terms of the oral testimony of their sons against  whom  no
    adverse credibility findings had been  made  whose  evidence  reflected
    their witness statements.  There was also evidence before the judge  of
    the extent of  the  appellants'  needs  by  reference  to  the  tenancy
    agreement and  the  need  for  medical  treatment  by  the  first-named
    appellant as well as his nil tax return.


10. The judge's concern over the vagueness of  Waqis's  evidence  regarding
    his historical support was  not  relevant  to  the  issue  before  him.
    Having accepted the evidence from Awais on the extent of his  financial
    support for his parents, the judge should  have  proceeded  to  make  a
    finding on the extent of their dependency.  The evidence was before him
    but he failed to do so or disregarded  it  and  focused  on  immaterial
    evidence.


11. Having given these brief reasons I am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law in its decision which I set aside.  The  decision
    is re-made and as invited by Mr Matthews on behalf of the Secretary  of
    State I allow the appeal.
