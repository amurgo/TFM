                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of China born on 11th of December 1988. She
      appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Lloyd
      sitting at Birmingham on 16th of December 2016 in which  he  dismissed
      on the papers the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
      dated  10th  of  October  2016.  That  decision  was  to  refuse   the
      Appellant's application for leave to remain as the spouse of a  person
      present and settled in the United Kingdom. The Appellant  had  married
      Mr Tariq Shihaib, a United Kingdom citizen, ("the Sponsor") on 31st of
      October 2013.


   2. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 30 July  2009  with  entry
      clearance as a Tier 4 (general) student valid until  25th  of  October
      2011. She made in time applications for this leave to be extended  and
      leave was granted until 30th of January 2014. On 17th of January  2014
      she applied for leave to remain as the spouse of the Sponsor and  this
      was granted valid until 17th of July 2016. On 13th of  July  2016  she
      made a human rights application for leave to remain as  a  spouse.  It
      was the refusal of this application on 10th of October 2016 which gave
      rise to the present proceedings.

The Explanation for Refusal

   3. The refusal was solely on the basis of the financial requirements  and
      associated evidential requirements of Appendix FM and  Appendix  FM-SE
      of the Immigration Rules. The Sponsor was required to show that he had
      a gross annual income of at least �18,600. The Appellant stated in her
      application that not only did the Sponsor earn  this  amount  but  she
      also had self-employed  earnings  of  �5,653  from  her  self-employed
      business trading as "Shining Shen Make Up."  Various  bank  statements
      and wage slips were provided with the application  which  showed  that
      the Sponsor's gross earnings were �1549.17 per month which equated  to
      an annual income of �18,590.04. The Sponsor's income was approximately
      �10 short of the required threshold.


   4. The Respondent did not accept the Appellant's  self-employed  earnings
      as the evidence supplied did not satisfy the requirements of  Appendix
      FM-SE paragraph 7 (c), (g) and (h). These requirements were  proof  of
      registration with HMRC as  self-employed  if  available,  evidence  of
      ongoing self-employment  through  evidence  of  payment  of  Class  II
      national insurance contributions and if the business was not  required
      to produce audited accounts then unaudited accounts for the last  full
      financial year along with an accountant's certificate of confirmation.
      The refusal letter did not take into  account  the  claimed  financial
      support towards living costs received from the Appellant's parents  or
      family in China.

The Appellant's Case

   5. The Appellant disputed the reasons for refusal. The  Sponsor's  actual
      salary was �18,600 per annum  but  due  to  an  error  by  the  firm's
      accountant the gross income he  received  was  as  calculated  by  the
      Respondent that is �10 short. His boss  and  the  accountant  had  now
      fixed that problem and she referred to supporting documents  from  the
      employer. The supporting document was a letter from the employer dated
      20th of October 2016, just over 3 months after  the  application.  The
      letter stated that in line with the firm's policy the Sponsor's  wages
      had been increased by �100 and his annual salary would now be �18,900.
      His wages had been due for review prior to the application but due  to
      the busy nature of the firm that was overlooked. There was evidence of
      the Sponsor's training contract for a fixed term starting from 2nd  of
      September 2013.

The Decision at First Instance

   6. As I have indicated the matter was  listed  for  hearing  as  a  paper
      appeal, the Appellant having only paid the �80 fee required. The Judge
      could thus only consider the matter on the basis of the papers  before
      him. He noted that the Sponsor's salary was stated at page  2  of  the
      training contract which was in a form recommended  by  the  Solicitors
      Regulation Authority. The amount of salary was inserted in handwriting
      in the appropriate space but had been partly obscured. It appeared  to
      say �18,600 but according to the Judge the 6 in that figure had either
      been smudged or overwritten and it was not clear what  was  originally
      written. The increase in the Sponsor's wages had been made  after  the
      date of application and did not tally  with  the  Sponsor's  statement
      that he was previously earning �18,600. Nor did the  letter  from  the
      employer refer to any form of mistake or underpayment in the Sponsor's
      wages prior to the date that the letter was written. The  Judge  found
      that  the  Sponsor  was  earning  �18,590  per  annum  prior  to   the
      application.


   7. There were still  no  accounts  provided  for  the  Appellant's  self-
      employed earnings. Tax returns obtained from HMRC were provided  along
      with bank statements showing various deposits in 2015 well into  2016.
      Some of these were in  cash  but  many  were  via  bank  transfer  and
      contained references to make up, individuals names and bridal  service
      deposits. The stated turnover was  below  the  personal  allowance  of
      �10,000 so no tax was payable. The Judge accepted that  the  Appellant
      did have some self-employed earnings for the  appropriate  period  but
      did not make precise findings on the level of  those  earnings  during
      the specified period although they clearly  would  have  exceeded  the
      necessary �10 per year. Appendix FM did not allow  3rd  party  support
      albeit that it was being received. The  monies  from  abroad  did  not
      therefore count. The actual income was well above the required  figure
      of �18,600 but it could not be evidenced in accordance with the Rules.




   8. As the Appellants failed  under  the  Rules  the  Judge  proceeded  to
      consider whether the Appellant could succeed outside the  Rules  under
      Article 8. The Appellant and Sponsor had a family life together. Since
      September 2016 the Appellant had been employed  by  Elite  Associates.
      The Appellant's failure under the Rules might be described as  a  near
      miss and there were strong indications that the financial  requirement
      might be met at the date of hearing. Nevertheless Article  8  did  not
      guarantee an Appellant a choice of country in which  to  enjoy  family
      life together with their spouse and there was  no  reason  why  family
      life could not be pursued in China. The only evidence of private  life
      in the United Kingdom was evidence of study and  work.  The  Appellant
      still had family members in China but  there  was  no  other  evidence
      regarding the Sponsor's ties to the United Kingdom. Since family  life
      could be pursued in China there would  therefore  be  no  interference
      with the family life by requiring the Appellant to  return  to  China.
      Any  interference  would  be  mitigated  by  the  possibility  of  the
      Appellant  making  a  fresh  application.  Maintenance  of   effective
      immigration controls in the public interest.


   9. There were no other considerations under section 117B of the 2002  Act
      that would adversely affect the Appellant. At paragraph 30  the  Judge
      somewhat ambiguously said "having considered all of this  together,  I
      find that the decision made by the Respondent  was  not  proportionate
      and accordingly I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds".  It  is
      not entirely clear what the Judge meant by this phrase  since  if  the
      decision was not  proportionate  then  the  appeal  should  have  been
      allowed under Article 8. If the  decision  was  proportionate  to  the
      legitimate aim pursued, then the correct course would  be  to  dismiss
      the appeal. Under the heading  "notice  of  decision"  the  Judge  did
      dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds and I assume therefore that
      there was a typographical error in paragraph 30.

The Onward Appeal

  10. The Appellant appealed against the Judge's decision in grounds settled
      by Counsel. After 2 introductory pages, which could perhaps have  been
      omitted the grounds of onward appeal made four main points. The  first
      (and for reasons which I will shortly explain the  only  ground  which
      had merit) was that the Judge should have considered the facts as they
      were at the date of his consideration.  If  it  was  likely  that  the
      Appellant could satisfy the financial requirements  of  the  Rules  at
      that time the appeal should have been allowed.


  11. The 2nd ground claimed that the policy of the Rules  was  that  people
      who could support themselves financially should  not  be  required  to
      conduct family life abroad. The grounds purported to rely  on  section
      117B (3) of the 2002 Act for this submission. This ground was  plainly
      wrong. It is well established that the subparagraph is not a  positive
      factor for an Appellant  if  they  should  satisfy  the  subparagraph,
      rather it is a negative factor if they do not.


  12. The 3rd ground argued that the  Judge  had  failed  to  take  adequate
      account of the private lives of the Appellant  and  her  husband.  The
      Sponsor had a lack of  connections  to  China  and  it  had  not  been
      explained why it was not relevant that there was evidence of study and
      work nor had the Judge taken into account the  importance  of  British
      citizenship. This ground overlooked the Supreme Court decision in  the
      case of Agyarko upholding the Court of Appeal that it was not a factor
      of particularly significant weight that an adult British  citizen  did
      not wish to relocate to the country of origin of his or her spouse.


  13. The 4th ground argued that the  Judge  should  have  treated  the  �10
      shortfall in the husband's income to be de minimis and/or should  have
      taken the size of that shortfall as relevant  to  the  proportionality
      exercise. The grounds sought to argue with an Upper Tribunal authority
      that the de minimis principal was no more than another way of  arguing
      for the discredited near miss principle.  The  4th  ground  sought  to
      explain the difference between de minimis and the near miss principle.
      With great respect to the drafter of the grounds paragraph 13  of  the
      grounds espoused a distinction  without  a  difference.  Perhaps  more
      soundly paragraph 14 the grounds argued that the de minimis  principal
      should not apply in human rights case as opposed to Immigration  Rules
      case.


  14. The application for permission to appeal came  on  the  papers  before
      Designated Judge Shaerf on 26th of July 2017. In  granting  permission
      to appeal he noted that  the  Judge  had  been  entitled  to  consider
      evidence of matters at the date of hearing by reason of section 85 (4)
      of the 2002 Act. The Judge had arguably erred in  failing  to  explain
      why  he  would  not  consider  such  evidence.   The   assessment   of
      proportionality was in error as the Judge had not taken  into  account
      the Sponsor's nationality, his personal circumstances and his lack  of
      connections to China. The appeal was restricted human  rights  grounds
      and it was an arguable error of law not to weigh in the assessment  of
      the proportionality of the Respondent's decision the extent  to  which
      the Appellant met the requirements of the Rules. A near miss  arguably
      might have had a material impact on such an assessment.


  15. The  Judge  arguably  erred  in  not  giving  greater  weight  to  the
      Appellant's own earnings as provided for in Appendix FM E-LTRP. 3.  2.
      Although not set out by the Designated Judge, this subsection provides
      that when determining whether the financial requirements  in  Appendix
      FM are met only certain sources may be taken into  account  but  these
      include the income of the partner from specified employment  or  self-
      employment and  the  income  from  specified  self-employment  of  the
      applicant.


  16. The Respondent replied to the grant of permission by letter dated  4th
      of August 2017. It was submitted that the grounds were without  merit.
      The Judge had correctly directed that this was  a  human  rights  only
      appeal but an important factor would be the  Immigration  Rules.  When
      considering cases outside the Immigration Rules  the  public  interest
      had to be considered through the lens of the Immigration Rules.  There
      was no suggestion that the Judge had limited the evidence to the  date
      of application. He correctly noted the requirements under the Rule and
      at paragraph 19  was  considering  post  decision  evidence  from  the
      employer. The letter then complained that the remaining  grounds  were
      misconceived (a submission with which I would agree for the reasons  I
      have given above). The Respondent's letter noted  that  the  Appellant
      had requested the matter to be dealt with on the  papers.  Whilst  the
      grounds argued a failure  to  take  into  account  an  impact  on  the
      Appellant's private life they failed  to  identify  what  evidence  of
      private life had been put before the Judge or he had  failed  to  take
      into account.

The Hearing Before Me

  17. As a result of the grant of  permission  to  appeal  the  matter  came
      before me to determine whether in the first place there was a material
      error of law such that the decision fell to be set aside and  re-made.
      If there was not, then the decision at  first  instance  would  stand.
      Counsel for the Appellant accepted that  the  point  in  issue  was  a
      narrow one. At the date of application the Sponsor's  income  was  �10
      short of the limit. The issue was whether the  evidential  requirement
      in Appendix FM-SD was satisfied and thus made up the shortfall. It was
      difficult to see what the public interest was in the  removal  of  the
      Appellant. The Supreme Court had decided that  the  Immigration  Rules
      were compatible with Article 8 but the Tribunal had to be free to look
      at Article 8 even if the Respondent could be  prescriptive  about  the
      Rules. It was a near miss not so much in terms of the shortfall but in
      the failure to document but the Appellant could meet the requirements.
      The appeal should have succeeded.


  18. In reply the Presenting Officer relied on the Rule 24 response which I
      have summarised above. The Appellant could not meet the Rules  firstly
      because of the shortfall but secondly in relation to  the  Appellant's
      self-employment. The question then was whether the Judge  went  on  to
      consider Article 8 outside the Rules correctly. That the  Rules  could
      now be met was one factor in the proportionality exercise but this was
      a paper case. There was nothing on the grounds to  indicate  what  had
      been served on the Tribunal for the Judge to rely on under Article  8.
      There was no evidence about the Appellant's  wider  circumstances.  In
      any  event,  she  could  make  a  fresh  application.  If  there  were
      deficiencies in the application only the Appellant could remedy  them.
      As this was a paper case one ought to be able to  see  what  had  been
      provided by the Appellant in support of her claim. Was  there  further
      information  such  that  the  Judge  had  inadequately  assessed   the
      circumstances of the Appellant and her husband? If there was  not  the
      Judge was entitled to find the public interest in immigration  control
      outweighed the Appellant interference.


  19. In conclusion Counsel  argued  that  part  of  the  problem  with  the
      determination was that it had not been stated  what  weight  had  been
      given to the relevant factors in the Article 8  assessment.  That  the
      Appellant could now meet the Rules was a strong  indication  that  the
      Judge should have allowed the appeal. The Judge was not constrained by
      what was said in the Rules. Nothing turned on credibility. Nothing was
      said in the determination about the Sponsor's status. The parties have
      been married since 2013. There was a material  error  of  law  in  the
      decision and the Appellant should be entitled to succeed outright  but
      if there was a need for further findings of fact then the case  should
      be remitted back to the First-tier.

Findings

  20. The First-tier Judge had to decide whether the Appellant could in fact
      meet the income requirements of the Rules. The Judge  found  that  the
      Sponsor's earnings were �10 short of the required limit at the date of
      application. The evidence that the Sponsor had had an increase in  his
      earnings since the application  was  somewhat  dubious  as  the  Judge
      pointed out. Although the Appellant  declared  self-employed  earnings
      sufficient to take the joint family income over  that  limit,  as  the
      earnings had not been evidenced correctly the Judge  held  they  could
      not be admitted. Having said that, the Judge evidently felt  that  the
      Appellant could demonstrate that she had sufficient earnings.  Indeed,
      provided she could show she was working it would be difficult to  fail
      to show that she was not earning at least �10 per annum.


  21.  The critical point was the date at which the assessment  of  earnings
      should be carried out. The section quoted by the Designated  Judge  in
      granting permission does not state  a  date  by  which  the  financial
      requirement must be met. The argument is whether section 85 (4) of the
      2002 Act permits the Tribunal to take into account evidence which  the
      Tribunal thinks relevant to the substance of  the  decision  including
      matters arising after the  date  of  the  decision.  That  relates  to
      appeals under section 82 (1) which for these purposes means a decision
      to refuse a human rights claim since there is no right of appeal under
      the Immigration Rules.


  22. It is difficult to see how the Respondent's decision under  the  Rules
      could be said to  be  wrong  unless  the  Respondent  had  incorrectly
      applied the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE. The Judge found
      that  the  Respondent  had  not  incorrectly  applied  the  evidential
      requirements, see particularly  paragraph  21  of  the  determination.
      There was still no accounts provided although  tax  returns  had  been
      obtained from HMRC along with bank statements showing various deposits
      (of monies earned) from 2015 and well into 2016.  The  Judge  accepted
      that those deposits were from the Appellant's  self-employed  earnings
      hence his conclusion that the Appellant could meet the requirements of
      the Rules at the date of hearing. Since the appeal was only  on  human
      rights grounds unless the evidence referred to  in  paragraph  21  had
      been before the Respondent it would  be  difficult  to  say  that  the
      Respondent's decision was wrong.


  23. The Judge thus went on to consider the appeal outside the  Immigration
      Rules under Article 8. As I have indicated a number of  the  arguments
      put forward by the Appellant in this case have little or no force.  It
      is difficult to see how the Judge could have placed significant weight
      on the position of the Sponsor given the paucity of information before
      him. That the Appellant narrowly failed in relation to  the  Sponsor's
      income did not amount to a compelling circumstance  which  would  mean
      that the appeal should be allowed outside the Rules under  Article  8,
      see in particular paragraph 23 of  MM  [2017]  UKSC  10  quoting  with
      approval an earlier decision of the Upper Tribunal. More difficult  is
      the fact that the  Appellant  could  show  that  she  could  meet  the
      financial requirements albeit not in the form required by the Rules.


  24. The evidence  before  the  Judge  was  sufficient  to  show  that  the
      Appellant could meet the Rules for the reasons I have given  above.  I
      agree with the submission made on the Appellant's behalf that that was
      a powerful factor to be taken  into  account  in  the  proportionality
      exercise. This was a genuine and subsisting  marriage  and  leave  had
      previously been given  to  the  Appellant  by  the  Respondent  for  a
      relatively short period no doubt to confirm whether  the  relationship
      was genuine. The issue was a narrow one as Counsel for  the  Appellant
      correctly submitted to me. The Appellant could show that she  and  the
      Sponsor exceeded the financial limits  by  a  substantial  amount.  In
      those circumstances as Counsel for the Appellant argued what  was  the
      legitimate purpose being pursued in  this  case?  That  the  Appellant
      narrowly missed the requirements of the  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
      Respondent's decision is not I accept a weighty factor for  her.  What
      is relevant is that by the date of the hearing she could show that she
      substantially met the  Rules.  A  human  rights  assessment  does  not
      require the same strict evidential requirements  that  a  Rules  based
      assessment requires.


  25. In  those  circumstances,  I  see  little  purpose  in  requiring  the
      Appellant to have to make another application  (and  of  course  incur
      another fee) since on the  evidence  before  me  the  Appellant  would
      inevitably succeed under the Rules in a fresh  application.  It  would
      not be a proportionate interference with the established  family  life
      of the Appellant and the Sponsor by requiring the Appellant to  return
      to China to make an application from there for entry  clearance  as  a
      spouse since she would be repeating an application she had  previously
      made and which had been granted.


  26. An issue was raised as to whether the Judge was entitled to  say  that
      family life could be continued elsewhere. I  accept  the  Respondent's
      argument that there was nothing before the Judge to show that it could
      not. The burden of proving that it could not rested upon the Appellant
      and that burden had not been discharged.  I  accept  the  Respondent's
      criticisms of much of the grounds of onward appeal in this case  which
      have somewhat obscured the core issue. That core issue was whether  it
      was  proportionate  under  Article  8  to  refuse  an  application  on
      financial and evidential grounds  where  the  evidence  was  that  the
      Appellant considerably exceeded the relevant requirements.


  27. I indicated at the conclusion of the hearing before me that if I found
      there was a material error of law I would set the decision  aside  and
      give directions for the matter to be reheard. I consider there  was  a
      material error of law in the Judge's handling of  the  proportionality
      exercise in the light of his finding that the Appellant  could  exceed
      the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules by  a  substantial
      margin. That being so I set the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      aside.


28. There is no need for further evidence or submissions since  the  matter
    has been fully ventilated both at first instance and  before  me.  Such
    further evidence as there might be might well reinforce the  indication
    that the Appellant could succeed under the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules but since the Judge found that she could there  seems  little
    point in adjourning just for that. Further evidence about the Sponsor's
    situation will not I find take the case any  further  in  view  of  the
    authority of Agyarko. I do not therefore propose either to  remit  this
    case back to the First-tier or to list it for  a  continuation  hearing
    since little purpose is to be served by either step.  In  my  view  the
    correct course of action in this case is to allow the  appeal  outright
    on human rights grounds as there are  exceptional  features  (that  the
    Appellant can show she meets the Rules) about this case which  take  it
    outside the normal run of cases. That the Appellant did not produce  to
    the Respondent evidence in the correct form of her self-employment is a
    factor to be taken into  account  but  is  outweighed  by  the  Judge's
    finding  of  the  true  position,  that  the  Appellant   and   Sponsor
    considerably exceeded the requirements.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
    law and I  set  it  aside.  I  remake  the  decision  by  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant
    leave to remain.

Appellant's appeal allowed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Although I have overturned the decision to dismiss  the  appeal,  I  do  not
interfere with  the  Judge's  decision  to  make  no  fee  award  since  the
Appellant succeeded on the basis of post decision  evidence  which  was  not
before the Respondent at the date of decision.
