Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. J White, Solicitor, Kesar & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms. S Cunha, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I observe the confirmation in the reported decision  of  Mx  M  (gender
    identity - HJ (Iran) - terminology) El Salvador [2020] UKUT 00313 (IAC)
    that decision makers should where possible apply the  guidance  in  the
    Equal Treatment Bench Book and use gender  terminology  which  respects
    the chosen identity  of  appellants  before  them.  Such  approach  can
    properly be adopted in respect of witnesses.

 2. The appellant is a national of the United States of America. Her appeal
    against the decision of the respondent to grant her leave to remain  in
    this country on human rights (article 8) grounds was initially  refused
    by the First-tier Tribunal (JFtT Hone) sitting at  Taylor  House  by  a
    decision sent to the parties on 6 May 2020.

 3. The appellant was granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal by  UTJ
    Mandalia and by a decision sent to the parties on 18  December  2020  I
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. I directed that the decision be remade by this Tribunal  and  confirmed
    that the findings  of  fact  made  by  Judge  Hone  at  para.  17  were
    preserved. This paragraph details:

         '17. I find the Appellant and her partner  are  very  credible  and
             that they are in a loving and supportive relationship.  I  find
             that their account is credible. I  find  that  the  Appellant's
             partner is undergoing  gender  reassignment  therapy  and  will
             imminently have bottom surgery. It is accepted and I find  that
             he has already had top surgery. I also find that he  identifies
             as a man and has since 2013. I find that the Appellant supports
             her partner. Her partner is also supported by  his  mother  and
             his family.'

Remote Hearing

 5. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in exactly the same way as if we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

 6. By means of my decision dated 18 December 2020 I  issued  an  anonymity
    order. Neither party applied for it to be set aside and I confirm it at
    the conclusion of this decision.

Facts

 7. The appellant is a national  of  the  United  States  of  America.  She
    entered this country as a Tier 4 (General) Student in 2014 and  studied
    at a university in this country.  Whilst  at  university  she  met  her
    partner, 'AA', a British citizen who was born female and  at  the  time
    they met identified as male.  He  continues  to  do  so.  AA  underwent
    psychological  assessment  and   began   the   processes   of   medical
    transitioning in 2011. He has engaged in  hormone  replacement  therapy
    (testosterone) administered by intramuscular injection since  2013  and
    attends a clinic for his required injections on average every 12 weeks.
    This requires him to undergo quarterly blood tests to identify  hormone
    levels. Such treatment will be undertaken throughout his lifetime.

 8. AA completed chest reconstruction surgery  in  2014  and  is  currently
    referred for both  hysterectomy  and  genital  reconstructive  surgery.
    There continues to be a long waiting time for  such  surgery  and  once
    undertaken substantial recovery time is required. To date, as a British
    citizen, the cost of his surgery  has  been  covered  by  the  National
    Health Service, and this will be the position for future  treatment  in
    this  country.  He  pays  �10  per  prescription  in  respect  of  each
    individual treatment of hormone replacement therapy.

 9. The  appellant  returned  to  the  United  States  of  America  at  the
    conclusion of her studies and the couple's relationship continued on  a
    long-distance basis. The couple relocated together to the  Republic  of
    Ireland in 2016. They resided there until 2017 when they  relocated  to
    the United Kingdom. Whilst  living  in  the  Republic  of  Ireland,  AA
    regularly returned to the United Kingdom as  required  to  receive  his
    hormone replacement therapy.

10. The appellant entered this country with entry clearance  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student in September  2017  enjoying  leave  to  enter  until
    January 2020. Her leave was curtailed in November 2018 upon her  course
    being reduced from 2 years' study to 1 year,  such  leave  being  valid
    until 4 March 2019.

11. On 18 February 2019 the appellant applied for leave to remain on  human
    rights (article 8) grounds. The respondent refused the application by a
    decision dated 2 September 2019. The respondent did not challenge  AA's
    gender identity, nor the genuineness of the relationship. By  means  of
    her decision she concluded that there were no insurmountable  obstacles
    to family life continuing outside the United  Kingdom,  namely  in  the
    United States.

12. Both the appellant and her  partner  are  employed.  The  appellant  is
    permitted to work  consequent  to  her  enjoying  'section  3C  leave':
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

Evidence

13. The appellant was unrepresented before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  She
    attended and gave oral evidence, as did AA. AA's mother  and  a  family
    friend attended the hearing.

14. The appellant confirmed that her mother, father and sister, who  reside
    in the United States, are aware as to AA's personal  circumstances.  AA
    informed the First-tier Tribunal that his present therapy was flexible,
    permitting the administration of testosterone every 12  weeks,  however
    he believed that he would have to revert to  a  2-week  therapy  if  he
    lived in the United States.

15. Before  this  Tribunal  the  appellant  and  her  partner  relied  upon
    individual witness statements, both dated 27 April 2021. The  appellant
    confirmed that when AA visited her in the United States in 2015, he was
    due his next treatment  of  hormone  replacement  therapy.  The  couple
    identified and attended a clinic. The total cost was $250 for the drop-
    in appointment and  a  further  $150  for  the  administration  of  the
    intramuscular injection.

16. AA explained in his statement:

         '10.  Injections can range in cost. Amounts have begun at  $30  and
             been found to exceed $500. I believe an average price  I  could
             expect to pay to  be  $150;  though  this  doesn't  include  GP
             appointments nor blood  tests  required  to  check  my  hormone
             levels, or the cost of syringes. It is not uncommon for  people
             to blindly  go  through  hormone  replacement  therapy  in  the
             States, or miss injections due  to  financial  reasons.  It  is
             extremely important for  overall  health  for  hormones  to  be
             managed correctly and it would be a challenge to  ensure  this.
             My particular injection grants quality of life and ease of  use
             due to the low maintenance required but it largely  popular  in
             Europe, I have previously found in the United States  is  short
             of astronomical, an injection of 3ml at just  under  $500  from
             some providers  [sic].  I  currently  pay  a  �10  prescription
             charge.'

17. He explained as to the importance of his treatment:

         '12.  My identity as a trans man has had moments of what  can  only
             be described as deep mental anguish at times in my life. I  can
             say without hesitation that my  treatments  improved  this.  It
             does not play a problematic role in my role. I consider this  a
             privilege I wouldn't have in America.  Acquiring  hormones  can
             often feel like a state of survival for trans people, and it is
             a state I haven't had to live in for a long time.


         13.  Should I not be able to receive treatment (hormones,  surgery)
             as well as supporting treatments (blood tests) in the  US  then
             it would have a real impact on my mental health  and  sense  of
             place  in  the  world,  but   physically   a   deprivation   in
             testosterone would affect my energy levels, my state  of  mind,
             it would affect my confidence and it would begin to  affect  my
             body, from weight distribution, weight gain and  until  further
             surgeries, infrequent injections can essentially 'start up'  my
             female sex organs. It is also worth noting that hormone therapy
             can  significantly  affect  the  thyroid,  which  is  extremely
             detrimental to a person's health. It is also  worth  mentioning
             that after a hysterectomy  that  missing  any  further  hormone
             injections can seriously affect physical health.  Hormones  are
             important for any human being to balance.'

18. The appellant explained the  regular  difficulties  AA  experiences  in
    explaining transgender to medical professionals:

         '4.  ... When you meet a  new  health  professional,  you  have  to
             disclose your personal  information.  Which  means  essentially
             that [AA] has had to routinely 'come out'  to  multiple  people
             over any length of time within the  medical  community.  It  is
             shocking to find out how little trained doctors know about  the
             basic things that people who are Transgender face  on  a  daily
             basis. It is frankly exhausting to have to educate, explain and
             interact in that capacity. ...'

19. The appellant confirmed that AA has experienced discrimination:

         '5.  ... He was heavily discriminated against at his workplace. His
             employers treated him  with  extreme  disrespect,  and  it  was
             revealed  that  they  were  tracking   his   personal   medical
             information. This was absolutely unacceptable and [AA] ended up
             quitting. I encouraged him to find another job, where he  would
             be treated with dignity and his gender identity  would  not  be
             openly questioned or discussed by  people  who  have  no  legal
             right to.'

20. The appellant expressed her concern that if she returned to the  United
    States AA would lose her support at a time when he may be called in for
    extremely invasive and serious surgery. She observed that AA  had  been
    on a waiting list for two years for chest  reconstruction  surgery  and
    then only given one week's notice as to his surgical appointment.

21. AA confirmed that the couple had enquired into private treatment in the
    United  States,  but  they  found  the  finances  required   were   not
    manageable. They were concerned that seeking to  secure  such  finances
    would affect their quality of living.

22. As to the cost of surgery in the United States, the appellant stated:

         '7. ... The cost of receiving those surgeries in America  is  vast.
             We are extremely fortunate to live in a country where that is a
             medical expense that is recognised as a necessary  surgery  and
             not a cosmetic one, like in America. Many health  providers  do
             not consider gender reassignment surgery to be necessary  to  a
             Transgender person's life. ...'

Decision

Preliminary Issues

23. By means of the Tribunal's decision dated 18 December  2020,  at  [27],
    the appellant was directed to file and serve any additional evidence to
    be relied upon, accompanied by an appropriate rule 15(2A)  application,
    no later than 14 days before the resumed hearing. Such  time  therefore
    expired on 20 April 2021.

24. The appellant filed and served further  evidence  to  be  relied  upon,
    running to 74 pages, on 30 April 2021. There was no  accompanying  rule
    15(2A) application or an explanation as to why the documents were filed
    in breach of directions.

25. On the morning of the hearing, Ms.  White  sought  to  file  and  serve
    further evidence, again with no accompanying rule 15(2A) application or
    explanation as to why the documents were filed in breach of directions.



26. I consider a breach of directions to be a serious matter.

27. Ms. White stated that she was unaware of the relevant direction, though
    she candidly accepted that the decision of 18 December  2020  had  been
    received by Kesar & Co. She sought to explain  that  the  Tribunal  had
    previously been 'put on notice' as to the appellant's intention to rely
    upon further evidence but presented no cogent  explanation  as  to  why
    such  vague  unilateral  assertion  diminished  not  only  an   express
    direction of the Tribunal but also the mandatory nature of rule  15(2A)
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

28. Ms. Cunha confirmed that she took no objection to the appellant relying
    upon the documents and so I  exercised  discretion  and  permitted  the
    appellant to rely upon them.

29. Ms. White sought to rely upon an undated skeleton argument running to 7
    pages. Whilst there was no direction as to the  filing  of  a  skeleton
    argument in this matter, a skeleton argument is usually of  benefit  to
    the Tribunal in its preparation and so gratefully received. However, in
    this  matter  the  skeleton  argument  was  sent  to   the   Tribunal's
    correspondence team at  09.32  on  the  morning  of  the  hearing.  The
    Tribunal receives a considerable amount of email correspondence  during
    the day, and any reasonable professional working in  this  field  would
    expect a time delay  in  the  internal  forwarding  of  correspondence.
    Despite the best endeavours of administrative staff at Field House, the
    skeleton argument was forwarded onto me at 10.08 and I became aware  of
    it  a  matter  of  minutes  before  the  hearing  commenced.   In   the
    circumstances, with a busy list, Ms. White gave no  cogent  explanation
    as to why the hearing should be subject  to  delay  so  that  I  should
    retire to read the document with the expected care.  Consequently,  the
    appellant was refused permission to rely upon the skeleton argument.

30. I share the exasperation of the High Court in its  recent  judgment  of
    Ahmed v. Ahmed [2021] EWHC 1021 (Ch) as to how the very late service of
    skeleton arguments is expected by parties to aid a judge  in  preparing
    for a hearing. As a tool designed to be persuasive, its  usefulness  is
    significantly, if not fatally, undermined when it reaches the desk of a
    judge minutes before a hearing commences. The adoption by a  lawyer  of
    very late filing establishes an unhelpful mechanical  approach  to  the
    production of a skeleton argument, rather than abiding by  its  primary
    role of aiding the Tribunal and consequently advancing  their  client's
    case.

Decision

31. Ms. White confirmed that the appellant was unable to satisfy  paragraph
    E-LTRP.3.1 of  the  Immigration  Rules  ('the  Rules')  in  respect  of
    financial requirements at the date of application  and  so  the  appeal
    under the Rules proceeded in respect of paragraph EX.1(b)  of  Appendix
    FM.

32. At the commencement of the hearing Ms. Cunha confirmed that  though  it
    remained the  position  of  the  respondent  that  the  decision  of  2
    September 2019 was correct as at the date it was served in light of the
    evidence presented at that date, the respondent's present position  had
    altered. The respondent  accepted  in  light  of  the  information  now
    available  to  her,  when  properly   weighed,   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate for the couple to relocate to the United States and so
    the appellant properly succeeded under paragraph  EX.1(b).  Though  the
    respondent's position remained that the appellant could not succeed  on
    article 8 grounds outside of the Rules, Ms.  Cunha  accepted  that  the
    appeal should properly be allowed as the appellant succeeded under  the
    Rules.

33. In respect of paragraph EX.1(b), I am  satisfied  that  the  concession
    made by Ms. Cunha was the only  permissible  option  available  to  the
    respondent. Paragraph EX.1(b) and EX.2 provide:

         'EX.1.   This paragraph applies if


         ...


                 (b)   the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                  relationship with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a
                  British Citizen, settled in the UK,  or  in  the  UK  with
                  refugee leave, or humanitarian protection, in the UK  with
                  limited  leave  under  Appendix  EU  in  accordance   with
                  paragraph GEN.1.3.(d), or in the UK with limited leave  as
                  a worker or business person under Appendix ECAA  Extension
                  of Stay in  accordance  with  paragraph  GEN.1.3.(e),  and
                  there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  with
                  that partner continuing outside the UK.


         EX.2.     For the purposes of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
                obstacles" means the  very  significant  difficulties  which
                would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and
                which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
                hardship for the applicant or their partner.'

34. The Supreme Court confirmed in R (on the  application  of  Agyarko)  v.
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC  11,  [2017]  1
    W.L.R. 823  that  the  words  'insurmountable  obstacles',  defined  in
    paragraph EX.2, establishes  a  strident  test.  The  Court  of  Appeal
    confirmed in Lal v. Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1925, [2020] 1 W.L.R. 858 that the test is  an  objective  one
    and so proper regard has to be had  to  the  particular  character  and
    circumstances of the individual concerned.

35. I am satisfied that AA will have significant difficulties, in at  least
    the short to mid-term and more likely than not in the  longer-term,  in
    securing  regular  access  to  blood  tests  and  hormone   replacement
    treatment in the United States consequent to a  lack  of  accessibility
    through cost and location. I am satisfied  that  any  impact  upon  the
    regular administration of hormone replacement treatment, which is a key
    part of AA enjoying life in accordance with his identity, would  entail
    very serious difficulties for him and adversely impact upon the  family
    life he enjoys with the appellant. Upon relocation the likelihood of AA
    securing required surgery in the short to  mid-term  is  minimal,  also
    consequent to cost. This too, will entail very serious difficulties for
    AA and adversely impact  upon  the  family  life  he  enjoys  with  the
    appellant. Such significant  difficulties  would  entail  very  serious
    hardship for the couple. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that  the
    respondent was correct as to her concession  in  respect  of  paragraph
    EX.1(b).

36. As the appellant is successful in  her  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, and the  respondent  agrees  with  such  conclusion,  I  am  not
    required to consider her  appeal  outside  of  the  Rules.  However,  I
    observe that I would also have allowed the appeal on article 8  grounds
    outside of the Rules in light of the particular  factual  circumstances
    arising in this matter.

Notice of Decision

37. By means of a decision sent to the parties on  18  December  2020  this
    Tribunal set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated
    on 6 May 2020 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal, Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

38. The decision is re-made, and the appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights
    (article 8) grounds is allowed.

39. An anonymity order is made.

Anonymity Order

40. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the relevant Procedure Rules I make an anonymity
    order:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no  report
         of these proceedings or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or indirectly identify the appellant and her partner,  AA.
         This direction applies to, amongst others, the  appellant  and  the
         respondent. Any failure to comply with this  direction  could  give
         rise to contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a
         likelihood of  serious  harm  arising  to  the  appellant  and  her
         partner, AA, from the contents of the human rights  claim  becoming
         publicly known.'
