                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and reasons which I  gave
    orally at the end of the hearing on 6th April 2021.

 2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also open to attend at Field House.  The  parties  did  not
    object  to  attending  via  Skype  and  I  was   satisfied   that   the
    representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M B Hussain (the  'FtT'),  promulgated  on  5th  October
    2020,  by  which  he  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's refusal on 6th December 2019 of his protection  and  human
    rights claims.

 4. In essence, the appellant's immigration history was that he had entered
    the UK clandestinely on 2nd October 2017 and claimed asylum on the same
    day. He was an Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnic origin who  entered  the
    UK as a minor but by the time of the respondent's impugned decision was
    now over the age of 18. However the respondent continued to  treat  him
    as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child. The respondent accepted  that
    the appellant was an Iraqi national of Kurdish ethnic  origin  but  did
    not accept that  he  supported  the  United  Kurdistan  National  Party
    ('UKN'), as a result of  which  he  had  faced  adverse  interest  from
    political rivals within the KDP, prior to leaving Iraq;  or that he had
    lost his identity or 'CSID' card,  based  on  his  assertion  that  his
    stepmother mistreated him and had burnt his belongings.  The respondent
    rejected his protection claim as well as his claim for leave to  remain
    based on right to respect for his private life. The  appellant  was  no
    longer an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child aged under the age of 17 �
    and therefore did not qualify for discretionary leave.

The FtT's decision

 5. The FtT considered, at �10, the appellant's claim to  have  engaged  in
    'sur place' activities, in particular attending a demonstration in  the
    UK on 1st September 2020 in  respect  of  which  photographs  had  been
    taken. At �13, the FtT noted the appellant's claim that various  Arabic
    and  Kurdish  TV  channels  had  filmed  the  demonstration  which  was
    available on their website and he would face risk even on return to his
    hometown of Sulaymaniyah, given the national influence of his political
    rivals. The FtT did not accept as credible the appellant's  account  at
    ��22 to 39, including the plausibility of the appellant's  timeline  in
    becoming interested in the work of the UKN (more  accurately  described
    as the PUK); and �35, the FtT rejected the appellant's  claim  to  have
    distributed leaflets on behalf of the PUK. At �36, the FtT rejected the
    account of ill-treatment by the appellant's stepmother, and at �42  the
    claim that she had burnt his CSID.  The  FtT  found  at  �40  that  the
    appellant would be able to return to Sulaymaniyah, under the control of
    the PUK.

 6. The FtT therefore rejected the appellant's appeal.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The respondent's appeal is on a single ground, namely that the FtT  had
    erred, having concluded that the appellant had attended a demonstration
    in London on 1st September 2020, in concluding that the appellant would
    not be at risk as a result of 'sur place' activities. The appellant had
    not only been photographed but filmed at the  event  and  the  FtT  had
    before him the expert report of Dr Fatah, referred to  at  �28  of  the
    FtT's decision, which had referred to the consistency, with  background
    evidence, of the risk of the appellant's raised profile as a result  of
    his attendance at the London demonstration  and;  the  existence  of  a
    Kurdish channel known to oppose the KDP- dominated government.

 8. The FtT's conclusion that there was no evidence  that  any  filming  or
    transmission included a recording of the appellant or  transmission  in
    his home country was not consistent with the authority of YB  (Eritrea)
    [2008] EWCA Civ 360, where at �18, the Court of Appeal had stated  that
    there was no requirement for  affirmative  evidence  that  intelligence
    services of repressive states monitor the internet for information  and
    instead, the real question was whether an individual was not identified
    as a mere hanger-on with no real commitment to an oppositional cause. A
    requirement for  the  appellant  to  prove  that  the  IKR  authorities
    actually monitored the demonstration and had identified  the  appellant
    through various mechanisms was an impossible one  to  fulfil.  Instead,
    his evidence of  repression  by  the  authorities  and  his  opposition
    activities at the demonstration were sufficient.

 9. First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew initially refused permission, but on a
    renewed application, permission was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Macleman on 27th November  2020.   The  grant  of  permission  was  not
    limited in its scope.

The hearing before me

The appellant's submissions

10. In terms of the hearing before me Mr Walsh referred to the  grounds  of
    appeal that had been permitted to proceed and which had been settled by
    Mr Mukherjee.  In particular the paragraph in question was �41  of  the
    FtT's decision which stated:

         "41. In regards to the appellant's sur  place  activities,  namely,
             attendance at a demonstration in front of the Iraqi Embassy in
             September 2020, whilst I accept that he did attend the  event,
             there is absolutely no evidence that any  filming  included  a
             recording of the appellant nor that any  transmission  in  his
             home country depicted him in any way.  The appellant's  expert
             comments generally that those who oppose  the  government  are
             not kindly treated, however, the appellant has not proven that
             he has come to the attention of the authorities.   He  claimed
             that  there  were  references  in  Facebook  and  the  Kurdish
             television channel's website, but it is not  proven  that  any
             broadcast included a picture of him."

11. In that regard the grounds had cited the Court of Appeal's decision  of
    YB (Eritrea) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 360 and in  particular  �18,  which
    stated:

          "In my judgment, and without disrespect to what  is  a  specialist
          Tribunal, this is a finding which risks losing contact in reality.
           Where, as here, the Tribunal has objective evidence which 'paints
          a bleak picture of the suppression of political  opponents'  by  a
          named government, it requires little or no evidence or speculation
          to arrive at a strong  possibility  -  perhaps  more  -  that  its
          foreign legations not only film or photograph their nationals  who
          are demonstrating in public against the regime but have  informers
          amongst expatriate oppositionist organisations who  can  name  the
          people who are filmed and photographed.   Similarly  it  does  not
          require affirmative evidence to establish a probability  that  the
          intelligence services of such  states  monitor  the  internet  for
          information about oppositionist groups.  The real question in most
          cases will be what follows for the individual claimant.   If,  for
          example, any information reaching the embassy is likely to be that
          the claimant identified in a photograph is  a  hanger-on  with  no
          real commitment to an oppositionist cause, that will  go  directly
          to the [relevant] issue...."

12. In this case there was the context of Dr Fatah's report, an expert.  Dr
    Fatah had specifically referred to the risk, to which I was referred at
    �80 of that report, of the plausibility, if the appellant  were  indeed
    filmed, of him being perceived by the IKR authorities to have a  higher
    profile.  Where the FtT had fallen into error was to say  that  because
    there was no direct evidence of the appellant  being  filmed,  or  such
    film being broadcast (the appellant had adduced still photographs), the
    appellant had failed to meet the burden of proving his case.  What  the
    FtT should have done was to consider whether it was possible  to  infer
    risk, in particular, by considering whether the appellant would be seen
    as a 'hanger on,' from the surrounding evidence, such as the nature and
    quality of the appellant's involvement in 'sur place'  activities.  The
    FtT had committed the very error cautioned  against  in  YB  (Eritrea).
    To require the appellant to prove  his  being  filmed  or  observed  by
    agents of the IKR authorities or political rivals  was  too  high,  and
    indeed an impossible burden.

The respondent's submissions

13. Mr Tufan reiterated the contents of the respondent's Rule 24  response,
    the gist of which was that the findings made by the FtT  were  open  to
    him to make on the evidence before him.  There was no evidence  of  any
    filming being broadcast in the IKR.  The FtT had been entitled to  draw
    adverse inferences from the lack of such evidence on Facebook or the TV
    channel's website, when the appellant had referred to  the  possibility
    of  it  being  there.   Mr  Tufan  went  on  to  criticise  the   still
    photographs, which appeared to show that the appellant was  criticising
    the political party he claimed to support; and the limited evidence  in
    Dr Fatah's report on the risk because of  'sur  place'  activities,  as
    opposed to oppositional activities within the IKR,  although  Mr  Tufan
    accepted that Dr Fatah had referred at  �80  to  the  risk  because  of
    attending demonstrations in the UK.

The appellant's reply

14. Mr Walsh urged me to consider that there was a risk  in  following  the
    line of argument pursued by Mr Tufan of making  an  assessment  of  the
    merits of the  appeal  (by  considering  the  quality  of  photographic
    evidence), rather than considering whether the FtT had  erred  in  law.
    As could be seen from �80 of the expert's report, Dr Fatah had  clearly
    considered and referred to the risk to the appellant  as  a  result  of
    'sur place' activities in the UK and it was that evidence  that  should
    have  been  assessed  in  the  wider  context  by  way  of  inferential
    reasoning.  The question of whether he was also critical  of  the  some
    people within the PUK, whom he claimed to support, had been referred to
    by the FtT at �12 of the decision.  In  essence,  we  returned  to  the
    central challenge which was that at �41, the FtT had imposed too  high,
    and indeed an impossibly high, burden upon the appellant and  therefore
    had impermissibly rejected his account in the circumstances.

Discussion and conclusions

15. I do regard the FtT as having materially erred in law.   I  accept  the
    force of Mr Walsh's argument that  I  should  not  assess  the  primary
    evidence before the FtT or the merits  of  the  appellant's  protection
    claim, and instead should consider whether the FtT erred in imposing an
    impossible burden on the appellant.  Whilst I note Mr Tufan's criticism
    of both the expert report and the photographic evidence, I  accept  the
    proposition of Mr Walsh that this would stray into a  consideration  of
    the merits  of  a  protection  appeal  rather  than,  as  an  appellate
    jurisdiction, the sole question before me, which was  whether  the  FtT
    had in his reasoning, erred in law.

16. I accept that the FtT did, at �41, impose not only too high a standard,
    but an impossible one, namely to require the appellant  to  prove  that
    photographs or footage of him had been watched by political  opponents,
    whether in the IKR or the UK.   Instead,  the  Court  in  YB  (Eritrea)
    encourages decision makers and Tribunals to assess the  likelihood,  by
    way of inferential reasoning, of a  person  coming  to  the  notice  of
    hostile governments. It might also be of key relevance  to  that  issue
    (but not in all cases), whether 'sur place' activities were  contrived,
    in the  sense  of  being  without  genuine  conviction,  to  bolster  a
    protection claim, which in turn  may  have  an  impact  on  whether  an
    individual is perceived as a 'hanger on'.

17. In contrast, the FtT focussed on the absence of evidence regarding  the
    broadcasting of material, rather  than  the  wider  circumstances,  for
    which there was potential evidence, of the nature of such  'sur  place'
    activities,  in  the  sense  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  personal
    involvement and the regularity and commitment to such  activities;  the
    extent to which such activities were contrived; and the extent to which
    political opponents would perceive such  activities  as  contrived  and
    even if contrived, whether that made a difference to  the  well-founded
    fear of persecution, based on 'sur place' activities.

18. The FtT therefore erred in his assessment of  the  risk  posed  by  the
    appellant's sur place activities,  and  this  error  was  material.   I
    considered what of the FtT's findings, if any, it was safe to preserve.
    Mr Tufan rightly pointed out that the appellant's appeal had only  been
    in  respect  of  the  FtT's  reasoning  in  relation  to  'sur   place'
    activities, and not in respect of the findings about  adverse  interest
    in the appellant's country of origin.  It would be perfectly  possible,
    Mr Tufan urged me, to separate out the findings of adverse  credibility
    in relation to events in Iraq, versus events in the UK.

19. The practical difficulty  with  preserving  the  FtT's  findings  about
    events in Iraq is three-fold.  First, the FtT  clearly  links,  in  his
    reasons, adverse credibility findings about political activity in  Iraq
    with,  for  example,  the  claimed  destruction  by   the   appellant's
    stepmother of his CSID card - at �42, the FtT says that:

         'It is my view that given the negative findings on the  appellant's
         credibility that I have made, that this claim is also made up...."

20. It is clear that the FtT was considering the issues of  credibility  as
    linked together, although he does  not  expressly  link  this  to  'sur
    place' activities, which in turn leads to the second issue.

21. The second problem, in separating out and preserving findings on events
    in Iraq, is the absence of any finding on whether the appellant's  'sur
    place' activities are contrived. It might be that the FtT believed,  as
    with the findings on the destruction of the CSID card, that because the
    FtT believed the appellant to be not  credible  in  one  respect,  this
    impacted on his credibility in relation to the genuineness of his  'sur
    place' activities; or it may be that the FtT had intended  to  conclude
    that despite not believing him in relation to events in Iraq, that  the
    appellant's  commitment  to  activities  in  the  UK  was  genuine  and
    committed, albeit his fear was not objectively well-founded. Any  Judge
    remaking would have no sense of what the FtT had found on this issue.

22. Third, the difficulty for any Judge in remaking, if compelled to follow
    preserved findings in relation to events  in  Iraq,  as  separate  from
    events in the UK, is that this  requires  the  drawing  of  such  clear
    distinction, where the necessary fact-finding requires consideration of
    credibility as a continuum, even recognising  that  a  witness  may  be
    credible in one respect and not in another.  Finding that a witness may
    be credible in one respect but not another is perfectly  possible,  but
    that does not mean that in making such divergent findings on  different
    aspects of a narrative, it can safely be done  in  isolation  from  the
    evidence as a whole. It  also  calls  in  to  question  the  safety  of
    preserving findings, however clearly reasoned, in relation to events in
    Iraq, in the context of  a  nuanced  assessment  of  credibility.   Put
    simply, it cannot safely be said that the credibility of the account of
    events in the UK  could  have  had  no  impact  on  the  assessment  of
    credibility of events in Iraq.

23. For all of the above reasons, it is unsafe to preserve any of the FtT's
    findings, other than the undisputed facts  that  the  appellant  is  an
    Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnic origin.

Decision on error of law

24. In my view there are material errors here and I must set the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision aside, subject to the preserved  finding  that  the
    appellant is an Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnic origin.

Disposal

25. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Practice  Direction  and  the
    necessary fact-finding, this is clearly a case that has to be  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

26. The remittal shall involve a complete  rehearing  of  the  appeal.  All
    aspects of the claims must be addressed. I preserve the FtT's  findings
    that the appellant is an Iraqi citizen of Kurdish  ethnic  origin,  but
    not the remainder of the findings, bearing in mind that the appellant's
    credibility and  plausibility  are  key  to  this  appeal,  and  issues
    relating to both run throughout the claim.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside, with the only preserved finding that  the  appellant  is  an
Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnic origin.

I remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

Directions to the First-tier Tribunal

This  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a   complete
rehearing, preserving only the  finding  that  the  appellant  is  an  Iraqi
citizen of Kurdish ethnic origin.

The remitted appeal shall not  be  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M
Hussain.

The anonymity directions continue to apply.
