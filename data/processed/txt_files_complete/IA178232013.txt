                                   Between

                               Moazzam Rasheed
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Sampson, of Messrs Waldegraves Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


     DETERMINATION AND NOTICE UNDER RULE 17 OF THE IMMIGRATION TRIBUNAL
                           (PROCEDURE) RULES 2005.

    1. The appellant appeals against a decision of the First-tier  tribunal
       in which Judge of  the  First-tier  tribunal  dismissed  his  appeal
       against a decision of the respondent refusing to vary his  leave  to
       remain.  The decision was made on 30 April 2013.
    2. The appellant had asked for an extension of stay to re-sit the  PLAB
       exam.
    3. Having passed the exam the appellant decided to return to  Pakistan.
       He wrote to the Tribunal to withdraw the appeal  on  27  August  and
       left Britain on 13 September to return to Pakistan.
    4. Unfortunately the letter withdrawing the appeal was  not  placed  on
       the file and was therefore not before the Judge when  he  determined
       the appeal and dismissed it.
    5.  BY consent we now set aside the  determination  of  the  First-tier
       Judge. We substitute for the decision of the  First-tier  Judge  our
       own decision that this appeal is withdrawn under the  provisions  of
       Rule 17 of the Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   This
       determination serves as due notice under Rule 17 (3) of those Rules.




Signed                                  Date: 18 November 2013


Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy
