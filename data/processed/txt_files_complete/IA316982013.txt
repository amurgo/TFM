For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal concerns essentially the question of whether the  appellant
    had a valid appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having decided that he did  not.   The  background  facts  are
    somewhat involved, but I set out the chronology of events as it appears
    to me from the documents that have been provided.

 2. The appellant, who is a citizen of India born on 9 October  1986,  made
    an application for further leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student  Migrant
    on 27 February 2013.  He initially came to the UK in pursuance of leave
    granted on 25 September 2009, that leave valid until 30 January 2012.

 3. The application made on 27 February 2013  was  refused  in  a  decision
    dated 18 April 2013.  The bases of the refusal were, firstly, that  the
    appellant had overstayed his leave in the UK for a period of more  than
    28 days, prompting the refusal under paragraph 245ZX(m) of HC  395  (as
    amended). Secondly, the CAS was not valid because a check was  made  on
    18 April 2013 in relation to Quinton College, the  sponsoring  college,
    but the sponsor register revealed that Quinton Colleges Limited was not
    listed at that date.  So far as maintenance under  Appendix  C  of  the
    immigration rules is concerned, the appellant was not assessed in  that
    respect because no valid CAS was provided.

 4. His appeal against the refusal to grant leave  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Page on 25 April 2014 who considered the appeal 'on  the
    papers', that is to say without  a  hearing.   He  concluded  that  the
    appellant did not have a right of appeal.  The reason for that was that
    at the time he made the application for further leave to remain  he  in
    fact had no leave. In order for  that  to  have  been  an  'immigration
    decision' attracting a statutory right of appeal,  the  result  of  the
    refusal of leave would have to have been that  he  had  no  leave  (see
    section 82(2)(d) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    ("the 2002 Act")). Here, the result of the refusal was not that he  had
    no leave, because he had no leave anyway because his leave had expired.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,
    essentially  in  terms  of  Judge  Page  not  having  had  before   him
    information from the Secretary of State which  it  was  considered  may
    arguably have had a bearing on the question of whether or not there was
    a valid appeal.

 6. However, the underlying chronology  goes  much  deeper  than  the  last
    decision made by the respondent on 18 April  2013.   The  history  goes
    back to 27 January 2012 when the appellant first  made  an  application
    for further leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student.  That application  was
    rejected in a decision dated 8 February 2012  because  the  appropriate
    fee had not been paid or, putting it  another  way,  the  issuing  bank
    rejected the payment.

 7. As I understand the submissions made on behalf of the appellant  today,
    it is accepted that the account which was said to support  the  payment
    of the fee did not hold sufficient funds but it is said that there  was
    another account which did hold sufficient funds.  It is argued that the
    appellant should have been contacted in order to allow him to submit  a
    further application using an  account  which  did  hold  the  funds  in
    question.  In fact, the letter  dated  8  February  2012  refusing  his
    application states that the appellant could make a further  application
    but there were no guarantees that the application would be  successful,
    and that the application would be considered on its merits.

 8. So the appellant could have made a further application,  and  indeed  a
    further application was made on 13 February 2012.  That was refused  in
    a decision dated 20 April 2012 on three bases  it  seems  to  me.   The
    first was that the documents he submitted  were  dated  more  than  one
    month before the application, contrary to the rules. Secondly,  he  did
    not have an established presence in the  UK  because  he  then  had  no
    further leave to remain, his leave having expired on 30  January  2012.
    Thirdly, because he needed, it would appear,  �5,400  but  his  account
    only held �2,836.82.

 9. Following that refusal there was a  pre-action  protocol  letter  which
    preceded what was contemplated as being a judicial review  application.
    That letter is dated 12 May 2012.  The Secretary of State responded  to
    it on 13 December 2012.  It does not appear that  any  judicial  review
    proceedings followed. If they did, I have not been made  aware  of  the
    outcome of those proceedings.

10. There was then a third application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    Student, on 12 February 2013.  That third application did  not  feature
    in the submissions that I heard today, or indeed when  the  matter  was
    last before me when the hearing was adjourned.   That  application  was
    also rejected, on 21 February 2013, because again the bank declined  to
    make the payment.  It seems again that there were insufficient funds.

11. That brings me to this application dated 27  February  2013  which  was
    refused, as already indicated, in a decision dated 18 April  2013.   It
    was refused for the reasons that I have set out in [3] above.

12. This appeal came before me  on  11  July  2014  at  which  hearing  the
    appellant was represented.  I adjourned that hearing because I was  not
    satisfied that sufficient evidence was before me  for  me  to  make  an
    informed decision as to what the proper outcome of  the  appeal  should
    be.  In truth, I was not satisfied that the appellant's  representative
    on that occasion was fully apprised of all the relevant facts,  or  was
    in a position to advance reasoned argument on the issues.

13. That situation prompted me to make directions for the  further  conduct
    of  the  appeal,  those  directions  including  the  provision  by  the
    appellant's representatives of a skeleton argument and  chronology.  It
    is readily apparent why I made directions for a chronology and skeleton
    argument. Nevertheless, those directions were ignored by  those  acting
    for the appellant.

14. In addition, Mr Trussler who appeared on behalf of the appellant before
    me today, it seems, was instructed 'late'. That of course is  no  fault
    of his and in the short time available to him he has very  impressively
    managed to marshal most of the salient facts in this factually  complex
    appeal.  The legal issue involved is actually one of little complexity,
    however.

15. At one stage the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Basnet (validity  of
    application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC) was relied on, but Mr
    Trussler on behalf of the appellant made it clear  that  that  decision
    has no application to the issues in the appeal before me today.

16. I was, however, referred to another decision, JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA
    Civ 78, also referred  to  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  That was a case which dealt with the question of a variation
    of an application for leave and whether  a  second  application  should
    have been treated as a variation.  However, I  am  not  satisfied  that
    that decision has any bearing on the issues that I need to determine.

17. Mr Trussler submitted, rather tentatively it has to be  said,  that  if
    the second application  (dated  13  February  2012)  should  have  been
    treated as a variation of  the  first  application  (dated  27  January
    2012), then the appellant may have been able to succeed in  his  second
    application because at the time he made that application he  had  valid
    leave. This proposition appears to rest  on  the  contention  that  the
    appellant would have had statutorily extended leave under section 3C of
    the Immigration Act 1971, which would thus have allowed his application
    to have been considered.

18. However, that fact of the matter is that the appellant made  his  first
    application on 27 January 2012.  It was rejected.  It is accepted  that
    he  did  not  have  sufficient  funds.   It  seems  to  me  that   that
    application, for all that it matters for the purposes of  the  'appeal'
    that is before me, was validly rejected.  The  second  application  was
    refused for the reasons I have given at [8] above.  A  judicial  review
    was at least proposed, given  that  there  was  a  pre-action  protocol
    letter, but seemingly not pursued.  If  it  was  pursued,  it  was  not
    successful.

19. A third application (dated 12 February 2013) was rejected because again
    the bank declined to issue the  payment,  possibly  or  even  probably,
    because that there was a lack of funds.

20. It was inevitable that this application, which is the direct subject of
    the proceedings before me, fell for refusal because the  appellant  had
    overstayed for more than 28 days.  The fact that the CAS was not  valid
    because the college was no longer on the sponsor register is a  feature
    of the refusal which actually has not been dealt with by the appellant.
     It would have caused the application to have been refused anyway.   It
    may be that if it was a valid application the appellant might have been
    granted a further 60 days  within  which  to  find  another  sponsoring
    college, but he could not have succeeded under the rules anyway because
    of the fact that he was an overstayer.

21. In any event, and fundamentally for the present  'appeal',  he  had  no
    leave to remain when he made that application. This brings me  back  to
    the beginning, being the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  he
    had no valid appeal because the decision made on 18 April 2013 was  not
    an 'immigration decision' which attracted a right of appeal. A  refusal
    to vary leave to remain is only an appealable immigration decision  "if
    the result of the refusal is that the person has no leave to  enter  or
    remain" (s82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act).

22. I am satisfied that First-tier Tribunal Judge Page's conclusion in that
    respect was absolutely correct.  The appellant had no valid  leave,  he
    had no right of appeal and the First-tier Tribunal was correct  to  say
    so.  The history that the appellant seems to be relying on  is  nothing
    to the point.

23. Accordingly, the First-tier Tribunal did not make an error on  a  point
    of law, and the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appeal is to stand.
