Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Ali, instructed by Syeds Lawcare Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  determination
    promulgated on 7 April 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes and Mrs
    R M Bray JP which allowed the respondent's appeal against deportation.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I refer to Mr Christie  as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State as the  respondent,  reflecting
    their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The challenge to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was that it:

          a.  sought  to  mitigate  or  otherwise  improperly  weighed   the
             appellant's offences

          b. failed to show how the  circumstances  of  the  appellant  were
             exceptional  so  as  to  outweigh  the   public   interest   in
             deportation, undue weight being given to the best interests  of
             the children and health of the appellant's wife.

 4. With respect to those acting for the Secretary of State in this matter,
    the challenges brought appeared to me to amount  only  to  disagreement
    rather than identifying anything that might amount to an error of  law,
    notwithstanding  the  complexity  of  the  law  and  legal   principles
    concerning in deportation cases.

 5. The panel stated in terms at [40]  that  the  appellant's  offence  was
    "particularly serious" as it concerned drugs. They go on  to  state  in
    the same paragraph:

         "It  remains  a  serious  offence  even  though  the  sentence  the
         appellant received was relatively low."

 6. It did not appear to me that the panel could possibly be said  to  have
    erred in law to the extent that their  decision  should  be  set  aside
    given those clear statements.  I  did  not  read  the  reference  to  a
    "relatively low" statement as "mitigation" or reduction of  the  weight
    to be placed on the offence or the weight to be placed  in  the  public
    interest. It is merely an accurate reference to the length of  sentence
    when considered against the full range of sentences available for  such
    offences.

 7. The respondent maintains that the panel minimise the offence  in  their
    discussion at [16] to [21]. I could not see how that could be so.  They
    correctly address at the outset of their consideration the  nature  and
    seriousness of the offence. They were entitled to have regard  at  [17]
    to the remarks of the sentencing judge. The findings at [18] to [21] go
    against the appellant as regards his reasons for having  committed  the
    offence.

 8. As regards the second ground, the panel clearly had in mind the correct
    case law and importance of the public interest in  the  deportation  of
    foreign national criminals and the "exceptionality"  or  "very  strong"
    grounds that must pertain for such an appeal to be allowed;  see  [12],
    [13], [38] and [39]. They refer in terms to MF (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192 and SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550.  Nothing  in
    the determination suggests that they did not apply the high test for  a
    deportation appeal to be allowed in their substantive consideration.

 9. The question of how  much  weight  was  to  be  afforded  to  the  best
    interests  of  the  children  and  the  health  difficulties   of   the
    appellant's wife were matters for the panel. The consideration of those
    matters at [19], [27] to [30], [33], [40] and  [41]  was  thorough  and
    careful. The panel took into  account  at  [28]  the  lack  of  medical
    evidence about the appellant's wife. It  indicates  at  [40]  that  the
    findings that it made on the wife's health were limited and not as high
    as put in the appellant's evidence. There was some  evidence,  however,
    some of which was corroborated by third parties;  see  [29],  [40]  and
    [41]. Having assessed the evidence about the appellant's wife carefully
    and declined to take it at its highest, it was open  to  the  panel  to
    conclude at [29], [30] and [40] that the wife had difficulty in looking
    after the children on her own when the appellant was in prison and that
    the family would "struggle" if the appellant was deported.

10. In short, there were manifestly matters here  capable  of  leading  the
    First-tier Tribunal  to find that this was "a very strong case  indeed"
    and they provided cogent reasons for their conclusion that  the  appeal
    should be allowed.

Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
