                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Wright is a citizen of Jamaica whose date of birth is recorded as 15
    November 1957.  He entered the United Kingdom on  15  July  2003  as  a
    dependant spouse.  Leave was varied and then further extended until  31
    October 2012.  Shortly before that date,  on  15  September  2012,  his
    spouse was granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on
    the basis of her ten years continuous residence.  On 31 October 2012 he
    therefore made application as the spouse of a  person  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That application however, was rejected on 19  December
    2012 because the specified  fee  was  not  paid.   Notwithstanding  the
    guidance in the case of Basnet (Validity of Application  -  Respondent)
    [2012] UK UT00113  Mr  Wright  did  not  appeal  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State (it may be that there was no issue) but  rather,  on
    23 January 2013, submitted a further  application  which,  on  6  March
    2013, was refused with no right of appeal.  On  3  March  2014  he  was
    served with a Notice of Immigration Decision pursuant to Section 10  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 in respect of which he did  have  a
    right of appeal, which he exercised.

 2. On 9 October 2014, Mr Wright's  appeal  was  heard  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, by Judge Thomas, sitting at Birmingham.

 3. The evidence was that Mr Wright and his  wife  married  in  Jamaica  in
    1989.  They had never lived apart and from April 2010 to  January  2012
    Mr Wright had worked as a bus driver with  a  salary  of  approximately
    ï¿½26,000.  Mrs Wright is  unwell  with  a  number  of  conditions  which
    physically restrict her.  However, notwithstanding the  disability  her
    employers (she works  as  a  part-time  carer)  have  accommodated  her
    illness. Her medication would, however, be available in Jamaica, though
    there, Mr and Mrs Wright have no home and it would be unlikely that Mrs
    Wright would be able to secure employment.  The  medical  condition  is
    deteriorating. Medical evidence in support, was led.

 4. In submissions, Mr Eluwa who also appeared in the First-tier  Tribunal,
    pointed to the fact that Mr Wright was, when he made application on the
    basis of his wife's settled status, only months short  himself  of  the
    ten year requirement.  That the Secretary of State took two  months  to
    return the application meant that the leave, by virtue of section 3C of
    the Immigration Act 1971, which Mr Wright had,  expired  prior  to  the
    Secretary of  State  informing  him  that  the  application  was  being
    rejected.

 5. I do not need to decide the point in the context of the appeal that  is
    before me, but given the case of Basnet, it  may  be  that  '3C  leave'
    would have continued until such time when Mr Wright might have appealed
    the decision to reject his application, had expired.  Be that as it may
    the Secretary of State in considering the grounds upon which Mr  Wright
    argued that he should be permitted to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    looked to insurmountable obstacles and contended  that  there  were  no
    sufficient insurmountable obstacles standing in the way of Mr  and  Mrs
    Wright continuing family life in Jamaica.

 6. Judge Thomas had regard to the submissions. He considered  Appendix  FM
    to the Immigration Rules,  and  in  particular  exception  EX.1,  which
    raises "insurmountable obstacles". He  recognised  that  there  was  no
    evidence that Mr and Mrs Wright could not live together in Jamaica  and
    held, "there is  no  evidence  that  [Mrs  Wright]  could  not  receive
    appropriate medical care in Jamaica."  For those reasons  Judge  Thomas
    found the requirements of Appendix FM and in particular  EX1  not  met.
    Having regard to paragraph 276ADE of HC395, the twenty year requirement
    was not met, and so Judge Thomas found that Mr Wright could not succeed
    under the Immigration Rules.

 7. Judge Thomas however went on to consider the issue of  proportionality,
    finding that Mrs Wright's medical condition and the immigration history
    of both Mr and Mrs Wright were not adequately provided for in  Appendix
    FM nor paragraph 276ADE and went on having regard to Sections 117A  and
    117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, to allow  the
    appeal.  Judge Thomas was clearly concerned by the Secretary of State's
    failure to inform Mr Wright for two months of the difficulty of the fee
    in relation to the latest application and suggested that the delay  did
    not indicate effective immigration control.  Judge Thomas looked at the
    positive aspects that there were, such as the willingness of Mr  Wright
    to work; that he had not been, at any time, a burden on the tax  payer,
    and the nature of the relationship. He came to the view, having  regard
    to all of the factors, that the appeal should be allowed having  regard
    to the wider application of Article 8 ECHR.

 8. Not content with that decision, by Notice dated 12 November  2014,  the
    Secretary of State made application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The  Secretary  of  State  suggested  that  there  was
    inconsistency on the part of the  judge  in  finding  that  the  appeal
    failed under Appendix FM but then having regard to  the  same  factors,
    namely Mrs Wright's medical  condition  and  the  immigration  history,
    found sufficient cause to look to the wider application  of  Article  8
    and allow the appeal.  It  was  also  submitted,  in  contrast  to  the
    judge's finding, that private life having been established  at  a  time
    when Mr Wright was precariously present in the United Kingdom  because,
    it was submitted, at all material times  Mr  Wright  was  granted  only
    periods of temporary leave.  I pause to note however that the  marriage
    was one that was entered into prior to Mr and Mrs Wright coming to  the
    United Kingdom.

 9. In the event, on 16 December 2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Hodgkinson granted leave thus the matter came before me.

Was there an error of Law?

10. This is yet another of the many cases  that  have  troubled  the  Upper
    Tribunal concerning the issue as to when it is appropriate for a  judge
    to look beyond the Immigration Rules and examine whether Article  8  of
    the ECHR is engaged and whether the decision of the Secretary of State,
    usually to remove an applicant, is proportionate to the legitimate  aim
    of the Secretary of State, usually the economic wellbeing of the United
    Kingdom expressed as immigration control.

11. I do not propose to add any gloss to the  considerable  guidance  which
    has emerged on point.  In the case of R (On the application of Halimatu
    SA Adiya Damilola Aliyu and Fatima Owakemu Aliyu v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 3919, Judge  Grubb,  sitting  as  a
    Deputy High Court Judge, having considered the various authorities,  at
    Paragraph 59 said:

         "In my judgment the Secretary of State (apart from "Complete  Code"
         situations) always has a discretion  to  grant  leave  outside  the
         rules.  That discretion must be exercised on the basis of Article 8
         considerations in particular  assessing  all  relevant  factors  in
         determining whether a decision is proportionate under Article  8.2.
         There is, in principle, no "Threshold" criterion of  "Arguability."
         I especially agree with what Aikens LJ said in this  regard  in  MM
         (at 128).  However that factor, taken together with  other  factors
         such as the extent to which the rules have taken  into  account  an
         individuals circumstances relevant to Article 8, will condition the
         nature and extent of the consideration required as a matter of  law
         by the Secretary of State of an individuals claim under  Article  8
         outside the rules.  If there is no arguable case, it  will  suffice
         for the Secretary of State simply briefly to say so giving adequate
         reasons for that conclusion.  At the other extreme, where there are
         arguable good grounds that the rules do not adequately deal with an
         individuals circumstances relevant  in  assessing  Article  8,  the
         Secretary  of  State  must   consider   those   circumstances   and
         identifiably  carry  out  the  balancing   exercise   required   by
         proportionality  in  determining  whether  there  are  "Exceptional
         Circumstances" requiring the grant of leave outside the rules under
         Article 8."

12. Clearly the reference to the Secretary of State in the guidance set out
    above applies to the judge whose decision is under consideration in the
    instant appeal.  I remind myself in  determining  whether  there  is  a
    material error of law that cases are often fact specific and that there
    will be a margin of appreciation  (to  use  a  European  term)  between
    judges.

13. My approach to this appeal is helped by the guidance in the case  of  R
    (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    982.  At paragraph nine of that judgment Brooke LJ said:

         "...It may be convenient to give a brief summary of the  points  of
         law that will most frequently be encountered in practice:

         i)   Making perverse  or  irrational  findings  on  the  matter  or
             matters  that  were  material  to   the   outcome   ("Material
             Matters");

         ii)  Failing to give reasons or any adequate reasons  for  findings
             on material matters;

         iii) Failure to take account and/or resolve conflicts  of  fact  or
             opinion on material matters;

         iv)  Giving weight to immaterial matters;

         v)   Making a material misdirection of law on any material matter;

         vi)  Committing  or  permitting  a  procedural  other  irregularity
             capable of making a material difference to the outcome or  the
             fairness of the proceedings;

         vii) Making a mistake as  to  the  material  fact  which  could  be
             established by objective and uncontentious evidence, where the
             Appellant and/or his advisors were  not  responsible  for  the
             mistake, and where unfairness resulted from the  fact  that  a
             mistake was made."

14. Pregnant in the grounds, the Secretary of State suggests, that what the
    judge did was perverse since on the one hand he found that it would not
    be unduly harsh for the Appellant and his wife to return to Jamaica and
    live there  notwithstanding  the  medical  conditions,  dismissing  the
    appeal under the rules and then, based on the same factors, allowed the
    appeal on human rights grounds.

15. It seems to me that whilst in many cases  one  can  say  that  what  is
    unduly harsh may well  determine  the  outcome  of  an  appeal,  "undue
    hardship" and "proportionality" after consideration of to the  totality
    of the evidence and the  circumstances  appertaining  to  a  particular
    appellant will not always lead to the same result.

16. Judge  Thomas  was,  in  my  view,  entitled  to  have  regard  to  the
    immigration history.  The immigration  history  included,  importantly,
    the fact that Mr Wright fell foul of the immigration rules  on  account
    only of an incorrect fee having  been  submitted  in  circumstances  in
    which, had the Secretary of State been  more  prompt  in  pointing  the
    error to Mr Wright, might have been corrected in time  (without  regard
    to any of the issues that arise from the guidance of Basnet).  In other
    words as Mr Eluwa  pointed  out  in  the  course  of  his  submissions,
    everything in this case flowed from that error.  This is  not  a  point
    based case with its strict requirements prescribed by the  rules.   The
    judge therefore looked again at Mrs Wright's  medical  condition  as  a
    factor that was to be  put  in  the  balance  with  all  other  factors
    including immigration history and those statutory matters  set  out  in
    sections 117A and B and concluded that the balance favoured the  status
    quo namely that Mr Wright should be allowed to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

17. Reading the determination as a whole it does read as if the judge posed
    for himself this simple question,  "Is  it  proportionate  in  all  the
    circumstances to require Mr and Mrs Wright, who  in  the  case  of  Mrs
    Wright is settled in the United Kingdom and  has  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for over ten years and Mr Wright who by  the  time  the  matter
    came before the Tribunal had himself been  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    excess of ten years and almost ten years at the date of the application
    to be required to uproot and start a new life in Jamaica where they had
    no home and no work  or  because  in  reality  a  wrong  fee  had  been
    submitted in circumstances in which the Secretary of State had  delayed
    letting them know having regard to all other factors?"

18. It is not for me to decide whether I would have determined  the  matter
    differently, it is for me  to  decide  whether  having  regard  to  the
    guidance in R (Iran) the decision taken by this judge was open to  him.
    In my view it clearly was.  There is nothing perverse or irrational  in
    the approach taken.  It was open to the judge  to  look  to  the  wider
    application of Article 8.

Notice of Decision

19. In all the circumstances the appeal is dismissed and  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.
