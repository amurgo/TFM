                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier Tribunal composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brennells  and
        Dr P L Ravenscroft (hereinafter referred to  as  'the  Panel')  who
        dismissed the appellant's appeal against an  order  to  deport  him
        from the United  Kingdom  under  both  the  Immigration  Rules  and
        Article 8 ECHR.


     2. Permission to appeal was granted generally by Upper Tribunal  Judge
        Southern on 1st July 2013 following  a  refusal  of  permission  to
        appeal by another judge of the Upper Tribunal having  been  quashed
        by the High Court.


     3. It was conceded by Mr Deller that the Panel had  erred  in  law  in
        relation to  their  consideration  of  paragraphs  397-400  of  the
        Immigration Rules. If this is  the  case  their  dismissal  of  the
        appeal under Article  8,  which  turned  upon  the  proportionality
        issue, may be directly  affected  too.  We  set  the  determination
        aside. There is no challenge to the factual findings which shall be
        preserved.



Discussion



     4. The appellant was born on the 16th November 1988 and is  a  citizen
        of Trinidad and Tobago. He entered the United Kingdom as a  visitor
        with his mother in June 1994 and was granted  indefinite  leave  to
        remain on 26th April 2005.


     5. The appellant is the subject of the deportation order as  a  result
        of his conviction on  the  9th  December  2011  of  an  offence  of
        possessing a Class B drug, Cannabis,  with  intent  to  supply  for
        which he received a 22 month custodial sentence.


     6. A number of documents were presented to the Panel at the hearing on
        11th December 2012.  They  included  witness  statements  from  the
        appellant, his mother and other  family  members.  In  outline  the
        appellant has not returned to his home state since arriving in  the
        United Kingdom and the only evidence of  family  connections  there
        was from his mother who stated that she only returned to arrange  a
        divorce from her then  husband.    She  stayed  with  her  mother's
        sister who is a 65 year old pensioner with  her  own  children  and
        grandchildren who would not be able to care for the appellant if he
        was returned. They are said not to be very close. The  evidence  is
        that the appellant left Trinidad & Tobago  aged  five  and  has  no
        recollection of life there and no family that he is close  to,  who
        will be able to care for him.


     7. Having considered  this  evidence  the  Panel  made  the  following
        finding at paragraph 17 of the determination:


              17. Although aged 23 at the time of his arrest, the  Appellant
   was still               living  with  his  mother  and  siblings  in  his
   mother's house. He was                unemployed and has few  educational
   qualifications. Should he be                  permitted to remain in  the
   United Kingdom he would like to study                  on a  Construction
   Course which he hopes would enable him to                       obtain  a
   job.   He  has  said  nothing  in  his  evidence  as   to   any   private
   life which  he  has  developed  apart  from  his  relationship  with  his
     girlfriend. He came to the United Kingdom  at  a  very  early  age  and
     most of his formative  years  have  been  spent  here.  We  accept  the
     evidence he presented  which  shows  that  whilst  he  does  have  some
     relatives living in Trinidad and Tobago, they are unlikely to be  in  a
          position to assist him to  find  work  and  accommodation  on  his
   return.                 He is fit and healthy.


     8. Both parties agreed that the  central  issue  in  this  appeal  was
        whether or not the appellant had sufficient ties  to  Trinidad  and
        Tobago so as to meet or fail to meet  that  requirement  under  the
        Immigration Rules.  Mr Nicholson on behalf of the appellant invited
        us to consider the issue upon the evidence already  submitted.   He
        invited us  to  find  that  in  reality  there  were  no  ties  and
        accordingly invited us to allow  the  appeal  on  that  basis.   Mr
        Deller, whilst recognising that the  evidential  basis  was  finely
        balanced, relied upon the approach taken in the reasons as set  out
        by the Secretary of State for refusing to implement paragraph  399A
        in this case.


     9. The Secretary of State, in her  notification  of  the  reasons  for
        deportation, [R's bundle pages N5-8] considered paragraph 399A  and
        states:


              Paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules defines  the  criteria
   which must              be satisfied before an individual's private  life
   outweighs the public                  interest  in  deportation  in  line
   with Article 8 of the ECHR.


              Paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules requires that each  of
   the criteria            contained within it be satisfied.


                  (a)  it is accepted that you have  lived  continuously  in
   the  UK  for  at                     least  half  your  life  immediately
   preceding the date of the                           immigration  decision
   (discounting any period of                             imprisonment) and


                  (b)  it is not  considered  that  there  are  no  ties  to
   Trinidad & Tobago                     to which you will be deported.


              It should be noted that English is the  official  language  of
   Trinidad &                   Tobago, therefore this will not be a barrier
   to removal. It has also  been               noted  that  you  mother  has
   previously returned to Trinidad & Tobago  to             visit  relatives
   there.  Therefore,  by  returning  you   to   Trinidad   &   Tobago   and
   with the assistance of your relatives you would be able to re-adjust  and
   re-            integrate into the family network that still exists.


    10. The ability to speak the language and the presence  of  family  has
        been held not to be the correct test in cases of  this  nature.  In
        Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60  (IAC),  at
        paragraphs 123-125, it was held:




              123.    The natural and ordinary meaning of  the  word  'ties'
    imports, we think, a            concept involving something  more  than
    merely remote and abstract links             to the country of proposed
    deportation or removal. It involves there being            a  continued
    connection  to  life  in  that   country;   something   that   ties   a
     claimant to his or her country of origin. If this were  not  the  case
    then it           would appear  that  a  person's  nationality  of  the
    country of proposed                 deportation could of itself lead to
    a failure to meet the requirements of the             rule. This  would
    render   the   application   of   the   rule,   given    the    context
    within which it operates, entirely meaningless.

              124.    We recognise that the  text  under  the  rules  is  an
    exacting one.                       Consideration of whether  a  person
    has 'no ties' to such  country  must                involve  a  rounded
    assessment of all the relevant circumstances and is  not             to
    be  limited   to   'social,   cultural   and   family'   circumstances.
    Nevertheless,              we are satisfied that the appellant  has  no
    ties with Nigeria. He is a                   stranger to  the  country,
    the people, and the way of life. His father may           have ties but
    they are not ties of the  appellant  or  any  ties  that  could  result
     in support to  the  appellant  in  the  event  of  his  return  there.
    Unsurprisingly,             given  the  length   of   the   appellant's
    residence here, all  of  his  ties  are  with               the  United
    Kingdom.  Consequently  the  appellant   has   so   little   connection
    with  Nigeria  so  as  to  mean  that  the  consequences  for  him   in
    establishing           private life there at the age of  28,  after  22
    years  residence   in   the   United              Kingdom,   would   be
    'unjustifiably harsh'.

               125.     Whilst  each  case   turns   on   its   own   facts,
    circumstances relevant to the                assessment  of  whether  a
    person has ties to the country to  which  they                    would
    have to go if they were required  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  must
     include, but are not limited to: the length of time a person has spent
    in the            country to which he would  have  to  go  if  he  were
    required to leave the           United Kingdom, the age that the person
    left that country, the exposure              that person has had to the
    cultural norms of that country, whether that              person speaks
    the  language  of  the  country,  the  extent  of   the    family   and
    friends that person has in the country to which he is being deported or
              removed and the quality of the relationships that person  has
    with those             friends and family members.

    11. The findings of fact in paragraph 17 of the  Panel's  determination
        have not been challenged by the Secretary of State.  Those  finding
        in any event fairly reflect the evidence as presented.  We  do  not
        find that the appellant has any relevant ties so as to  defeat  the
        operation of the Immigration Rules.  Given the concession that  the
        appellant has lived continuously in the United Kingdom for at least
        half his life immediately preceding the  date  of  the  immigration
        decision. The appeal must be allowed on the basis of the  Secretary
        of State's own assessment of what is proportionate.


Decision

    12. The Immigration Judge materially erred in law.  We  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Immigration Judge. We remake the  decision
        as follows. This appeal is allowed.














   Anonymity.


    13. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          We make no such order as there was no application for the same and
   no             justification for such an order is proved.
