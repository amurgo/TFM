                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The Appellant appeals the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Callow
    promulgated on 30 November 2015 ("the Decision") dismissing his  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision dated 19 November 2014  refusing  him
    entry clearance as the partner of Ms Ghuman ("the Sponsor")  who  is  a
    British citizen present and settled in  the  UK.   The  Sponsor  has  a
    number of children from a  previous  marriage  who  were  aged  between
    fifteen and twenty-five years at the date of the appeal hearing.  Those
    children include the Sponsor's disabled child in relation to  whom  the
    Sponsor is entitled to and receives carer's allowance.

 2. The Judge accepted that the relationship between the Appellant and  the
    Sponsor is genuine and subsisting ([13] of the Decision).  However, the
    Respondent refused the application also on the ground that the  Sponsor
    could not show a sufficient  income  to  satisfy  the  requirement  for
    adequate  maintenance  and  accommodation.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted on the  basis  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  set  out  the
    calculations relied upon as  showing  that  the  Sponsor's  income  was
    insufficient.  The appeal comes before  me  to  determine  whether  the
    Decision contains a material error of law and, if I so find, to  either
    re-make the Decision or  remit  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-
    hearing.

Submissions

 3. Mr Bajwa submitted that the Sponsor is exempt from the  requirement  to
    satisfy the minimum income requirement of �18,600 set out in the  poast
    2012 Immigration Rules and that this is determinative  of  the  appeal.
    He relied on E-ECP.3.3(a) of Appendix  FM  and  pointed  out  that  the
    Sponsor is in receipt of carer's allowance and so is exempt  from  that
    requirement.  As First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  pointed  out  when
    refusing permission to appeal, though, that  is  not  the  issue.   The
    issue is that identified at [14] of the Decision as follows:-

         "As to the financial requirements however, the appellant has failed
         to discharge the responsibility that rests with him.  While  it  is
         obviously accepted that the payment of a Carer's Allowance  exempts
         the appellant from providing  specified  evidence  of  a  specified
         gross annual income of at least �18,600, it has not been shown that
         the sponsor is  able  to  maintain  and  accommodate  herself,  the
         appellant and the sponsor's dependants adequately in the UK without
         recourse to public  funds  as  at  the  date  of  the  respondent's
         decision.  No mention was made  of  this  issue  in  the  sponsor's
         statement prepared for the purpose of the hearing and which was not
         addressed  in  her  evidence  in  chief.  The   sponsor,   as   was
         acknowledged by Mr Bajwa, is totally reliant on public funds.   She
         is  Zarqa's  carer.    Mr   Lowdon's   [the   presenting   officer]
         calculations showing that the sponsor fell woefully  short  of  the
         required minimum to satisfy the  rule  in  question  had  not  been
         countered and were correct."

    Paragraph E-ECP.3.3(b)  provides  that  in  addition  to  demonstrating
    exemption by showing receipt of the relevant  allowance  the  applicant
    "must provide evidence that their  partner  is  able  to  maintain  and
    accommodate themselves, the applicant and any dependants adequately  in
    the UK without recourse of public funds".

 4. I invited Mr Bajwa on a number of occasions to point me to the evidence
    which he said showed the adequacy of monies available to the Sponsor to
    adequately maintain the Appellant in addition to continuing to  finance
    her other existing obligations.  He referred me to the large number  of
    bank statements in the bundle but did not direct my  attention  to  any
    particular figures.  He submitted that the  Sponsor  has  accommodation
    available to her and therefore the Appellant would have a roof over his
    head.  That does not though deal  with  the  maintenance  element.   He
    submitted that the Appellant would not in any event  have  recourse  to
    public funds as he would not be  entitled  to  benefits.   That  though
    ignores the question of whether the Sponsor would be  able  to  support
    the Appellant without any increased reliance on public funds  which  is
    the relevant test.  Mr Bajwa also  submitted  that  the  Appellant  has
    skills as a qualified mechanic and so could be expected to find  a  job
    on arrival which would provide  adequate  income  to  support  himself.
    There is though no evidence of a job offer.  He may be lucky enough  to
    find a job very swiftly following arrival but that remains speculative.
    The Respondent  and  the  Judge  were  entitled  (indeed  required)  to
    consider the Appellant's circumstances on the evidence before them.

 5. I also directed Mr Bajwa's attention to calculations  which  appear  on
    the file which appear to set out the Sponsor's income.   Mr  Bajwa  did
    not  dispute  those  calculations.  Indeed  they  appear  to   be   the
    calculations which he presented to Judge Callow. Those  show  that  the
    Sponsor is in receipt of a weekly figure  of  �185.38  broken  down  as
    follows:-

         "Child benefit         �20.70
         Carers allowance  �62.10
         Child tax credit       �57.58
         Income support         �45"

    The Sponsor also has her council tax paid by the local authority.

 6. Mr Kotas accepted that it would have been preferable for the  Judge  to
    have set out the Presenting Officer's calculations with some detail  of
    what was meant by "woefully short".  He pointed out  however  that  the
    burden is on the Appellant to show that the Sponsor has adequate  funds
    available to her to maintain him, herself and her other dependants.  He
    referred me to the income support figures which are generally viewed as
    a yardstick for the adequacy of maintenance and which  would  apply  on
    the facts of this case.  Those are:-

         "Couple                    �113.70
         Dependent child                 �66.33
         Family/lone parent premium      �17.45
         Disabled child                  �59.50
         Carer                           �34.20"

    That gives a total of �291.18 per week.  He  therefore  submitted  that
    even if the failure to provide reasons were an error, it would  not  be
    material.

 7. In reply, Mr Bajwa submitted that if the Judge had in mind the  minimum
    income threshold when determining the issue of adequacy of maintenance,
    this too would be an error as the Sponsor is exempt. However, there  is
    no reference in the Decision to that threshold and  it  is  clear  from
    [14] of the Decision as set out at [3] above, that the  Judge  accepted
    that this threshold does not apply.

    Decision and reasons

 8. It is common ground that the Sponsor is exempt from the requirement  to
    show that she has access to �18,600 as a minimum income  (paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.3(a) of the Rules).  However, the Appellant is still  obliged  to
    show that the Sponsor has adequate funds to  maintain  and  accommodate
    him.  I  accept  Mr  Kotas'  submission  that  the  burden  is  on  the
    Appellant.

 9. I accept  also,  as  Mr  Kotas  submitted,  that  it  would  have  been
    preferable if the Judge had set out at  least  the  basic  calculations
    which led him to the decision that the Sponsor's income  was  "woefully
    short".  Even if that amounts  to  an  error  of  law,  however,  there
    remains an issue of materiality.  If the evidence and any  calculations
    in fact show that the Judge was correct in that view,  there  would  be
    little point in the appeal  proceeding  further.   This  is  an  appeal
    against an entry clearance decision and as such Judge  Callow  (and  I)
    could not take  into  account  evidence  post-dating  the  Respondent's
    decision (section 85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002).  I turn therefore to consider the issue of materiality.

10. The case law in place prior to the introduction of the  minimum  income
    threshold in July 2012, encapsulated in the decision of KA  and  others
    (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00065,  applies  the
    yardstick of the  income  support  which  would  be  available  to  the
    Appellant and Sponsor as well as any other dependants if the  Appellant
    were permitted to enter.  The  wording  of  E-ECP.3.3(b)  is  virtually
    identical to that in paragraph 271 of the previous rules which governed
    the entry of those seeking to come to the  UK  as  a  spouse  or  civil
    partner. I can see no reason, therefore, why that would not still apply
    to E-ECP.3.3(b) and nor did Mr Bajwa make any submissions that  it  did
    not.  Insofar as that remains the appropriate test, I have already  set
    out the calculation as to the level of income support which would apply
    in this case at [6] above.  By way of comparison with  the  figures  at
    [5] above, it is evident that there is a substantial  gap  between  the
    two totals.

11. In any event, the onus is on the Appellant and the Sponsor to show that
    there is adequate maintenance.  Even if income support were  no  longer
    the yardstick, the Sponsor's bank statements  on  which  the  Appellant
    relies do not explain how the Sponsor  would  have  sufficient  income.
    The Sponsor's witness evidence does not deal with this issue.  The bank
    statements show frequently low balances.  There  are  also  unexplained
    credits, often of quite large amounts (which may be from the  Sponsor's
    children).  In order for the Appellant to succeed,  the  Sponsor  would
    need to show how her  income  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  additional
    maintenance obligation which  the  Appellant's  arrival  would  create.
    Alternatively, the Appellant would need to show by proper evidence that
    he has a job to come to on arrival which would  cover  his  maintenance
    and thus avoid that issue.  Whatever may  be  the  position  in  future
    applications, however, the position in relation to this application  is
    that the evidence does not show that the Appellant  can  meet  rule  E-
    ECP.3.3(b) and the Judge was right so to find.  Any error in failing to
    set out the calculations therefore is immaterial.

Decision
I am satisfied that  the  Decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
contain a material error of law.  The Decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
Callow promulgated on 30 November 2015 dismissing the Appellant's appeal  is
therefore maintained.
