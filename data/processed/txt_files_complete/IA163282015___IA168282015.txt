Officer.
For the Respondents:   Mr H Ndbuisi, instructed by Drummond Miller
Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These two appeals raise similar issues and the representatives are  the
    same.  We heard them together.

The facts

 2. Mr Thapa ("the first claimant") appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against the decision of the respondent on 22 April 2015 to  refuse  his
    application for further leave and to remove him from the United Kingdom
    by way of directions  under  s.  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 3. The first claimant came to the United Kingdom on 24 September 2009 as a
    student.  His leave to remain as a student was extended and was due  to
    expire on 13 January 2015.   On  13  August  2014  the  first  claimant
    applied for further leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, that is to say
    as an employed person.  The application was  made  on  the  appropriate
    form, referring to a certificate of sponsorship, and was accompanied by
    the  usual  declaration,  signed  by  him.    On   investigation,   the
    certificate of sponsorship, that is to say the proof that he  had  been
    offered a job, was found to be false.  The  application  was  therefore
    refused and, in addition, it was refused under paragraph 322(1A) of the
    Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 (as  amended),  which
    reads as follows:

           "322.
           ...
           Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter
           or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused.
           ...
           (1A)  Where  false  representations  have  been  made  or  false
           documents or information have been  submitted  (whether  or  not
           material  to  the  application,  and  whether  or  not  to   the
           applicant's  knowledge),  or  material  facts  have   not   been
           disclosed, in relation to the application or in order to  obtain
           documents from the Secretary of State or a third party  required
           in support of the application. "

 4. The first claimant appealed against the Secretary of State's  decision.
    He did not seek to challenge  the  refusal  of  his  application.   His
    grounds of appeal were as follows:

           "Appellant appeals against the para 322 refusal.  Appellant  did
           not intend to deceive.  He is victim of  a  scam.   Decision  is
           contrary to law and article 8 ECHR."

 5. His evidence was that he paid �9,500 to a person  called  Anand  Kumar,
    who said he was acting as a recruitment consultant, to obtain a job for
    him so that he could remain in the United Kingdom having decided not to
    complete his studies.  He had, apparently, made  no  other  attempt  to
    obtain a job in the United Kingdom.  He had not himself had any contact
    with the hotel, employment by which was the basis  of  his  application
    for leave.  He said that he had reported to the police what he  claimed
    was a fraud upon himself, but there  was  no  other  information  about
    that.

 6. Judge Montgomery  concluded  on  balance  of  probabilities  that  "the
    appellant had been conned into believing that he had secured a job,  as
    opposed to having deliberately bought a 'package' which included  false
    documents.  I consider that it is more likely that he has been gullible
    rather than dishonest".  He therefore found that the Secretary of State
    had failed to prove dishonesty, and allowed the appeal insofar  as  the
    decision related to paragraph 322, although of course dismissing it  in
    substance.

 7. Miss Patel ("the second claimant") appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal
    against a decision of 22 April 2015 refusing  to  vary  her  leave  and
    deciding to remove her by way of directions under s.  47  of  the  2006
    Act.  She first came to the United Kingdom on 23 September  2009  as  a
    student.  She had further leave as a student and then as a Tier 1 (Post
    Study) Migrant until 21 August 2014.  On  11  July  2014  she  made  an
    application for further leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, that is to
    say as an  employed  person.   She  used  the  appropriate  form,  with
    supporting documents including a certificate of sponsorship, and signed
    the  usual  declaration.   On   investigation,   her   certificate   of
    sponsorship was found to  be  false.   The  application  was  therefore
    refused in substance and, in addition, under paragraph 322(1A) for  the
    same reasons as in the case of the first claimant.

 8. The second claimant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Like  the
    first claimant, she did not challenge the substantive refusal, but only
    the reason under paragraph 322(1A).  The grounds of appeal, drafted  by
    her solicitor, are as follows:

        "(1) The decision is contrary to law the appellant has  not  breach
             Immigration rule 322(1A)
          (2) The decision represents a breach of A8 of ECHR"

 9. When the matter  came  before  Judge  Boyd  the  second  claimant  gave
    evidence that she had approached a recruitment agency called G S Patel,
    via another agency, Amita Solutions, run by a Mr J Patel.  She had paid
    �7,500 in order to obtain the offer of employment with  M  Peal  Retail
    Ltd in London.  She had had no contact with M Peal Retail Ltd  herself,
    although she had had a telephone interview with Mr G S Patel.  She said
    that she had no idea that she had been defrauded, but after the refusal
    she went to the police and was told that the agency is  known  to  have
    been involved in a scam.  Judge Boyd concluded that as she did not know
    the certificate of sponsorship was false  she  did  not  knowingly  use
    deception in her application, and accordingly  allowed  the  appeal  in
    respect of paragraph 322(1A) only.

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. In both cases the Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision.  In the case  of  the  first  claimant,  the
    ground of appeal is simply that the certificate of sponsorship  was  in
    any event a false document.  In the case of the  second  claimant,  the
    appeal is on the basis that the judge had failed to give any reason for
    his conclusion that, despite her being "reasonably bright" she had  not
    knowingly used deception, and, in addition, that no reason is given for
    the apparent conclusion that she did not use a false  document  in  her
    application.

11. We heard submissions from Mr Matthews on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State and from Mr Ndbuisi on behalf  of  both  claimants.   Mr  Ndbuisi
    referred us in particular to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  AA
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773, where Rix LJ, given  the  leading
    judgement, said at [78]:


          "Dishonesty or deception is needed, albeit not necessarily that of
          the applicant himself, to render a "false representation" a ground
          for mandatory refusal."

12. Mr Ndbuisi's submission was that  the  decisions  of  the  judges  were
    wholly defensible on that basis.

Decision

13. It seems to us that the law in this area is perfectly plain.  There  is
    no doubt that the certificates of sponsorship were both entirely false.
     False documents  were  submitted.   That  is  a  ground  of  mandatory
    refusal.  Indeed in paragraph 67 of AA Rix LJ deals  specifically  with
    false documents, and reaches a conclusion wholly disadvantageous to the
    claimants:

          "[67] "False representation" is aligned in the  rule  with  "false
          document".  It is plain that a false document is one that tells  a
          lie about itself.  Of course it is possible for a person  to  make
          use of a false document ... in total ignorance of its falsity  and
          in perfect honesty.  But the document itself is dishonest.  It  is
          highly likely therefore  that  where  an  applicant  uses  in  all
          innocence a false document for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  entry
          clearance, or leave to enter or remain, it is because  some  other
          party, it might be a parent, or sponsor, or agent, has dishonestly
          promoted the use of that document.  The response of a  requirement
          of  mandatory  refusal  is  entirely  understandable  in  such   a
          situation.  The mere fact that a dishonest document has been  used
          for such an important application is understandably  a  sufficient
          reason for a mandatory refusal.  That is why  the  rule  expressly
          emphasises that it applies "whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's
          knowledge".

14.  It  follows  that  both  applications  were  correctly  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A).  We do not need to enter  into  the  other  evidence
    given at the First-tier Tribunal hearings, but we are inclined to agree
    with the suggestion implicitly made on behalf of the Secretary of State
    that the judge's conclusions bordered on irrationality.  Both claimants
    have lived in the United Kingdom for many years.   Both  claim  not  to
    have been remotely suspicious when asked for a very substantial sum  of
    money in order to secure an offer of a job with an employer  with  whom
    they had no contact themselves.  Their ordinary experience of  life  in
    the United Kingdom must have caused them to know that that is  not  the
    way that the employment market works.

15. The Secretary of  State's  appeals  are  allowed.   We  set  aside  the
    decisions of Judge Montgomery and Judge  Boyd.   The  appeals  of  both
    claimants stand dismissed  under  the  substantive  provisions  of  the
    immigration rules and also under paragraph 322(1A), with  the  relevant
    consequences in relation  to  any  further  applications  made  by  the
    claimants.
