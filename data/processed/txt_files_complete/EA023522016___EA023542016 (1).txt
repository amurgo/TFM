Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Poddar, Counsel for Hamlet Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh born on 15 January  1990  and
    31 July 1994 respectively.  They appealed against the decision  of  the
    respondent dated 8 February 2016 refusing to grant  them  each  an  EEA
    residence card.  Their appeals were heard by First-Tier Tribunal  Judge
    Saffer on 13 June  2017.   The  appeals  were  dismissed  for  want  of
    jurisdiction in a decision promulgated on 15 June 2017.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Chamberlain on 23  November
    2017.  The permission states that subsequent  to  the  application  for
    permission to appeal being made, the Court of Appeal held in  the  case
    of Khan [2017] AWCA Civ 1755 that a  decision  to  refuse  to  issue  a
    residence card to an extended family member is an EEA decision and thus
    can be appealed to the First-Tier Tribunal in the ordinary way, and  so
    the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear  such  appeals.   Permission  was
    granted on 23 November 2017.

 3. There is a Rule 24 response by the respondent dated 24  December  2017.
    This states that although the Court of Appeal in the said case of  Khan
    has overturned the case of Sala [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC)  which  states
    that there is no statutory right of appeal against the decision of  the
    Secretary of State not to grant a residence card to a  person  claiming
    to be an extended family member, permission has  been  sought,  in  the
    case of Khan, to appeal to the Supreme Court and the  Court  of  Appeal
    has imposed a stay on the effect of the Judgement, pending the  outcome
    of  that  application.   The  same  point  is  also  being   considered
    separately by the Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) which was heard at  the
    end of November 2017.  The respondent contends that Sala still  remains
    good law.  The respondent therefore seeks that this appeal be adjourned
    and  not  listed  until  the  outcome  of  the  above  application  for
    permission to appeal is decided or the Supreme Court's decision  in  SM
    in promulgated.

 4. The Rule 24 response goes on to state that it is  trite  law  that  the
    First-Tier Tribunal has no  jurisdiction  to  consider  the  Article  8
    element of the appellants' appeal  and  the  case  of  Amirteymour  -v-
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  353  is
    quoted.

The Hearing

 5. The Tribunal's position is that all cases based on  the  said  case  of
    Sala which have   been dismissed through want of jurisdiction are to be
    remitted to the First-Tier Tribunal.  As this  is  the  policy  of  the
    Tribunal I direct that  this  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal and that an adjournment is not granted for the reasons  quoted
    by the respondent.

Notice of Decision

 6. I direct that the decision of the First-Tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.
    None of its findings are to stand other than as a record  of  what  was
    said  on  that  occasion.   It  is  appropriate  in  terms  of  Section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit  the
    case to the First-Tier Tribunal for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The members of the First-Tier Tribunal chosen to consider the case  are
    not to include First-Tier Tribunal Judge Saffer.

 8. Anonymity has not been directed.




Signed                                  Date 23rd March 2018
