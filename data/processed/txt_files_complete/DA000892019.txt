                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cohen, promulgated on  11  November  2019.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Resident Judge Appleyard.

Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now.

Background

 3. The respondent states that he arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  during
    September 2013. He was issued with an EEA Registration  Certificate  on
    30 June 2016. EEA Residence Cards were issued to the respondent's  non-
    EEA national spouse and child on 22 May 2017. On 7 November  2017,  the
    respondent was convicted of two money laundering offences, amounting to
    a sum of ï¿½238,000, in connection with allowing his business to be  used
    to launder proceeds from a fraudulent business  which  sold  overpriced
    vitamins and supplements  to  elderly  and  vulnerable  customers.  The
    offences took place between 1 December 2015 and 30 September  2016.  He
    was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment on 8 November 2017.

 4. On 6 February 2019, the  Secretary  of  State  decided  to  deport  the
    respondent under section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. It  is  this
    decision which is under challenge. Essentially, the Secretary of  State
    was  of  the  view  that  the  respondent  had  provided   insufficient
    documentary evidence of continuously  residing  and  exercising  Treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom for 5 years. It was  considered  that  the
    respondent posed a risk of re-offending and  of  causing  harm  to  the
    public and that he represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the public, justifying his deportation on the grounds
    of public policy. The respondent's Article 8  claim  was  also  refused
    owing to an absence of very compelling circumstances  which  outweighed
    the public interest in his deportation.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  found  that  the  respondent  had  been
    continuously residence  in  the  UK,  exercising  Treaty  rights  since
    September 2013 and concluded that he had achieved permanent  residence.
    The judge found that the respondent's  removal  was  not  justified  on
    serious grounds of public policy or security and allowed the appeal  on
    that basis as well as under Article 8 ECHR.

The grounds of appeal

 6. It was argued, firstly, that the First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for findings on a material matter. It was  noted  that
    the respondent could not have acquired a permanent right of  residence,
    having arrived in the UK only 4 years prior to being sentenced in  2017
    and therefore the Tribunal  had  identified  the  incorrect  threshold.
    Furthermore, it was argued that the  judge  had  failed  to  adequately
    assess the seriousness of  the  offending,  that  the  judge  erred  in
    distinguishing this case from the claimant in Tsakouridis and that  his
    findings as to the extent of the current threat posed by the respondent
    were flawed.

 7. It was further argued that the judge paid inadequate  scrutiny  to  the
    respondent's claimed rehabilitation and also that the judge  was  wrong
    to consider this case under Article 8  of  the  ECHR,  applying  Badewa
    (ss117A-D and EEA Regulations) [2015] UKUT 00329.

 8. On 11 December 2019, Resident Judge Appleyard considered this  decision
    to be one which he could set aside, subject to representations, because
    the respondent had "manifestly"  not  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence in the UK.  Having seen no representations,  the  matter  was
    set aside on 7 January 2020. Resident Judge  Appleyard  set  aside  his
    aforementioned decision on 15 January 2020 as it  transpired  that  the
    respondent objected  to  this  course  of  action.  He  also  took  the
    opportunity to grant permission to  appeal  for  the  reasons  he  gave
    previously.

 9. The respondent's Rule 24 response was provided during the  hearing  and
    in it, it was accepted that the judge misdirected  himself  as  to  the
    level of protection applicable. It was  contended  that  this  was  not
    material to the outcome of the appeal because the risk criteria did not
    merit deportation on even general grounds because  the  respondent  did
    not commit the most  heinous  of  crimes  and  the  judge  reached  his
    findings as to rehabilitation based on  the  evidence.  Permission  was
    sought  to  admit  a  bundle  of  additional  evidence  which  was  not
    previously before the Tribunal.

The hearing

10. Mr Lindsay relied on the grounds of appeal,  except  for  paragraph  11
    which referred to Badewa. He clarified  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted that in this case where a one-stop notice had been  completed,
    it was open to the Tribunal to consider Article 8. Otherwise, he argued
    that the judge's incorrect  identification  of  the  correct  threshold
    would affect his proportionality findings. Mr Lindsay  emphasised  that
    the respondent received a sentence of 4 years imprisonment and he would
    therefore need to show that there were  very  compelling  circumstances
    involved.  The judge made a  clear  and  obvious  error  regarding  his
    assessment of the Regulations. It was accepted in the Rule 24  response
    that the respondent cannot show that he is permanently resident in  the
    UK. Furthermore, his imprisonment broke  his  residency.   This  was  a
    material error. While it might have been open to the Tribunal  to  find
    that the respondent posed a low risk of reoffending, he  posed  a  real
    risk to the public and there was a not negligible risk of causing  very
    real public harm. The outcome of the appeal might have  been  different
    had the judge not erred.

11. Ms Nnamani made the following points. The judge made an error of law in
    finding that the respondent had established permanent  residence;  this
    was not an argument advanced on  the  respondent's  behalf.  The  judge
    referred to reports, courses, the support network of the wife and  son,
    low risk of  reoffending  and  of  harm  and  that  the  respondent  is
    remorseful. The judge was entitled to note that the respondent had good
    prospects for continued rehabilitation and that there  were  protective
    factors as set in the reports. While the judge wrongly  concluded  that
    the respondent's deportation was not justified in relation  to  serious
    grounds he considered that he was integrated in the UK, it was a single
    offence and conviction, there was a low risk of  reconviction  and  low
    risk of harm. In  response  to  my  query  as  to  how  this  could  be
    considered a single offence, Ms Nnamani accepted that the offences took
    place over a period of months but contended that the respondent  merely
    had suspicions rather than knowledge of relevant matters.   Ms  Nnamani
    asked me to note that the respondent received a small payment  and  all
    the money he received was confiscated. In  terms  of  materiality,  she
    argued that the Secretary of State had not shown  that  the  respondent
    posed a threat or that it was proportionate to deport him, and  it  was
    not justified to set aside the entire determination.

12. In response, Mr Lindsay argued that the respondent's conduct  had  been
    mischaracterised as omissions, whereas it was plain that the conviction
    was for positive acts on his part. It was  proven  by  the  prosecution
    that the respondent was suspicious  that  his  course  of  conduct  was
    contributing to a criminal enterprise. Secondly,  applying  Dumliauskas
    [2015] EWCA Civ 145, rehabilitation could not be a  weighty  factor  in
    the absence of a permanent right of residence.

13. At the end of the hearing, I concluded  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    made a material error of law in applying the  incorrect  threshold  and
    set aside the decision in its entirety.

Decision on error of law

14. It is not in contention that the respondent had not acquired  permanent
    residence in the United Kingdom. It is clearly an error for  the  judge
    to find that he did in  circumstances  where  it  ought  to  have  been
    obvious that the respondent had not even been present in the UK  for  5
    years prior to his imprisonment. Indeed, no such argument was ever  put
    on the respondent's behalf. There is no support in the decision for the
    contention that had the judge applied  the  correct  test,  the  result
    would have been the same. At [31] onwards,  the  judge  made  repeated,
    detailed,  references  to  evidence  pointing   to   the   respondent's
    rehabilitation and his conclusions relied heavily on it. The  following
    was said in Dumliauskas at [54]: "I do not consider that in the case of
    an offender with no permanent right  of  residence  substantial  weight
    should be given to rehabilitation." In this case, the judge's  findings
    demonstrate that substantial weight was given to this issue. Therefore,
    I do not accept that the outcome of the appeal would have been the same
    even without the error as to the correct threshold.

15. While mindful  of  statement  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements of 10 February 2010, it is the case that there has yet to be
    an adequate consideration of this appeal at the First-tier Tribunal and
    it would be unfair to  deprive  either  party  of  such  consideration.
    Furthermore, the respondent wishes to provide further evidence and rely
    on  new  material  which  was  not  previously  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside,  with  no  findings
preserved.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at Taylor House, with a time estimate of 4 hours by any judge except  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Cohen.
