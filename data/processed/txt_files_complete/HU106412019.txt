                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)


This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing  I
reserved my decisions  and  reasons,  which  I  now  give.  The  order  made
is described at the end of these reasons.

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Grenada, with date of  birth  given
    as 15.11.72, has appealed with permission to the Upper Tribunal against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated 24.3.20, dismissing
    her human rights appeal against the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, dated 22.5.19, to refuse her application made  on  4.3.19  for
    entry clearance to the UK as the spouse of  [SD],  a  British  citizen,
    pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. I have carefully considered the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    the light of  the  submissions  and  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The relevant background can be summarised as follows. The appellant  is
    married to [SD],  a  British  citizen.  They  first  met  and  began  a
    relationship in 2016. They married in  the  USA  in  August  2018.  The
    sponsor is the carer for his 90-year-old mother in the UK,  in  respect
    of which he receives Carer's Allowance. He is unemployed  but  receives
    income support, a Council  Tax  reduction,  and  Housing  Benefit.  The
    application  was  refused  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the  appellant  could  meet  the  eligibility  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM or that there would be adequate maintenance
    for the sponsor and the appellant without further  recourse  to  public
    funds. His income was calculated on the formula where  his  net  income
    after deduction of housing costs must meet or exceed the income support
    level of �114.85 per week for a British citizen  family  of  equivalent
    size, with the consequence that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  found  a
    shortfall.

 4. Although the grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  complained
    that the Entry Clearance Officer had miscalculated by including Council
    Tax,  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing  the   appellant's
    representative conceded that there remained a shortfall of  some  �4.55
    per week. It follows that the appellant could not  meet  the  specified
    sources requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE.

 5. In summary, the grounds assert that the judge erred in law  by  failing
    to apply the proper test in paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE, and failed
    to conduct a proper proportionality assessment.

 6. Permission was granted on all grounds by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    on 15.6.20, who considered it arguable that, in  an  otherwise  careful
    and detailed assessment,  the  judge  erred  in  his  consideration  of
    proportionality.

 7. The appellant argued that the shortfall could be met by the  income  of
    the appellant's mother-in-law. In  normal  circumstances,  promises  of
    third-party  financial  support  cannot  count  towards  the  financial
    requirement. However, the grounds as drafted rely on paragraph GEN  3.1
    of  Appendix  FM,  which  provides  an  alternative  where  there   are
    exceptional circumstances. It is submitted that the judge erred in  law
    by not considering whether the decision could result  in  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences but only whether there would be  such  consequences.
    It is argued that the judge applied the incorrect test and that on  the
    facts of the case, including those found by the judge at  [48]  of  the
    decision the circumstances could render refusal a breach of  article  8
    on the basis that it could result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    for the applicant. At [48] the judge  found  that  the  mother-in-law's
    offer of financial support was "genuine, credible and reliable."

 8. GEN 3.1 provides as follows:

         "GEN.3.1.

         (1)      Where:

             (a) the financial  requirement  in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1.,  E-
             LTRP.3.1. (in the context of an application for limited  leave
             to remain as a partner), E-ECC.2.1.  or  E-LTRC.2.1.  applies,
             and is not met from the specified sources referred to  in  the
             relevant paragraph; and

             (b) it  is  evident  from  the  information  provided  by  the
             applicant that there are exceptional circumstances which could
             render refusal of entry clearance or leave to remain a  breach
             of Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
             because such  refusal  could  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
             consequences for the applicant, their partner  or  a  relevant
             child; then

         the decision-maker must consider whether such financial requirement
         is met through taking into account the sources of income, financial
         support or funds set out in  paragraph  21A(2)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
         (subject to the considerations in sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) of that
         paragraph).

         (2)      Where the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP.3.1., E-
         LTRP.3.1. (in the context of an application for  limited  leave  to
         remain as a partner), E-ECC.2.1. or E-LTRC.2.1.  is  met  following
         consideration under sub-paragraph (1) (and provided that the  other
         relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules are also  met),  the
         applicant will be granted entry clearance or leave to remain under,
         as appropriate, paragraph D-ECP.1.2., D-LTRP.1.2., D-ECC.1.1. or D-
         LTRC.1.1. or paragraph 315 or 316B of the Immigration Rules.

 9. It is clear that the judge only considered  would  rather  than  could,
    which, as Ms Norman put it, opens the gateway to consideration of third
    party support. The judge did not consider the  could  or  even  'might'
    aspect. This was an obvious error of law which infected  the  whole  of
    the decision so that it must be set aside.

10. Mr McVeety agreed with  Ms  Norman's  interpretation  of  GEN  3.1  and
    further agreed that on the particular facts of  this  case,  where  the
    sponsor had given up his employment to care for his elderly mother  the
    refusal of the application for a  shortfall  of  less  than  �5,  could
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the  appellant  or  her
    partner so that the judge should have considered the genuine  offer  of
    third-party support. On the facts of this case I am  satisfied  on  any
    view of the circumstances that the appeal should have been allowed.

11. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, I find an error
    of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal so that  it  must  be
    set aside and remade.



Decision

    The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

    I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

    I make no order for costs.

    I make no anonymity direction.
