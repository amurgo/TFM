                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O R Williams promulgated on 23 June 2014 dismissing  her
    appeal against a refusal of an application for leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) under the Points Based System and a  decision  to
    remove her by way of directions under section 47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. The Appellant's case is linked to that of her  husband  Arminder  Singh
    (IA/20287/2014) as they were part of an Entrepreneurial Team  in  their
    Tier 1 applications which were made on different dates and the  subject
    of separate decisions. His case was heard before a different  Judge  on
    another date and has also been appealed and also came before me  today.
    While  there  were  some  common  issues   inevitably   the   decisions
    nevertheless  involved  different  Judges  and  different  grounds  for
    refusal his appeal is the subject of a separate decision.

Background

 4. The Appellant was born on 20 September 1987 and is a national of India.

 5. On 14 November 2013 the Appellant applied for leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.

 6. On 16 January 2014 the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

      a) The application  was  refused  under  paragraph  322  (1A)  of  the
         Immigration  Rules  because  in  support  of  the  application  the
         Appellant submitted a letter from Punjab Bank dated 25 October 2013
         that the Respondent was satisfied was false as they confirmed  with
         the issuing body that they had not issued the letter.

      b) As a result of the Bank letter in respect  of  the  funds  required
         being false the Appellant could not be  awarded  the  those  points
         required in the points scoring  aspect  of  the  application  under
         Appendix  A  and  therefore  the  application  did  not  meet   the
         requirements of paragraph 245DD.

The Judge's Decision

 7.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  appeared
    unrepresented. First-tier Tribunal Judge O  R  Williams  ("the  Judge")
    dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's decision. The Judge:

    (a)    Set out the applicable law in relation to the evidence  that  he
         could consider.

    (b)    Set out the applicable law  in  relation  to  an  allegation  of
         forgery reminding himself that cogent evidence was required  and  a
         bare allegation of forgery was not enough.

    (c)    Set  out  the  relevant  evidence  in  relation  to  documentary
         evidence.

    (d)    He set out in detail the enquiries made  by  the  Respondent  in
         respect of the bank covering letter  in  relation  to  the  account
         ending 804 in her father in law Madna Lal's name purporting to come
         from the Punjab National Bank.

    (e)    He set out the contemporaneous note of the conversation  between
         the UKBA Officer and the Branch Manager Mr N Gulati and  the  faxed
         response from the Punjab National Bank confirming that  the  letter
         in issue was, in essence, not genuine.

    (f)    He heard oral evidence from the Appellant who  claimed  to  have
         spoken to the branch manager in question  who  denied  any  contact
         with UKBA. He found that other than her oral evidence there was  no
         other evidence of this conversation taking place and therefore  she
         preferred the evidence  of  the  Respondent  which  was  documented
         /contemporaneously recorded and he found it was accurate.

    (g)    He accepted that some parts of the letter were true such as  the
         Appellant's father in law having an account in the bank  but  found
         that as the claimed balance was not correct he accepted  the  banks
         assertion that they had not issued the letter.

 8. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that;

    (a)    The Appellant believes that she was only required to  show  that
         she had access to ï¿½50,000 not exactly how much  money  was  in  her
         father in laws account.

    (b)    The bank did not confirm in writing that they did not issue  the
         letter.

    (c)    She produced a letter dated 2 July 2014  from  the  Punjab  bank
         which confirms that the letter dated 24 October 2013 was issued  by
         them.

    (d)    The Judge did not take into account her evidence that her father
         in law went to the bank showed the manager the documents and  asked
         him to print the letter which he did.

 9. On 9 October 2014 First tier Tribunal Judge Chohan  refused  permission
    to appeal. The application was renewed and on  4  December  2014  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Latter gave permission to appeal on the basis  that  the
    Judge arguably failed to take into account relevant evidence.

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from the Appellant that :

      a) There was a document at page 11 of the bundle which  was  from  the
         web page of the Punjab Bank which was placed before the Judge which
         confirmed that the bank manager named in the Document  Verification
         Report was incorrect.

      b) The Punjab Bank had in a letter dated 2 July  2014  confirmed  that
         they had not been contacted by UKBA and this letter was before  the
         Judge.

      c) She relied on the documents and submissions in her bundle.

11. On behalf of the Respondent Ms Johnson submitted that :

      a) The documents being produced today by the Appellant and claimed  to
         have placed before the Judge were not before the decision maker.

      b) Why would the official from the Punjab Bank lie, what motive  would
         he have for claiming that the bank had not  issued  the  letter  in
         question.

The Law

12.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or  giving
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

13. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail  to
    deal with every factual issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
    Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of the evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law. Unless an Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have  taken  no  account  of  evidence  that  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible. Nor is it necessary  to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration judge concludes that the story told is untrue. If  a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Finding on Material Error

14. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.

15. In a well reasoned decision the Judge set out the law that was relevant
    to the central issue in this case which was: did the Appellant submit a
    letter from the Punjab Bank in support of a Tier 1 application that the
    Bank did not issue. This false  letter  underpinned  the  refusal  both
    under paragraph 322 (1A) and the PBS refusal under paragraph 245DD.

16. The Judge set out in detail the contents  of  a  Document  Verification
    Report dated 14 January 2014 14-16 of the decision. He set out both the
    contemporaneous notes of the conversation between the UKBA official  in
    which they confirmed that they did not issue the letter of  24  October
    2013 but also the contents of the written response from the bank  faxed
    to the consular official. He was entitled to conclude in the absence of
    other evidence that this was cogent evidence that the  letter  was  not
    one they had issued although he accepted that some of the contents  may
    have been true, such as the fact that the Appellant's father in law had
    an account at the branch.

17. The Appellant asserted before me that in reaching that  conclusion  the
    Judge fell into error because  he  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence she produced from the bank that the letter was genuine and  no
    such  enquiry  had  been  made  at  the  branch.  Such  evidence  could
    potentially have been considered  in  relation  to  the  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(1A) as that was not limited by section 85(A) in  relation
    to new evidence. The Appellant referred in her grounds of appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal received on 4 July 2014 only to a letter  dated  2  July
    2014 from the bank confirming they had no such  enquiry  was  made  and
    they did issue the letter of October 2013 but as this letter post dated
    the hearing the Judge clearly could not have taken it into account  and
    the Appellant was initially refused permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

18. The Appellant then renewed her application and then suggested that  she
    had submitted grounds of appeal to the First-tier in February 2014 that
    included a copy letter from the bank dated 5 February  2014  confirming
    that the letter of October 2013 was genuine. I note that  there  is  no
    copy of these grounds of appeal in  the  file  nor  has  the  Appellant
    produced any evidence that such grounds were sent to the court and  the
    first reference to a letter of that date is in the renewed  grounds  of
    appeal. I am satisfied that such grounds and the  evidence  purportedly
    included with them were not  before  the  Judge.  The  Judge  makes  no
    reference to the letter in the decision and there is  no  copy  of  the
    letter on file other than that with the renewed grounds of appeal. I am
    satisfied that this evidence was not before the Judge as it also stands
    in stark contrast to the oral evidence of the Appellant recorded by the
    Judge in his written Record of Proceedings:

         "Q: Have you a letter to say Bank manager not spoken to him.

         A: I don't have one- Bank manager said not our  policy  to  verify.
         But he will if phone him."

19. I am therefore satisfied that it was open to the Judge on the  evidence
    before him to conclude as he did:

         "The appellant claims that she had spoken to the branch manager  at
         Rajpura who denied any contact with UKBA.  However,  the  appellant
         has not produced any evidence of  the  telephone  conversation.  On
         balance  I  prefer  the  evidence  of  the   UKBA   since   it   is
         documented/contemporaneously recorded, and so I  accept  it  to  be
         accurate."

20. The Appellant also claimed that the appeal bundle before the First-tier
    which is not on file but is part  of  her  renewed  application  bundle
    (page 11) included a print out  from  Punjab  Banks  website  giving  a
    different  branch  manager  for  the  branch  issuing  the  letter   of
    24.10.2013 to that named in the DVR. However I am satisfied  that  this
    evidence was not before the Judge moreover I note that  the  print  out
    was dated 2015 and could not have been before the Judge and in addition
    there is no indication as to what date  the  individual  named  in  the
    print out became the Manager.

21. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as a
    whole set out findings that were sustainable and sufficiently  detailed
    and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

22. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

23. The appeal is dismissed.
