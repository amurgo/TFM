                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellant  SF,  was  born  in  2004  and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.  He appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Lever)
    against a decision of the Secretary of State dated  10  March  2018  to
    refuse the appellant asylum.  The appellant has been granted  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom until 9 September 2020.  In  his  decision
    letter, the Secretary of State [129] gave  reasons  for  the  grant  of
    discretionary leave to remain:

         I have decided that adequate reception  arrangements  in  your  own
         country are absent at this time.  You have therefore  been  granted
         leave to enter/remain in the United Kingdom.  Your leave ends on  9
         September 2020.  If adequate reception arrangements  are  confirmed
         in your own country before your leave expires, your leave  will  be
         curtailed.  Once your leave to enter or remain ceases  you  may  be
         liable to removal from the United Kingdom unless  you  qualify  for
         leave to enter or remain on other grounds.

 2. The appellant appealed against the decision to refuse him asylum to the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lever) which, in a decision  promulgated  on
    24 May 2018 dismissed the appeal.   The  appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The appellant relies on LQ (Age, Immutable Characteristic)  Afghanistan
    [2008] UKAIT 00005.  The appellant asserts that, as  a  result  of  his
    age, he is a member of a  particular  social  group  and  ought  to  be
    recognised as a refugee for that reason.  The judge, on the other hand,
    took the view that the Refugee  Convention  claim  is  "academic".   At
    [24], Judge Lever wrote:

         Any potential risk to [the  appellant's]  protective  rights  under
         Articles 2/3 [ECHR] were  essentially  subsumed  by  the  fact  the
         appellant  has  been  granted  temporary  leave  to  remain   under
         paragraph 352ZC of the Immigration Rules.  This  is  based  on  the
         fact that the appellant is under the age of 17ï¿½,  is  unaccompanied
         and was not granted either asylum or humanitarian protection by the
         Home Office.  Further it is because there is no adequate  reception
         arrangements in his home country.

 4. The appellant  complains  that,  although  he  has  given  reasons  for
    disposing of the appellant's claim under Articles 2/3 ECHR,  the  judge
    had failed  to  make  a  proper  finding  in  respect  of  the  Refugee
    Convention.  The appellant also relies ST (Child  asylum  seekers)  Sri
    Lanka [2013] UKUT 00292 (IAC).  The appellant relies in  particular  on
    [27]:

         The judge's second error was in respect of  the  material  date  to
         assess risk on return. It is clear that the grant of the status  of
         refugee cannot be evaded by the respondent in  effect  saying  that
         although there is a risk of ill-treatment today, the  Secretary  of
         State proposes to grant discretionary leave  to  remain  until  the
         risk  has  diminished.  Where  an  asylum   claim   is   determined
         substantive and the criteria for the status are  met,  there  is  a
         right to the status, albeit one that can be  made  subject  to  the
         cessation clauses: see LQ (above).

 5. Mr Gobir who appeared for the appellant in the  Upper  Tribunal  relied
    heavily upon ST.  However, by relying upon [27] in isolation  from  the
    remainder of that decision, he has overlooked the fact that in order to
    succeed in a claim for refugee status the appellant  must  still  prove
    that he would be at real risk on return to Afghanistan.  I  acknowledge
    the risk must be assessed now rather than at an unspecified future date
    when the appellant has passed beyond the age of 17.5 years but  I  note
    also that the appellant in ST failed to  persuade  the  Upper  Tribunal
    that, although he was a child at the date of the hearing, he  would  be
    at risk on return.  In ST, the Upper Tribunal went on to find  at  [73]
    that the individual circumstances of  that  appellant  indicated  that,
    notwithstanding his age, he would  not  be  at  risk.   Obviously,  the
    appellant in that case was a citizen of Sri Lanka.   The  Tribunal  had
    regard to the fact that he had family living  in  his  home  state  who
    would assist him on return.  In the instant appeal, the  appellant  has
    been granted discretionary leave to remain because the Home Office  has
    been able to locate his family in Afghanistan.   However,  the  judge's
    findings were that no part of the appellant's account  of  past  events
    could be relied upon.  The judge went on to say at [23] that "given  my
    findings on fact and credibility I do not accept the appellant forms  a
    member of a particular social group either because of his  age  or  any
    other feature of his case."  It follows from the judge's findings  that
    there are no agents, state or otherwise in Afghanistan who  would  seek
    to harm this appellant.  The judge found that the appellant was "not at
    real risk of persecution from either his father, family  or  his  local
    village  generally"  and  that  the  appellant  was  "not  at  risk  of
    persecution for an imputed political opinion."  I have considered  what
    the Upper Tribunal in ST said at [78]:

         Nor are we engaged in the task of requiring the respondent to prove
         precisely the circumstances for his removal and  reception  in  Sri
         Lanka. This would be unnecessary in a case where the issue  is  not
         general welfare assessment on removal but whether the appellant  on
         the known facts is entitled to  refugee  status.  As  a  matter  of
         practicality, it would be absurd to require detailed evidence of  a
         removal plan: which home will the claimant be admitted to, how will
         he get there, who will meet  him  and  the  like  when  it  is  not
         proposed to remove him at all.  We conclude that it  is  sufficient
         for present purposes to note the general legal obligations  on  the
         Secretary of State (that is to say s.55 of the 2009 Act and Article
         3 UNCRC) in the event that the fictional hypothesis  on  which  the
         appeal is predicated were to be implemented.

 6. As  with  the  appellant  in  ST,  Judge  Lever  has  carried  out  the
    hypothetical  assessment  of  whether  the  appellant  has  a   genuine
    subjective fear which is well-founded of persecution  or  ill-treatment
    in Afghanistan.  For the reasons the judge has given,  the  outcome  of
    that hypothetical exercise is that the appellant does not have  such  a
    fear  nor  is  it  well-founded.    That   assessment   satisfies   the
    requirement, as articulated in ST of determining whether the  appellant
    should be given refugee status now rather than  at  some  date  in  the
    future at [27].  As in ST, there was no need for Judge Lever to descend
    to a particular examination of the precise reception facilities for the
    appellant were he to be returned now to Afghanistan.

 7. Mr Gobir advanced a further ground of  appeal  at  the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing.  He referred to Judge Lever's exposition of the  law  relating
    to asylum and the standard of proof required in an asylum  appeal.   At
    [14] Judge Lever wrote:

         In essence, an appellant will have to show  there  are  substantial
         grounds for believing that he is outside his country of nationality
         or if applicable his country of former habitual residence by reason
         of a well-founded fear of  persecution  for  a  Refugee  Convention
         reason and is unable or unwilling  owing  to  such  fear  to  avail
         himself of the protection of that country.

 8. Mr Gobir complained that the judge had not referred  to  "a  reasonable
    degree of likelihood" or "a real risk".  I reject the submission.   The
    articulation of the relevant standard of proof in asylum by Judge Lever
    is in all essentials adequate and accurate.

 9. In conclusion, I find that the judge had not erred in law.  As with the
    Tribunal in ST, the judge has correctly considered whether or not there
    was a real risk of persecution to the appellant existing at the present
    time in Afghanistan.  The judge has categorically decided that there is
    no such risk.  It is clearly possible also to infer  from  the  judge's
    findings of fact that if he is not at real  risk  of  persecution  from
    members of his  family  or  others  in  his  local  village,  then  the
    appellant as a minor would not be living alone at the present  time  in
    Afghanistan but with his family and in his local village.  That finding
    does not require a detailed assessment of how and in what circumstances
    the appellant would  actually  return  to  Afghanistan;  Judge  Lever's
    findings in respect of credibility  are,  as  he  stated,  adequate  to
    dispose of the asylum appeal.
