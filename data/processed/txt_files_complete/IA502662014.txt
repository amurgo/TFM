                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M C Afzal of International Immigration Advisory
Services


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M  J  Gillespie,  promulgated  on  3rd
July 2015 which allowed the Appellant's appeal on article 8 ECHR grounds

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 4 April 1972 and is a national of Rwanda.

4.    On 17 December 2014 the Secretary of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application for leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of a person  present
and settled in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

5.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge M J Gillespie ("the Judge") allowed the  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision on article 8 ECHR grounds only.

6.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and  on  23  September  2015  Designated
Judge Garratt gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    "The grounds are arguable.  It  was  made  clear  in  Forman  (Ss117A-C
    considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412(IAC) the significance of the  factors
    set out in, e.g. section 117B, is that where they are not  present  the
    public interest is fortified. Where they  are  present  that  does  not
    enhance the appellant article 8 claim. In paragraph 16 of the  decision
    the Judge refers to factors  already  considered  under  the  rules  as
    supporting the article 8 claim having, nevertheless, concluded that the
    appellant could not meet the provisions  of  the  rules.  Further,  the
    Judge gives no reasons for concluding that,  in  the  circumstances  of
    this case, it would be wrong  to  the  appellant  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance from outside the United Kingdom."

The Hearing

7.    (a) Ms Fijiwala, for the respondent, drew my attention to the rule  24
response made by the appellant and told me that that contains  a  concession
that the appellant cannot succeed under the rules. The respondent  therefore
relies on the dicta in SS Congo at paragraph 33. Ms Fijawala  told  me  that
compelling circumstances had to be identified before article 8  ECHR  rights
case could competently be considered out-with  the  immigration  rules.  She
told me that the Judge failed to consider whether there were  insurmountable
obstacles to the appellant's return to Rwanda.

(b)   Ms Fijiwal relied on the case of Agyarko, and took me to [17]  of  the
decision;  she  said  that  although  the  judge  considered  the  cases  of
Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 and SSHD v Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA  Civ
1054, the Judge failed to identify the exceptional circumstances  spoken  of
in Agyarko. She argued that there had been inadequate scrutiny of the  facts
and circumstances of the appellant's case and that the Judge had  failed  to
properly consider s.117 of the  2002  Act.  She  argued  that  the  decision
discloses an inadequate proportionality balancing assessment

(c)   Ms Fijiwala relied on the cases of  Forman  (Ss117A-C  considerations)
[2015] UKUT 00412(IAC), AM (Malawi) & Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL  40,  and
urged me to set the decision aside.

8.    Mr Afzal, for  the  appellant,  adopted  the  terms  of  the  rule  24
response, and told me that the decision does  not  contain  errors  of  law,
material or otherwise. He told me  that  the  decision  contains  a  careful
analysis of the evidence, and that the Judge made  findings  of  fact  which
were open to him before reaching a sustainable conclusion.  He  agreed  that
article  8  ECHR  would  only  be  engaged   if   there   were   exceptional
circumstances and argued that that was a  matter  entirely  for  the  Judge;
that the facts and circumstances of this case were such that  the  appellant
was entitled to succeed on article 8 grounds out with the  rules.  He  urged
me to hold the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Analysis

9.    Between [10] and [14] the Judge correctly  considers  the  appellant's
case under the immigration rules and focuses on appendix  FM  and  rule  276
ADE. The Judge correctly concludes that  the  appellant  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of the immigration rules. It is a  matter  of  concession  that
that finding is correct.

10.   At [15] the Judge correctly directs himself  in  law  when  he  states
"... where  the  immigration  rules  provide  a  complete  code  as  to  the
applicability of article 8 relief, there  is  no  need  to  address  further
claim under article 8." The error that the Judge makes is that, in [16]  and
[17] the Judge goes on to consider article 8 out-with  the  rules  and  does
not explain why. The Judge did not make a finding  that  there  are  factors
which require an article 8 assessment out-with the rules.

11.   In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ  387  Lord  Justice  Richards
said at paragraph 33 "In our judgment, even though a test of  exceptionality
does not apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special
contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to
be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new  Rules  in
Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which is not as strict as  a
test of exceptionality or a requirement of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to
foreign criminals), but  which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
consideration  of  public  interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  It  also
reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has been  tested  and
has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g.,  Haleemudeen  at  [44],  per
Beatson LJ".

12.   The judge's error is compounded when  his  proportionality  assessment
amounts to little more than a superficial examination  of  section  117B  of
the 2002 Act. Section 117B(1) dictates that  effective  immigration  control
is in the public interest. The Judge states at 16 "I consider that there  is
no public interest of substance in her removal", but he does not  adequately
explain why the presumption enshrined  in  statute  has  no  effect  in  the
particular facts and circumstances of this case.

13.   I therefore have to find that the  decision  is  tainted  by  material
errors  of  law  because  it  races  to  a  conclusion  without   sufficient
explanation.  As the decision contains material errors  of  law,  I  set  it
aside. There is sufficient evidence before me to enable  me  to  remake  the
decision.



Findings of Fact

14.   The appellant is a national of Rwanda, born on  4  April  1972.  On  6
September 2006 the  appellant  entered  the  UK  as  a  visitor  with  entry
clearance valid until the 3 January 2007. The appellant has remained in  the
UK since September 2006. On 12 July 2007 the appellant applied  for  asylum;
that application was refused by the respondent on 23 August 2007

15.   On 10 June 2011 the appellant applied for leave to remain  in  the  UK
as the unmarried partner of a British citizen. The respondent granted  leave
until 28 September 2014. On 31 March 2013 the  appellant's  British  citizen
partner died.

16.   In March 2014 the appellant met her current partner, who is a  British
citizen.  The  appellant  and  her  partner  maintain  their  own   separate
households, but visit each other when time allows. The appellant lives in  a
flat in London and works as a carer.  She  earns  a  maximum  of  �1500  per
month. The appellant's partner is an HGV driver and maintains his own  house
in Chelmsford. His income is marginally higher than that of the appellant.

17.   The appellant has two adult children who continue to live  in  Rwanda.
The appellant has travelled to Rwanda and visited her children there.

18.   On 23 September 2014  the  appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to
remain  in  the  UK.  On  2  December  2014  the  respondent  refused   that
application. It is against that decision that  the  appellant  appeals.  The
appellant cannot succeed under the Immigration rules. Her appeal relates  to
consideration of article 8 ECHR rights out-with the Immigration Rules.

The Immigration Rules

19.   The rule 24 note for the appellant candidly accepts that  at  [12]  of
the decision the Judge correctly finds that the appellant cannot fulfil  the
requirements of appendix FM. The relationship requirements  set  out  at  E-
LTRP1.10 & E-LTRP1.12 cannot be satisfied, because the  appellant  does  not
live in her partner and because the appellant has never had entry  clearance
as a Fianc�e.

20.   The rule 24  submission  accepts  that  paragraph  276  ADE  (vi)  was
correctly considered by the Judge at [13] & [14], when he found  that  there
were not very significant obstacles to  the  applicant's  re-integration  in
Rwanda. It is common ground that the appellant's adult children continue  to
live in  Rwanda,  and  that  the  appellant  has  visited  them  there.  The
appellant cannot fulfil the requirements of the immigration rules. The  real
focus in this case is on article 8 ECHR.

Article 8 out-with the Immigration Rules.

21.   At paragraph 5 of the rule 24 submission, it is argued that  "...  the
appellant's case is of most  compelling  and  compassionate  circumstances."
What is argued for the appellant is that during her time in the UK  she  has
been widowed and then bereaved (for a second time) by the  sudden  death  of
her partner in 2013. Since then she has established a relationship with  her
new partner. In the UK she has a home & a job. She has lived in the  UK  for
more than nine years now. It is argued that in  Rwanda  the  appellant  does
not have a network of support, and only has two adult children there.

22.   In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v Secretary  of
State for the Home Department (Article 8  -  MM  (Lebanon)  and  Nagre)  IJR
[2014] UKUT 00539 (IAC) it was held that there is nothing  in  R  (Nagre)  v
SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)
[2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) that  suggests  that  a  threshold  test  was  being
suggested as opposed to making it clear that there was a  need  to  look  at
the evidence to see if  there  was  anything  which  has  not  already  been
adequately considered in the context of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  which
could lead to a successful Article 8 claim. These authorities  must  not  be
read as seeking to qualify or fetter the assessment of Article  8.  This  is
consistent with para 128 of R (MM & Others) v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,
that there is no utility in  imposing  a  further  intermediate  test  as  a
preliminary to a consideration of an Article 8  claim  beyond  the  relevant
criterion-based Rule. As is held in R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  2712
(Admin), there is no prior threshold which dictates whether the exercise  of
discretion should be considered; rather the nature  of  the  assessment  and
the  reasoning  which   are   called   for   are   informed   by   threshold
considerations.

23.   Section 117 of the 2002 Act is a factor to be taken  into  account  in
determining proportionality.  I  appreciate  that  as  the  public  interest
provisions are now contained in primary legislation they  override  existing
case law, Section 117A(2) requires me to have regard to  the  considerations
listed in Sections 117B and 117C.  I am conscious of my  statutory  duty  to
take these factors into account when coming to my conclusions.   I  am  also
aware that Section 117A(3) imposes upon  me  the  duty  of  carrying  out  a
balancing exercise. In so doing I remind myself of  the  guidance  contained
within Razgar.

24.   I must ask the following questions

    (i)    Does family life, private life,  home  or  correspondence  exist
    within the meaning of Article 8

    (ii)   If so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with

    (iii)  If so, was the interference in accordance with the law

    (iv)   If so, was the interference in pursuit of one of the  legitimate
    aims set out in Article 8(2); and

    (v)    If so, is the interference proportionate to the pursuit  of  the
    legitimate aim?

25.   The appellant does not have any family members in the  UK.  Her  adult
children live in Rwanda. The appellant's application  was  submitted  on  22
September 2014. That application does not identify her current partner as  a
fianc� or cohabitee. The weight of  reliable  evidence  indicates  that  the
appellant and her partner enjoy a romantic relationship,  but  do  not  live
together. They maintain separate households in separate  towns.  The  notice
and grounds of appeal lodged to challenge the appellant's  decision  do  not
identify the appellant's current partner,  and  place  no  reliance  on  her
relationship with him.

26.   The respondent's decision will either separate the appellant form  her
partner, or force her partner to leave the UK to avoid  separation.   R  (on
the application of Agyarko)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  440  considered  the  phrase
"insurmountable obstacles" as used in  paragraph  EX.1  of  the  Rules.   At
paragraph 26 of that decision "The mere facts that Mr Benette is  a  British
citizen, has lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a job  here  -
and hence might find it difficult and might be  reluctant  to  re-locate  to
Ghana  to  continue  their  family  life  there  -  could   not   constitute
insurmountable obstacles to his doing so."

27.   If family life is established (for  the  appellant)  in  the  UK,  the
problem for the appellant is that the case of Agyarko  is  directly  against
her. The circumstances of the appellant and her partner are similar to  that
of Mr Bennette in the case  of  Agyarko.  It  has  already  been  judicially
determined that the facts and circumstances pled by  the  appellant  do  not
amount to "insurmountable obstacles".

28.   But the appellant and her partner are not members of the same  family.
The appellant's original application was not for  leave  to  remain  on  the
basis that family life is established, but was made as  an  application  for
"Further discretionary leave to remain following the completion of  3  years
discretionary leave to remain".  The  appellant  may  intend  to  marry  her
partner, but she has not yet done so. Family  life  within  the  meaning  of
article 8 ECHR does not exist for the appellant in the UK.

29.   This case really turns on consideration  of  the  appellant's  private
life. Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that immigration control  is  in
the public interest.  The appellant has not always been lawfully in the  UK.
The appellant has had leave to remain in the UK since 2011, but any  private
life the appellant has developed has been whilst her immigration status  was
precarious.  The  appellant  speaks  fluent  English  and   is   financially
independent.

30.   In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT  260  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  held  a
person's immigration status is "precarious" if their continued presence  in
the UK will be dependent upon their obtaining a further grant of leave;  in
some circumstances it may also be that even a person with indefinite  leave
to remain. In Deelah and others (section 117B - ambit)  [2015]  UKUT  00515
(IAC) the Tribunal held that the adjective "precarious" in section  117B(5)
of the 2002 Act does not  contemplate  only,  and  is  not  restricted  to,
temporary admission to the United Kingdom or a grant of leave to remain  in
a category which permits no expectation of a further grant.

31.   In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the Tribunal held that an
appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant of leave to  remain  from
either s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree of his fluency in English,  or
the  strength  of  his  financial   resources.   In   Forman   (ss   117A-C
considerations) [2015] UKUT  00412  (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the  public
interest in firm immigration control is not diluted  by  the  consideration
that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at no time  been  a
financial burden on the state or is self-sufficient or is likely to  remain
so indefinitely.  The significance of these factors is that where they  are
not present the public interest is fortified.

32.   Even though there are factors set out in s.117B which  weigh  in  the
appellant's favour, their effect in the consideration  of  the  appellant's
appeal are neutral.

33.   I must balance the appellant's home in the UK, her  employment  here,
and her intention to marry  a  British  citizen  against  the  respondent's
interest in preserving fair and effective immigration  control  to  protect
this country's fragile economy. In Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT
25 (IAC) it was held that the judgments of the Supreme Court in  Patel  and
Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 serve to
re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article 8 of the ECHR  and,
in particular, to recognise that Article's limited utility in private  life
cases that are far removed from the protection of an individual's moral and
physical integrity.

34.   The respondent's decision places the appellant and her  partner  in  a
difficult position. Section 117  the  2002  Act  declares  that  immigration
control is in the public interest. The  respondent's  decision  is  made  to
preserve fair and effective  immigration  control.  The  appellant  and  her
partner will have  to  decide  where  their  future  lies.  The  appellant's
partner will have to decide if he is able to leave his home, & his work  and
follow the appellant to Rwanda, or if he will  wait  for  the  appellant  to
make an application for entry clearance from Rwanda.

35.   In F & ANR v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA
Civ 76 one of the arguments was that the principle in  Zambrano  applied  so
far as the Appellant's British citizen husband was concerned.  It  was  held
that Zambrano was not applicable to that case as the Claimant's husband  was
an adult British citizen who would be both entitled and able to  remain  and
to reside in the UK without  his  wife.   He  was  not  dependent  upon  the
Claimant:  Zambrano distinguished.  It was also said that if  that  Claimant
were to be removed, her husband might follow her to Pakistan if he chose  to
do so, but his rights in the UK and in the  EU  were  not  impaired  by  her
removal (paras 10 - 11)

36.   In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 in  relation  to  one  of
the appeals, (Richards LJ) the sponsor had arrived in the  UK  aged  7  from
Somalia; he became a British citizen in 2010. He and the  Appellant  entered
the marriage  knowing,  in  effect,  she  would  have  to  comply  with  the
Immigration Rules.  Richards LJ said that the fact that he  would  lose  his
job in the United Kingdom if he had to leave to enjoy family life  elsewhere
and hence would prefer to establish family life  here  does  not  constitute
compelling circumstances to require the grant of  Leave  to  remain  outside
the Rules: as the authorities make clear, Article 8 does not create a  right
for married couples to choose to live in a Contracting State.

37.   Immigration control is in the public interest. Both the  case-law  and
section 117B of the 2002 Act indicate that that  public  interest  outweighs
the interests of the appellant and her partner. I  therefore  have  to  find
that, in so far as I am able to consider  the  appellant's  article  8  ECHR
rights out-with the  immigration  rules,  the  respondent's  decision  is  a
proportionate interference with the appellant's article 8 rights.

Conclusion

38.   I therefore find that the Judge's decision is tainted  by  a  material
error of law. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  because
it contains a material error of law. I substitute the following decision.

Decision

I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

I dismiss the Appeal on Articles 8 ECHR grounds.
