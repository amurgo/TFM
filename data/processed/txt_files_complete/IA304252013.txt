 Decision on the Secretary of State's application to withdraw her appeal to
                             the Upper Tribunal


1.    On 17 April 2014, the Secretary of State  was  granted  permission  to
     appeal by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
     Chamber) Grant-Hutchison against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-
     tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) A W Khan who,  following
     a hearing on 28 February 2014,  allowed  the  appeal  of  Mr.  Bowalage
     (hereafter the Claimant), a national of Sri Lanka born on 18  September
     1981, against the decision of the Secretary of State of 8 July 2013  to
     refuse his application of 15 January 2013 for leave to remain as a Tier
     4 (General) Student Migrant under the Points-Based System.

2.    The Secretary of State refused the application  because  she  was  not
     satisfied that the Claimant satisfied the  maintenance  requirement  in
     Appendix C of the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules HC  395
     (as amended) (the Immigration Rules). This was because the Secretary of
     State considered that the financial documents provided by the  Claimant
     to demonstrate that he had the required funds (being  ï¿½1,600)  for  the
     required consecutive 28-day  period  were  issued  by  the  Swarnamahal
     Financial Services PLC, an organisation that was not  on  the  list  of
     acceptable financial institutions published at table 13 of  Appendix  P
     of the Immigration Rules.

3.    At the hearing before Judge Khan, Counsel for  the  Claimant  produced
     material which showed that HC 1039 introduced table 13 of Appendix P on
     14 March 2013 and that the transitional provisions  provided  that  any
     application made before 6 April 2013 would  be  decided  in  accordance
     with the Immigration Rules in force on 5 April 2013. The  Secretary  of
     State's representative concurred.

4.    On that  basis, Judge Khan held that it  was  not  necessary  for  the
     Claimant to demonstrate that the  required  funds  were  issued  by  an
     acceptable institution, as his application  was  made  before  6  April
     2013. He therefore found that the Secretary of  State  had  incorrectly
     applied table 13 of Appendix P of the amended Immigration Rules to  the
     Claimant's application. He allowed the appeal.

5.    Judge Grant-Hutchison granted permission on the ground  that  Appendix
     P setting out a list of named financial institutions existed  as  at  5
     April 2013 and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC was not  featured  on
     the list on that date. In doing so, Judge Grant-Hutchison  relied  upon
     the Secretary of State's grounds.

6.    It was established at the hearing before  us  that  the  Secretary  of
     State's grounds were incorrect and that table 13 was only inserted on 6
     April 2013 by HC 1039.

7.     Mr.  Walker  therefore  informed  us  that  he  was  withdrawing  the
     Secretary of State's appeal.

8.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
     provides for a party to withdraw its case before  the  Upper  Tribunal,
     with the consent of the Tribunal, but there is no provision for a party
     to withdraw the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

9.    Accordingly, the Secretary of State requires the consent of the  Upper
     Tribunal to withdraw  her  case.  For  the  reasons  given  above,  the
     Secretary of State's grounds were  incorrect.  We  therefore  give  our
     consent to the withdrawal of her case pursuant to rule 17(2).

10.   This means that Mr. Bowalage's  case  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
     unopposed. We are therefore satisfied that Judge A W Khan did not  make
     any error on a point of law. Accordingly, we dismiss the  Secretary  of
     State's appeal.
