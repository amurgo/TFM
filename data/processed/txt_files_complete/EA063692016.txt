                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT

    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

         Upon the determination  by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  J  Traynor
         promulgated on 11th April 2018 disclosing a material error  of  law
         and being set aside on 5th November 2018 by consent.

         And upon the Secretary of State being satisfied that the  appellant
         acquired a permanent right of residence under  Regulation  15(1)(f)
         of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  on
         30th August 2014: Ms Boutchich was demonstrably  exercising  Treaty
         rights throughout the 4 years 11 months of the  marriage  including
         at the date of initiation of divorce proceedings and Mr  Awode  met
         the  requirements  of  regulation  10(3)/(6)  by  way  of  his  own

    tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.   The  appeal  against  the
    decision giving rise to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    allowed.
