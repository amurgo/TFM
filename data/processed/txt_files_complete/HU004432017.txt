For the Appellant:     Mr Karnic (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Wedderspoon promulgated on the 2nd June 2017  in  which
      she refused the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  decision
      to refuse the Appellant  Leave  to  Enter  the  UK,  on  Human  Rights
      grounds.

   2. Judge Wedderspoon made an Anonymity Order in the case, given the  fact
      the Appellant is a minor, and  I  similarly  make  such  an  anonymity
      direction in respect of this decision.

   3. The Appellant is a citizen of Morocco who was born on the  [  ]  2015.
      Before the First-tier Tribunal, it was argued by  the  Appellant  that
      the Entry Clearance Officer had miscalculated the Appellant's benefits
      and that  there  were  adequate  funds  for  the  maintenance  of  the
      Appellant and that the decision was in  breach  of  his  Human  Rights
      under Article 8.

   4.  In  reaching  her  findings  at  [39],  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
      Wedderspoon found that although this was not  an  appeal  against  the
      refusal under the Immigration Rules, consideration  still  had  to  be
      given as to whether or not the Appellant met the requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules, which was a relevant consideration  in  respect  of
      his Article 8 claim.

   5. She found that the  Appellant's  Sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  modest
      benefits in terms of  Personal  Independence  Payment  and  Employment
      Support Allowance.  She stated that "The Respondent needs to  consider
      this amount and take account in this  regard  to  the  housing  costs.
      These need to be deducted from the benefit income.  The fact that  the
      housing costs do not directly reach  the  Appellant's  Sponsor's  bank
      account is irrelevant.  Housing costs are  a  part  of  daily  living.
      Therefore I find in meeting the requirements of  adequate  maintenance
      his net weekly income  after  housing  costs  have  been  deducted  is
      �185.35.  The Appellant's Sponsor's income is less than the  level  of
      income support that a UK resident family of equivalent size  would  be
      entitled  to".   On  that  basis  Judge  Wedderspoon  found  that  the
      provisions of the Immigration Rules were not met and  that  the  Rules
      reflected Parliament's view as to how, as a matter of  public  policy,
      the balance should be struck between the right to respect  for  family
      and private life and  the  maintenance  of  an  effective  immigration
      control and that in such circumstances, the decision did not amount to
      a breach of the Appellant's Human Rights under Article 8.

   6. The Appellant has now appealed against that decision for  the  reasons
      set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  That document is  a  matter  of
      record and as such will not be repeated in its entirety here,  but  in
      summary, it is argued that  the  Judge  wrongly  calculated  that  the
      Sponsor's income was only �185.35 and that the Judge had not  included
      the Sponsor's Housing Benefit, which was paid directly to the landlord
      in calculating the Sponsor's income.  It is argued that  the  accurate
      calculation  of  the  Sponsor's  income  from  Personal   Independence
      Payment, Employment  Support  Allowance  and  Housing  Benefit  totals
      �352.20, and that when the housing costs of �83.85 were deducted,  the
      Sponsor's income was in fact �268.35, being a  sum  greater  than  the
      �199.20 income support level for a couple over 18 plus 1 child.

   7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer
      on the 31st October 2017.

   8. Within the Rule  24  Reply,  at  that  stage  it  was  said  that  the
      Respondent had not had full sight of the Appellant's  bundle  and  the
      evidence which the Appellant sought to rely upon and therefore at that
      time the Second tier State was therefore unable to  comment  upon  the
      Grounds of Appeal in any great detail.

   9. However, by the date of the appeal hearing before me, Mr  McVeety  had
      then received the Appellant's  bundle  and  conceded  that  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Wedderspoon had failed to take account  of  the  amount
      that the Sponsor received in Housing Benefit, when taking  account  of
      the Sponsor's income and that even though  such  Housing  Benefit  was
      paid directly to the landlord by the Benefits Agency on behalf of  the
      Sponsor, it was still part of his  income  for  the  purposes  of  the
      calculation.  Mr McVeety conceded that  there  was  no  doubt  that  a
      material error had been made, and further conceded that  as  that  was
      the only issue in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, not
      only should the appeal be allowed, but the decision should  be  remade
      by me allowing the Appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds, the  Rules
      having in fact been met and there being no evidence of criminality  on
      the part of the Appellant, who is a very young child, seeking to  join
      his parents in the UK.

  10. In light of that concession, I do find that the decision of First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Wedderspoon does contain a material error  of  law,  in
      that she has failed to take account of  the  level  of  the  Sponsor's
      Housing Benefit, in calculating the level of his income, and  that  as
      quite properly conceded by Mr McVeety in compliance with his  duty  to
      the court, even in circumstances where the  Housing  Benefit  is  paid
      directly to the landlord, that is still the  Sponsor's  benefit,  that
      has to be taken into account in calculating his income. The  Sponsor's
      income  from  Personal  Independence   Payment,   Employment   Support
      Allowance and Housing Benefit totals �352.20,  and  when  the  housing
      costs of �83.85  are  deducted,  the  Sponsor's  income  was  in  fact
      �268.35, being a sum greater than the �199.20 income support level for
      a couple over 18 plus 1 child In circumstances he did in fact have  an
      income in excess of the income support  level  for  a  couple  plus  1
      child,  and  therefore  I  do  find  that  the  requirements  of   the
      Immigration Rules are met, which  as  conceded  by  Mr  McVeety  is  a
      relevant consideration when considering the Article 8 case.

  11. Bearing in mind the provisions of Section 117A-D of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act and the fact that  the  maintenance  of  an
      effective immigration control is in the public interests, and that  it
      is in the public interests that people who seek to enter  the  UK  are
      able to speak English and are financially  independent,  and  clearly,
      given his young age, presently just two years old,  the  Appellant  is
      not financially independent or able  to  speak  English.  However,  in
      circumstances where the requirements of the Rules our met and there is
      no evidence of criminality on his part or on the part of the  Sponsor,
      and in circumstances where the Respondent  concedes  that  the  appeal
      should be allowed on Article 8 grounds, I do find  that  the  decision
      made by the Respondent originally is  in  breach  of  the  Appellant's
      human  rights  under  Article  8  and   the   decision   reached   was
      disproportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved in
      the circumstances of this case.

  12. I therefore set  aside  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Wedderspoon, and remake the decision, allow the Appellant's appeal  on
      Human Rights grounds under Article 8.



Notice of Decision

The decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wedderspoon  does  contain  a
material error of law and is set aside in its entirety;

I remake the decision  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  Human  Rights
grounds under Article 8;

Given that the Appellant in this case is a young child just over 2 years  of
age, who is currently separated from both of his parents, both parties  have
asked me to include a request to the Respondent, when considering the  Leave
to be granted to the Appellant, undertake  such  consideration  as  soon  as
possible following my decision;

Given that the Appellant is a minor, I do make an anonymity  order  in  this
case. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008, unless and until a Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, the  Appellant
is granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
