Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Xiaomei Zhang, date of birth 6.2.76,  and  Jinmin  Shi,
    date of birth 5.11.96, are citizens of China.

 2. This is their appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Ghaffer promulgated 21.6.15, dismissing their  linked  appeals  against
    the decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer, dated 8.8.14,  to  refuse
    their applications for entry  clearance  respectively  as  partner  and
    child of the sponsor in the UK.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 2.6.15.

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted permission to appeal on 1.4.16.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 26.1.17 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. For the reasons summarised below I find no material error in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Ghaffar to be set aside.

 7. The sponsor,  who  has  had  ILR  since  September  2011,  and  is  now
    naturalised as a British citizen, left his family in China in 2000  and
    came to the UK. He had chosen to maintain indirect  contact  with  them
    and remain in the UK. In the Entry  Clearance  Manager  review  it  was
    noted that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  or  evidence  of
    insurmountable  obstacles  which  would  prevent   the   sponsor   from
    continuing family life with his wife and child in China.

 8. Although he claims to have fled  China  on  account  of  his  religious
    beliefs, he has not been granted refugee status in the UK. In fact,  he
    had returned to visit his family in China  between  November  2012  and
    February 2013. He made no application to bring his wife  and  child  to
    the UK until April 2014.

 9. It was not argued that it was impossible for the sponsor to  return  to
    China, only that he as he had lived in the UK for 15 years and is now a
    British citizen, he feels that he had adapted to life  in  the  UK  and
    would struggle to relocate to China, and would  have  to  give  up  his
    business in the UK. He also has distant relatives in  the  UK  and  his
    sister is trying to establish her immigration status in the UK.

10. It had been conceded in the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellants
    could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules,  specifically
    the minimum income maintenance requirement of ï¿½22,400.  The  appellants
    were driven to rely on article 8  ECHR,  the  appellants  pleading  for
    entry clearance on compassionate grounds, given their long separation.

11. Judge Ghaffar found on the facts of this case that there were "no  good
    reasons" to consider the matter  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  and
    stating that there is "no exceptionality" in the case,  or  significant
    obstacles to the sponsor integrating to life in China.

12. The judge concluded at [17] of the  decision  that  although  there  is
    family life between the appellants and the sponsor, article  8  is  not
    engaged. By choice, family life has been conducted indirectly for  many
    years. The judge observed that article 8 does not provide  a  right  to
    choose where family life is to be exercised. The judge then found  that
    the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  did  not  interfere  with
    family life and thus dismissed the appeal.

13. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Gill found it arguable that the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was in error in stating that  article  8  was
    not engaged. "In addition,  I  am  just  about  persuaded  that  it  is
    arguable that the judge did  not  engage  with  the  article  8  claims
    adequately."

14. The Rule 24 reply, dated 18.4.16 points out that the judge  found  that
    the sponsor no longer had a fear of persecution on return to China  and
    that there were no significant obstacles to his integration, so that he
    could not succeed under paragraph 276ADE in  respect  of  private  life
    within the article 8 regime established by the Immigration  Rules.  "It
    is very difficult to see how the appellant(s) could  possibly  hope  to
    succeed in respect of article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules. It is
    submitted that the judge did not materially err in law."

15. That the governing test is compelling circumstances has  been  recently
    confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Rhuppiah [2016]  EWCA  Civ  803.  A
    decision  to  subject  any  appeal   to   the   test   of   'compelling
    circumstances' proceeds, logically, on the basis that the first four of
    the five Razgar stages have all been overcome. I am prepared to  accept
    in this regard that  the  decision  interferes  with  the  family  life
    between the appellant and the sponsor, even though the evidence adduced
    is entirely inadequate.


16. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  muddled  the  terminology,
    referring  to  exceptional   circumstances   rather   than   compelling
    circumstances. Having found family life, the judge was  also  incorrect
    to suggest that article 8 is not engaged or that the decision  did  not
    interfere with that family life. I also accept  that  at  the  date  of
    application and refusal, the second appellant was still a minor, though
    only by a few months. However, I am not  satisfied  that  these  errors
    were material to the outcome of the appeal.


17. On the evidence in this  case,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal could not have found any sufficiently compelling circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules  so  as  to  justify
    consideration of allowing the appellants to enter the  UK  outside  the
    Rules on article 8 ECHR  grounds,  on  the  basis  that  otherwise  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer would be  unjustifiably  harsh.
    Whilst the  facts  as  alleged  engender  a  degree  of  sympathy,  the
    application and the appeal falls manifestly  short  of  overcoming  the
    exacting  threshold  of  compelling  circumstances.   There   were   no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in China and no very
    significant obstacles to the sponsor's integration in China and as  the
    judge pointed out, article 8 does not provide a right to  choose  where
    family life will be exercised. The article 8 regime established  within
    the Immigration Rules provide for entry clearance in the  circumstances
    of these appellants and the sponsor, which reflects the public interest
    balance by requiring proof of the ability to maintain  by  the  minimum
    income  threshold,  which  the  sponsor  did  not  meet.  Frankly,  the
    application was doomed to failure from the outset and  the  appeal  was
    correctly dismissed. The judge may have used incorrect terminology, but
    the errors were not material.


18. Even if the judge had gone on to  conduct  an  article  8  ECHR  Razgar
    stepped proportionality assessment outside the Rules,  I  am  satisfied
    that the Tribunal would have had to conclude for the  same  reasons  as
    given above, that the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    entirely proportionate and not disproportionate to the  rights  of  the
    appellants and the sponsor. Rules are  in  place  to  facilitate  entry
    clearance, but the appellants failed to meet those Rules.


Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
